"AITA for Asking My Ex (F 24) to Block Me on Spotify? (M 22) My ex (F 24) and I (M 22) had an on-off relationship for the last three years. Currently, I find myself unable to resist checking her Spotify, the only social media platform I can still view. It's the only connection I have left, and it's hindering my ability to move on. Recently, I noticed she's creating playlists that seem like messages to someone new. Feeling overwhelmed, I asked her to block me on Spotify, but she ignored me. AITA for making this request? Looking for your insights on whether I handled the situation appropriately. Keep in mind that blocking someone on Spotify only stops them from seeing YOUR profile, not the other way around.  
  
TLDR: AITA for requesting my ex (F 24) to block me on Spotify? Feeling unsure about the decision.",0.6
"AITA for asking my wife not to contribute to a conversation Bit of background story. A friend has been asking me to write his CV together. For a while. And I kept postponing this because it never really met my priority list (also, I wanted him to take a bit more responsibility) Anyways, he decided to apply to my wife's company, asked for a reference from my wife and once that was settled my wife pretty much said *""you gotta help him with this CV thing, he's been waiting for your help""* So on a Friday afternoon I sent a template and said just *""fill this with your experience and we'll review it tomorrow.""*

Slight important point here - I'm not talking about a super easy, 2 minute to prep, fully text, times new roman CV, there's a reason why he was seeking my help, I put a lot of effort into these and they'd look really nice at the end. So sometimes it takes up to 2 hours to fine-tune something. I've also written and reviewed countless CVs; so have an eye for detail.

Fast-forward to Saturday midday, we're having a call with my friend, who apparently did no work at all on the template, which leaves me a bit frustrated. My wife at this stage is really pushing me to do this, so honestly; I'm doing it for her pretty much.

Now we start working on this, she's dropping in and out of the room every once in a while. At some stage (about 1hr in) - a particular thing is being discussed, whether it's valuable to add or not; and I'm trying to make a strong point, *""no it's not needed"" -* and honestly just be done with this thing. You can probably figure out from the writing that I was already getting frustrated; because I'm a weird situation.

* The friend who was supposed to spend some time updating the template did nothing, so we're writing stuff from scratch
* My wife practically asked me 15 times to help him out with this
* It's Saturday and I really don't wanna spend my time doing this. I just wanna be done.

She comes to the room - and says something like *""you wanna know what I think?"" -* to which I respond *""honey we really don't need another opinion, this is how it should be"".* She then insists on giving her opinion and says something that's not really relevant. 

There's silence. I again said *""thanks but we're OK - I'm just trying to get this finished, so it's really OK, just let me do it the way I know it"".* She asks my friend what he thinks of the whole thing, and my friend replies *""well he'd know this better, so I'll go with whatever he's saying"".*

So now, my wife is furious (and I really can't understand why). She said that I treated her in a disrespectful way; I've told her that if anything, she came in and gave unsolicited advice. 

She's also super offended by my friend's comment on *""he'd know this better"" -* saying that he was applying to her company, and he didn't even consider her opinion. I told her that that's fine, because the reason why he reached out to me was that I knew how to write a CV better anyways (and I've written my wife's CV as well)

She's incredibly pissed off about this and not letting it go.",0.75
"AITA for getting the mean girl and her boyfriend fired?  The mean girl (who we'll call Emily) and her boyfriend (who we'll call Kayden) both work at a local fast food restaurant, like this place is a bike ride away from my home. 

  
Emily thought that my friend wanted to be with her boyfriend because they ALMOST had something in the past, which frankly is a big stretch. The boyfriend only saw them as a friend though. Emily was just constantly disrespectful and making empty threats towards my friend. Over time the more it went on the more it angered me. Emily once used past traumas against my friend just to throw it in their face.  


 Then I remembered how Emily would brag about having the tango with Kayden in the backroom of the establishment. I brought up how it was gross and frankly unsanitary that it was happening and she was BRAGGING about it. So I brought up reporting it to my friends. They thought it was a good idea because if there's anything true about it, it's gross and SHOULDN'T happen. Some even joked  about how they could possibly ""contaminate"" the food. (Gross to actually think about) So i wrote a report and went over it and submitted it. 

  
It was in the back of my mind all day and not too long ago my friend had caught wind that they were BOTH FIRED not even 12 hours after the complaint. I can't say I necessarily feel bad, but it has been on my mind. AITA? ",0.06
"AITA for being annoyed that I'm paying for everything? For the last few months, I have been spending a lot of time staying with a close friend so that I can receive a medical treatment not offered in my city. For context, I live 1 hour away and am not allowed to drive for 24 hours after my treatment. My treatment is 2x per week, so I stay at this friend's apartment about 4 days per week. 

I am extremely fortunate to have a place to stay, because otherwise my options would be 1. staying in a hotel/airBnB or 2. not getting treatment. I am not paying rent/contributing to my friend's mortgage, and I pay 100% of my rent at my own place in the other city. 

However, I find that when we are together I am paying for almost everything else. I do make significantly more money than my friend (we are both on disability currently but get different amounts each month), but I still dip into my savings each month to cover living and treatment costs. 

I'm finding myself getting irritated that I'm paying for everything. Groceries, coffees out, gas (she is allowed to use my car whenever I am at her place), toiletries, even sometimes things like kibble and litter for her cats. At first I didn't mind, but now as I watch the numbers in my savings account dropping each month, it is starting to bother me. 

I'd also like to add that when she stays at my place, as she does on occasion, I am still the one paying for everything. 

I might be the AH because I'm angry about paying for stuff when I get a free place to stay during my medical treatments. But my friend has to pay her mortgage regardless of whether I'm there or not, and I still have to pay my own rent. 

So AITA for being irritated that I'm paying for everything?

(and no I have not discussed any of this with the friend yet because I am super non-confrontational and a coward when it comes to money stuff). ",0.56
"WIBTA if I gave my brother's girlfriend fake cremains? TW- adult dating a minor (nothing sexual)

My brother (24) overdosed directly after his girlfriend (18) who he'd been dates for 4 years broke up with him. She was 14 and he was 20 when they met online. He moved far away and lived on the street as a homeless person just so he could be near her. From what I understand her parents fully accepted and allowed this. Obviously this was a super messed up relationship and situation.

I have a lot of empathy for this girl who everyone seems to be failing. She is hurting a lot and asked for some of my brothers ashes to remember him by. He didn't want his ashes to be split up and he didn't like the idea of someone holding onto ashes forever either. And honestly it very very much bothers me to think of him staying in this incredibly wrong and messed up relationship for eternity. I feel like she's going to realize how messed up this was at some point and grow to look at him much differently as she gets older.

That being said I do feel for this girl and I think it would help her get closure and bring her comfort in the short term to have some of his ashes to hold on to. If I gave her fake ashes, she wouldn't know the difference and she would have that comfort and closure. And my brother would not be stuck in that relationship forever and his ashes can all be spread in one place. In my head I feel like this is a win win. But in my heart it also sort of feels wrong.

"AITA for not giving my shift to a pregnant person? For context I have worked at the same veterinary clinic since 2019 and my off days are Tuesdays, and then on Fridays I’m a “half day” which basically means I am off by 2 PM. Everyone at my job has certain days/hours that they are not available and my manager always seems to make it work for them as far as scheduling. My partner works the night shift and is off Thursdays/Fridays, hence I hardly see him. We would do laundry, grocery shop, deep clean and try to set up any appointments on Fridays after work. Because he is a man, he will not do any of this unless I’m there to help/supervise. I never talked to my manager about having Thursday nor Friday off because I knew it would be impossible due to everyone else’s availability, besides I was happy with my half day on Fridays. Now the manager has someone else doing the schedule and without consulting with me first, took away my half day on Fridays to give to someone else. Mind you, the person who made the schedule was adamant about having Wednesdays off because her ex partner also had that day off, hence I thought she would be understanding. Now this same person stated that I am having to give up my half days because another coworker that is pregnant wants to have it. The pregnant coworker is very tired and painful by the end of the week that she wants to have an early weekend. There is another coworker there that is off on Fridays and her schedule is set in stone because everyone is too afraid of her to change it. So they won’t ask that coworker to give up her off days but they’ll gladly take away my half day. I have seen MANY coworkers get pregnant over the years and have never once seen someone have to change their schedule to accommodate someone that’s pregnant. I tried to explain that I too have a life outside of work but everyone is making it seem like I HAVE TO take one for the team and deal with it for a few months or so, putting me in a tough spot. I have now changed my availability on the schedule and told my manager that I need either Thursday off, Friday off or to keep my half days the way they have been for years now. Am I the asshole for not giving my shift to a pregnant person? Respectfully, I just don’t feel like I had any say in this person getting pregnant, so why should my life and schedule change?",0.02
"AITA for jokingly calling my mom stupid? So I (19) had my mom (50) hold onto my ring for me, it was my grandmas so it was pretty valuable to me. I had been cooking the day before and didn't want to get some raw meat or just food in general stuck onto the ring while I cook so I gave it to her for safekeeping.

 The next day (she still has the ring) we're sitting on the couch. I was going to ask her for it back earlier in the day but never got around to asking and she says ""Where's grandmas ring???"" and i say ""I thought I told you to hold onto it for me yesterday?!"" she goes on to say in a serious tone (but i knew she was joking as she usually does) ""No you didn't? I don't have it, I gave it back to you."" She then smiles and pulls out the ring, while handing it to me I laugh and smile saying ""That's so stupid"" she then gets upset with me saying ""What? Wow you never call me stupid. That's the first time I ever heard you call me that."" I was a little taken aback by her statement because I actually have made that same remark before when she jokes around with me. She then leaves to go upstairs and has a cold demeanor, giving me the silent treatment and mumbling around the house saying ""All my kids are the same, no one cares about me.""

"AITA for Getting Upset that My Significant Other Calculated My Purchases and Presented the Running Total? My spouse and I share an AppleID. We’ve done this for close to two decades and did this initially in the “old days” of Apple where it was common practice. He’s had an AppleID since he was a teen, so I’m on his. However, it is my credit card that is used to make purchases. This means anything I purchase on my phone with my credit card still results in an email receipt that gets sent to him. We do each keep our own personal checking accounts and then have one joint account to pay for shared expenses that we put money into (eg household bills.) We wanted to avoid getting upset with one another for personal purchases, so by keeping separate personal checking accounts we don’t know what the other person is spending with their own money.  
  
Recently I got into one of my micro-transaction games hardcore and made a lot of successive purchases over the past month. However, the money spent has been entirely coming out of my personal account, so I know exactly what I have been spending. But he has been getting the receipts for my purchases because of the shared AppleID. He decided that before asking me about the increased uptick of purchases (which he is not paying for) he collected and wrote down every single purchase and calculated it. He even took the step of not including any line items like AppleCare. He then brought the list with the running total to me “out of concern.” 

We got into an argument as I felt like my privacy had been invaded; even though he happens to get the receipts taking the extra step to go through the emails, collate, separate, and calculate the total before ever talking to me about it felt like a check-up to me. He argued it was a ‘check-in’ and not a ‘check-up’. I told him if it had just been a check-in a simple “I noticed I’ve been getting a lot of receipts, just wanted to make sure everything was okay and that they were valid purchases.” But taking the step to collect all that data and calculate the total to present to me felt like a check-up and I told him so.   


His argument was that as my partner he was allowed to do this if he had a concern. I tried to point out if it was not for the receipts he would have never known I made the purchases since it pulled entirely from my account, so it felt like he was taking advantage of the access he had. We went back and forth (his arguments included that he was concerned I was being taken advantage of, that he was getting the receipts sent to him and it was a lot of money, etc) But as I am a middle-aged adult and I am spending my own money I did not feel it was his place to do what he did. It also felt like he was a parent checking up on their kid for actions they didn’t agree with.   


AITA for arguing that he was checking up on me and he should have minded his own business when I only spent my own money? Or AITA for being wrong that this was a case of checking-in rather than checking-up?

"AITA for playing with my ex's dog? So I went to my ex's house the other day so he could spend time with his kids (this is just something I do every once in a while to check in on him and make sure things are safe in the house for the kids but I don't go often because he has a really short temper and I don't want to be his punching bag).  When we got there older daughter (od) and I stayed in the car for a minute so I could help her with something while my younger daughter (yd) went inside.  When my od and I went inside ex was spazing out yelling that his roommate was sleeping and we needed to be quiet.  He also said that we could not play ball with the dogs (fair, dogs can be loud when they play fetch by barking and tripping over their feet and such).  So I go sit on the couch and the dog comes over and puts a stick in my lap, I give her a pet and throw the stick behind me on the couch to which she immediately grabs it and puts it back on my lap.  So I start play fighting with her a bit to distract her and put the stick at her feet to make room for yd to sit on my lap which she again immediately retrieves it and places it on my lap.  At this point my ex comes in screaming (yes screaming) that his friend is sleeping and that he told us we weren't allowed to play with the dog and then goes on for over 5 minutes about how he shouldn't have to repeat himself and how I'm acting like child for wanting to play with roommates dog (also I should mention that since all of this happened in a small area on a couch, the dog was neither running around chasing things nor barking/making loud noises).  I asked if he wanted us to leave and he responded by going on another rant about how we don't listen it respect him.  He then leaves and plays some video games with the kids while I stay in the living room and play on my phone.  He comes out later trying to make some small talk that falls flat so I start by asking that next time we come over when someone is sleeping that he give me a heads up so I can talk to the kids ahead of time so that they aren't running in the house like standing caddle (totaling doable as he called me about half hour before we got there to ask how long till we arrive).  He went on to tell me that that was ridiculous as we should just listen to him when he tells us to do things.  To which I tried explaining to him that spastically yell be quiet when half of us aren't even in the house yet does not fix the problem but was interrupted every time before I could even get two words out.  He then followed up with ""fine stay in here and mope then"" to which I told him that I wasn't mopping I was just avoiding him and he stormed out.  I started out with just rolling my eyes at his behavior as him being upset over something as silly as giving a dog a stick but now I'm second guessing myself.  So reddit am I the ah?",0.79
"AITA for planning a birthday party? Throwaway account. I feel like I’m losing my mind over this so I need an outside perspective. I (F29) am planning a 30th birthday party. It’s important to note that I haven’t had a birthday party since my 16th, so none of my current friends have been to a party of mine.

My friend Sam, who I’ve known for about 6 years, is someone I consider one of my closest friends. The first conflict occurred after I had sent the invites, and Sam asked if they could bring their partner, Alex. I didn’t intend to invite partners, as I have a small space and wanted to invite the people on my guest list (all who know each other), and my own partner will barely be involved. Sam thought that didn’t apply to Alex, as they have been together for years and I’ve interacted with Alex during many group hangouts. I replied saying I am just simply not very close to Alex among all my other reasons, and it was not intended to be a personal slight to them. Sam then said that if Alex couldn’t come, then they wouldn’t be able to come. Of course, I wanted Sam to be at my party, so I changed my mind and said that I would invite Alex.

The second conflict happened recently, when Sam informed me that they told Jaden (acquaintance) about my party, not realizing that Jaden had not been invited. Sam asked me why I didn’t invite Jaden, if it was an accident, if something had happened between us, etc. I explained that I simply am not very close to Jaden despite hanging out in group settings a few times before, and it has only ever been polite small talk. I genuinely think that this is a mutual feeling with Jaden, as we don’t know anything about each other, and the only reason we interact is because we get invited to the same events.

Sam then began to ask me about the other people that were coming to my party, if I was close to them and if I have hung out with them before. I responded saying I talk to these people often and I accept their opinion but this was my party. Sam kept saying that my reasoning was weird and didn’t make sense, to which I eventually responded that I’m sorry but I didn’t want to have to justify who I did/didn’t invite to my party.

I did not expect this to completely backfire. Sam told me that I invented the idea that they made me justify anything, that I did something stupid, and that it was my responsibility to inform them that Jaden hadn’t been invited, so it’s my fault that they told Jaden about my party. They told me that I first F’d up with not inviting Alex, but they were able to let that slide and move past it, but this was something they can’t accept.

I really don’t know if I handled it wrong here. It doesn’t seem like Sam feels even slightly remorseful so I’m questioning if I might be TA, as maybe I should have just invited Alex and Jaden in the first place. My partner is on my side, but I want the opinion from someone who doesn’t know or care for me.

"WIBTA if I report my professor for her grading system? I(18f) am in college. I am a part of a program that allows high schoolers to work towards their diplomas and AAs at the same time. Most students are 16 or 17 (important for later).

My English 101 professor, K, is a bit intense with her methods. She set up a grading contract system where students were expected to read through a list of expectations for each passing grade (seperate expectations for As, Bs, and Cs). Then you have to select the grade you are going for and sign your name. She did not tell us why we had to do this until the deadline passed and then she gave the reason. She said (to put it simply) that you are expected to do the required work for the grade and if you don't meet all the expectations for that grade, you fail (no chances for Bs or Cs if you got an A for example). 

I'm pretty sure this system is against college policy in addition to the pressure this has put on students (myself included). I want to report her for this. But some students insisted the work was doable. I feel like maybe K is within her right to do grading this way and it's just my stupid mental disability making it this hard.

"AITA for not having a friend be a bridesmaid even though I was one at her wedding? I don't consent to this being shared on Tiktok or Youtube or other sites.

I've been friends with Alyssa since grade school. Alyssa got married and I was a bridesmaid for her wedding and planned her bachelorette party and all that. After her wedding, Alyssa's life became much more centered around her husband. It culminated in us being less close - for example, she had a baby and I didn't even find out until after her delivery. It just didn't feel right anymore to share my innermost thoughts, goals and plans when she didn't tell me about something as major as a pregnancy so I definitely became a little more private. I still tried to be nice, and mailed her a gift for the baby, and listened to her loads about baby and family life. She was also understandably busier as a new mother so we didn't spend as much time together.

Alyssa's baby is now over a year old and I still haven't met him. I saw Alyssa for one party for a mutual friend but we haven't made plans for the two of us (or three with the baby, or five with our partners) since the pregnancy. I let her know early on I'd love to meet her baby but I would leave the ball in her court since she was pretty overwhelmed with extended family visitors back then. Alyssa never took me up on that and I didn't invite myself over again. I became closer with other friends who I started to spend more time with who were in a similar stage of life to me. It was honestly never anything malicious but my friendship with Alyssa became more text-based and superficial. 

I just got engaged last week :) And I really wanted to get married this summer so I got to planning really quickly and already have my bridesmaids picked out. It's a small wedding and I wavered on whether I even want a bridal party but ultimately I decided to go for it to have some of the fun experiences of a bachelorette party and getting ready together. I didn't invite Alyssa to be a bridesmaid.

One of the girls posted a picture of my bridesmaid gifts on Instagram so Alyssa messaged me asking about when she would get hers and I just said it was a small bridal party but I was so excited to see her at the wedding as a guest. She got mad that I was a bridesmaid at her wedding and that I excluded her while including a friend that I met through her..  But her wedding was almost 5 years ago and I've known that friend for over a decade so I don't really think this matters? She is upset that I'm treating her different cause she had a baby....

"AITA for leaving my sister's anniversary party early My sister is one of those people who feels like everyone has an ulterior motive against her and that everyone is out to get her. When this side of her flares up, it's not fun.

Last Saturday was her and her husband's 20th anniversary and they had a party at their place. My sister gets a few drinks in her and decides it's a good time to tell me that she was not happy about what happened at her daughter(17F)'s doctor's appointment earlier that week.

Long story short, my niece weighs 233 pounds, the doctor brought up the health risks, my sister got mad about the doctor making her daughter feel bad.

I made the case that rather than be mad at a doctor for bringing up risks, maybe she could use that energy toward making lifestyle changes and helping her daughter. She rolled her eyes, sarcastically said I couldn't be serious. I said I was. She called me crazy, so I left the party. She called me that night to tell me I'd ruined her anniversary for her.

"AITA for not sending my partner a video of our child for him to send to his estranged brother My child recently started reading. I posted a short video of her progress on my private Facebook for friends and family. This evening after my partner went to see his brother, he asked me to text him the video so he could share it with his brother and wife. I declined and my partner was upset about it.

For some backstory, I haven't spoken to these in laws for almost 6 months. They've always been problematic, but I only stopped speaking to them after his wife screamed profanities at me and threatened to put her hands on me in front of my child. Following that both his brother and his wife tried to say that I was a cheater, a bad mother and I was trying to separate my partner from his family. None of which are true. My partner's brother also threatened to shoot him if he ever came to their home again. 

Of course after this wild turn of events I wanted absolutely nothing to do with them. I no longer felt comfortable having their presence in my child's life and I made this clear to my partner. 

Now his brother is supposedly a few months sober and my partner has begun visiting him again. I reiterated the fact that I still didn't want either one of them around my child and he agreed. I can see the boundaries may be starting to slip.

"AITA for wanting my wife to confront her longtime friend over how her friend treated me? My (25F) wife (27F) and I recently went through a little bit of a difficult time in our relationship. My wife told me that she had kept a secret from me about something that happened with another woman about a year into our relationship.

I love my wife more than anything in the world. We grew up together as troubled teenagers and helped each other become way more healthy, lived together since the day we started dating, and have been each others’ greatest supporters always.

Anyhow. she recently informed me of this, saying that she kept it a secret for years, because she was so afraid of how I react. Obviously, I was hurt, but we have been working through it, and I would never ever throw away an amazing relationship over a mistake.

my wife confided in a mutual friend of ours, who we have both known for years, but she has known for much longer than I and has a deeper relationship with her than I do. Essentially, she was just stating how bad she felt about what she had done and looking for advice/ comfort which I totally understand and don't fault her for. however, her friend decided to comfort my wife by telling her that I essentially deserved what she did due to me ""lying"" about being very depressed during a particularly bad spell of mental health for me within the past year (my wife was gone on a trip and I was depressed and didn't want to stress her out, so coped unhealthily with substances, but did stay safe until she got back). She said that lying about this was just as bad as what my wife did to me and that my wife shouldn't feel that bad about it and that ""we are now even"".

I texted the friend and told her that this really hurt my feelings and felt totally unnecessary for her to attack me in order to comfort my wife and that it seemed like she didn’t care about me at all. She texted me back and said that my wife was her ""primary friend"" and basically that's where her loyalty is and that she didn't think that we could really be good friends. She then proceeded to immediately block me both over text and on social media. I noticed that my wife wasn't really saying anything about the situation so l asked how she felt and if she felt that her friend was unkind to me and she agreed, but didn't really elaborate. my wife has been friends with this person since before she knew me and I know the relationship is very important to her, so I do not want to ask her to end the relationship, obviously, but I still feel very hurt. I have been trying to work through my feelings about it, and still find myself feeling very sad and lonely, and even a little betrayed.

"AITA (35M) for asking my girlfriend (36F), a former Hooters girl who met a 70s-aged man there and received expensive gifts from him, to remove his photos from her house and social media? I've been in a relationship with this girl for about 7 months. There's a lot to like about her. She's sweet, beautiful, caring, and seems trustworthy and loyal. We're super attracted to each other and the sex is great. I've never felt this way about any girl I've dated. I think she might be 'the one', but I've got some serious concerns.

After our fourth or fifth date, I learned she worked at Hooters in her 20s. I thought ""no big deal"", and even joked about her putting the uniform back on for me, lol. She's moved on from that, now with a very respectable and successful job.

But then, I spotted these pictures of an old man in his 70s at her place, and more on her Facebook. This guy was a regular at Hooters when she worked there. She told me straight up that he was her friend, who would buy her and her Hooters friends tickets to expensive events in my hometown, each ticket worth thousands. At first, I didn't think much of it, but then I learned about more gifts - a $2k designer purse, a MacBook, a Vegas trip for her and friends. He even let her and other Hooters girls live with him. I can almost guarantee his tips were way over the top.

She insists there was nothing to it, that he was just a kind, funny, generous guy who liked hanging out with young people. He passed away a few years ago, so it's a touchy subject. I have to tiptoe around it, and she gets upset when I bring it up. She's told me never to bring it up again. But it doesn't change the fact that I think he's a creep, at the very least. Even if there wasn't anything sexual, how can she not see that this is odd for me, or anyone else she dates? She tells me her other boyfriends didn't have an issue with it. I've responded, ""I'm not them, and they must have been bitches,"" lol. I wouldn't be okay with another man, any age, buying my girlfriend expensive gifts.

I've confronted her about it at least twice, even asking her to take down the pictures in her house and on social media since moving in with her. I feel like this would make me feel much better. My concern isn't just for me, but for her too. I'm worried that as we get closer, and friends and family notice these pictures, questions will pop up. I have no clue how to explain this ""friend"". She seems naive, thinking no one will ask or judge. She believes she can just say he's her friend and everyone will be like ""oh, okay,"" and move on. I've noticed her naivety about other things too. I also have questions about how this might affect her expectations in a relationship.

On top of all this, she asked me early on to take down pictures of my ex on Instagram. To be fair, most were with her, so I obliged. I think it's normal to have pictures of your ex, but it's not normal to have pictures with a friend who's 50 years older, who buys you designer purses and lets you live rent-free, lol. Am I the asshole for wanting her to take down these pictures? Would I be an asshole if this became a dealbreaker in an otherwise great relationship?",0.91
"AITA i am an introvert(like kinda extreme) and my parents(just one rlly) think it’s their place to feel stress over my not socializing; I resent this btw. “‘Oh woe is her for not seeing people, for being alone, woe is secretly me as it is my problem, but wait I say, tis her issue.’ ‘But, how’ i ask, ‘how should I act? Fake and in pain, with others when I crave alone. Woe is you for I don’t break myself apart for YOUR PIECE OF MIND’ I add. End this dumb act, say all the shit straight to my face; I’ll take it, this hurts more. ‘She acts awkward, i don’t know how to understand her, she speaks unsocially.’ Why, why say this when you don’t see my face looking back at you; you hide behind anonymity and comfort of yes-men, giving you strength and confirmation of your opinions, one’s you never take up with the one who is ‘broken’, ‘odd’, ‘different’, ‘societally wrong’, the one who really matters: me.”

"AITA for destroying my sons PlayStation 4? Recently, I (47F) have been browsing YouTube and came across numerous prank videos featuring people dropping gaming systems into places like the trash or their backyard pool only to reveal a new gaming system. These videos caught my interest because my son (17M) was experiencing issues with his PlayStation 4. 

He mentioned that his games were lagging, indicating a performance issue expected from an aging console. He always complained about the noise, comparing it to a plane takeoff, and expressed a desire to upgrade to a PlayStation 5 or an Xbox Series X.

In an attempt to bond with him, I devised a plan to buy him a PlayStation 5 and ceremoniously destroy the PlayStation 4. 

I executed the plan by fabricating a story about a poor math test grade, using it as a pretext to take away his console. 

 I unplugged the console while he was playing a game I bought him called Dark Souls and he got frustrated. I concocted another false claim about destroying it due to his noise, despite his pleas to stop.

 I proceeded to throw it on the ground and throw it away, causing him to cry over the loss of his PlayStation 4 like in the videos. 

When I presented him with the PlayStation 5, expecting excitement for the upgrade, I was instead met with slurs and curses. He expressed frustration over the loss of his data and has since locked himself in his room, only allowing my husband in.

I researched data saving methods that suggest compatibility across gaming systems. So I understand the initial shock of the system being destroyed, but if he has a new one, I'm not sure if him being so distraught is justified.

"AITA my asking partner who has a emotional exhausting job to work the weekends so I don’t have to work 7 days a week Money is tight Christmas didn’t help, and being a rideshare & food delivery means the hours I put in are not always equal to the pay I bring home.  My partner has a job from Monday to Friday. They enjoy it but it has been exhausting for them so I try to give them the space and time to recover and relax. 

I have been working 7 days a week (unless one of my kids get sick and then I am dealing with that) and this has been going on for months of working everyday.  And it has been taking a toll.  I would wake up most morning and see the bank account in the negative and have to spend the day trying to make enough before the bank close and we get hit with a $36 overdraft fee.  

We had to play for one of our children birthday and after collecting at least $200 over the month for them we get hit with an extra $160 of additional cost.

I ask my partner to see if they can work an extra 2 hours as a rideshare driver over the weekend too (they are signed up as drivers too) but they do not drive as much as me on the app and have to wait until the app tells them they can drive, also they want the weekend to decompress, and their job has them do a lot more driving too.  So they said no to helping me.

"AITA for asking my friend to help me by playing matchmaker? 
I (20f) have a best friend (20m) who I’ve known since we were 5. He has a gf (20f) whom I’ve met and have gotten along with very well, I’ve even hung out with her without him on multiple occasions. I’ve always been the self proclaimed “happy to be single” friend, but recently I’ve been thinking how nice it would be to find a partner. This led me to downloading dating apps and swiping through them. One thing my best friend always says about me is that I have a hard time judging red flags in potential partners, and he (jokingly) makes fun of me for this often as my past partners have either not been very nice or not very good looking, and in bad cases both! Now one of the dating apps I’m on has a “let your friends play matchmaker” option, where you can send a friend a link, and they can swipe on your behalf, and their swipes get forwarded to you. 

My best friend and I have had loads of fun with this as he has never swiped on a dating app before and is just overall having fun with it, and it’s beneficial to me as he filters out the bad options before they even get to my phone. I thought everything was fine until one day I got a text from his gf. She asked me if I could stop sending these links to my best friend as it worried her that he was looking at all these single people. I replied that it was all for me and he couldn’t access their full accounts or message them even if he wanted to, and he has never expressed interest in any of them except for things like “this person would look good with you”. She gets more and more angry and tells her that him swiping through could subject him to better partners or encourage him to act on his bisexuality (for context he is bi, but has never had the chance to date another man). I told her that reasoning is bs, but about an hour later she sends a voice memo crying because my best friend told her he was not gonna stop helping me, called her insecure, and was offended by her reasoning. They got into an argument about her not trusting him and he went back to his parents for the night. She is pissed that I did not immediately stop when she asked me to, and screamed at me for ruining her relationship but I don’t think I did anything wrong by asking my friend’s help to choose a potential date, AITA?",0.25
"AITA for making plans with my friend and not including my boyfriend? My (28F) best friend (29M) is like a brother to me because both of our mothers are very close to the point that his parents are my sister’s godparents. So basically we were raised together. My friend spent the last 2 years abroad finishing his PhD, and it was during this time that I met my boyfriend (32M), who never met my friend in person, only saw him over Zoom a few times while he and I were talking. 

Now my friend is back (he arrived earlier this week) and I made plans to meet him this weekend. I could tell he wanted to talk to me about some personal stuff, because he is not in a good place right now. Long story short, he was hoping to get a position in the university where he was studying and that didn’t come through, and he broke up with his girlfriend when the time came for him to move back because both of them didn’t think things could work long distance. 

So I figured he needed to pour his heart out and maybe I should just meet him alone so we can talk more comfortably, and my boyfriend can meet him some other time. But when I told my boyfriend I made plans with my friend on Friday and I could meet him on Saturday, he was very upset that I excluded him and didn’t even invite him. Also Friday is one of “our nights” because we never get the chance to meet over the week. 

I tried to explain to him that I just need to be there for a friend in need, and I think the only reason he’s making a big deal out of this is because this is a male friend that he hasn’t met. AITA for not including him?

"AITA for storming off from an argument about my private sex life with my mother? Edit number 2: my family doesn’t see or meet the people that have come over. The only reason they know about it is because they said “I don’t care if someone comes over just give me a heads up”, or my mother would ask who was over out of curiosity and I will tell her.

Throwaway account. I’m 21 years old, the area I live in has extremely high rent and I live at home with my mother father and little brother (16) to save money.

I recently got out of a two year relationship and have been having other ladies over later at night as I work 3:15-11:30 as well as some weekends. I don’t sleep with every girl that comes over.

She will ask who was over, how I know them etc etc.

My mother wanted to talk to me about the “amount of girls” I’ve had over, so we started talking about it as I try to be open and honest with my family. We talked about how some girls might not like that I’ve been with a certain amount of other women etc etc. She then asked if I’m embarrassed about it which I replied no. She then asked if I would be comfortable with her telling her friends and our family friends about it to which I replied I wouldn’t be okay with it. 

She kept accusing me of not being okay with it and saying I was embarrassed because I didn’t want her telling people about it. That started to really get on my nerves. She kept pushing it and I finally asked her if she could NOT tell people about my private sexual/ romantic life and she obliged but kept pushing about how I wasn’t comfortable with it. 

I snapped and told her while I was still ultimately I am under her roof, I am an adult and my private sex life has nothing to do with her. I told her that she has no business knowing which lady was over or how I know them other than the fact it is her house. I reiterated that she should not tell anyone about my private sex life because it is MY PRIVATE life and I am requesting that she does not. 

She kept on pushing that I wasn’t okay with it, that women can “call men sluts” as well, that there is a double standard (I don’t personally care), and women may not like a certain amount of sexual partners and I wouldn’t stand for it so I stormed off. 

Am I the asshole?

Edit: My issue is that regardless of her agreeing with my choices or not she shouldn’t leverage the fact that it is an intimate part of my life. It doesn’t matter whether or not I’m comfortable with it for me personally but more so that it doesn’t need to be shared with anyone, everybody would have a reaction to their sex life being shared regardless of being comfortable with it themselves or not.",0.73
"AITA for not babysitting my sisters kids anymore. Introduction: I (27m) did some accidental good financial decisions years ago that today put me on position where I can do mostly what I love - mess with all kinds of electronics, play videogames a lot etc, I am a huge nerd.  
I own a small electronics/computer shop where I fix customers devices etc, also sell general computers stuff and other small electronics, I live in the same building.  
I don't spend all my time in the shop, I have 2 workers who work in shifts and I work when I feel like it or when they ask help, I also replace them when they need a vacation or sick days.

I have a sister, Jane (34f) and she has 3 kids, Mary (14f), Julia (6f) and Jack (4m) and as I am only one with basically ""unlimited free time to watch the younger kids"", (Mary don't need to be watched anymore, but she often hangs out in my shop either way). I do it every time the kids are sick or my sister is at business trip for her work, and after the COVID, kids are sent home for every tiny cough and sneeze...

What happened? My grandmother had her 80 years birthday and everyone was invited, relatives I don't remember ever seeing before, my sister and I were sitting close to each other and suddenly one old lady (who was maybe my grandmothers cousin or something) started to ask everyone what they do and I told that I run the small business and my sister out of nowhere: ""Yeah, by running a business he means being very lazy and sleeping until noon, sometimes chills out in the store and plays videogames or watches movies all day while some of us had to work hard for their success!"" what is all technically true, while she studied her whole life, I went to trade school and got lucky with few business decisions, but I felt kind of hurt that she forget, that for her to get all that education, others had to watch the kids, so I told ""Oh, don't forget that I am also full time free babysitter, but I decided to quit and focus on being lazy!""

She did not say anything more, did not take me seriously either as week later I get phone call in the morning that the Jack threw up at night few times, she would bring him to my place and I said ""don't you forget that I quit as I am way too lazy to watch the kids"" and ended the call, went back to bed, when I woke up later there was multiple messages from my sister telling me that I am a selfish asshole and I act like I am the centre of the world, I replied politely ""sorry you feel that way"".

Later my mother called and told me, that I put my sister in really tough position as she (mom) can't take days off from hospital in such short notice either and Jane has nobody to watch the kids!  
Am I the asshole for not watching them? I am not hurt because of the ""truth"", I know I am lazy, it hurt that she acts like watching her kids has been nothing.

"AITA for telling my boyfriend he doesn't suit piercings Basically what the title says.
My boyfriend's best friend recently got a nose ring and has been trying to convince my boyfriend to get one as well. Sadly, my boyfriend listens to him when it comes to getting talked into stuff, so naturally he has been obsessing over wanting to get one. 
After having brought up his wish to me once again, he asked what I thought about it and if he would suit one to which I said no, since he doesn't have the right facial structure for it and I believe he wouldn't suit piercings in general. 
I added that I personally don't think they're attractive but it wouldn't change anything, since I love him no matter what and would still find him attractive with or without a piercing. 
Naturally he's been upset about it and even called me an asshole for ""ruining his life long dream"" since apparently he's always wanted to get one but now he doesn't want to anymore. 
I told him that I could be completely wrong with my assumption and to just go ahead and get one if he truly wants it but he still refuses and gets upset whenever the subject comes up.

"AITA for refusing to hand my savings away to my spoiled brother I (18M) am being told to hand over all of my saved money to my spoiled brother so he can go on a vacation? (16M). 
For as long as I can remember my parents have blatantly favoured my brother. He must receive presents for my birthdays, my candles have to be replaced and relit in order for him to be able to blow them out, we always go where he wants to eat. I have even been regularly referred to as a ‘practice child’ by my parents. My grandparents have seen this kind of favouritism from my parents and called them out for it, however it inevitably goes back to the way it has always been.
Throughout all of this I have been able to do reasonably well for myself, I have just recently graduated with good grades. I have been able to do much better in my studies as I have had much more time after distancing myself from my family. I have also been working at my part time job for the past 3 years and have saved myself a nice chunk of money to be able to go to college with, I will of course still have to take out a student loan but my saved money will definitely help me out.
Recently my brother has decided he wants to take a trip across europe with his friends during summer vacation and has been very vocal about this. My parents are in love with his idea and claim it would be a great opportunity for him to ‘make memories that will last forever’. However they have recently spent a lot of their money on a new phone and laptop for him. 
This is where they did the maths and realised that I must have some money saved up, while I was out working they went through my room and found some of the money that I have saved that I have not yet put into a savings account. Once I realised they took my money I ordered them to give it back or I would get the police involved. They did return the money to me but are now trying to guilt me into giving all of my savings to my brother saying that ‘these memories will last him forever’, ‘I will get money from student loans anyway’ and that I am being selfish.
I am getting sick of them asking and guilting me so should I just give them the money?

"AITA if boyfriend moves because I’m allergic to cats Okay here goes- my boyfriend (let’s call him Peter) and his roommate (let’s call him Paul) live together in a small 2 bedroom apartment but are struggling to pay their rent, so Paul’s girlfriend is willing to move in so that there is a third person paying a share of the costs. However, the girlfriend says it’s non-negotiable that she would bring her two cats with her. 

I am highly allergic- not just bad congestion and asthma, which I would be able to suffer through, but my eyes get so itchy and swollen that they swell completely shut. This usually takes 3-5 days to fully heal after symptoms begin and has occasionally led to hospital visits. The only treatment is really strong eye drops which could damage my vision permanently if I use them more than a couple times a year, so I can’t take anything preventatively. For reference, when Peter used to visit a family member with a cat and then see me right after, he would have to undress on the front porch, put his clothes in the washing machine, and immediately take a shower.

I don’t pay rent at Peter and Paul’s place, but I spend several days and nights a week there. I would not be able to visit at all anymore. Because Peter works from home and his setup is not portable, as well as the fact that he does not have reliable transportation, he is not able to spend even close to that much time at my house. Peter comes to my house maybe once or twice a month and it would be really difficult to do more than that. He would also have to follow the decontamination procedure which would be tough now that that I live at a new place with roommates. We have been dating for several years and while we have the occasional date night out, we aren’t able to spend much time together besides at each other’s homes.

Also aside from my allergies, Peter just does not want to live with cats at all. He doesn’t like the smell and also a friend who works with him quite often at his house is also allergic so this would impact their work together. Peter is considering moving out if the cats move in, which would be an even greater financial burden for both Peter and Paul. And I don’t want to be the reason Peter leaves an apartment that he loves, but I could see us possibly breaking up down the road from arguments over the many obstacles keeping us from spending time together. I know if I wasn’t in the picture Peter would probably begrudgingly just live there with the cats.

Paul has suggested I take Benadryl so I’m hoping for better solutions than that! What is the right thing to do? AITA if because of my allergies Peter has to move out, struggle to find a new place, and end up paying more than he is now at his own apartment?

"AITA for wanting a valentine’s day card? Throwaway account as my partner follows my main. I (22f) ordered a customised valentine’s day card for my fiancé (27m). Nothing extravagant it came to less than £5 even with delivery, I’m a very sentimental person and I see cards with a written message as a small but meaningful gesture and tend to hold onto these quite dearly (I’ve even still got cards from my 16th birthday.) 

It arrived today in an envelope which showed the brand of the company that’s quite well known for custom gifts/cards, to which my partner asked what it was and I said it was a valentine’s day card I had ordered for him. 

At hearing this his face scrunched up and he made a comment about how he won’t be getting me a card because “getting someone a card 3 times a year is too much effort and time” for reference I get a card at christmas and for my birthday from him. 

We started bickering over it and I tried to explain I’d rather a cheap or hand made card with a message than going out for a date and having him spend his money covering the bill. And that him saying he’d rather go out than make what I think is a small amount of effort to get and write in a card kind of feels like he’d rather just throw money at the problem instead of doing something sentimental. 

He’s now calling me demanding and ungrateful and got annoyed at me as I started getting emotional and crying, I told him that he had really upset me and all he said back is that I’ve upset him. I’m a bit at a loss here at what to do and if I was in the wrong for pushing him on this. He hasn’t booked anything for valentine’s day nor had he even mentioned wanting to go out which is why I thought a small card would be a nice gesture. I wouldn’t even have minded if he didn’t get one for me it’s more the comment he made about it being “too much effort”. AITA?",0.15
"AITA for not sharing the money Last month, during my (f35) birthday, I went out and bought myself a lottery ticket. Just one ticket to commemorate my first birthday without my grandma, she passed two weeks prior. Two days ago, I found out that I won. I received the news while hanging out with my partner (M53) of 4 years.

In my country, jackpot winnings are not taxed, therefore if you win 44 mil, you got 44 mil nett. I have 6 months to claim the money from the board. 

I am currently renting an apartment, his house is still on mortgage. Our cars are both paid off and I am a local tv producer and he's a tv director. I am in no rush to claim the money coz I think I have 6 months to do so. 

So last night, he asked me about what am I going to do with the money. Told him I've been eyeing a new warehouse which cost around 1.3 mil, showed him how I'm going to convert that warehouse into an industrial loft. He asked about car, so I said maybe I'll get a new car  but I'll keep the old one coz it's my first car.

Suddenly he said he called the bank earlier and asked how much left for his house's full settlement and banker said, he owes 230k more. I kept quiet. Then he said, he'd love a new Corolla Cross hybrid. 

Told him I didnt think to count him in on the math of dividing the winning. In fact, I dont really plan anything yet. He said, even if I give him 1 mil, it wont make a dent on the amount I am about to receive. He cannot believe that I have no intention of sharing the wealth after 4 years of being together. Plus it's mere luck, it's not like I work my ass off to get that much amount of money. He left my house abruptly after that. He's not angry, just frustrated.

"WIBTA if I decided to not invite my friends' / relatives' kids to my not so ""Child-Free"" wedding? I (27F) is getting married this December to my long-term bf. We both planned to have this an almost ""Child-Free"" wedding, only inviting 3 kids under 7 years old, the ring bearer, the arrhae bearer, and the flower girl.  
  
We decided to not include any kids as we have experienced attending weddings where invited guests are allowed to bring their kids, and it was CHAOTIC! One time, we attended one of his bestfriends' wedding with a guest list of 100, almost 20% of them were kids. The ceremony was good but you can hear the kids playing around, screaming at their playmates, laughing, crying, etc. We didn't really understand what the pastor was saying because of the noise.  
  
So as we are planning our wedding, both me and my fiance decided to not invite any of our friends'/relatives kids, unless they are part of the entourage. We don't want for our guests standing up everytime their kids will cry, go up and ask for their kids to sit down or their kids to have their tantrums while the ceremony or the reception is on going. We want them to enjoy the party as is. We also planned on inviting only 100 people. I have a big family specially on my dad's side. Most of them are my cousins, who almost all have their own kids ages 11 below. One of my aunts wants to bring her grandkids as there's no one to look after them (a total of 5 ages 2-11y.o). My dad is insisting me to invite them as they are still family and it is unfair to invite 3 kids that are not blood related to me than to invite the kids from the family.  
  
On the other end, one of my friends (ex co-worker) is also insisting of bringing her kids (ages 5 below) as I've already met them twice and there's no reason for me to not invite them because they are well-behaved kids.

One day (aprox a week ago) we were sparing and she tried a choke hold on me that I thoght her and she executed it almost perfectly.

I was starting to run out of air(i didn't think she would choke me out completely but it was close) and was ready to tap out but as a last ditch effort I swung my head back and hit her square in the nose(we have only 2 rules : no crochshot and watch out for the eyes). She let go and fell on the ground so i got worried but she was fine. 

When we told the story to our friends they said that I was a dickhead and should have just tapped out or thrown her. I even heard the abuse word thrown around a couple of times later in the night.

But if I throw her she would surely get hurt and I wont disrespect her with not giving everything I got.

"AITA for not cooking my 10 year old brother breakfast? Throwaway

 I (16) get up early before school to cook breakfast for myself. I have been doing this for years now. Before anyone comes for my parents though, they do provide breakfast. It's just that they always get cereal or frozen food and stuff while I'd prefer a hot omelette. 

Anyways when I started doing this they asked if I'd make a little extra for my younger brother (10m) since he doesn't like frozen breakfast food. I already take care of making sure he gets up and ready for school in the morning since my parents both have to be at work before we even get up so I said sure. It was hell since he'd have to get up earlier in order to have time to actually eat the food. It was a fight every morning we had school.

This might be where I'm the ahole though. I didn't want to do it anymore so I just stopped. I'd make food for myself and make sure he was up in time to grab something and get the bus like before, but I didn't make sure he had breakfast. He honestly didn't seem to care and I thought it was fine. He apparently complained to our parents about this though since I was scolded last night and they said that if they find out I'm not making sure he's fed in the morning they'll ground me and take away my allowance.

"AITA for finally blowing up at my ex gf? Hi Guys,

I don't really know where I stand with this because I do feel like an AH now. 

The background behind this is that me 25F and my now ex gf 26F have split up. The reason behind this is that I was and still am going through a major depressive episode. I have been doing so since around mid November. During that time I will admit that although I tried getting help, I was repeatedly getting batted away by docs and told I was fine. This made me less engaged with getting help so eventually I just shut off. I admit that I shouldn't have done this.

My ex, let's call her J, the entire time she did make some suggestions but they unfortunately weren't really much use. She has also struggled massively with her mental health and two times it escalated to the point where she needed to go to the hospital. I stayed with her throughout and tried to make sure she got the help she needs, I'm not taking creditt for her getting the help but I was there to support her.  I'd go up to see her and her apartment used to be a mess, there were never any groceries in and never anything cooked. I took that responsibility and made sure when I was there that her apartment was deep cleaned, there were groceries in and there was a fresh meal every night, on top of managing my own place. We both work full time but she spent on average between 12 and 16 hours of the day asleep as she would nap while working. I feel like we never spent quality time together as she was asleep so often and I felt like I'd be rude if I said her sleeping so much was affecting me, so I kept quiet and just carried on.

Since mid November my mental health took a severe turn and I wasn't doing great. All of December when I'd come to see her, she just seemed pissy with me and on Christmas, I was sick and spent the day in bed and she didn't even bother. I offered to come up to see her in January and she said she would let me know. We hardly spoke all through January and last week, she broke up with me. Initially I did the whole thing of apologising and grovelling and pleading but she said she was feeling neglected and that the relationship wasn't working. I went to A&E and informed them that if they don't see me, I was going to take some drastic action if I didn't get any help and that finally got things going. I got back onto medication and am paying privately for therapy again. She said it wasn't enough so I finally lost it and blew up on her. I sent her a massive text message on how she made me feel during the relationship and how I felt neglected and ignored and how whenshe was going through similar, I was there but the second I needed her, she left and hung out with others. She told me more or less to get fucked and we haven't spoken since.

 I think I'm the AH for two reasons. One if I tried harder to get mental health help, maybe we wouldn't be in this situation and two, if I didn't blow up on her and tell her how I was now feeling about the relationship maybe we would still be talking. 

The decision is ultimately up to you guys though.",0.1
"AITA for starting arguments with my mum to defend my BF? No TL;DR, I could explain so much more context but I'm at word limit.

I (25F) live at home with my (49F) Mum, where I pay half rent as she is on a pension. I am also currently on a pension due to mental health issues.

I have a bf (35M) who we'll call Romeo. He lives in another country, we met online in a D&D community in mid-2022. To be short, we met when I was in a very bad place mentally however he as a person inspired me to be better, and I spent more time hanging with him until we transitioned to dating in around Feb '23. Romeo had been out of work for just over half a year at the time that we met, as he had his own mental health struggles. 

Before this most of my relationships were online, and I know how different people can be in person. We discussed options but he had a crap flatmate so I wouldn't be able to stay with him and would have to get a hotel. If he visited me, he'd be able to stay in the house and I'd be comfier. He liked the idea and was happy to wait and save, but I am impatient and wanted to meet ASAP so I decided to pay.

After 4 years of not working, I got a job in Oct '23, and was planning for his visit on March '24. My job told me a month in that we get an unpaid break from Dec 22 to Jan 10, so I rushed the process so that we could spend Christmas and NYE together. His flight dates were Dec 9th to Jan 20th, giving him time to explore my city while I'm at work (and the dates were the cheapest).

When he lands, I can immediately tell my mum does not like Romeo. He is very quirky but so am I (we're both autistic) however her dislike was before he even spoke. She badmouths Romeo to my entire family before they get a chance to meet him. She refuses to participate in conversation with him, and treats him worse than a child or pet. This began to effect me severely and even my coworkers could tell something was wrong. 

After time passes, it comes down to he's short & chubby (5'5 same as me, though I'm bigger), balding, and does not follow (or know) her 1000 house rules (she has extreme OCD). My mum would constantly make remarks that were rude about Romeo. I would often tell her to stop, but she would say she just ""tells it how it is"". A few times this escalated into a one-sided screaming match as I'd get emotional, and she would just be a cold b\*tch.

Romeo left about 11 days ago and she has calmed down since, but we recently had to discuss moving as our landlords decided to unexpectedly renew our lease (they *were* going to renovate). She told me she'd never have Romeo staying with us again, and I said if she wants me to still live here and help financially, then that's not an option. She started going on again about how bad he or his appearance is or how ""I could do so much better"". I started to point out her problematic behaviour, and she got upset that ""I always start arguments over him when shes just worried"". Now whenever Romeo is mentioned, she gets dramatic and acts like I'm being a big toxic AH just for defending him.

We have lived in this house for a couple of years and are now moving out as the landlord has decided to sell the house. While in the final few months of our tenancy, we have agreed to allow house viewings from prospective buyers at specific times.

"AITA for communicating through my mother since my brother and I are going through a rough patch We are all in our early 30s apart from my
Mother. My brother recently bought a new house. For the past few months we haven’t been talking much. There’s been issues on both sides I guess and we’ve not talked them out. We’ve still been celebrating occasions as a family and gift each other presents on birthdays. 

His wife rang me recently to invite me to view their house. My brother was next to her. It was arranged that I would visit same day my parent. I thought it was a good idea as it
Wouldn’t be too awkward. I told her my husband finished at a certain time and she said it was fine. I later found out that they were inviting my mother and my sibling hours earlier. It didn’t make sense because the point was that we’d go together. By the time my husband would be home and we’d set of my parents would probably be on the way back. 
Sil had told me to let her know if we could make it so that morning before I had talked to my mother I let my sil know the time we would come and if it was ok. Hours went by and I didn’t get a response. After my talk with my
Mother she decided to talk with my brother who basically confirmed what I had been thinking.

He said there wasn’t any point in me coming because he had things planned later that night and and with the time we were coming we wouldn’t be able to stay long anyway. (Around 6pm) so obviously I won’t be going when my parents go anymore but my sil is still silent. Of course she had told me the time was fine to come so if that’s not the case why not just reply to say it wouldn’t work or to rearrange instead of not responding back. I’m wondering if I did something wrong in talking to my mother and her reaching out to my brother. There’s a long history of my sil making issue and holding grudges out of anything so I think I’m just a bit weary.",0.79

Me (41f) and my husband (42m) have been married for 10 years and have 2 kids. My husband's family are lovely, but don't seem to talk about anything difficult. My SIL (40f), let's call her Daisy, lives at home with them. Daisy has always lived at home and struggles with managing her finances. She's great at her job, but is on minimum wage, and her parents pay for her car, accommodation, food, phone etc. My MIL (78m) and FIL (80m) are retired and have enough savings to go on nice holidays etc, and so this is not an issue for them. SIL will make some unnecessary purchases, eg. Bought a new apple laptop to upgrade her one which was 3 years old, uses high-end hair products and cosmetics, is subscribedto all the streaming services, will regularly buy new clothing/ shoes etc. I wouldn't have minded any of this, except recently my MIL has recently been making comments along the lines of ""she'll be living with you when we're gone"", and implied we'll have to manage her car etc. They've done this joke before and don't do any of this conversation with my husband. I got a bit annoyed at this as no-one seems to think that there are any other options for her to improve her finances. (Eg. Parents could plan to one day move out of the large 4 bedroom house they are in, downsize and buy SIL a flat). If they don't make that plan then i worry she will spend anything she inherits and not have anywhere to live/ not plan. This happened with an earlier large inheritance she got from grandparents. When the topic of moving out has been brought up in the past by FIL, she just walks out of the room. My husband thinks it may have been a joke comment, and to not rock the boat.

"AITA for sending my kids to school sick A little background - my kids are young. They have missed about 25 percent of the school year due to various illness. I’m fortunate enough to be a stay at home parent so it’s easy enough to keep them home. 

About 11 or 12 days ago the younger kid started getting sick. It was a Sunday so I kept him home from school on Monday. I also kept the other kid home. He just had a runny nose but I figured I may as well. Sure enough they both got hit hard and missed the entire week of school. It actually got worse for them on the weekend, so They were also out the first 2 days of the following week as well.

"AITA For asking questions about my guy friend’s relationship? My (25) Guy friend (25) Caleb and I have known each other since middle school. It’s been a weird up and down kind of friendship mostly on his end. He caught feelings for me and he’s struggled with it on and off for years. I rejected him many times. But he’s also under the impression I gave him false hope because of one drunk confession I said. And we cuddled on a couch. The next day I explained how I didn’t mean what I said. And he went on to be depressed and started to think “I wasn’t good for him” But he was good for and to me. He’s always been somebody I trust. He’s helped me through rough periods in my life. Helped me move to a different state. Everything. He’s never had a girlfriend so when he met Arianna on Tinder a year ago, I was so happy!! 

The first few weeks, we were still close and back to normal for a few months since that weird drunk incident. He went to me and was excited for me to meet Arianna. I thought she was gorgeous and awesome. But I guess she had an issue with our friendship since the day I texted him a paragraph about the status of our friendship. 

I texted him “Hey Caleb. I’ve noticed I haven’t heard from you as much these past few weeks. How do I navigate this situation?” Arianna I guess was laying right near him and got a bad impression of that question. 

I asked him a few months later if Caleb moved in with her since I noticed on Facebook Arianna got her own apartment. Guess that was an issue too.  

I’ve tried to keep the friendship up, but he said how I am not good for him. And how he wants to remain civil since we are in the same friend group. When Arianna is not with him at events or concerts, I’ve went up to him and told him that I miss our friendship and that I’m sorry. 

Guess Arianna doesn’t like that I approached her “property” without her there. She doesn’t own him. 

Well he did move in with her a few months ago, and it’s an hour away from where we live. I worry he’s isolated as he only comes back to our home town a few times a month. Arianna is “off”. We know barley anything about her life, she’s not super eager to befriend the girls in the group, and is just “stand-off ish”

"AITA for confronting my father about eating with mouth open Me 30ish Father 50ish call him Dave. Mother call her Sarah

I visit Sarah and Dave often. Dave chews very loudly with his mouth open. I find it repulsive and annoying so does Sarah. Sarah and I have told Dave on multiple occasions to chew with his mouth closed like a normal person. Dave has made excuses that he has a condition or a small mouth etc.

Dave would always tell me I'm turning a mountain into a mole hill (Being pedantic). But I noticed that when out at other family gatherings Dave eats normally. 

So one day I recorded Dave eating while watching a movie and played it back to him. I played it back and pointed out that even though the film was loud you could still hear the chewing. Dave told me he couldn't hear it. I recorded again this time pausing the movie and this time Dave stopped and closed his mouth while chewing. I confronted him again. I asked if he was lying about having any condition at all.

Eventually we got into a long conversation. Which I recorded (With Dave knowing about) It started with my Dave laughing at me and saying your funny. I asked the question like ""Why did you lie about the mouth thing?"" ""Why do you find this funny?""

Dave: ""Son you're funny""

Me: ""Why do you find me funny?""

Dave: ""You're not funny"" Proceeds to laugh hysterically

Me: ""You can tell if you don't want to answer these questions""

Dave : ""To me its like pretty obvious and not only is it obvious but its almost juvenile having to tell you"" ""I'm sorry I have a different sense of humour. ""I don't give a S \*\*\*\*  about (a lot of things)... and you give a S\*\*\*\*   about a lot of things""

Dave has claimed that chewing with your mouth open is some sort of cultural thing and generally most people don't have a problem with it. Later Dave told me that it is unacceptable to tell others what to do. Which Sarah pointed out was by definition 'telling another person what to do'.

Dave has told me AITA and Reddit would think so as well for me being petty and not letting things go. I don't think I am being petty at all. Eating with your mouth open is gross and annoying and we shouldn't subject those we care about to that sound.

"AITA for being upset after my fiance came home from work 5 hours late? I (26m) woke up at 530am today to realize that my fiance (21f) hadn't made it home yet. I tried calling her twice but the first time it wouldnt connect through messemger so I called her phone and it went straight to voicemail. I immediately called her mom and told her what i knew and she called the police and my fiances boss (they work together so they used to share bosses.) I got in my car and drove towards her work to see if i could find any debris, she got out of work at midnight so i figured if she did crash it would have been cleaned by then because it's an interstate highway and has a lot of traffic. While i was driving back i got a text from my fiance saying sorry she didnt have service and that she had gone to the bar with some friends after work and just didnt think to let me know. At this point she was already home but didn't realise anyone had tried to contact her because when she regained service she got a bunch of notifications at the same time. When I got back home she was upset that i had contacted her mom and that her mom called her boss and the police. AITA for being upset at this point? I thought my whole life ended and she was dead, and she's upset that I got worried even though it was 5+ hours after she got off of work.

"AITA for stealing the spotlight from my sister at her baby shower? My sister (f29) and I (f23) are both pregnant.

She's nearing her seventh month, she had an accidental pregnancy with someone she was having an affair with, so she's not getting his support. My sister moved back with our parents and she's at risk of losing her job. She has hyperemesis gravidarum, so she's really not having a good time and she has had to skip work often, she was also recently diagnosed with gestational diabetes.

I also got pregnant accidentally, but with my boyfriend (m25) who I've been dating for two years. I'm in my 14th week. It was a big surprise to us because I was on birth control but we were already living together, we're planning on getting married, so we were able to accept this a lot better. Besides that I've had the normal pregnancy symptoms which kind of sucked more than I expected them, but my nausea is almost non existent by now so I'm doing a lot better now.

My parents and I live close by, so visit often. Also when I got pregnant I asked her for the contact with her doctor, so ever since we have been going together to our check ups because I thought that she'd like it and it was helpful for her as well. 

The thing is that my sister and I are spending more time together and often talking about our pregnancies as well.

So, my sister had her baby shower last week. The party was nice and we got to see some of our extended family who live away. Since they're my family as well they asked me about my pregnancy too and we chatted about that as well. My bf was invited too so because I'm the closest person to him he was with me almost all the time. But then my sister got upset, she wasn't feeling well and I don't know exactly what triggered her but she got angry at me because I was stealing the attention from her. She told me I always want to be the focus of attention and I can't even let her have one day, she said that I'm always bragging about how good/ supportive my boyfriend is and how ""easy"" my pregnancy is and I don't know when to shut up because I don't have empathy for others that are going through a harder time. 

I started crying. This was so unexpected to me because she has never implied or said something about this before... Our parents and my boyfriend rushed to comfort me and they got angry at her, they had an argument and my boyfriend and I left. Almost everyone sided with me at this and yesterday my sister sent me a long message about how I was an entitled and spoiled golden child (literally like that) and how much she always feels like she's in the shadows because of me. She accused me of getting pregnant on purpose because I couldn't tolerate not having everyone's attention... That I complain about small things when I have it easy... All of that. She blocked me so I couldn't reply anything.

So some context, he’s awful with money, but makes a decent wage. He bought a house and got a brand new car, but he’s living above his means and doesn’t make enough to cover everything so he’s been putting a lot on a credit card that’s now pretty much maxed out. I’ve been living primarily in his home recently and have offered to help with utilities, rent, and frequently buy groceries and cook all the dinners since he says he can’t afford to buy food even though he still manages to buy vapes, cigarettes, and a six pack of beer a night. Every time I’ve offered he tells me “no” and says he wants to “provide for me”.

I don’t need to be provided for, and I could live independently as I am financially savvy and make a good salary. I have even offered to help him make a budget and he tells me no because “he’s going to die someday and he wants to spend his money how he wants”.

So when he asked me for money for his car payment I got frustrated. I told him his car is his responsibility and his investment, he chose to buy a brand new car with all the extras, I don’t use it (he won’t even let me drive it) and I have my own car which is paid off. I reminded him that I will give him money for living expenses and bills since I am in his home and it’s shared use, but not for his car. He declined wanting money for that again.

(I did not cheat with Randal, this was before he got with Miyah.) My brother Max is the best man. Me and my parents were also helping and contributing a bit to the wedding. We are all excited for the wedding. Everyone knows I am pregnant and that Randal is the father. Everyone was shocked at first but got over it. And we do plan on giving the baby up to a lovely couple we know. It will be a closed adoption. As we both don’t want kids.

Our whole family is invited so it will be a big wedding which is why we are contributing. I have met Miyah a good few times as she is also my best friends little cousin. She’s a nice girl and my guess is no one told Miyah about the whole pregnancy situation. She messaged and asked me to meet up. 

I did agree, we met up and the first thing she asked if Randal is the father. I said yes he is the father, but we are giving our daughter to a lovely couple. Miyah just started crying at this point, I tried giving her a hug. She pushed my hands away and just started calling me names and told me not to come too the wedding. 

I told her no of course. I explained that my pregnancy really is none of her business anyways and that I got pregnant way before she even met Randal. I left at this point and I told my whole family about what happened. They support me and said I am still going. My parents then told Randal’s mother and his family what happened.

She is on my side and wants me there. So does his cousins. Now Randal is mad at me texting me that I ruined everything. Because Miyah has not messaged him since she knew. I texted him that it was his responsibility to tell his partner about everything. He just left me on read and hasn’t messaged me since. Miyah’s family and friends however started messaging me so much on Facebook people who I don’t even know. Even some of Randal and Max mutual friends started messaging me and blaming me. 

Which was a shock to me, as they knew about my pregnancy and I was good friends with them as well. It was just too much, I had to deactivate my account. It’s causing a lot of stress for me and my pregnancy, I’m getting nervous.

"AITA for not letting my 21 year old son move back in with me? My son's dad (Joseph) and I have been divorced for about 6 years now.  When my son (Damion) turned 18 he wasn't able to hold down a job and didn't want to go to college.  Joseph and I had a custody arrangement where the kids are with me a week and then him a week and this continued after he turned 18.

I was tired of Damion not working or going to school and just playing video games all day so I decided to charge him rent ($300 per month).  The rent was to pay for his internet, phone, any special groceries he wanted along with utilities.  I explained to Joseph the lesson I was trying to teach Damion and that I would never kick him out.  He would just not have the luxuries mentioned above but he would have a roof over his head, clothing, and food to eat.  Damion was upset about this arrangement and called his dad asking to live with him.  His dad agreed despite the conversation I had.  Having Damion live with me was actually taking a toll on my physical and mental health.  I was somewhat relieved but suspect Joseph agreed just to dig at me and make himself seem to be the better parent.

Fast forward two year later, Damion is having serious mental issues, can't hold down a job, and isn't in school.  He just stays in his room all day playing video games, eating, and sleeping. About a year ago, Joseph couldn't handle Damion living with him full-time and asked if I could take him some of the days.  I agreed to allow him to stay with me the same weekends I have his little brother as well to give Joseph a break.

As mentioned before, Damion is having serious mental issues and the both of us are working on getting him help and are in the process of getting him into an outpatient program for depression.  I've always been a supportive mom and kept in constant contact with him despite him moving.  I value his well being and always try to help him where needed.

Well, Joseph is now asking if Damion can live with me a week at a time again because his mental instability is taking a toll on him and his health (much like with me years ago).  It may help Joseph but I don't believe going back and forth again will help Damion at all.  I'm scared if I agree, my mental and physical health will start to decline.  I don't think either one of us is equipped to deal with Damion and he needs help beyond what either of us can offer.  I think the solution is to work on his mental health, then work on helping him become a functioning adult rather shifting the whole living arrangement again.

"AITA for not attending my cousin's wedding? Backstory: in September 2023, found out from someone with CONCRETE EVIDENCE that my grandparents are terrible people.    
  
  
  
In October 2023, visited my family and my cousin, Cindy, who was getting married in 2024, mentioned she was inviting me to her wedding. Having just started a new job, I told her a digital invite is fine instead of physical since I lived abroad. She said that's fine and she'd send it to me when she got them.  
  
  
  
Honestly, because of the news about my grandparents and me not particularly enjoying my extended family I was hesitant to attend... wanted to attend and celebrate Cindy and her big day any way. Even if I couldn't get the time off, I figured I would send her a nice check.  
  
  
  
December 2023 - My grandma informed me that the wedding was May 30th. Checked my calendar and saw it was a Thursday, which is odd. Called Cindy to verify, she said no - the wedding was APRIL 2024, they are finalizing dates now. I mentioned again, this is fine - just send me a digital copy of the invite when she could.  
  
  
  
Early January 2024 - My grandma tells me the wedding is 4/30, check the calendar and it's a Tuesday? She mentioned that invitations will be sent out soon. I don't bother to message Cindy since the invites would clarify everything for me.  
  
  
  
LATE January 2024 - Extended family in Canada receive their invites, I live in the USA. My second cousin, Rebecca is asking if I am attending and sends me a copy of her invite. I said I didn't get an invite yet. Rebecca mentions most of the Canadian relatives received their invites days ago. I am quite hurt because I thought my cousin would have emailed or texted me the invite... especially since I have to put in a vacation request, book flights, etc. Rebecca mentioned using her invite to get my time off, decided against it because I felt embarrassed/forgotten.  
  
  
  
When I looked at the invite, the wedding is two days long - 4/27 and 4/28 and my grandmother is listed as an RSVP contact. I am baffled that she kept providing me wrong dates when she's listed as a contact for RSVP????  
  
  
  
Today - my grandma called asking for my address (which is absurd because she has ALWAYS had my address to send paperwork, apply for visas, etc.) to send my invite via regular mail. Hazarding a guess here that she realized someone (Rebecca) may have mentioned I never received any invite. I now no longer wish to attend, even if I got the time off. My grandma is disappointed saying, ""I could at least come down for one day"" and I'm being difficult. I feel like some sort of afterthought. I don't want to keep asking Cindy about my invite either.

"AITA for asking my bf to learn about my chronic illness? (Type 1 diabetes) My bf (29m) and I (29f) have been seeing eachother for 4 months. I have type 1 diabetes which I was diagnosed with fairly recently (2.5 years ago). I have talked to him frequently about the difficulty managing this illness, and he’s been comforting and supportive generally. 

Recently, I had a severe hypoglycemic episode (my blood sugar was very low) and I texted him saying I can’t make plans yet as I’m dealing with a very low blood sugar event. I also stated that I was feeling a bit scared. He texted and said “not to sound naive, but ..eat something?” . I explained why I’m scared, and that he may be naive about it but it’s not his fault. He continued asking questions but during a low blood sugar it’s tough to think/respond/focus on anything but treating the emergency.

He works in tech and experiments with chat gpt. He asked why I’m scared and I responded “b/c it’s dangerous. 2.5mmol.  Urgent low. Ask chat gpt”. He then said “no need to be sassy” . Conversation continued with questions and answers and I then just decided to send him two infographics explaining what to do and what you should know if someone is experiencing hypoglycemia. One of them mentioned the risk of a low possibly leading to seizures or death. I sent the two sources with the question “have you looked it up?” Because I felt like he could have done some research at this point especially while I’m in the middle of this emergency. 

He responded to the infographics and my question with “yes, my cousin died from it. I’ve listened to what you said” but his cousin died from addiction related causes that led to difficulties managing his diabetes.  

I responded an hour later with “I’m not sure what to say” and he said “let’s leave it for tonight”. It’s been 36 hours and I’ve not heard from him.

AITA? For telling him to do his research and waiting for him to apologize or even ask if I’m okay? Also, at no point did he ask if I was feeling ok or needed anything. He lives a 20 minute walk away.

"AITA for thinking my best friend is wrong for charging me for moving help AITA for asking for moving help from my best friend.

I am currently planning on moving in with my gf of 4 years and I asked my best friend of 10 years for a favor to help with moving since he has a work van with a lot of empty space.I told him I can pay for all the gas and get lunch for whatever he wants. My gf does live about 1 hour 20 minutes away so it would be almost 3 hours of help. He said yes then let me know he will charge me 67 cents a mile (because that’s what truckers charge). Idk If I’m in the wrong thinking this that the 67 cent a mile is a bit much considering we have been best friends so long.",0.94
"AITA for grounding my son for his behavior on a field trip?   
My wife (32F) and I (32M) have twin boys Milo (11M) and Leverett (11M).  
  
On Monday was the 5th grade field trip to the planetarium. Milo is very into science and loves stuff like physics and astronomy, so he went on this trip with his friends. Leverett finds science to be boring, it’s his least favorite subject and when permission slips came out months ago, he told us he didn’t want to go. We told him that was fine and we asked him if there was anything else he wanted to do on that day and he said he’d ask his friends.  
  
Open of his friend’s mom’s suggested a basketball museum in our state, it’s a bit of a drive but she said her and her husband were willing to take Leverett and his basketball teammates, and thats what they ended up doing. On Monday, Leverett and his friends went to this museum.  
  
The planetarium field trip was chaperoned by the teachers.  
  
On Monday evening, once they got back to the school, parents had to pick up their kids from the school. I went to pick up Milo and his teacher asked if she could speak to me. She said that Milo and his friends had made various inappropriate comments on the trip, she said that Milo mentioned what Leverett and his friends were doing and that they said him and the other boys were “ret\*\*\*ed” for not wanting to go on the trip, she said they also were making fun of Leverett for his skincare routine. Milo had taken a picture of the skincare products Leverett used and were calling him a “f\*g”.  
  
Leverett started using some skincare products recently after one of his friend’s girlfriend’s told him that girls like boys with “clear skin”. His skin is already clear and we just got him some basic stuff. We were a bit hesitant to get him these products due to all the articles we’ve seen on preteen skincare, but we never mentioned anything against it over fears of it being “feminine”.  
  
In the car, I was talking to Milo and he said that he was just telling the truth and refused to apologize.   
  
I mentioned what happened to my wife when we got home and she asked to speak to me alone. After speaking, we told Milo that he needed to write an apology letter or he would be grounded, he told us to group him, but that we were being “unfair”.  
  
When the boys got home this afternoon, we asked them about their day, Leverett said that Milo and a few other boys in his friend group were bragging about getting punished for “using free speech” and “telling the truth”. Milo still maintains the grounding is unfair and won’t even consider an apology letter.   
  
My wife asked a co-worker of her’s who has a “rebellious daughter” who’s also 11 for advice, and she said we should lift the punishment and we were being too harsh on him and that we should just let Milo speak his mind. AITA?",0.14
"AITA for grounding my daughter for making fun of my son?   
My husband (m33) and I (f33) have two children, our daughter Meave (f13) and our son Treyton (m11).  
  
Meave is in 8th grade and Treyton is in 6th grade, they go to different middle schools though.  
  
In the beginning of 4th grade, one of Treyton’s friends from basketball left his elementary school to join the local Montessori school near us, he soon started asking his friends to see if they could join him, explaining to them it was “better” than traditional school, one of his friends ended up joining in 5th grade and soon the rest of the boys, including Treyton, started to ask if they could go to the Montessori middle school for 6th grade.  
  
Treyton’s friends parents started to enroll, we saw the benefits it was having for Treyton’s 2 friends in it and we could afford it, so we ended up applying and him and all of his friends got in. Treyton’s doing much better in school, he used to be reading and doing math in grade level, but since he started there, he’s developed a genuine interest in all of his school subjects, and is starting to even perform above his sister in the core subjects.  
  
The teachers have taught Treyton to connect math and science to basketball, his true love in life. One of the cool aspects of the school is that kids can come together and if enough students are interested, they can get their teachers to offer a course (some examples include French History, or classes about AI), they will either do this online or find a professional part time who can teach the course.   
  
Treyton and his friends organized to have a class that’s about basketball around the world, like how different cultures engage with it, ect and they were able to get the class. Now they’re trying to get more classes around basketball.  
  
The issue is Meave, Meave is saying that Treyton is “not taking real classes” and that the progress he made is “only because he was so stupid before”. She’s saying that it’s “pathetic” that he needed to tie science and math to basketball to actually care about it, and is saying that Treyton and his friends won’t be “ready for the real world”, she says this stuff in front of Treyton and his friends and we’ve told her to stop but she won’t.  
  
Last night, she was talking to a friend and she said he goes to a “school for idiots”.  
  
After the friend left, my husband and I spoke about what happened. We asked Meave to come in our room and told her that she was grounded due to her repeated comments, she said she did nothing wrong and that we are unfair for grounding her for “her opinion”, she keeps trying to make us feel guilt and we don’t know if we’re in the right now or if we are a-holes. AITA?",0.09
"AITA for teasing him or did I go too far? I’m (21) in a situationship or a fuck buddy arrangement (honestly idk anymore, I asked him (28) when we met but he didn’t really give an answer he just says he would like to have a relationship someday and I told him I don’t want to have a fuck buddy arrangement but here we are).

In January he texted me several times asking me to come over and I told him that I can’t because I was really busy with exams and assignments. I told him that I was going to be busy for the entire month. He said “okay no worries focus on your work” so I thought he understood, but he kept on texting me, each time giving off persistent/impatient vibes. So, I jokingly asked him “if you’re so horny why don’t you just fap or something lol”. I meant to tease him but apparently it struck a nerve and I expected him to say “shut up hahah” or something like that, but he said “This is not what I write to you when you ask me about coming over or when I will be back”. So I apologized saying I didn’t mean to offend him.

And then he asked me “what will 30 mins do to you?”, “I have been reasonable to ask you for 30mins only rather than the whole night”, “What time will you sleep? Maybe I can come right before that”. Those first two sentences he said made me feel like I owe him sex or something. So I snapped and texted him back “Why are you forcing me? I never forced you. Don’t treat me like a sex toy you can use whenever it’s convenient for you” and then he replied “I’m not forcing you and keep this kind of talk to yourself. You message me when you want and I do the same.”

Mind you, I only asked when he’s coming back, I didn’t ask him every single day with thinning patience. I only asked him twice in two weeks. At the time I was taken aback by his response so I just apologized.

Fast forward to today, about 1-2 weeks have passed since the incidence, we agreed earlier today that I’ll come over to his place tonight, but I just got my period and I told him that it’s probably going to be messier than the last time we did it, but he said it’s fine and to bring towels. I tried to tease him again “You’re really horny huh” and then he got angry again. He replied “I don’t have much time for such shaming, or jokes or whatever it is you’re trying to do.” And I told him that I wasn’t trying to shame him and he said “I’ve already asked you not to talk this way with me.” Now this sentence honestly rubs me the wrong way. I asked him back “why are you so tense??” And he told me that he’s not horny and not to come over tonight.

Am I the asshole for teasing him? I wasn’t trying to shame him, I mean pretty much a majority of people on this earth gets horny right?? Did I perhaps crossed the line with the teasing? Or does he just have an attitude/is too sensitive?",0.32
"AITA for not buying the dress? F31 was married to M35, we had 2 kids now F17 and M5 before divorcing. My Ex-husband ended up having an affair right around the time we got pregnant with our daughter. So he has two F17. We’ll call my daughter Katie and affair baby Sally. 

I found out about Sally, when both girls was 14. Sally’s mom had lost her job and could no longer make ends meet. She asked ex for money, he refused. She told him she would take him for child support. The DNA came back as he was her dad. I served him divorce papers a year later.

Both girls have Prom coming up. I pay for their private education bc Katie wanted her to go to the same school with her. I was always the bread winner due to being a trust fund baby and making a salary of 98k a year. My husband never made much of a salary, maybe about 15k a year at most.

I took my daughter dress shopping and she wanted to take Sally. I protested this idea bc we was going to an high end shop and I knew Sally wouldn’t be able to afford a dress from there. She kept on insisting and my ex told me to just let her go.

I gave in, I felt bad bc I could tell Sally was wanting one of these. I told Sally we would go elsewhere for her to look at dresses if she wanted, she decline. 

Katie picked out a designer dress that was a blue ombré. Sally seemed very upset and I offer to take her to look at dresses in her price range and throw in a few hundred to help. She decline. We took her back home. 

My ex called and was mad at me. I asked what was wrong and he just blew up on me. Saying I was wrong for not buying Sally a dress and that Sally was wanting a dress that Katie had tried on. Apparently when Sally got home she started asking them for one of the dressing Katie had tried on. I told him this is why I didn’t want to take Sally. 

I thought the problem would die there. Katie finally got her dress after the alterations. She wanted to take the dress and show her dad and stepmom. She goes there with it and doesn’t return with it. 

She came in cry telling me her stepmom took the dress. Told her she could wear a dress that’s the same amount as Sally’s. My daughter is a teen and obviously believes she has to wear a dress that’s the same amount as her peers.

I called my ex up. He said he would return the dress to us in May, prom is March. I told him he would return it now or I would stop paying for Sally’s schooling. I told the school I would no longer be paying for Sally’s school and to ask ex for the check. 

Ex got word and called me in a rage. I told him the sooner I get the dress the sooner I’ll take responsibility of payment back. I told him it’s not my fault his wife continue to have kids she couldn’t afford. He yelled that I could’ve just bought the dress Sally wanted and just hung up on me. 

Since this he’s made a Facebook post and contacted his and the stepmom’s family over the situation. I’m being called names and I should just buy the dress bc “it wouldn’t hurt my pockets”. So AITA for not buying the dress?",0.47
"AITA when I tell my Girlfriend she knows nothing about money? So my girlfriend(28F) and I(26M) come from different ends of money and it’s hurting our relationship because she has no idea how to save money. 

She comes from a relatively well off family. She had her college fully paid off, a car fully paid off and had many of her bills paid for her when she was in college and for some time when she graduated. She didn’t pay her car payment, phone bill, and got an allowance for a while while she was in college. 

All of that has stopped and she’s now paying for everything to be fair. I come from a very poor family and have been working a regular 30-40 hours since 16 like a lot of people (My birthday present on my 16th birthday was my mother telling me to get a job, that kind of family). 

I have paid for everything I have owned or gotten since I was 16. Paid fully for an older car, paid for my college, paid for my own phone since 16, etc. 

We cannot save money, like at all. My girlfriend is very particular about what she buys and what she will not buy. 

For example, we spend roughly 2000$ a month on food. We are vegan and she eats strictly organic food. Our grocery bill is roughly 400$ a week and we eat out once a week for 100$(she will not eat any kind of fast food). She will only get the top name brand organic groceries. She will only get an organic, vegan protein powder that costs roughly 100$ for 3 containers. 

We have two cats, she will only get the most expensive kind of cat food, as well as premium litter. Roughly 3$ for a small can, and 12-15 for the litter(which isn’t terrible). 

She loves music and we will go to multiple big events per year. Each one of these events are roughly 1000$ each and we typically will pay for one and go, then begin another when we get back. There is hardly a month when we aren’t making a 120-150$ payment each to go to these events. 

She loves expensive rave outfits, as well as custom fits from independent small businesses. She doesn’t like supporting large brands. A typical outfit is roughly 500-1000$. When she wants gifts I will typically make payments on these for her to get them for her. 

The last place we rented costs 1015$ a month, all utilities included. She said her mental health was not in the best place because it was a little on the small side, so we moved into a larger place that costs about 1600$ per month. 

Needless to say I am stressed because we can’t save money, I have tried talking to her but she refuses to come down on any of these things. I told her she doesn’t understand money and she hates when I tell her this. AITA?",0.31
"AITA anything to do with my fiancé’s toxic and abusive mother?    I need advice. Keep in mind that im 15 and my boyfriend just turned 18, we are 5 weeks  pregnant. His mother is literally a lunatic. She’s a bipolar narcissist and emotionally abusive. 
When we told her I was pregnant, she acted really supportive and kind at first. Then her and 2/4 of her kids(16&14) decided to talk badly about me. Of course, I tried to calmly and maturely address it and they cannot take criticism or admit they are wrong, so they blew up and now i’m a “drama starter”. This is not the only time his family has acted immature and disrespected me and my boyfriend. My boyfriend’s mom AND daughter(16) both have said that i’m lucky i’m pregnant or they would’ve fought me, this led to my boyfriend standing up for me, so his mom kicked him out onto the street with nowhere to go, forcing him to drop out of school so that he can work more hours to find us our own place. His mom even said “I don’t care if you don’t let me around your baby, I have 3 other children who will have kids, I’ll be part of their lives.” 

Anyways, keep in mind that his mom has severe ptsd from car accidents and cannot work due to this and has panic attacks every time she steps outside the house. She doesn’t ever leave. The plan was to have our baby shower at his moms so that she could attend it, but after continuous disrespect and tantrums from her, we decided to have the shower at my best friends house, as she has offered to pay for the whole thing and set it up for us. 

Today, he’s changed his mind. He wants to give her EVEN MORE chances and have the baby shower at her house, he even said “let’s give her until the baby comes to act right and start respecting us”. Absolutelyyyyy notttt. i’m not going to allow her to wake up and change her ways just because the baby is born. 

After I refused to agree to having the shower at her house, he said “Okay then we’ll have a baby shower and your friend’s house and i’ll have a baby shower at her house.” I told him I will not be attending and I asked him what he will tell the guests when the baby (who’s party it is) isn’t even there and he said he will lie and say i’m sick. 😐

I hate her and don’t want her in our lives or near our child, and I refuse to go anywhere near her or her house. Am i in the wrong for that?? Also I’ve never ever been disrespectful to ANY of his family, even after they’ve disrespected me behind my back or to my face. I swallowed my pride and dealt with it, so there’s no excuse for the way i’ve been treated by them. They’re all just absolutely psychotic.",0.8
"AITAH for wanting my roommate to move out due to her spending habits? I (24F) have a roommate Kate (26F) who I've lived with for 2 years. We met in college and were randomly assigned as roommates freshman year. We ended up getting along well and decided to get an apartment together after graduation.  
  
The issue is Kate has a real spending problem. I would not care if it would not concern me too. But it does.  
  
I am not trying to tell her how to spend her money, its her money after all. But she is always late for rent and I have to cover until she can pay...  
  
She's constantly buying new clothes, shoes, makeup and just useless stuff from Amazon. I'll come home and find multiple packages at our door several times a week. Our tiny apartment is overflowing with her purchases.  
  
I sat her down a few months ago and voiced my concern about her excessive spending. Kate admitted she might have a problem and would work on it. But it's only gotten worse. Just last week I saw 3 new pairs of expensive shoes in her closet.  
  
... no I was not snooping around. We borrow clothes from each other all the time without asking the other person...  
  
Yesterday was the last straw. I got hit with a $280 electricity bill when it's usually around $120. When I asked Kate if she knew why it was so high, she said she had started mining cryptocurrency in our apartment with some devices she bought... wtf?  
  
Guess who doesn't have the money ... Kate...  
  
I told Kate this was unacceptable and I wanted her to move out by the end of next month. Now she's furious at me, saying I have no right to ""kick her out"" and she'll leave when the lease is up. She said I'm just jealous of her new belongings.

"AITA for tricking my girlfriend into a JoJo’s reference? For a bit of context, I (24M) and my girlfriend (25F) have been together for roughly 2 years now. I am an avid JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure fan and she cannot stand the series. She doesn’t like the story, the art style, and the writing, i’ve tried to get her to read the mangas/novels as that may be more her taste but she refused. I didn’t mind as I just wanted to share an interest of mine with her, but since she wasn’t up to it I just let her be.

My potential screwup was last night, after we went out to dinner and took some nice pictures for her instagram, she asked me for a song recommendation I saw an opportunity for a little joke. I told her to post the pictures she took to the song “My Funny Valentine” by Frank Sinatra. It’s a really beautiful and romantic song, but that’s not the reason I picked it, I picked it because one of my favourite JoJo’s characters (President Funny Valentine) is named after it and I found it pretty hilarious to trick her in this way. Light and harmless, I thought.

She posted the pictures when we got home and all was good until a few hours later, when a mutual friend who is also a big JoJo’s fan replied to her story (obviously knowing that I was the one to suggest the song and make the reference) said something like “hey, you know what this is a reference to, right?” and when my gf said no, he spilled the beans. Letting her know that I had tricked her into posting a JoJo reference. She was not happy. She asked me if I had really used the song as an excuse to make a refernce to the series and I told her yes, and explained that I was just trying to make a harmless joke. She then accused me of not truly valuing our relationship, and ruining a romantic moment and memory to make a dumb reference. I want to preface that we very rarely argue and whenever we do, we both try to settle it quickly and resolve our issues healthily. However this time was an exception. The argument didn’t end up settling down, and I was made to sleep on the couch last night and today she left earlier and didn’t even say a word to me. I’ve tried messaging her but she hasn’t replied. A few friends have reached out to say that I was a bit of an asshole and should’ve just suggested something sweet and romantic without any alterior motives, and others have told me that she’s overreacting and it was fine to suggest the song. Initially I didn’t really think I did anything wrong but now I’m starting to doubt myself, so am I the asshole?


Update: Around half an hour ago my girlfriend came home from work and we spoke. She said that the photos she took were really cute and she thought that me using the opportunity to reference jojo’s was rude and embarrassing. Although I didn’t intend for it to come across like that, it’s entirely my fault and I take full accountability for it. She’s the most amazing person and I love her more than words can tell, I made her a nice dinner and got her a wine that she likes to try and make up for it, but believe me I will put a whole lot more effort into making up for embarrassing her and to tease her in better ways that we’ll both appreciate. 

And! She looked into JoJo’s a good bit whilst on her break today and she said that she’s actually quite interested (albeit mainly because she find Dio attractive lmao but a win is a win). We’re gonna watch an episode or two later on, and if she enjoys it more than she has in the past then we’ll hopefully watch through it all together! 

I appreciate everyone giving me their opinions and seeing everyone’s view points on the situation, I just wanted to add that me and her banter and tease eachother fairly frequently and I didn’t mean to upset her like this - although I understand why she felt like this!!!

"AITA for continuing to talk my my boyfriend about my friends dog being attacked (we're both 32f) My friend and i have close for over a decade. She lives about 3 hours away. Another import piece of info is that I was attacked by a cane Corso last year and my friends and everyone is very aware that I have a bad fear of dogs. I even literally said it on this occasion to my friend when I was on my way to her city to visit for a couple days

K so we're heading to the dog park. Again, I told my friend I was scared to go but went anyways.
Her small sweetheart of a dog was attacked, one dog had him and a second even tried to join the attack. My friends dog didnt have a scratch THANK GOD. & The owners were right there and grabbed their dogs away immediately.
My friend decides to reveal that her dog is to be neutered next week so that could be why? I wish she had told me before but anyways.
I was shaking for hours and asked to leave. She just took us to another part of the park. I kept envisioning the dog coming at us again but we were good.
Later that evening I'm in the livingroom on the phone with my bf, she's in the kitchen. I started telling my bf about what happened. I felt sick about it. My friend comes fast from the kitchen into the living room doorway and told me to stop telling him the story, that it's going to upset her.
I didn't hear at first, she said it a couple more times so she was talking at me and so was my bf on the phone. I got overwhelmed and yelled ""go away"" or ""leave me alone"". She left the room and gave me the silent treatment. I continued to tell my bf about what happened (I didn't get gory bc there was none) it was like 1.5 minutes of story I think. And I didn't describe anything, I wasn't sitting there being like and the sounds and the teeth and her dog was bring jostled, like I didn't just sit there and go through the gore, I just said her dog was attacked and where and by what then got off the brief phone call
I apologized immensely for saying that rude comment to her but I did not apologize for talking to my boyfriend. I was out of town, It's a small apt. It was winter so I didn't think to go outside and I was very shaken up.

"AITA for calling my dad a “fucking idiot”? This has been eating me up for weeks. For context, my dad and I have a great relationship and i’ve never really spoken to him this way and I did apologize after, which he accepted, but I can’t stop thinking about it and wanted thoughts. 

My partner, who I live with, is disabled and was born with 2 generally non-functional fingers on his left hand and a shorter left arm. This means he can’t operate a lot of common two-handed gadgets, which includes a manual can opener. Due to this we have an automatic, electric can opener where you simply place it on top of the can, turn it on, and it does the work for you. 

One day, my parents were over at our place and I was about to open a can of condensed milk (to make coquito), so I took out our automatic can opener. This is where I will admit I had a petty thought where I wanted to set my dad up to say something ignorant/judgemental, like I assumed he would. My dad isn’t generally bigoted, however, his mindset can be somewhat closed at times, especially towards experiences that don’t apply to him, such as those of women, lgbtq individuals, disabled people, etc. He is also very judgemental in a manner that pisses me off a LOT, especially in my adulthood. He truly believes that his decisions are the only correct ones and everyone else is of subpar intelligence and living a lesser life as a result. Anyways, I placed the can opener on the can and called out to my dad to “check out our cool gadget,” and he reacted exactly like I thought he would. He made a judgey face and said, and I quote, “What kind of LAZY ass shit is that!?” to which I responded, “One of us is disabled, you fucking idiot.” His jaw sort of dropped and he was dead silent. My mom and my partner were also silent. 

I immediately regretted the way it came out, as all I wanted to do was teach him a lesson so he will hopefully think a little deeper in the future before he judges the decisions people make but the “fucking idiot” part definitely slipped out. It came from the deepest pit of my soul. 

I am also very protective of my partner and I felt that the lazy comment was a complete disregard of his disability and his every day struggles that most people will never relate to. I have been with him for 2 years and both my parents are very aware of his disability as we see each other relatively frequently. I have no real way of knowing how my bf felt about this comment, but I realize this may have irked me more than him so I won’t lean on the “I was just protecting my partner” excuse. 

I hugged my dad IMMEDIATELY after, and apologized and he was a little stunned but he accepted. 

Am I the asshole for wanting to teach him this lesson and going a tad too far?",0.88
"AITA for booking a second night at a hotel? My wife (25) and I (26M) have an 11-month-old son. I could do his nighttime routine and get him to bed without issue most nights. When he wakes up, I take care of his needs and he goes back to sleep. When my wife puts him to bed, she stays in there with him and sleeps on the floor. When putting him to bed and when he wakes up in the night she will breastfeed him and they go back to sleep. 

My wife expressed interest in hiring a sleep trainer because this has resulted in some nights being rough. He will cry repeatedly because he sees her and he wants to be breastfed. I’m woken by this as well because I am a light sleeper. The sleep trainer she picked had two plans, one costing $150 and the other costing $500. I agreed to the $150 one.

She gave us a feasible plan. It worked for a week, but then my wife reverted back to her ways and our nights started being bad again. I asked her to just let me start handling bedtime if she can’t detach from him but she said he needed more sleep training. We argued.

The sleep trainer talked her into the $500 plan promising it would work better and my wife paid for it behind my back. I was angry. Well, the $500 plan boiled down to me putting him to bed 4 nights a week by giving him his bath, reading, lying him down, reassuring him, and leaving the room. The same things I was already doing. Then in between on the other nights she was to put him to bed, same routine, except to stay in the room for less and less time and then let him cry it out. At least, she was supposed to.

This didn’t work, so the “sleep trainer” then recommended that I do his bedtime 100% for two weeks. Some nights he does fine, some nights he realizes his mom isn’t coming to him and he cries, then wakes up crying a few times. My wife sleeps through this. I can’t. The last 4 night had been terrible and I had gotten maybe 12 hours of sleep total. On top of that I’m also sick. 

We had it out and I told her that she created this mess by making him dependent on her. I told her I need sleep because I feel *terrible* and she agreed for me to go to a hotel for a night alone. 

She called me twice in the middle of the night so I could talk to the baby and soothe him back to sleep, which isn’t a lot, but enough that I barely slept again. I asked her if she tried letting him cry it out before going to him and she said no.

I went home today but told her I’m taking another night in the hotel because I’m still sleep-deprived. She’s angry with me saying I didn’t talk to her about this and now I’m wasting money. I told her she spent $500 of my money without my permission for a plan that didn’t work and I’m entitled to making a decision without her. She’s saying I’m an AH and I’m abandoning them for a night. I say she’s being dramatic.

"AITA for sending screenshots to my ex's new girlfriend? This happened last weekend and I'm still trying to wrap my head around it. 

My ex (M27) and I (F29) broke up about 8 months ago, he was a complete narcissist, cocaine addict and cheated on me with his current girlfriend.

I've had a really rough time trying to heal from this and I've been doing quite well , lost weight, haven't stopped therapy, and just overall doing much better than when I was in a relationship with him. (He started a relationship with his affair partner right after I broke up with him & still is with her)

So shit came down on Saturday when I went to a party , they were both there but I didn't pay any attention to them, I was just dancing and hanging out with my friends but I did notice they were staring at me constantly. I left like at 3 am and started receiving calls from him (like 5 calls nonstop) then he started messaging me telling to pick up that I'm his baby and that he wanted to make things better with me because he fucked up and bla bla bla, I texted him to leave me alone because I would never forgive him.

Few hours passed by and I was just so angry and still drunk so I decided to text his girlfriend and send her the screenshots he sent, basically, she didn't take it well and told me to fuck off, hours later they started posting how much they love each other (I have them blocked but a friend showed me)

So obviously she didn't believe me or my ex told her that I'm a psycho bitch or something like that.

To be honest I didn't send the screenshots with nice intentions, I wanted her to feel the same way I did and for both to suffer. I thought I would feel good about it but honestly, I just feel like they are just mocking me now and I feel I fucked up and shouldn't have even paid attention to him because that's what he wanted.

"AITA? I (21F) ripped off a part of my mom's (46F) momento from my ex (24M) and she's blaming my current boyfriend (21M) Long read, so I'll include a tl;dr at the end.

I've been with my current boyfriend, Carl for about a year now. I was with my ex, Max for about a year and a half before we broke up. 

I’ve been getting rid of things that remind me of Max. We didn’t have a great relationship, but we would pretend like things were fine in front of my family. Afaik, they don't know anything about his toxicity. He would often keep track of my location, keep tabs on who I hung out with, refuse to let me do certain things, etc. I never expressed this to them because I wanted to keep our issues between ourselves.

After we broke up, he stayed in contact with my family and would talk to them behind my back. I cut off contact with him, but found out he was still texting my mom and hanging out with my brother. I expressed to both Max and my family that I was uncomfortable with this, and that I wanted them to stop.

In contrast, Carl and I have something more substantial and supportive. But there are times where we've fought and my mom has been able to tell we're in a bad mood. But I love him, I'm much happier with him, and I see him as someone I could spend the rest of my life with. Regardless of all the good things Carl has done for my family, including the stuff that I've said he's done for me, my mom still approves of Max more.

Max and I wrote a note to my mom to thank her for making food. I forgot about it until I saw it hanging on the fridge. I expressed to my mom that I was deeply uncomfortable with the note, and that I would prefer if it was tossed out or had his name ripped off. She was hesitant at first, telling me that the note was for her memories, but eventually told me to do whatever I wanted with it. Since she wanted to keep it, I decided tearing off his name would be the better option, and I let the note hang up on the fridge.

Recently, she's found out about it. And she isn't happy. She sent a text to me telling me that nobody should be touching her things and that I only tore off Max's name because I was scared Carl would get jealous. She's started a group chat with me and Carl to ask for an explanation, has told us to ""fuck off,"" and has said that we don't care about her feelings.

I told her what happened, how I was the one that ripped it off after asking her, how I was the one that felt uncomfortable with it up there. And she responded saying that she never said it was okay to do that, and that she doesn't care if I ended it with Max, but that he was still her other son. She's even gone on to say that she doesn't like Carl at all. 

Now, I'm not sure what to do. My mom is upset about the note, Carl is upset about what my mom's said. Was I the asshole for tearing off Max's name from the note? Did I take things too far?

tl;dr: my mom likes my ex more than my current boyfriend, i ripped off my ex's name from a note we wrote to her when we were together, she's upset, she's blaming my current boyfriend and is excessively disapproving of him now",0.05
"AITAH I used my bfs kids name to get my kid out of the label of poopy pants My kid had a sleepover the other night… It was with two of his friends from his class. My kid is 12 and still struggling to remember to wipe his butt. During the sleepover, the kids found a dirty pair of underwear and chased my son around for about 30 minutes Yelling poopy pants. After about 30 minutes, I stepped in and said the underwear belongs to our little cousin… Used a name of my best friends kid.  My best friend lives in a different city, and her kid is not affiliated in anyway with my kids friends… Still, kind of a jerk move to use her name, but it was the first thing that came to mind. Her kid will never meet these other people and I feel like I saved my son from getting the nickname of poopy pants in junior high, she is now extremely mad at me for using her kids name. She also thinks that I shouldn’t of let my kid off the hook for his “choice” tonight wipe his butt. AITAH?!",0.67
"AITA for telling my brother that he should have listened to me. 
I 18m have a brother 17m. He got all his university offers back and 3 rejected him so he only has 2 offers. 

He showed me his ucas form before he sent it off, one of his 5 choices was for a pretty good (and more competitive) university close by all his friends are going to apparently, then the other 4 where for a more average one. 

His GCSEs are horrendous, (6 real GCSEs at C and a distinction BTEC).But he’s really turned things around, and his predicted grades for his A-levels when he sent off his application where AAB. 

Before he sent it away I told him not to apply for the more competitive one because there is a 0% chance they’ll give him an offer because of how poor his GCSEs are no matter his predicted A-levels. 

He told me he may as well try as he’ll probably get all the offers back from the other one. When he told me they rejected 2 of his choices I brought up how he should’ve listened to me. Wasn’t being all “I told you so” or anything just reminding him to listen to other people in the future to avoid disappointment. 

He called me a pretentious cunt and told me to shut the fuck up and told me that I enjoy being an irritating piece of shit.",0.89
"AITA for pushing bf’s hand off my fries ? My bf Ray (27M) and I (28F) went to eat today. He ordered his food and I ordered something from the all you can eat buffet (meaning that I can have it as much as I want). He finished his food and then he started to take some fries from my plate one by one. He took some, then I told him that I want to eat this plate, and the next plate of fries can be his. He didn’t agree with that and he told me that he was not that hungry, just wants to eat a few. But he was  reaching to my plate from  time to time. I wanted to finish the fries and just take extra portions of the chicken so I didn’t want another plate and I didn’t want to share my food. When Ray would reach out to get another fry, I’d push his hand away and tell him that I don’t want to share my fries and we can order another plate. Ray insisted that he just wants a few and he is not hungry. This happened several times, me pushing his hand off (5 times according to him). Then he got mad at me because apparently I treat him like a pet, pushing his hand away. I also got mad, because I think he doesn’t respect my boundaries. He thinks I ruined the dinner, and I think he did. 

So who is TA? 

Btw Ray and I are totally cool now, we laughed it off and decided to share the story and see who is right :)",0.19
"AITA for not wanting to do what my sister wants me to? I recently went through a breakup that was long over due with an alcoholic. I had no where else to go so I had to call up my dad. He gets housing assistance since he’s on SSD. My sister lives with him all her life and the dynamic between them wasn’t always the best. He’s a manipulator and narcissist, which is reason why my mom protected me from him as a child and why I keep my distance from him. So, when I came back my sister immediately gave me conditions. She said that if I want to live here that I have to pay his rent, because she wants her freedom. She said “it’s time we switch places for a year. You’ve already lived your life and now it’s my turn”. In the moment of despair I said ok because I needed to leave my place of residence with my ex. I’ve always been a woman who’s been taken care of by men so I’m used to a certain lifestyle and I believe people are entitled to live how they want to. It’s always worked for me but I made a mistake with my ex. As of yesterday, my dad told me in a very demanding and mean tone that “you need to get a job so you can pay the rent” all the while my sister was standing there staring at me. I knew she was the one that wanted to say it but she has to use our dad as a shield because she doesn’t have the balls to tell me directly because she knows what I’m going to tell her and she’s not going to get what she wants. I didnt say yes or no and changed the subject and proceeded to do something else. She perceived that I was very upset. He doesn’t tell me anything, and when he does it’s because she’s told him to tell me something. I do not feel that I should be responsible for taking care of his rent. She’s done it because she wanted to. No one has forced her to do it. And now she’s asking me to put my life on hold, meaning I can’t find a partner and possibly move with him because it’s going to ruin her plans of moving with her boyfriend in another state. He doesn’t need me or her to pay his rent. Housing would just move him from a 3 bedroom to possibly a 1 or 3 bedroom apartment. But he says that he’s not going to do that. And I’m not going to sacrifice myself for his own benefit. Am I in the wrong? It wasn’t and still isn’t my plan to stay here for the long term. I feel like I’m being guilt tripped i to doing something that I’m not comfortable with just because I’m in a vulnerable position.",0.53

For some context my aunt (48F) had three miscarriages before having my cousin even though her gyno advised her not to try to get pregnant cause of high miscarriage rate. I feel horrible for my aunt having lost three babies before my cousin.the last time she came over I was discussing with my grandma that I wish to have my tubes tied or burnt. 

My aunt heard and said ""oh so *my name* doesn't wanna have kids cause she'll leave them like your mom did you?"" With a look of disgust on her face, she does not believe in woman nor having kids. I told her ""no it's not that I'm just not gonna go getting pregnant all the time with a high miscarriage rate like you did"" I may be the jerk for that cause she left not long after without speaking. 

My cousin called me later and told me I was out of line for what I said. I told him ""so I was out of line but she wasn't for what she said?"" He just called me a b-word and hung up

"AITA for not wanting my brother and his family at my 30th birthday? Backstory: 

My family has a ""golden child"" which has always been my brother because he's the first born male. So anything for him is always perfect and exactly what he wants. 

Me on the other hand, my birthday dinners have never been where I wanted to go (always have to accommodate my mother or she'll bitch about it the whole time) or my grandmother, or my brother. 

When I graduated college, the first in my family to do so, I didn't get to choose the place for ""my"" dinner and when we got there I was told it was combined with mothers day so mom and SIL wouldn't be left out. It took me 8 years to finish that degree because of financial issues. 


End backstory 

My brother and his wife set my nephews birthday party on my birthday. My birthday is February 11 and my nephews birthday is February 12th. 

I get that this year his birthday is on a Monday but why not have it on Saturday? Why my birthday? This isn't the first time that this has been done. They did this last year too.

I told my mother, yesterday, that I dont want them at whatever were doing and for once, just this once, I want something to be about me. She's arguing that since nephews birthday is at noon, I shouldn't be complaining and that I can just split the day with him.

I said no. 

So my mom tried again today and said SIL called her to ask where were going for my birthday and I reiterated that I don't want them there. 

Mom said that she's not telling them that because it'll start and argument and that I just need to let it go and split my 30th with my 8 year old nephew and that it's not a big deal. I told her I was at work and she's not doing this while I'm at work and hung up. 

I sent mom a text saying that ""I won't be having anything for my birthday. I won't be home. I don't want to go to eat. That's my decision.""

So now im wondering if im the AH because I want something to be about me, and I feel like it's just disrespectful towards me.",0.12

So just to clarify, he is really close with his cousin, like a best friend/sibling type of relationship, and often jokes about beating up guys that even look at her and stuff as such. We always laughted it off, seeing it purely as a joke (which we are not sure about right now).  
  
A little bit of a backround here, me and the cousin have feelings for each other, but are not dating at the moment.

He ultimately started telling me to leave his cousin and told me all about me not being enough for her, he called me a bunch of nasty names, mostly about my looks, as well as telling me that if i love her then i have to leave her for someone better. I admit, I'm not on the best side when it comes to looks, but i try to treat everyone with respect and be nice to everyone, and i definitely dont think that i would be the wors partner choice out there, so i was kinda hurt by him saying i should leave her because i dont look good enough to be her girlfriend. We were left kinda shocked and his cousin especially mad, because he was acting very controling of her love life. this also hurt quite a lot considering we were thinking about getting together for real, so this was very discouraging.

"AITA for telling my SIL she sounds like a snob My SIL (let’s call her Sophie), is often the butt of the joke in the family for her pretentious, snobby comments and behaviour. My husbands family are very middle class people, and no one in the family behaves or talks the way she does so everyone finds it amusing that she behaves this way. She is in no way wealthy, has a pretty middle class job and income herself. Her partner is a higher earner, but isn’t rich by any means either.  My own parents are first generation immigrants and immigrated to our country with myself and my brother when we were kids. We were very poor most of my childhood until my parents got on their feet, and are very much working class people. My SIL’s comments have always rubbed me the wrong way but I have never said a word, ignore it and move on. My husband will regularly pokes fun at her though as do her other siblings, cousins etc 

Yesterday she was talking about what food she’d given her 8 month old to eat and said “he is only going to eat artisan sourdough, not disgusting sliced bread from the grocery store like we were fed”. I could not resist and told her that her comments about bread were the height of snobbery and privilege. That she wouldn’t endear herself to other mothers by making such comments. I said there was nothing wrong with sliced bread. She decided to dig in and said sliced bread was bad for you and her child would never eat it.

"AITAH for not wanting to enable the SIL show My partner and I have been together for a little over three years. I was raised that 15 minutes early is late, and to respect other peoples time. She was not. Her family is extremely dysfunctional, especially her older sister, who we’ll call Nicole. Nicole has no concept of time, is a horrible planner, and is constantly running late. Not 5-10 minutes late, hours late, and expects everyone to bow to her needs. Once we had planned to meet up with her when we were in her area, and she showed up so late we only had 5 minutes before we needed to leave. 

Nicole’s husband is a nice guy, but never has any say, even in how they parent their 4 year old son. Their son has no boundaries, stays up until midnight to one am every night, and does what he wants, when he wants. When they come to our house Nicole will give anywhere from a 4 to 6 hour window (there is some travel involved), and we just have to wait twiddling our thumbs. We do what Nicole or her son wants, when they want. If there’s any hesitation her son will have a meltdown. My partner refers to it the Nicole show, and claims she doesn’t like it, but has accepted that in order to see Nicole that she has to put her own feelings and opinions aside, and do what Nicole wants. She’s basically a doormat. After crap that went down this past weekend, I’ve finally had enough of the Nicole show, and how she treats people, especially my partner. I told my partner that it’s rude to expect people to wait around for hours, with no communication (if we reach out, she won’t answer or respond), and expect them to do whatever she wants at the drop of a hat. My partner said I either participate the Nicole show, or don’t participate at all. That I do as she says, or I can leave. I don’t mind staying out of it from time to time, but long term, I’d like there to be an actual solution where everyone feels their needs are met.

"AITA for not wanting my boyfriend to go yo certain frat events? Me (20F) and my boyfriend (20M) have been dating for over three years now, but at the start of this year he moved away for college, so now we are in a long distance relationship. That comes along with its own problems and things have been kind of rocky since he left. He also joined a frat which I was uncomfortable with at first, and I will admit I was being overly paranoid about it, but he was lying to me about it.

I don't know a ton about Greek life but I've done my own research since he started talking about it. When he joined I told him that I would only be ok with it if he didn't go to certain events. Obviously I would have been willing to talk about this more and try to compromise but he was completely okay with it and told me he understood. 

By certain events I mean frat parties and those closed events they do with sororities. Also when he joined I was worried he wouldn't be able to visit it on any weekends since they have their meetings on Sundays, and he told me that it wasn't something to worry about they don't require you to go to anything other than to be somewhat involved. He also told me his reasoning for wanting to join was more so that he got along with the guys in it really well and wanted to be friends with them and go to their game night and poker nights. And that he wasn't interested in joining for the typical frat things and that they weren't your typical frat.

Well fast forward to know and there's a dinner date type of event with a sorority he's going to that he needs to bring a date on. I told him I was really uncomfortable with this and I would not want him to go to something where needs to bring a date. After I said that he started back tracking and told me oh no it's not with a sorority it is only us guys. Am I wrong for feeling uncomfortable with this?

He says I'm being too controlling and I'm just jealous and don't want him to have friends. Of course I want him to have friends and be happy while he's away at school. I know he's having a tough time transitioning and he's stressed out with school. But I don't think that means I need to be ok with some of these things.

For context, I was originally parking in that spot around two years ago, but when my sister first got her car, I was told to work out something with her so I parked on the street in our culdesac since I would have to leave really early in the morning and hanging on to that spot would mean waking her up at around 5:30am-5:40am to move her car as she left way later and got home later than I did.

She did a great job raising me alone after she split up with my dad and we have a great relationship, but because of how attractive she is I was always worried when I introduced boyfriends to her because I was afraid they'd try to get with her instead of me.

Last week I was having lunch with her when she got a call from her boyfriend, who met her at the restaurant we were at to pick her up. To say I was shocked is an understatement. I walked her outside and was met by a man named Cole who was about my age (Mom would later tell me he's 22.) I initially assumed Cole was her boyfriend's son or something but that quickly changed when Mom greeted him with a passionate kiss and they left hand in hand. A few hours later I called Mom and told her the obvious, that Cole was my age and her relationship was just weird and almost predatory.

Our relationship with her isn't so great, she is always making unnecessary comments. I know that she dislikes me a lot, she didn't like me from the first time my (then boyfriend) introduced us together. Then when I got pregnant I was still in school and my boyfriend had just started college. He dropped out and we needed a lot of support from our families to settle down back then. So my SIL thinks that I f*cked up her brother's/ family's life because I didn't get an abortion at the time. She has always been rather hostile, we mostly only see her at family gatherings, she doesn't visit or anything and honestly that's better. She has caused problems before because she says that my husband was the ""golden child"" and she was the ""scapegoat"", and then when I got pregnant their parents basically adopted me and spoiled me because I was with my husband. 

So, she sent invitations for her wedding. She sent my husband his invitation which had his name and our three kids' names, not mine. My hubby asked her about this and she said that I'm not a pleasant person to be around, so I'm not invited. He told her that is extremely disrespectful since I'm his wife, they argued a bit through text and my husband told her to not count on him or the kids because they're not going. 

She blamed it on my hubby being immature. My in-laws tried to mediate between them, she replied to them saying that she's not surprised they're taking our side. They argued and my in-laws said that since she's having this attitude, they're not going either to the wedding. Immediately after she started blaming me. She said that this is all my fault because I could've just accepted that I am not invited and ""allow"" my husband and children to exist without me for a couple hours. She also called me stupid and uneducated, also spoiled, and said I have ""princess syndrome"".

I told this to my husband and his parents, they told some other family members and now apparently a lot of them cancelled their assistance as well. She keeps blaming it all in me. Yes, I didn't tell my husband to go, I admit that, so I think that's why I'm possibly an asshole because I could've prevented such a big drama and I didn't.

I go out and he says, ""I’ve tried therapy, I’ve tried all kinds of things, but I want a divorce."" I’m just like, well that’s not a kind way to tell me. I have an appointment, don’t have time to talk about this, so ok, whatever you want.

  
He'd never stopped seeing her. When I asked him about it a few weeks ago he said, “Oh I tried to break things off with her, but she’s persistent, I like that.” I’m kind of surprised he decided whether or not he to stay married while he was dating someone else. It seems like it would make for a biased decision. Anyway, this is all relevant because I want to make sure my feelings on the below aren't being biased by my hurt feelings and honestly, a little anger.

  
So now, 4 months later, his family has met her, he's met her kids, and he wants our kids (elementary school) to meet her & her kids b/c, “It would be more convenient to see her when he has the kids.""

WIBTA for denying him the opportunity to introduce our kids to someone he loves and is “getting serious” with? I also don't want to be petty but It feels much too soon. I’m thinking the following things should happen before he makes any introductions.

1. Waiting until are actually divorced, or at least legally separated.

2. Waiting until they have been dating for longer than 3 or 4 months, especially since this is his first new relationship in 15 years, I’m thinking 6 to 10 months? 

She’s probably a good person, I just worry about my kids. It would be confusing, esp. since he has the family house - bringing a new partner into our home that I lived in literally less than two months ago might not be the best way for them to process their grief that mom and dad aren’t together anymore. (He insisted on moving back in after he told me he wanted a divorce).

So WIBTA if I said absolutely not? He seems really eager to introduce them, and I’m just flat out uncomfortable with it. Seems like it should be obvious, that doing what’s best for my kids is clear, but idk if my emotions are clouding my judgement  into thinking this wouldn’t be ok when it might be fine. I have a lot of big feelings I'm dealing with. (edited to fix spacing).",0.02
"AITA for not having drinks available at my place? Throwaway since I’m not on Reddit but heard this is a great source for opinions.

I (26F) do not drink anything with caffiene in it. Or high sugar content. I basically only drink water so I don’t develop a caffeine addiction like a lot of my friends have. I know they spend a lot on coffees/teas and that’s not a hole I want to fall into. 

I’m doing pretty well for myself financially as I landed a job immediately after university and was quite frugal during that time. Because of this, I have the biggest place of all my friends as well as no roommates. As a result, I’m the host for get-togethers 90% of the time.

I make it a point not to have tea/coffee/energy drinks etc and that people can bring things they wish to drink. I think it’s a fair thing to ask given me hosting so often. There’s never more than a day where I’m on my own. The issue I have her is with my best friend Alice. She definitely has a caffeine addiction. I’ve never seen her without some kind of coffee/hot drink. She keeps pestering me about keeping some teabags at my place or some iced coffees in the back of the fridge. I love her but I’m very tired of her asking me about it and I snapped once she asked why I’m so weird around caffiene and that she’d be buying the tea/coffees anyway.

It is a huge deal for me. I don’t want anything caffeinated in my house and she knows this. So I told her no and that she and anyone else who has a problem with it is welcome not to come round anymore and they haven’t and are all in agreement with Alice. My place feels a bit empty so I asked her to come over last night and she stood her ground. That it’s okay for her to by food to keep here which she shares with me but I draw the line at caffienated things I won’t drink. AITA here? ",0.6
"AITA for not giving sis-in-law more gas money Ok so I honestly don't know what to do about this situation. Back story: I (37) needed help getting to and from work for about a week. Sis-in-law (35) and her father offered rides. I told both i would give them some gas monies As a thank u. Gave then both $30 each. Sil apparently had a problem with it stating that ""30 will fill my tank but won't fill my dad's, he might be mad"" I never said I would fill either of their tanks. This turned into an argument with here where she called me a lier and to not txt her. I didn't respond cause I think it's a ridiculous argument. 4 days later, my mom (who is across the country) tells me the sil txted her that she's tired of me and I guess wanted my mom to get in the middle of the argument.

"AITA for not making the bed? Throwaway account because I don't want my s/o to see.

Me and my s/o recently moved in together. I am aware that everyone has to make sacrifices and adjustments to their life/lifestyle when sharing a space with someone. My s/o has this ""thing"" (NOTHING to do with trauma, PTSD, past relationships, etc. nothing like that, simply just a preference) that he likes to make the bed every single morning before work. He was just simply raised that way. Me on the other hand, it was never enforced or even an idea for us to make our bed. I would make it if if I felt like it, and my parents had better things to worry about. 

Ever since moving in, he has told me he preferred the bed to be made. I told him that I would do it to the best of my ability to 1. remember to do it 2. make it into a habit. 3. see if i even have time for it. 

\*we have SEVERAL pillows + multiple blankets. this is not just a comforter type of situation\*

After a few weeks of me making the bed on and off (very busy for the week of December due to my job and us being out of town for a few weeks until now), he got upset the bed wasn't being made everyday. I told him that I am trying my best to do so, but sometimes I really do not have the time or remember to make the bed. I also personally believe that there are better things I can do in the morning to benefit us rather than something that is simply a preference. Doing the dishes, clearing the dish rack, cleaning up a bit, will always take priority over something that does not affect our quality of life. He told me that from now on if I don't have time to fully make the bed, then to at least fix the top blanket. I have been doing that more often than not lately, it has just been a rough couple of days for a multitude of reasons.

"WIBTA for not picking my daughter up so she can come visit? My daughter is 21 and lives about 45 minutes from us one way. We bought her her first car; she canceled her insurance because she was driving her roommate's car. Then she drove her car again without insurance and wrecked it. We helped her get a second car; and she chose to abandon it in a parking lot. So now she has no car.

She works weekends and she always wants to come visit on a Monday or Tuesday night (her days off). This means driving to get her AFTER our workday; taking her back to our house where she can visit for maybe like two hours tops; then driving the 45 minutes back to her house to drop her off; then drive back to our house again.

WIBTA if I was like ""You really need to figure out a different ride if you wanna come hang out.""

ETA: She does deal with mental health stuff so I can struggle with guilt that we are coming across as not caring enough to hang out to make the sacrifice or whatever.

ETA again: I came across as though she wants this twice a week. This is something she wants to do about once a month total (but always on either a Monday or a Tuesday.)",0.04
"AITA for getting mad at my friend for being late all the time. Hello, this is my first time posting on reddit so I don't really know what I'm doing. 

So I have a friend who I will be referring to as Linsey. I will also be changing up some details but nothing that will change the story too much. 

Me and Linsey had been friends for awhile now and we didn't share a lot in common. I didn't really see this as a problem as I respect that she has her own interests and I have my own and we still got along fine. 

However she always made fun of me and often belittled me for thing I enjoy. For example I told her I didn't like a certain type of food she liked and she would make fun of me for that which I found ridiculous. 

We would usually met up every once in a while as our schedules didn't aline. For example on my free day she might be working or on her free day I might be visiting my family. 

Thats where the problem comes in. Every time we meet up she is always late. Sometimes I would have to wait hours for her only for her to ditch me. 

She would always give a terrible excuse saying something along the lines of having to feed her dog and that's why she was late for 2 hours. 

I let it go the first couple times as I understand she probably had her own thing going on. 

However after the 10th time in a row I got really feed up with her and the fact that she's always making fun of me. I complained to her about how I'm tired of waiting hours for her and how she's always making fun of me. 

Linsey got really upset about that and yelling at me saying she was ""having breakdowns everyday"" and how I should give her some slack. 

This really annoyed me as I knew she wasn't struggling and I knew for a fact she was not having breakdowns every single day as I'm also friends with her roommate and when asked about it she straight up told me no and that was doing perfectly fine and not having breakdowns. 

Linsey ended up going home early that day and now I'm getting text from her saying that I'm a asshole and other curse word. 

Now that things had cool down I'm starting to feel a little bad but I still feel like I was in the right.

"AITA For Ruining my Father’s Favorite Movie I (m 19) and my father (m 45) were watching Tombstone earlier. Both of us love the movie. My father has always like and and I recently got into it after playing Red Dead Redemption and getting obsessed with the time period. And when I say obsessed I mean it. I’ve watched documentaries, historical overviews, interviews, as well as done outside research on the so called Wild West.
 So while we watched Tombstone together we started talking about different things related to the movie. Things like historical accuracy, gun models, and character motivations. The issue happened when we reached the last topic listed. Why did two of the main characters care so much about each other? 
Knowing what I did about the history and time period I told him that it’s possible that the two characters may be more than friends. He immediately shot down the idea by explaining how there is less modern honor. He told me that friends did things like that back then.
I admittedly got defensive since he rejected my idea so quickly. It didn’t help that my earlier research made me feel like I was right in my assessment, so I went to Google.
Since Tombstones was a movie about real people who existed, historians have studied a lot of the questions my father and I were coming up with. Low and behold, I was right. It was a historical theory that could explain the character’s actions. 
I told my father this and he told me it was probably untrue and to drop the conversation. To prove my source was accurate, I sent him the website I got my info from. After he read my text he glared at me, changed the channel, and said “thanks for ruining this for me”.",0.83
"AITA for telling a coworker how to do their job? I(22F) am 4th year geology major working part time at a boutique jewelry store. I have only been there a few month and am considered junior but I’m making more sales. However if one of the more senior employees are present they normally handle customers coming in. We specifically have an older employee who is against lab grown diamond or gemstones for engagement rings. 

We recently got a new display featuring tanzanite, sapphires and aquamarine that could be used for engagement rings. We also now have some lab grown pink and blue diamonds that are both mounted and loose for customers looking for that. Some customers come specifically come to us to take a look at that because they want to see if they would like a colored stone. 

However this employee always tries to steer them away from those displays and to the “traditional” mined diamonds. I know most customer still prefer those stones however a large part of our customers are younger people (20-30s) and specifically ask for lab grown diamonds and gemstones. She would try to insist to the men (who’s gf’s already expressed wanting a gemstone or lab grown) that they would do better with a mined diamond. The worst is when women come in and ask for a specific gemstone or lab grown and then leave angry that she tried to push them away from what they clearly want. 

We recently had a younger woman come in specifically to look at a lab grown pink diamond on a rose gold setting and she tried to push her to a traditional diamond saying pink was “tacky” and she will probably regret it. The woman left clearly pissed off and wrote a terrible review on Google. I usually mind my own business but I was shocked she managed to piss off a customer like that and pulled her aside and told her that younger people now have different ideas about what a engagement ring should look like and if she tries to force them accept what she thinks is an engagement ring it will alienate our clients. She got mad and basically told me I don’t know what I’m talking about and it’s a fad that will wear off so she is trying to prevent our customers from having regrets. She has told the manager what I said who told me in private that she will talk to her because she obviously is in the wrong but not to discuss anyone’s job performance.",0.55

I told them I didn't have time for this shit, and proceeded to call them a "" nosy bitches"". They lose it, tell me I'm out of line, tell me I'm acting like a "" brat throwing a tantrum"".

"WIBTA if I (23F) replaced my weed with oregano? I (23F) smoke cannabis regularly to deal with severe mental health issues. I also haven't been able to find a job recently, as the field I'm in has a hiring freeze. This means I need to be conservative with how much I spend, and even more conservative of how much cannabis I take until I can get put on proper medication. 

My (24M) brother on the other hand, has a job in construction. He's not struggling, he just chooses to spend all of his money as soon as he gets it. He recently broke up with his girlfriend and has been consistently asking me for weed, since he can't afford it. I've always given him some when I could. 

 This morning, I wake up to find all of it missing. I wouldn't accuse him of anything, but he's the only other one in the house that smokes, and growing up he has been known to lie and steal. I never planned to hide my weed because I didn't think he'd do that *now* at 24, but I wouldn't put it past him. 

There's no other explanation as to how it went missing, and he's still denying it. So I was thinking of getting oregano or something else that would be rather unpleasant to inhale and putting it in my safe box. If he hasn't smoked my weed, he wouldn't need to worry. If he has, he'll learn not to in the future.

"AITA for openly ruining my ex’s reputation? My ex (23M) and I (22F) have been broken up for months now. It wasn’t on good terms but I still tried to be friendly with him.

He doesn’t really have a lot of people in his life, I didn’t want to abandon him and let him ruin his life further.

But yeah, I tried to be friendly with him for the longest time, I never told anyone he cheated on me multiple times. Nor every other shitty thing he’s done to me. I try to act kindly with him and encourage our mutual friends not to think too badly of him. Fast forward to recently that I found out he was twisting the narrative of our break up. Apparently I’m toxic and immature for absolutely no reason and he’s so kind to have stayed with me for as long as he did. Neglecting to mention the fact our relationship went sour because of his lack of basic human decency and cheating.

That pissed me off a lot of course. Now I’m openly telling people how shitty he is. I think I’ve effectively gotten him expelled from the very few friend groups he has and then some.

"AITA for storming of after a banana mishap with my autistic husband? I(31f) am married to ""John'' (38m) for 11y. He's autistic (L1 of support) and I have DID, which means sometimes I forget things and lose track of time (between other stuff). 

We’ve been working together for about a year. My depression is really bad since August, I’ve thougts of taking my life and not much energy. That means he's had an overload of work. I'm doing all that I can, but there's still some of my work he's been doing.

 It's been a lot for him. But also a lot for me, even with medication and therapy. The last couple of weeks have been specially stressful and John’s been understandably overwhelmed. And here comes the banana incident:

He was working at home and I offered to go to the market. I've heard MANY complaints about forgetting something when I do it, even when I make a list, so we have an agreement that I always go through the list with him before living home. Usually we walk around the house together and I take notes.

So when I asked him if he remembered anything that I should bought and he said ""let me check the bananas"" I went to the kitchen and waited for him. He didn't show up, but I know he sometimes focus on doing something in the computer and loses track of time, so I went to our bedroom (close by) and lay down a little, cause I'm always tired (hi depression).

What I forgot is that we have banana trees in our backyard, so when he said about checking how many we had he was talking about those. He’d come to the kitchen later, saw me in the bedroom, called me and since I didn't answer he went back to work. I guess I didn't hear him because of the fan.

So when I called him after a while to check if he was coming to help me with the list he got super mad, said he already checked the bananas and I was laying as always and I shouldn't take his time cause he’s working.

I tried to explain that I didn't hear him and I thought about the bananas inside, not outside and tried to say what I understood from he sentence (let me check the bananas).

That's the part that made me mad, cause he said he never said he would come check the bananas with me and I must have been hallucinating. Listen, I forget a loto of shit cause of my DID but I KNOW WHAT I'VE HEARD. And recently I’ve noticed many times when he acts like he1s never said something I’m sure of.

I angry cried and he tried to talk to me. This part is a abit blurry to me, but ik he wasn’t listening me and I yelled, then went to get the car keys. They weren't where they are supposed to be so I asked him. He said he didn't take it and it must have been me, since he never misplaces them. They were in his backpack tho.

So here I am, wondering if I'm really crazy and I'm this dead weight my husband has to carry or... maybe I have some value and he shouldn't be talking with me this way. Even if he's in the spectrum and stressed because of the workload.

If I'm TA please be kind. Thanks.",0.56
"AITA for denying my sibling monetary support? My mother cannot work and depends upon government assistance.

At the request of our middle brother, and other family members, I reluctantly agreed to pay his living expenses for one month while he looks for a job.

"AITA for letting my female friend paint my nails without asking my gf Also sorry if my spellings bad I have dyslexia and make typos a ton

So this all started 2 days ago when I (23m) went to my friend Marks birthday party,

 without my (24f) gf tara because she didn't want to go

Now me and this particular friend group
 Maria (23f) Josh (24m) mark (22m) and
 Jake (24m) 

Are very close, we all lived together for about 3 years 

Now it's important to note none of us whould ever date each other, I whould rather die

We met at a skate park when I was 13 and it whould be like dating my cousin, not that there bad partners, 

also Maria's gay

Even if she was gay shes just not my type 

I'd also never cheat on my girlfriend I genuinely love her and i want to marry her eventually

I thought Tara knew I'd never do anything like that but I guess I didn't make that clear enough 

So I go to Maria's apartment and it's just her the other guys and Jake's girlfriend 

So we do the normal birthday party things hand out presents, eat cake, ect

About 2 hours in Maria reaches across the table and her nails were looking rough
 (I wouldn't judge people normally but she's my friend so I had to say something)

So I say something like 

Me: what the fuck happened to your nails 

Jake: how could you be so rude (obviously joking)

Maria: fuck you (again joking) I wanna see you
TRY to have painted nails stay looking nice for more then 2 fucking days 

Me: You know I bet I could keep it on for at least 4 without them looking like that

(Gesturing to her nails)

Josh: bro you don't know how hard it is one second they look amazing then the next they look like you fought a angle grinder (he's emo)

Me: it's nail polish bro

Marina: fine if you're going to talk shit I'm grabbing my nail polish

Me: bet 

Jake's gf: I'd back out now just saying 

Me: never 

Now I knew I'd never be able to keep them on that long I work at a rock climbing like place (frits adventures) and they have alot of different metal parts you have to clip and unclip

But there is no way I'd back down after a dare as simple as that

So marina and Jake's gf painted my nails bright pink and purple with hearts

So here's where I fucked up, I forgot to ask my gf if she was OK with it and instead I just assumed since I could wipe it off she'd be OK with it

So anyways I get home and showed them to my gf and she thought it was hilarious, at first then she took a picture and sent them to her friends 

And her friends are now saying it's a huge red flag and that Maria and Jake's gf were hitting on me (which I really don't think they were) 

But now my girlfriend is giving me the silent treatment and when I ask her if she wants me to take them off she just says no and that I deserve to keep them on (I have no idea what that means)

When I get home I often unload the dishwasher and do some cleaning in the kitchen then I start with my hobby. I also do most of the other cleaning in the weekend. We both have a very ""brain"" demanding jobs so we are often very tired after work. And my hobby helps me to relax.

Saturday are for me landery day. I change bedsheets and towels. And washing them and some clothes That will be around 3 loads. 

My partner makes a massive amount of dirty clothes. He use his clothes only one time then he puts it in the laundry basket. That includes, T-shirt, hoodies and pants.

Me in the other hand I use the clothes around a week at the time. (Not undies tho)

So in the end of the week his landery basket is over the brim. I put my landery in an different basket so I can easy wash my clothes that I need for work the next week. 

One day he was packing for a work trip and said that he had no clothes.
 I said that they was in de landery basket.
 He asked me why I didn't wash them the day before. And I said a washed 4 machine yesterday. 2sets if bedsheets, towels and the underwear. And it took all day. (With washing and drying. We have a combo machine).

He looked midly frustrated and was tilted. I said that he can start the laundry when he works at a good time before I get home so when I come home I can just unload it. He didn't answer to that. 

So AITA for not washing my partner masive landery pile, while he works from home and can easily load the machine so it will be finished when I get home?",0.05
"WIBTA if I tell my friend I sent them $50 I “owed” them but don’t actually send the money? Please bring your worst judgement on me because I’m heavily considering doing this.

So the situation, a few months ago I owed my friend $50. Instead of paying them back we agreed I purchase tickets for an event for the both of us. The tickets ended up coming to $55, but whatever I’m not going to fight over $5.

Fast forward to now, they are asking for the $50 I “owed” them. I reminded them that back then we agreed on a comprise for that money. My friend apologized for the “confusion” and told me that they’re short on money so if I send them $50 online, they’ll give me $50 cash for the tickets.

The thing is they’re  planning on going on a trip for months, so I’m not going to see them. I don’t fully trust them to be reliable in paying me back due to past instances. Also now knowing that there’s a risk of not getting money back when you lend, I’m not in the position to afford that risk.

I consider them a good friend but this situation is causing tension. Since they believe I still owe them $50 and I believe we both don’t owe each other anything.

To avoid further argument I’d rather just say I sent it and be fully prepared to make it seem so. Blame it on tech or something and move on from this situation.

WIBTA if I don’t actually send the money and lie to get past this?",0.27
"AITA for not wanting to commit to dinner plans less than 4 weeks before my due date? My husband (M36) and I (F38) are expecting our first child in May.
Ever since we announced the pregnancy, the relationship with my inlaws has been very strained. They have ignored my boundaries several times, but I have been told that it's just because they are very excited and that they mean well. I shouldn't be so hormonal/dramatic and should be more grateful.

Yesterday I saw my inlaws again for the first time since Christmas eve. Normally I would have seen them sooner, but I tested positive for both COVID and the flu a few weeks ago, so I was too sick to leave the house.

Anyway, yesterday we were told (not asked) to keep our schedules free on a date in April, because they want to take us out for dinner to celebrate their wedding anniversary.
This date is about 3 weeks from my due date. Because of medical reasons I have a high risk pregnancy and there is a chance the baby will come early (we have to go to additional scans to monitor this). Immediately after the invitation I said that because of this I do not want make plans for April, but this was of course dismissed.

When we were home I told my husband that I think the inlaws should have asked which date would work for us and that if they insist on keeping the date in April, I will not be attending (of course he can go if he wants).
He said he would talk to his parents, but now I feel like maybe I'm being to harsh? Even though I already know I will not want to go? So aita for asking for an earlier date or if, that's not acceptable, for saying in advance I will not be attending?",0.25
"AITA for telling my sister to take down an Instagram post? So a while back my (23) sister (20) posted a photo on Instagram. I love my sister very much and she's a very pretty girl. This photo was unflattering to say the least. Kinda gave off ""scary man took photo in alley"" vibes. She looked like she hadn't showered in a long time and picked out the last clothes she had at the bottom of her drawer. The clothes did not fit and were torn in areas that clothes should not be torn. The photo was taken in a dark, empty hallway with flash illuminating her face while she squatted on the ground. Like, it was a genuinely scary image to see on Instagram. It was so concerning that several family members (aunts, our other sisters, cousins, second cousins) all called our mom within hours to ask if my sister was okay.

I asked her about it. She giggled and said that she thought she looked really good in the picture. She said ""I almost blocked you because I knew if you and Mommy saw it you'd make a big deal over nothing."" She also told me that she *did* remove our mom as a follower from her Instagram because she didn't want to get any strife from us (for the record, our mom played dumb later that night and got her to re-accept her as a follower).

I pestered my sister to take it down every day. I explained in graphic detail how sketchy the picture made her look and how it was actually terrifying to look at as her big sister because it felt like the kind of picture I'd see on the news if something bad had happened to her. She kept whining that I was being a jerk and asking me why I can't just let her live her life the way she wants to. I understand that I'm often too blunt in the way that I say things, so I always tried to cushion my comments with something like, ""You're so pretty, I have a million flattering photos of you, why don't you post one of those?"" and ""Ooh what if I drive up to visit you and we do a photoshoot on the lake?"" but I'm not sure how it ever came across.

Ultimately she took it down a couple weeks later after an ex-boyfriend of hers commented on the post, ""Sorry, this is what you look like now?"" Which I guess was the final blow she needed. In retrospect she's said that she didn't know what she was thinking when she posted it in the first place, she's grown up a lot over the last few months in particular and I'm very proud of her. I do still feel bad about the way I had asked her to take it down though, because I know I'm kinda of a jerk in the way I say things.

To be clear, this was over a year ago, and my sister and I are on great terms. I'm just curious about other people's opinions on the matter. AITA?",0.98
"AITA for yelling at my mom for wanting us to move in with my ex? I (15F) have an ex-boyfriend Dez (17M). I broke up with Dez a bit less than a year ago because me was too intense for me in many ways. This included alcohol, drugs, and other more personal things. I didn't know this until a little while after I broke up with Dez, but my dad (48M) was dating his mom Sonny (42F). 

It was a little weird but it didn't affect me much until now. My dad told me that he put our house on sale so that we can more in with Sonny and Dez in their house. I told him that I don't feel comfortable moving in with them and don't even feel fully comfortable when I have to be around Dez. My dad said ""too bad so sad"" and I knew he had more to say but I cut him off and yelled at him about it. 

He is really mad at me now and I am grounded but I don't really feel like I did anything wrong? Like I probably shouldn't have yelled but I needed him to understand and he just doesn't or he doesn't care. ",0.25
"AITA for Wanting to End Gift Giving with Nieces and Nephews? My husband’s brother has a large family (four kids) while up until recently, we didn’t have any. For years we were very happy to get the kids birthday and Xmas, many of which I believe were quite generous.  The parents are doing well financially.

Everything changed at our wedding. My husband’s brother (who is the only surviving family member) wasn’t even going to come to the wedding because of his new job. You can see our post history, but basically the kids were in the wedding and the two older kids showed up in workout dresses and running shoes. One of the younger kids also had running shoes. We had wanted the kids to have fun at the wedding, so we did an expensive treasure hunt for the younger kids and bought thank you gifts for the older ones. We also got a cupcake to celebrate one of the kids’ birthday. Then they got us a picture frame as a gift. Meanwhile, we had been extremely generous at their wedding.

After almost ten years giving gifts to the nieces and nephews, we finally have a child of our own. While we bought four presents (which included money for the older kids), they only got one present for our child, leaving me to feel like it was unequal yet again. If none of the wedding stuff had happened, I don’t think I would have cared, but the wedding stuff hurt so badly. 

On top of this, nobody even bothers to thank me, the aunt, and I’m not sure how well they even thank my husband, but that’s just the cherry on top. 

The gift giving is causing a lot of emotional stress and resentment, and I want to be done with all of it to avoid future emotional distress at how it feels like they don’t care. However, my husband thinks that we would be punishing the kids.

"AITA for lambasting my BiL after he left us to take care of his date so he could get lucky with his ex? So, My husband and I joined BiL and friends at a music fest this past weekend. 

&#x200B;

BiL (M34) was ""casually"" dating a young lady (F25) and invited her along to the event, as well as a colleague of his. We had also decided to meet up at his and then take an Uber to said festival. He was very keen on being the host for the night and having us all leave our vehicles behind gates at his.

&#x200B;

Shortly after arriving at the venue, BiL's ex (F30) rocked up and he proceeded to fawn over her and leave his date without even getting her a drink or checking up on her at any point. 

&#x200B;

Both my partner and I as well as our friends started wondering about his actions as the night continued. His date was at least chilling with us and our mates, enjoying the music as best possible. 

&#x200B;

After the last band for the night, I was chilling with a mate when my husband asked me about getting everyone ready to go home. He also mentioned that we would be taking two more people with us, which meant that our Uber would be overloaded. I then learnt that BiL went home with his ex for the night without so much as a ""good-bye"", leaving his keys with my husband.

&#x200B;

So, at least we had space for the extra bodies, but now we also had to get his guests sorted as their vehicles were at BiL's place. 

&#x200B;

I was mortified. 

&#x200B;

His date was looking quite forlorn and my husband told me that he told her the truth. She promptly blocked the BiL's lying ass and is happy to have dodged the bullet. 

&#x200B;

The next day I contacted BiL and he responded saying that we don't have the full context. He denies that he was wrong to treat his date like that, to leave us to take care of his guests without so much as asking. He also says we have no right to get involved in his personal life after he very clearly involved us.

I very directly shared a few pieces of my mind with him. So AITA?

"AITA For politely asking my gf to dress a little less provocatively? My gf and I are in a good, relatively healthy id say relationship, going for around 3-4 months now. We’re very close as we go to college together, so I feel comfortable asking her about closer and more sensitive topics.
But, she sometimes wears really low cut shirts or tank tops out for everyday activities, although I’m not a super trusting person (I’m working on it) I don’t believe she does it to attract other guys. But I see other guys looking at her breasts, which are sometimes quite visible, and it makes me immensely uncomfortable and anxious. I end up wondering why she would wear something like this and if she wants to attract other guys, but that’s just me spiraling in the moment. And, although this might seem a little controversial to some I guess, I feel it’s respectful to your partner to not wear revealing clothes like that in public. I’m not trying to force anything on her or anything but I decided to voice my uncomfortableness to her since this was something that was bothering me. 
She responded with almost reluctance, she wasn’t mad at me, and I’m grateful we can communicate without anger forming. She said it wasn’t a big deal for her and she didn’t see anything wrong with it, but that she would try for me.
However now she keeps wearing clothing of the revealing kind, without really much change. I sorta just feel like my feelings, worries and anxieties were cast out and disregarded, I feel ignored and anxious. Now I don’t really know whether to say something or what to do at all. Outside advice would be appreciated, thanks.",0.89
"AITA for kicking out my MIL even though she meant no harm? My SIL is a vile person. My husband and the rest of his family do not speak to her (or so I thought). 

I was having a very nice day some time ago when a friend suddenly sent me a screenshot. It was a picture of someone on twitter saying horrible things about my children (3 and 5). I was horrified because I don’t put pictures of them on social media. My friend explained that person A that insulted my kids was arguing with person B whose header was a picture of my children. Person A assumed they were person B’s kids and insulted them as a comeback. Friend said she was pretty sure I wasn’t person B because they had some weird things in their bio/tweet history that I would never say/or believe in. 

I informed my husband and we basically freaked out trying to figure out who person B was and why they had a picture of our children. I then remembered that I sent that picture of the kids to my MIL and I even checked our texts to make sure. 

MIL has been staying with us for a week or so, so we waited for her to come home from wherever then my husband explained what happened. She seemed concerned as well until my husband asked if she sent that picture to anyone else. She immediately went red in the face and started avoiding eye contact and everything. She then said she sent it to my SIL. In fact, she’s been sending her several pictures of my children. 

I can’t even lie, I saw red. It made a lot of sense too because after looking through person B’s account, they sounded just like her. MIL apologized and said she was just trying to make her daughter feel less isolated. But I was so incredibly angry. I told my MIL that all I’m hearing from her is utter bullshit and she doesn’t have to worry about her poor daughter being isolated because she can pack up her shit and go live with her. 

MIL immediately started apologizing and said she didn’t think SIL would save the pictures. She swore to never do it again and even deleted the pictures of my children off her phone. I couldn’t bring myself to care. The next day while she was leaving, she said I was being too harsh. I told her to stop talking to me. My husband is completely on board with this but he’s busy with his sister and making sure she changes her twitter header (it did end up being her). 

I can’t explain the amount of rage I still feel but MIL did seem very apologetic. And my FIL, her ex husband, even reached out to me saying that my anger is valid but that I shouldn’t kick her out because I’ve left her in a very tough spot especially since she had 0 bad intentions. I’m afraid my anger is blinding me (and my husband) so I’m just curious. AITA?",0.11
"AITA for making my husband want to be alone in a hotel for a week? My husband (34M) told an online friend (M) that he wanted to leave me (27F), our pets (2 cats), our apartment, and his part-time job (he only works 2 days) for a week to ""get some perspective."" His online friend told him to get a hotel for a week and go no-contact with me during that time. My husband said he couldn't do that because he has to drive me to work (I have a phobia of driving), but he wished that he could. 

This hurt me a lot because it sounded like he doesn't want to be around me or like being around me. He complains that I eat too loud and laugh too loud and does not like to be touched by me for play (like tickling) or sex (which we only have once a year due to his very low sex-drive, which he chooses not to medicate). He will hug me and tell me he loves me and show me memes and play video games with me, but that's all. 

I work full-time, cook and clean when I can, and manage the household. He doesn't really do much to help out. We both have depression, but I try to push through mine so everything doesn't fall apart in our lives. I guess this enables him to do nothing, which I didn't think I minded because I love him and I like taking care of him. 

But when I read what he said to his friend, it made me feel like he doesn't appreciate anything I do, and to be honest, I was really pissed off that he apparently wants some sort of mini-vacation away from his life when I'm the one doing it all for him. If he had said, ""Man, we're both really going through it, I wish we could afford a vacation,"" that is a totally different vibe than wanting to leave me alone so he can be alone... 

I told him that if he wanted to be alone, I can leave, and we can get a divorce. But he told me that's not what he wanted, and that I am treating this ""wish"" of his like a ""thought-crime"" because he ""wouldn't really do it."" He also said this isn't about me or our marriage, that ""everything"" is overwhelming him and he ""needs a break."" 

Like, buddy. Me too. But I would never think of leaving him alone like that, much less complain to a friend that ""I wish I could."" I have voluntarily missed out on a lot of my life, bars and concerts and parties, because I would rather stay home with my husband (he doesn't like to go out due to his social anxiety). He's my best friend, but now I don't even know if he likes me. 

All of my friends want me to leave him (they all dislike him for other reasons), but I don't know if I'm overreacting to this or not. I guess he made a mostly innocuous complaint to a friend, but it felt so selfish and hurt me really badly. I may be the asshole for taking this too personally.

TLDR: My husband told a friend that he wished he could leave everything, including me (his wife), to be alone in a hotel for a week because his life is too overwhelming. I do everything for him while also dealing with my own problems, but now I feel unappreciated and I don't even know if my husband likes me anymore.

"AITAH for an option? My BFF & I have been friends for almost 11 years. We have been through so many complicated romantic relationships together. On her end and on mine. We have always been there for each other. Always voicing our honest opinion about the situation. 

Within the last year she got with a man I did not like at all. However, I was civil and tried to get along with the guy, but she knew I didn't like him. He was a class one gaslighter and narcissist. 

It's important to know she had just given birth to a beautiful little girl (that was not his biological child), however this man was in the child's life for about 9 months. 

The relationship turned abusive and they ended up splitting. We went through many hours going over ""loco parentis"" because she knew I studied law. I did Not give get advice; just what I knew about the law. I advised her to a good lawyer. 

Long story short, she ended up signing documents giving him weekends and shared holidays. 

Of course I did not agree and voiced this but that was just my opinion on the matter. 

She would come over to my house every weekend she didn't have the baby and again I would voice the fact I didn't like him or the agreement; but I wouldn't make our whole visit about that. 

Then one day I get a message saying ""I'm going to do that thing you hate, I'm going to ghost you because I can't deal with the constant negative comments about him"" 

""Do you not want me to be honest to you?"" 

I did apologize but I honestly have a hate for the guy. He's not a good man. He has 6 kids already, all of which he doesn't take care of, and now he's even trying for child support since he doesn't work. 

I did get upset with her for ghosting me. Which lasted 3 weeks. I had honest intentions and just sincerely supportive attentions, this man is not a good guy. Maybe I could have delivered it in a better manner but she doesn't always respond to easy criticism. It has to be blunt. 

However, she is mad at me for being to harsh about the man because she loved him and maybe still does.

"AITA for refusing to let anyone go through my phone? I have been with my partner for 2 and a half years. Sometime last year she was talking about her friend who regularly looks through her boyfriends phone and we both agreed it was an unhealthy thing to do and something neither of us would do.

  
Last weekend my girlfriend said she thinks I've been acting differently and that she wants to look through my phone. I refused and mentioned our previous conversation to her. I tried to get her to talk about how she thinks I've been acting different but she refused. She said she only wants to look through my phone once but I refused again.

  
The thing is, one of my best friends has been going through some things and he has asked me not to tell anyone. I don't want to betray his trust by letting my gf see the messages and also I just see it as an unhealthy thing to do.

  
I told my gf again that I'm not letting her look through my phone but we can talk about why she wants to but she refused and accused me of hiding things from her and said it shouldn't be a problem for her to look through my phone just this once.

"AITA for telling my brother the truth about why I get more opportunities even though he’s smarter My (16f) twin (16m) is way smarter than me but because of how smart he is he grew up thinking that he deserve the all world. He’s cocky and disrespectful to everyone. He think he’s always right and everyone should just give him things.

I’m not as smart as him but I’m also not dumb. I know how to work hard and how to play my cards. I’m always told that I’m very beautiful and have angelic features, so I use it. I’m always kind and respectful, I put on makeup that make my eyes look bigger, give myself natural rosy cheeks, I dress in “appropriate” clothes with lots of pink and bows, my hair is either down or in traditionally kids hairstyles, and I’m a social butterfly, I perfected talking up people and charming them. It makes people underestimate me, but it also make them trust me easily and soften them up when I ask for something. 

My brother never understood that being smart isn’t everything. 

Me and my brother had a test two days ago, but we had a family thing that we couldn’t get out of that is important enough for our parents to be okay with us missing it. I asked the teacher if I could take it a day early and she said yes, when my brother found out he asked her too, but he was rude while doing so, and he’s always rude to that teacher so obviously she told him no.

This isn’t the first time something like this happened, I ask for something and I’m almost always given it, my brother ask and no one goes out of his way to help him.

I guess He snapped this time because he came to me and asked my why that happens. I told him the truth,I explained how he’s rude to people, he’s not a good person and he have no social skills and no one is going to help a person like that, no matter how smart they are.

He got quiet and left. From what I saw He has been trying to be a better person since than but it will take some time.

My parents asked what’s been going on since he’s been acting different and he told them.

While they’re happy that he’s nicer they are mad at me for talking to him like that. I don’t get way, I was nice while explaining everything, it’s not my fault that he needed a wake up call.

"AITA: Did I jeopardize my partner’s cats lives and ruin her vacation? 

I’m watching my partners cars while she is out of town for a few days on a well deserved vacation with her college best friend. I’m in charge of the cats Wednesday to Monday. She left weds morning at 7 and had some friends stop by in the afternoon to check on them. I didn’t arrive to her place until 11pm on Wednesday as I had been out of town too hours away skiing. I wanted to get back sooner but driving in an unfamiliar car in an unfamiliar place at night took longer than I’d expected. Thursday morning I had to return the car and then meet up with a friend to help him out with a project. I was gone all of Thursday, 8:30am to 11pm, leaving the cats alone for 15 hours. Before leaving on Thursday morning I left them a little extra wet food, ample dry food and plenty of water. Played with them a bit before going and hid some treats around the house. I returned at 11pm and all the cats seemed fine and in good spirits. One had vomited a small amount but I suspect that is from overeating. I don’t think it’s good practice to leave the cats for such a long period of time and I feel bad they were alone. My partner is very, very upset and feels like I’ve violated her trust. She’s angry and saying I’ve ruined her trip. I know I should’ve got back sooner but I carved out days to watch them.

"AITA for not wanting to show my brother the ropes on doing furry NSFW comissions? I've (M23) been doing furry NSFW comissions for about 4 years now, and been making some on and off money from that. I still live with my parents so it's in no way something that I do regularily enough to make ends meet, however it is a nice way to cover personal purchases and expenses. My older brother (M33) is a visual artist, and he gets some gigs from time to time and gets his stuff shown in galleries and all that, so I guess you can call him more of an artist than me, as I do what I do it as a part-time/hobby thing more than anything.

I'm not going to say that I don't have any attachment to the community and that I do this out of a merely monetary interest. No, I do like plenty of furry stuff and have my preferences,  and that's pretty much the way I built up a gig and a persona (or rather a fursona, hurr hurr) out of this: first by acquiring a taste for specific niches and artists when I was much younger, then making some art myself, and finally actually comitting to making some money off of that after finding out that is something people do.

Now, where's the problem in all this? Well, my brother is not an accomplished artist (I mean this in purely capitalistic terms, I am in no way belittling his work), so he doesn't live off his art. For a while now he has been pestering me about this, and insisting in a very entitled manner, that I should 'show him the ropes' on how to get money in a similar way. He even puts it as if that I'm somehow selfishly keeping this all to myself and not letting him get any. I always just tell him that I don't really feel like opening up about what I like to draw and get comission work about, first and foremost, and secondly,I just know that he's not into any of this nor he wants to mingle with NSFW-material addicts on the internet in order to cater to a specific niche.

If I decide to humor him and give him a crash course on how I do this stuff (or however I should approach this in the first place), it's just going to be a completely fruitless and incredibly awkward interaction where I only come off as a creep and he just goes ""oh cool"" and never does anything with the knowledge that he'd gain from this. I just feel he's doing this purely out of resentment and nothing else.

PS: I even gifted him a wacom tablet christmas before last (both to compensate for the fact that it is a tablet he bought years ago the one I started with and eventually appropriated, and also to get him to shut the fuck up about all this stuff in a way). But he never used it, I even insisted on visiting him and getting it installed for him (even if it is just downloading a wacom installer ffs) but he was never available so it eventually just fell into nothing. So in my mind this further reinforces the resentment theory I pointed out.

"AITA for being irritated with my parents for taking my car without permission? I was overseas last month and gave my parents my car and house keys in case of an emergency. They asked me if I wanted to leave my car at their house while I was away and I said no. My reason was that I didn’t want them driving my car at their leisure just because I was away, and I suspected that would happen if it was parked on their property. I left my car parked in my apartment block for the duration of my trip. 

When I got back, I noticed that my car was very clean, which wasn’t its state before my trip. I didn’t think much of this until I had a lightbulb moment at my parents house and realised they must have taken it. 

I asked: “Why is my car clean?” 
Mom: “Your dad wanted to be kind and cleaned your car for you while you were away. We also thought it wasn’t good that your car sat in the heat all day.”
Me: “Did you drive it while I was away?”
Mom: “No, dad obviously had to fetch it but he walked to your flat and drove it home.”

At this point I didn’t believe them and made up the next part of the conversation to call their bluff

Me: “Interesting, I noticed the odometer is up 20km since my trip.”
Mom and dad: [loooooooong] pause
Mom: “Well, we fetched person X for dinner on the way home. But that is all”
Me: “so you didn’t drive them home after dinner then?”
Mom: “oh no we did, but that is all.”

At this point I left the conversation and went home. A few days later I picked the conversation up again with my mom.

Me: “I don’t think it’s right that you took my car without asking”
Mom: “Oh my goodness, I can’t believe you even said that. If your dad had to hear how ungrateful you are he would be very upset”
Me: “I am not saying I don’t appreciate the car wash, but generally if you want to take my stuff I’d appreciate it you ask first.”
Mom: “Listen when you were younger you took my car too, remember? Why are we even having this conversation?”
Me: “because it is not right to take someone else’s stuff without asking”
Mom: [very defensively] you know it sounds like you’re asking for petrol or something and I’m sorry but we don’t do that in this family. We treat each other with kindness.
Me: “I am not asking for petrol, I am just saying you should not take my things without asking”
Mom: [bit of attitude, turns to my partner, laughs, and says “ok then”]

"AITA for not wanting to have kids with my boyfriend I (23F) and my boyfriend (30M) met on a game a while ago. He and I spoke for about a week and became really good friends, we then decided to face reveal. We both sent our pictures and I didn’t find him attractive at all and I was completely honest with I told him directly that I didn’t find him attractive. After a few months me and my boyfriend ended up meeting in real life for the first time and we both had a super good time but still I did not feel attracted to him. I love his personality and the conversations we have but I have always made it apparent to him that I don’t think he’s physically the most attractive. I’m currently in university just about to finish this year and my boyfriend and I are planning to permanently live together instead of having him just come and visit for a month or so and then going again. We’ve been talking things like kids and proposal, he’s always wanted kids and I’ve never been completely against the idea. But here’s the problem since I don’t think my boyfriend is physically very attractive I don’t know if I want to have kids with him because I don’t want my kids to get picked on in the future for not being attractive children and is that so wrong? I have been completely transparent with my boyfriend from the start that I’m not attractive and that I don’t consider him physically attractive so I don’t feel like I’ve led him on.

Every time we have a disagreement or an argument he always seems to dig up things I’ve done 1-2 years ago and I honestly always feel really disgusting and shitty for it.

"AITA for not having a long term plan for my mom? Throwaway since my family knows my main account.

So for background, I, 25m just left my stable job to pursue my dreams. I never really made a lot but I had good benefits but now I make less with no benefits. My step sister 35f, works a corporate job and easily makes 4-5x more than I do. My mom 62f (her stepmom who raised her), has had kidney issues for the last couple of years. Back when I had my old job, I paid for her out of pocket to be added to my insurance plan but once her coverage ran out, I quit my job. My mom has been relying on her savings, pension, and family support to get her through. My stepsister’s dad and my mom’s ex is no longer with us.

We are all also in a developing country so healthcare is bad and pay, for the most part, is worse. We also have a fundraiser set up but its not going well.

Now for the current situation:

My stepsister reached out to me after a year of no contact (we have had issues in the past) saying that mom needed financial help. I told her about my situation financially and that I do help with money from time to time but that I couldnt cover her current bill fully. She said I needed to step up and make plans for the future in case she and my family cant help further. I told her I wasnt even sure if I’ll be eating next week cause of how broke I am which is true. She said that regardless, I needed to step up and figure it out. I told her I was already doing my best but she still called me an AH because mom’s current bill was not paid. I held back from saying she just bought her husband a luxury watch that couldve easily covered mom’s bill cause I understand its not her own mom. 

I feel like Im not TA since I’m doing my best to still send despite being deadass broke but aside from her, other family members have reached out to me for not having any plans for my mother in the future.

So reddit… AITA?

Note: I left my job cause it was physically and mentally draining. I waited for my mom to use all the benefit coverage before I quit. The benefit wouldnt have renewed back till November but Id still have to keep paying till then (thats just how the policy works).",0.27
"AITA for disagreeing with my wife relating to her siblings visiting us? Hello all. 

My (28m) wife(27f) and I had a little disagreement this morning and we both thought it might be worthwhile to gain the perspective of this thread. 

My wife and I have been together for 10 years and just married recently and moved out west. It has been absolutely wonderful here and we are incredibly happy. Our current living situation is really great but can be tricky. While we decide if this is where we would like to buy a house and settle down, we are renting the guest house on my parents property. The whole house consists of walking in the front door where you are greeted to one medium sized room that holds the kitchen, bathroom and living room. Upstairs is our bedroom and bathroom.  The house is very open and there are no doors separating the rooms save for the bathroom doors. So any guests we have are smack dab in the middle of the 1st floor.

Now that the scene is set, my wife and I got into a slight disagreement this morning over her brother (11m) and sister (29f) coming to visit in July.  My wife is super close with her family so the move has been tough for her in that aspect. She has been trying to get a date scheduled for them to come out and they have settled on July. Now, July is notoriously hot where we live which likely means we’ll be stuck inside for a good portion of their visit. 

My concern lies in their planned length of stay. My wife and her sister have settled on a 6 day visit. Her sister had said she’d really like to make the flight worth it ($600 each and roughly 6 hour flight) While I can completely understand where they are coming from, I think it would be really hard to have them both in the middle of our living room on a pullout couch for 5 nights. Additional I feel a little overwhelmed by the idea of having to entertain for so long. Her brother and I are really close but he is a VERY energetic 11 year old and I worry I will not get much quiet time or alone time to recharge while they’re here. 

My wife and I both work from home and I don’t know that I’ll be able to get an entire week off which adds an additional layer of stress in the event that I would need to work a few days while they are here. My desk is in the living room as well. I work and game at my desk. I have absolutely no issues with them visiting and think it would be so fun to have them out but my wife is telling me I’m an AH for suggesting they come for a shorter amount of time maybe Wed- Saturday? 

So I need to know and I being insensitive and rude for asking my wife for a compromise in her siblings planned length of stay? 

My parents do leave in the summer so their house is theoretically open for my wife and I to ask if we could say in the guest room for the week. I’m not sure they would even say yes and in the event they did say yes (my parents are pretty protective of their house / space) I don’t love the idea of feeling booted out of my house for 6 days. 

Thanks in advance for the perspective everyone.

"AITA: step-sister has declined my wedding invitation despite us making multiple accommodations for her baby to attend our ""child free"" day I’m (28F) getting married in winter of this year. It’s a small city wedding with c.60 guests. We don't have kids and nor do most of our immediate friends.   
We made the decision early on that our evening reception would be child free for the following reasons;

* it’s just one room (no space for a child friendly area/creche)
* it's not at a hotel so no ability to pop back and forth to a room
* we are having a live rock band
* we want everyone to drink/dance etc without worrying about knocking into little ones
* the room opens out onto a roof terrace and this is a risk to small children running around
* it starts at 7pm so most children at this age would be asleep anyway (?)

We have been up front with guests that it’s adults only and everyone has been understanding.  
We do however have a few close family members who do have children under the age 2 - given the children’s age - we’ve made the following accommodations:

* invited babies to the wedding ceremony and wedding breakfast 
* arranged for a 1 hour break between the wedding meal/breakfast and reception starting so those who need to drop babies off with babysitters won’t miss anything
* shared recommendations of babysitters for those travelling from out of town
* pre-booked affordable hotel rooms nearby in case anyone needs to bring a grandparent or other person with them to babysit
* provided the option to just come for the ceremony/meal and not the reception

We sent out an initial batch of invites this week, including to the daughter (31F) - lets call her L - of my mums partner of 5 years. L had a baby last Easter, so her husband and baby were of course invited too. My mum flagged early on that she didn't think L would want to leave the baby with the baby's other grandparents, even just for one night, so we went out of our way to make all of the above concessions and communicate them when invites went out.

L and I aren’t super close as didn’t grow up together and live 4 hours apart, but they are a big part of my mums life now and we always make an effort to be at their special occasions (Xmas, L's hen weekend, wedding, and baby's christening). 

L has however declined her, her husband, and baby's invitation to my wedding. She did this within hours of the invite arriving, and she has not messaged me to even fein trying to find a work around or send regrets.

I thought we got on well, so I'm pretty hurt she's using the baby as an excuse especially when I contrast to other guests in a similar situation - some travelling from further away without their children, or with much younger babies who will still breastfeeding.

She's already declined my hen too which is one evening away - again organised to be convenient for  mothers in the group.

Am I being an asshole here for expecting a little more effort from her? Should I not expect L to be able to be apart from her 2 year old for a couple of hours?

I don't know how to raise with my mum either as I know she will get defensive and accuse me of not understanding motherhood.",0.56
"AITA for calling my father a looser This is such a stupid story I can't believe I'm even writing this... I (f21) and my family wanted to enjoy a ""family game night"". My mom (f48) prepared snacks and my little brother (m15) was excited because we hadn't spent time together as a family in a few months since I moved to another city to study university. 

We played a variation of charades (I guess, it's a board game well known in my country), where we split into two teams - me + mom and dad (m47) + bro. I was supposed to explain a word to my mom without dad or bro being able to guess what the word is (i hope, this makes sense). I chose to describe the word using references to a Tv show me and my mom watched together so it would be easier for us.

My dad got mad, that he didn't have a chance to guess the answer and started yelling. He just made loud sounds so mum couldn't hear me. We couldn't hear each other, the set time passed and we lost that round. But I was pissed. It seemed like such childish behavior to start screaming when you can't get the answer right.

My dad noticed I was pissed, but said, that he wanted to make a point and that it was just as unfair to use references to things he couldn't know. Mind you, when he describes things to my brother they use technical lingo which they know neither I nor mum can't understand. It turned into a bit of a screaming match, that resulted in me saying, that ""he acted like a loser"". That really pissed him off, he screamed a bunch of curse words at me and stormed out of the house. My mom and bro tried to go find him, but he disappeared for hours. He came back and I tried to apologize to him, saying I didn't mean he is a *loser in life,* that I was just pissed by his acting during the game. He didn't accept my apology and called me an asshole. 

I know I could have handled things differently, but I don't feel like an asshole. The only thing I regret is that I ruined the night for my mom and my little brother.

"WIBTA if I created a fake confession post to test my friends? I (19M) am currently in college. I have made a lot of friends and acquaintances; a few of us go back till high school. I enjoy being around my friends. However, I'd always feel like an outlier; left out and not being wanted around. I'd just brush it off thinking it's just me being paranoid.

My college has recently opened a confession forum. People can post their confessions here while staying anonymous. It has taken off well since, with hundreds of confessions being posted everyday. A lot of these are light-hearted jokes, appreciative notes, or just random doubts. Lately, I've noticed a couple of posts aiming towards a couple of my friends and talking shit about them. Fortunately, some of us, including me defended the friends by fighting back the hate comments. This lead to one of the posts being taken down due to the backlash it received.

While it was nice seeing people coming together to fend off hatred and negativity, it sparked a thought in my head: would they do the same for me if I'm the one being attacked? My name hasn't appeared in the forum yet; but I thought maybe by creating a confession post shaming myself, all my friends will come to my aide and fend off the hate comments. Through this, I can see who really considers me as a friend and whom should I consider cutting off contact with.

I can manage to come up with a shitpost about myself, but I don't want this backfiring on me if my friends find out later that I faked the post for attention. So WIBTA if I put my friendships to the test through this fake confession post?",0.93
"AITA for considering moving out with my son I (25f) have been with my boyfriend(25m) for a little over two years. We haven’t had the smoothest of relationships but I thought we were both working on understanding each other better. Due to past relationships I have troubles with trusting and have many insecurities, I am more of the keep to myself type while my boyfriend has always been a people person and very social. I was told when I was 19 that there was a 95% chance I would never get pregnant. I struggled with that for years but about a month before our 1st year together we got the news we had our son on the way. To say I was happy would be an understatement. I always struggled with the lack of boundaries my boyfriend set with his female friends but always thought I was just overthinking. A few months after we found out I saw messages of him with a few other girls. Nothing major just flirting and it destroyed me, I confronted him and he promised it was all a mistake and would never happen again. A week after our son was born I found messages and nudes pictures from another female talking about her wanting to sneak in our house while I was sleeping. Again I confronted him and he said he never cheated physically and again that he was sorry and promised it would never happen again. I was a week postpartum and didn’t wanna pack up and leave with our newborn even though it felt like my whole world had been shattered. I’ve had issues trusting him since then and honestly have felt like idk how our relationship will go back to normal. I’ve had a hard time trusting him going out without me since then. Our son is now almost 7 months and last night my boyfriend told me his cousin was going to buy him a plane ticket to go see him in California. We live in NY( back story his cousin lived with us before he moved, always had a different female every other day in and out of our house) told him I didn’t want him to go and didn’t like the idea of him being across the country as well as it wasn’t smart with our current money issues, he told me I was being controlling, always keeping tabs on him and stopping him from living his life. After having this fight so many times before( where he makes plans or decisions without considering my feelings or his son) I told him I was done putting my opinions in on his decisions and if his choices led me and his son not to be here when he gets home one day it’s on him.

"WIBTA if I stole a classmate's project idea because I thought I could do it better? I (17f) am In year 12 (junior year of high school) and I go to a school that offers a pretty good range of extracurriculars. Considering I'll be applying to university next year, I understandably want some good extracurriculars along with good grades. In September, our teachers told us about a charity that was offering £500  for a student or a group of students to do a project either an activity or creating something that they wouldn't have the opportunity to do otherwise. A girl suggested that her group do a song and music video. Everyone thought that was a cool idea and wanted to be in her group. I was among those people. Long story short, we got a group of 15 or so people who all wanted to do it, only over the four months, nobody was putting any effort into it. 

Now for some context, I got really into electronic music production and have some software for it. I also think I'm pretty good at it. I can also sing I told the people in the group this, in a group chat that we had, and they basically ignored my and a few other people's efforts to get serious about the project. This went on for four months, and now it's been officially cancelled.

But the thing is, I really liked the idea of making a song and video, and I feel like I could do it a lot quicker and a lot, frankly, better, by myself than with that group.  As far as I know, people at my school can still sign up for the project now by emailing the charity that's running it, and I was considering pitching the same idea for mine, but solo. It wouldn't be plagiarism because we had made nothing but a vague concept about writing a song and making a video, but if I were to repitch the project, I would clearly state who inspired the idea. But I understand why doing that  would still make me the asshole. I would have essentially been taking someone else's idea and making it my own.

But on the other hand , and I probably should have mentioned this earlier, I am very unpopular at my school. I'm new and just joined this year, and I have no friends and people are constantly rude to me for honestly no reason. So kinda like I'm  be nice and do favors to the people who have been  excluding me and frankly ruining my high school experience for months? At the end of the day, I'm not going to know or remember these people when I'm (hopefully) at Oxford.  And I really do think that I could repurpose their idea more productively.",0.13
"AITA for assuming someone speaks Chinese I 17f love studying languages and, in particular, have been studying both Chinese and Korean for 2 and a half years now. I am conversational in both and would consider myself an intermediate student. I’m mentioning this to show that I have a genuine skill and love for these languages. 

A few months ago a woman came into the restaurant I work in (I’m a host) with her grandmother and her boyfriend. She and her grandmother were both visibly Asian and her boyfriend was white. I’m not the type of person to assume someone’s ethnicity because I find that to be very rude but in this instance she was carrying a bag with Chinese characters, I live in an area with almost zero Chinese people and it’s very hard to get anything with Chinese characters on it. Like I usually do, I spoke to them in English and brought them to their table but as I sat them down I asked, “你说中文吗？” which translates to, “Do you speak Chinese?” When she looked confused I pointed to her bag and asked the question again in English. She then said that she was Korean and spoke Korean, which I then said I studied Korean as well (this time in Korean). Both her and her grandmother seemed really happy that I tried to speak to them (even though it was only a sentence) and when they were leaving the girl told me she really enjoyed it. 

I was really happy as well because I’m always trying to practice my language skills and connect with others. I love learning about other cultures and making people feel welcome, and on the occasions I do have full conversations in Chinese or Korean, people who speak those languages seem to love the fact that a foreigner is learning their language. 

I’m saying this because I recently told this story in one of my classes in school and my teacher and classmates (all white) said that it was racist to assume someone’s ethnicity. I of course know that and felt like a total jerk. I love talking to people in other languages and even studied abroad in South Korea this past summer. 

I am white and always try to be open to criticism about internal biases but in this case I feel really stumped. I hate thinking of myself as rude or ignorant and just want some clarification on my actions. I also want to say that I’ve told this story to both Chinese and Korean speakers and they seem to love it, this is the first time anyone has ever had a problem with it and so again I would just like some clarification. Also I’m sorry if I have offended anyone with this post or my actions, I just like talking to people.:)",0.95
"AITA for not letting my brother into the house on my day off I (25f), am living my parents and younger brother(16m) for a while. I work everyday of the week except Thursday, and my brother appears to have decided that he can just conveniently ‘forget’ his key on that particular day, as he knows I’ll be in. Now that’s all fine and well, but whenever I let him in I get berated for taking longer than he likes, as I’m usually gaming as it’s my day off. 
The neighbours have a spare key, which he could ask for as they are always home at that time, and he could just make sure his key is in his bag, but he chooses to ring the doorbell as loudly and obnoxiously as possible, every single time. The other day I’d had enough, so when he started ringing the doorbell, I turned on noise cancelling on my headphones and ignored it. He didn’t give up, but I continued to ignore it, and after 2 hours of ringing the bell, he finally asked the neighbours for the key and let himself in.  
When my parents found out, they called me cruel for just leaving him out there (even though he could get in at any time he wanted) and when I refused to apologise they have stopped talking to me.
Am I the ahole?

Edit: to those of you that are upset that I’m living with my parents, you should be aware that i have just finished a university course, and moved back in because my parents have very busy work schedules themselves. I help out by doing chores such as going grocery shopping, doing washing etc. I also help towards the bills.

"AITA or is this really an issue? I've been in a stable relationship (and probably my healthiest relationship so far) for about 3 years now. 

I'm the kind of person that requires quite a lot of attention, I like being smothered and coddled and I love spending time with my boyfriend. I voluntarily make plans that include him and I balance my life pretty well so that I can ensure no plan of ours gets canceled due to something else.

But the problem arises when he gets swamped or preoccupied by something. He forgets to call or text or talk to me. He definitely picks up a call if I call him but he doesn't take the initiative and every time this happens it makes me feel like if I wasn't there to call him or text him, he would never remember me. 

And just for reference, I can say with confidence that I definitely maintain the same intensity of interaction when I'm busy which is also why I don't understand why he can't do it as well.

There have been instances where we've been unable to meet or talk properly for weeks together which is when he says ""I miss you"" (he doesn't lie to me and say it otherwise so I know that when he says it, he definitely means it).

He told me than when I got back we were going to discuss my weight. I told him there was nothing new to discuss. He argued that my wardrobe issues were a perfect example of a weight issue to discuss.

I've been dating this girl Lucy, who is 21 for a few months. It's been lovely so far, but we couldn't do many things outside of hanging out on daytime dates, because she says her grandma is too strict. She lives with her mom, her dad, grandma, and a little brother, she says her grandma is the ruler of the house and her word is final. I was raised in a family kinda similar, so I understand, but she has an 8:00 PM curfew, most have a, Airtag with her, and she is doing a career has her grandma had chosen for her, which I think, is extreme, but I think is the first world version of the dynamic I had with my family as a child, and I hope someday she can make her grandma relax. 

However, I haven't met her family in person yet, because she doesn't let me go to the door when I pick her up or drop her at her home.

I confess the situation is increasingly frustrating me, so last week when I went to pick her up, I showed up at the door to at least see her family from a close distance. Whom I assume was her mom opened it and said ""Who are you?"" I just said ""I'm OP, I'm here to pick Lucy up"".

She said ""Ok"" and closed the door, I stood at the door for a few minutes, and then I've heard arguing inside the house. I could her Lucy's voice but couldn't really understand what they were talking about, and then a man, I assume her dad, came out saying ""Sorry, please leave, is not a good time"" and I left.

The next day Lucy called me, she apologized, but said she was mad at me for showing up at the door. Her mom told her grandma that there was a ""Mexican at the door"" then they questioned Lucy who was it, and then they started to argue about ""dangerous mexicans"" I reminded her that I was Venezuelan but she said that they don't care about that, then I said that is very obviously racist and said that is just how her grandma was raised and nobody can argue with her, now her grandma told her to cut contact with her so it will be more difficult to go on dates.

I asked some american friends and they tell me that her family is a lost cause, and some latino friends of mine told me to ""get used to it"" because that is just how some people are, and that I should have seen it coming.

During this time, I made a few friends and we talked for three hours, mostly listening to one of the girls talk about her boyfriend. As the power came on, we all decided to swap numbers before going our separate ways, a kind of support group for any building-related issues. The next day, I found the one guy in our group messaged me to say it was nice to meet me and he was happy to have a friend in the building. He then proceeded to say we should do something sometime. I'm usually wary of guys around me, but because he mentioned wanting to just be friends, I figured it was okay. I said it was nice to meet him too, and I would be happy to do something. I messaged my ex to let him know of the interaction, and he began blaming me, saying I was naive, that I allow guys to hit on me by being too friendly, that I'm trying to be friends with guys. Mind you, I've not had a male friend in over two years. The last male friend I had was his current best friend, who had tried to hit on me in the past and while we were together, and so I stopped being his friend, yet my ex still considers him a best friend. I told my ex I didn't appreciate how he was blaming me and that I checked with him for a reason, to see if he felt uncomfortable. He apologized, but then told me it was a fake apology and he didn't think he was blaming me. He then followed up by saying I do this all the time, like on Monday when a guy I work with (who is in a relationship and whose girlfriend I am friends with) messaged me to joke about an issue we were having at work, and we discussed it over text. When I told my boyfriend about it, he was fuming that I entertained the exchange and that I can work with him without being his friend. This coworker had mentioned he was excited to go on a business-trip together in the past, which I understand is weird, but I do not go out of my way to talk to him nor do I initiate conversations. I just try not to be mean because we work together.

All this to say, I'm having trouble understanding why he is so upset with me. AITA for thinking the friend I met during the power outage was just wanting to be friends, and agreeing to doing something together? ",0.16

I stay at his place 2-3 times a week. We've been sleeping together the entire time. Recently we've become very lovely dovey. Tonight after we had sex, I see he's gotten a tinder notification on his phone and a few snapchats from girls. I immediately felt betrayed. But should I? We haven't even had a discussion about where we are at, what we are doing. I felt more upset that he didn't care to stop talking to these people, like I'm not good enough.

"AITA for telling my sister to be less talkative? 
My (16M) sister (17F) is a really really talkative person. It’s so exhausting to have a conversation with her because she asks about every little thing and if she is talking about something it takes her so long to stop doing so. My dad is also that type and my mom is calmer than either for them but for some reason she likes talking to my sister.

Like my sister is the kind of person that asks mom every single day about her day, my mom is a teacher so my sister asks her about other teachers or students and like remembers small details and asks about them too so the conversation practically never ends. And when my sister and dad talk it’s definitely the worst part especially if they do it over dinner / a long car ride where peace and quiet is needed.

And not only does she talk so much but she also texts way too much too, she splits her sentences in like 4-5 words or whatever so it takes forever to get what she’s talking about. But thankfully I found a solution to that and have been blocking her whenever she sends 5 messages in a row (which is wayy too often). Of course her ego couldn’t take it and she told my mom who told me I should treat her better. I told her that I don’t mistreat her but I also should not be constantly hearing her ramble everyday whether it’s messages or just regular conversation.

My mom told me that soon enough I won’t see her when she goes off to college and regret things but I don’t know really. I’ve never seen anyone so bubbly and it’s just exhausting. AITA? I do tell my sister to tone it down when she talks to me but then she looks hurt and doesn’t talk to me for a few days which makes dad / mom ask me to apologize and I forget to and she forgets it eventually but I really want a break.",0.93

A few years ago I 27f had a nasty work incident that ended up with me having a lot of small burn scars all over my face/hands,, tbh it’s not something I’m insecure about bc I don’t pay much attention towards how I look etc but it was physically painful obv and kinda scary 


Either way I survived and got a fat check from the company lmao but there’s a nasty coworker Leila 29f who had a tendency to make a few nasty comments about how I look now every now and than, like she’d say stuff like “oh you need a high coverage concealer now” even knowing I’m not into makeup 


Luckily she went on maternity leave and I didn’t need to deal with her bs for a while, also important mention she was super pretty and took great pride in her appearance meanwhile I’m sorta average I guess?


Either way she returned and turns out she gained weight and oh man it’s alot, 200 pounds or so bc she literally went from supermodel level of hot to something straight outta my 600 pound life


Here’s where I might of been ta bc as I saw her enter the office I said “wow you need a car cover now for like a suburban or something” referring to her new clothes size and obviously she was upset like super upset bc she started crying and reported me to our manager 


Manager knew she used to come at me back than but she still said I could of been the bigger person

"AITAH petty gift giving   I’ve been married to my husband almost 9 years. With him 10. Every single year on Valentine’s Day, Christmas, my birthday and Mother’s Day or our anniversary he eaither “forgets” to get me a present or he gets me something with the least amount of effort. 
  One year he bought me an umbrella and a cat nip t-shirt. We didn’t even have a cat. He bought them at work at a home show. He’s bought me some good presents but most of them don’t fit me or they are pajamas. I usually put a lot of thought into his gifts, also I usually put a lot of research into them if I’m getting them online. 
  The only presents I’ve gotten that I’ve cherished is a dress he bought me two valentines days ago. A necklace, Bracelet and my engagement ring. It’s not like he didn’t have any ideas, I’m telling him all the time different ideas and showing him stuff that I like and telling him stuff that I need and he just completely ignores it. I told him I needed leggings this Christmas and he bought me a robe that didn’t even fit me I’m an XXL and he bought me a small claims that the hanger said XL. 
  We have been really broke since Covid and have been struggling so I’ve been understanding but still every time we didn’t have much money I would take our food stamp card to the store and buy all his favorite snacks, drinks and candies AND I also buy ingredients for one of his favorite dinners or a fancy meal. I don’t even get that amount of effort when we are broke. 
  He does sometimes make me breakfast in bed for Mother’s Day or my birthday. I just feel like he could be doing more and putting in more effort. In the past couple years I just haven’t wanted to put in any more effort. I still make him fancy meals but he pretty much gets that every night. I don’t want to write him any more sappy cards, I just don’t want to try anymore. 
  I was never giving him gifts to get one in return, I’ve always done it to show him how much I love and care about him. I feel like I’m just being petty to show him how it feels when he doesn’t put in any time, effort or thought into my gifts. AITAH? Am I just being a brat?

I even overheard her once with her friend repeating something her teacher said and her friend then laughed and told her that that is not what they said at all. And my sister would just laugh and say wow but he just said that I don’t know how I forgot.

It’s getting really annoying cause it just seems like a lot of attention seeking at this point. I ask her things sometimes and she answers me completely wrong answers and then swears she forgot the right ones (like about our family/ school etc).

I’m fairly independent from my family. I came from a lower middle class family but didn’t need for much. I’m fairly close with everyone and have a healthy relationship with my parents. My fiancé is very close with her family. She grew up upper middle class and her parents own businesses. She talks to them daily and we see them at least once a month if not more. 

Her family likes to party and have a good time. At first, I fit right in. I enjoy my fair share of fun, but have worked hard to get where I am. I’ve made mistakes along the way but make an above average salary in a job I enjoy. My fiancé has worked hard too and is making almost double my salary in a prestigious field.

As time has gone on, her parents have offered less friendly conversations, and have been more inclined to offer opinions on what we should be doing with our lives, how we should be spending money, etc. My fiancé’s parents make a lot of situations about themselves and most of their advice is backhanded, like saying we should buy a house like they did, even though conditions are very different. 

My fiancee relies on their advice over our own, and most of our major decisions are ran through them. I feel like we need to make decisions for ourselves without their influence. Their advice comes from a place of selfishness when we need to do what’s best for my fiancé and I.

"AITA for being frustrated with my bf when he prioritized league of legends when I was upset? I'm 24, by bf is 26.

He just got back into playing league recently. 

I was helping his sister cut her dog's nails and I accidentally cut his paw pad. I'm really upset about it, everyone else is saying he's fine and he's walking just fine, but I still *hurt a dog* and that's so upsetting to me. I was just trying to help him but he's squirmy with nail cuttings. I don't own dogs myself so I guess I really wasn't doing it right, but hindsight is 20/20.

I wanted comfort from my bf, I wanted him to come check on the dog, and I wanted him to make sure that his sister was doing okay too. But he just kept playing league, and it was upsetting me even more than I already was for hurting an animal, and it made me frustrated. Not shouting or anything, but he just seemed so much to me like that asshole bf league of legends player in that moment.

He's frustrated with me because I called him an asshole and said that he was being a bad bf. But I was so upset I just saw him as that sorta league player in that moment. 

He eventually came to talk to me when I was crying and he quit his game, but he was just really talking down to me. 

He was saying that right now league is the only thing that gives him comfort, and I understand in some way the ramifications of quitting a game, though I don't think I fully understand the consequences of it.

I just really wanted him to instead drop the game when I first went to him upset and crying and asking for him to help me, the dog, his sister. I really wish I'd been a priority in this moment. He's been staying up for days at a time, sleeping 3-5 hours a night for the past couple weeks playing league, it's not like I'm really asking for much just to have one single moment of comfort.  

The dog *is* fine. I'm hoping he'll be fine, but everyone else is saying he's fine. The dog isn't bleeding anymore, he's not limping, but god I feel like shit for hurting a dog. I was just trying to help and I cut him. My bf said that he thinks I'm so frustrated with him because *I* feel bad, but the dog is fine, so he's not worried and he doesn't think I should worry. But I'm the one who hurt the poor thing in the first place and that really hurts my heart a lot. 

I will admit that I get frustrated at him sometimes too if he needs help or comfort, sometimes things just don't seem like such a big deal to me. I try though. I do try. It's just that I don't want to feel like I'm less important than a fucking video game right now. I'm really upset so maybe I'm too emotional to think rationally about this, maybe I was an asshole for calling him an asshole and saying he's being a bad bf. Maybe I fucked up, I really want to know if I'm actually wrong here. I'm just so emotional, I feel like complete shit for hurting the dog and he says I'm taking it out on him, maybe I am.",0.93
"WIBTA if I refuse to pay parent plus loans after coming out as gay? Am I morally obligated to pay parent plus loans? I had to take out direct student loans for myself (\~20K). 6 months after I graduated, my mom informed me that there was an additional 20K in parent plus loans, I had no idea about but had to pay. I was devastated. My mom agreed to pay interest only until I had the 20K in my name paid off. I am now debt free on paper but still have this issue of the parent plus loan. Here's the thing, I have 2 sibilings who are married and each received help paying for their wedding (approx. 10K). I am nearly 30 at this point and gay. I will never receive money for marriage because they do not agree that gay marriage is moral. I clearly disagree. I have never been happier since I recently came out. I strongly feel being gay is not a choice and is morally okay. All of this would be irrelevant except that I have asked this money that they have always committed to my wedding up until recently to be reallocated to these parent plus loans was told no. Their reasoning is that a wedding is a fun family activity they can participate in. So that combined with the fact that I had no idea about these loans when they were signed up for, the loans are not in my name and I know they have the ability to pay them off immediately, makes me feel like I am no longer obligated. Or at a minimum, I would be okay to pay everything down to 10K and they can cover the remainder. However, my struggle is that I do recognize this was to pay for my education and I do have a well paying career right now because of my degree. While it would be financially tough for awhile, I would be able to pay it off.",0.33
"AITA for demanding the money for my cancelled holiday from my mum? A little context for this: i (31 F) and my twins (5 F) escaped an abusive marriage 3 years ago and had to start completely from scratch. We had nothing but the clothes on our backs and were homeless when we left my ex husband and now we have a full and happy life after such hard work, we get by ok but money is tight sometimes. I often go without by my daughters NEVER go without anything. EVER. My only support has been my mum and my best friend but i have never asked them for anything to get by. I managed to save some money and decided a holiday would be a great treat for me and my bff. I spoke with my mum at length to see if it was realistic and she encouraged me to book the trip of a lifetime to thailand for 10 days! she and my step-dad would take care of the kids. I booked it with my friend a month later making sure my mum was kept up to date on all details and was comfortable with plans... she assured me she was. Its important to note that my mum has MS. She works full time and is very much able-bodied but can feel the effects of the disease when she catches so much as a cold. 

Roll on to now and we are supposed to fly in April. This week mum has been poorly and acted out of character which is understandable... however I get a call from my mum this morning, telling me she cannot look after the kids for my trip and thinks that my ""priorities are complete shit for booking in the first place"" 😑 the holiday is paid off and i wont see the money again. My friend has no one to replace me with so she'll lose her money too. I didn't respond to my mum other than to say ""i understand you're upset, ill have a think and call you later to talk properly""  since then she has been dodging my calls and texts. I cannot in good faith leave my children with her now and fly off to another country so ive cancelled the holiday and will repay my friend what she has lost. We are completely GUTTED but it is what it is. 

The family have all told me i need to cut my losses as its my fault for booking in the first place and ""single mothers dont get to do things like that"" i havent demanded the money yet but i want to. Would it make me the A-Hole if i did? Or should i let go and accept losing more than £1000?

"WIBTA For Making My Kids Give Up Their Seats To My Parents? My husband and I have been debating this for a while so I made a burner account to ask here.

&#x200B;

We (37f and 38m) have 3 kids (8m, 6f, 3f). My parents have also been staying with us for about 3 months so far.

&#x200B;

This post is about something that happened yesterday. My son was sitting on the couch in the living room, watching TV, when my mom and I came downstairs to the living room. My mom wanted to sit where my son was sitting, so she told him to move. Where I am from, it is not seen as weird for kids to move so people older than them can sit. My son told her that he could sit over ""there"" (The couch is sectional, and my son was sitting on the long part for laying down, and he told my mom to sit next to him or on the middle part). My mom said ""Ah-ah, make this boy move"" to which I told him to move, and he listened. He went to his room, and my mom kind of scolded me about how I'm raising improper children who aren't taught to respect those older than them. I just sat there and considered everything she said, and I kind of agreed with her, but I talked to my husband about it. 

&#x200B;

He said that my son shouldn't have had to move from where he was sitting first, especially in his own house (My husband likes to call our house as in me and his, our kids' houses too because they live here, I think its dumb though) and that he didn't spend money on a big couch for problems like this to be arising.

"AITA for sending a text at 2am? To start most days I’m pretty busy. Monday-Thursday, I usually wake up around 6am and don’t get home until 10pm or later. During this time I don’t really use my phone to text because I know I can’t keep up a conversation. Even my mom isn’t getting a response if it’s not an emergency.

But I don’t have to wake up early on Fridays so Thursday night/ Friday morning I usually stay up later until like 5/6am. I was going through deleting old text and responding to people on apps and noticed there was a text from the previous week where this girl was supposed to text me Thursday to confirm if she was free for Friday. 

So at 2am I just shot a text seeing if she was still free for Friday because when she wakes up I’ll be sleep. When I wake up I assume she’ll be at work. When she’s off work I’ll be at work. And by the time I’m off I’ll know whether we’re still hanging out.

So as expected she responds at 8am telling me what she did. I wake up at 12 and respond. A little bit later she responds saying she doesn’t want to speak to me because I texted at 2am

To me it seems like a ridiculous thing to be mad at. It’s a text and it’s literally made to have asynchronous conversations. It’s not like I called and woke her up so I don’t see the issue",0.04
"AITA for threatening to show CPS my mom and her boyfriends discipline methods for my nephew? 

For some context, we recently acquired my sisters kid (M 3), she’s an addict who did some really horrible things to him and so did some men which is important to add for clarity on his trauma. 

My mother (45) and her boyfriend (21) had plans of fostering him till she gained kinship/guardianship to find him a proper home. 
Her boyfriend, lets call him Sam, apparently has some qualifications in childcare but isn’t employed in that field, he just works for his dads cleaning company but says he couldn’t do it because the system was too mentally draining for him after he apparently got in trouble for buying a kid a tablet. 

In my opinion my mother nor this house is suited to raise or foster a child, she has episodes of alcoholism and she’s unemployed. She has her own business making products but hasn’t made anything in over a month and without making this super biased, has shown a lot of manipulative and narcissistic traits while she raised me and my three sisters (24-27)

This morning I heard a bunch of ruckus, normally my nephew does have some out bursts during the day but this time I heard Sam yelling and a loud thud then more yelling. I went down to see him pinning this three year old under him on the couch as discipline for flipping a table, this guy is about 6ft and probably 200-230lbs so it’s honestly a scary visual. I’ve seen this happen before and aired my issues with it but was met with “you don’t know nothing, he has a degree” type of arguments from my mother. They also said it was done when he was posing a danger to himself but idk, flipping a table seems like a lot but not worth a grown man screaming and pinning a child under his body. 

My mother and I got into a huge argument, I told her she was not fit to raise my nephew nor should she be taking this 21 year olds word as gospel and even those with degrees can be bad at their job and the fact that he isn’t working in the field should say something. I told her next time I seen that I’d record it and see what our social worker thought of it, the one granting her kinship vs finding an actual foster, and she’s kicking me out but that’s beside the point.

I care for my nephew, he’s been through hell because of my sister and I just can’t stand the visual but I’m not sure if I’m just being sensitive due to my own issues from my father. They say he’d be worse off in the system but honestly I’m not sure if here is any better.

All of them ( including the dad) are incredibly low functioning autistic. I am a full time student and my boyfriend is the only person who works in the household. It has been insisted upon several times (by the dad) that we are not a family but roommates. My boyfriend and I have a grocery budget of 400 dollars a month (200 each). This money is the MOST we can spend on food,as we are trying to save up to move out. No one else in the house ever buys groceries and is in the constant habit of stealing our food. The dad has claimed he is willing to buy “communal essentials” (milk,eggs,ect.) but it happens less than every three months. I am the only person who cooks in the house and have just gotten into the habit of making double what we (me and my boyfriend) need because inevitably the kitchen will be swarmed at the smell of any food. I don’t want them to starve because they are in effect my in-laws, but i also just straight up cannot afford to feed them all and there is NO give and take. Everytime I try to confront someone about eating something they did not pay for I usually get the “wasn’t me” run around.

Currently Speech season is started up and our first tournement is this saturday. Each tournement is on a Saturday. My dad (35) works on Saturdays, which is an issue because not only do I need transport to speech, but have a little half sister (7). 
He started working Saturdays over the summer when he got promoted to Morning Manager. When he told me his new hours, I told him that once speech began again he would need Saturdays off to get me there and watch my half sister.
Today I asked my dad if he could change his hours/off days so he could bring me to speech and not put all the responibility on my half sisters mother (36).
 She has been an imense help to me when it comes to getting me to speech and other extracurriculars on time, and though I think of her as a second mom she is not related to me in any way. My dad has many times shoved responibility of getting me to extracurriculars he approved of.
When I asked him, he said he can't do that. When asked why he told me his off days wouldn't be consecutive. I failed to see the issue there because his hours are typically 4 am to 1-2 pm, meaning there is no conflict with anyone elses schedule. When I reminded him I told him this would happen months ago, he told me that disn't matter and he could not make it work. When I pushed more he said I could either accept the truth or he could tell me what I wanted to hear. When I asked if he could try he responded by saying he could make it work, but with sass and attiude indicating he was lying.

My mother and I never really got along, but I wouldn’t say that I hated her or anything like that. As a kid and in my teen years we always fought, it would be about the tiniest things, and all she would do is make it about herself, tell me things like, I’m was a  bad daughter because I always blame everything on her or she’s was  just a terrible mother since I hate my life so much. Things like that, but I moved out at 19 and we’ve slowly begun to build our relationship back these past couple years.   
  
Now, my fiancé Sebastian and I have been together for around 6 years and we are planning to get married in April. When I first got with Sebastian I didn’t introduce him to my mother right away, because at the time me and her weren’t really close enough for me to feel comfortable with her meeting Sebastian. But after about a year or so after we started dating I finally introduced him to my mom. After the first time meeting him my mom said that she loved Sebastian and that she thought that he was perfect for me. At this point I was so happy that my life was finally calming down, I was dating someone fantastic, I was beginning to rebuild a relationship with my mom after all those years, I had a great apartment and my cats. I was just happy. However, 2 years ago at Christmas I announced the pregnancy of my daughter (who is now 1 and I won’t be saying her name for privacy reasons), and my mom raised hell. She screamed at me in front of my family and Sebastian, telling me that I was a  whore and how impure I was because I didn’t wait till marriage. I ended up leaving her house in tears and cutting all contact with her. I haven’t talked to her since and she has never met my daughter.   
  
Fast forward a couple of weeks ago, we sent out our wedding invitations back in September, and apparently my aunt who had gotten an invitation had told my mom about the wedding. So eventually I get a call from her and she’s talking casually and stuff, and then she asks me when my wedding is and how excited she was to meet my daughter.  I didn’t know what to say. I was just dumbfounded, but I ended up telling her that she was not invited to my wedding and there was no way in hell I would let her come near my child after the way she acted.. And again just like she used to do, it was yelling and all the name calling, I just hung up after a while. It’s been a few weeks since the call and my mom continued to text and call me, she even tried to get my aunt to talk to me about it. Sebastian says that he also doesn’t want her at my wedding, but most of my mom’s side of the family said that if my mom can’t go they won’t go. So now I'm conflicted. Do I try to reason with my mother and let her come or should I stand my ground? I'm honestly just lost. I could really use some advice.

"AITA for leaving and telling my friend to enjoy his party? My friend turned 34 over the last weekend, and had a lowkey celebration on Saturday at a restaurant. There were only 15 people, and he told us the “real party” would take place in his apartment later. 

Thing is, from the start I told him I wouldn’t stay very late, because my son (5) stayed awake and with my grandma taking care of him. I’ve know my friend for almost 10 years now, for some reason I assumed it would go unsaid why i had to go back home before midnight.

Anyway, when the restaurant closed only 5 including me would stay for the “after party” but I was already thinking about my son and how late it was. So during the walk to my friends apartment, I spotted a bus -probably the last- to take me straight home and made my decision. I only had time to hug goodbye the other friend who was directly beside me, birthday boy was lagging way behind. I jumped on the bus and waved at him when it passed. On my way home I texted “Enjoy your party”

He said, “wdym enjoy your party” and we had a weird argument over text. When I got home I tended to my son, put him to sleep so I had to ignore my phone for a while but when I picked up there were strings of calls and texts of my friend asking why i left him and generally being very upset.

Now i’m getting a cold shoulder, i cannot fathom why. To me it feels like the key and peele texting skit, AITA?",0.83
"AITA for firing the pool guy for bringing his dog over I was at work the other day and saw I had motion in the backyard.  Checked it and saw that the pool guy was over.  What kind of pissed me off is that he brought his dog.  I watched the dog take a deuce on my pool deck.He did clean it up.  I don't have grass in my backyard, even then I wouldn't have been okay with that.    He previously brought the dog, and I told him to not do that before.  So this is the 2nd time.  

  
We are not really a dog friendly household, wife is severely allergic and I don't like them.  I did not appreciate that he did not get my okay before hand.

"AITA for telling or not telling my friend that none of us want her husband OR child? Amanda has been part of my wider social circle for a while, and though she's a friend, I've never been that close to her. At this point the majority of my friends are single, childfree people in their mid-30s to 40's who are living that lifestyle because they prefer it and are extremely happy with their lives.   


Amanda was living the same lifestyle, but then married a somewhat younger guy, Todd, and quickly had a baby. Amanda is one of those people who is nice but hopelessly self-centered with a 1 topic mind. So for the first few years with Todd, her ONLY topic of conversation was her epic romance with Todd and how unique it is. Since they had their son, her ONLY topic of conversation has been her son and how unique he is. That's just how Amanda is. There's no way to relate or talk to her unless you're willing to just listen to her talk about her son (now three years old). She takes zero interest in anyone else or what's important to them. Before Todd and her son, her 1 topic she only talked about was her health issues.   


Since nobody had heard about her health issues in a while, we didn't know they had gotten worse. There are some scary new developments and it's not clear how treatable it's going to be. She is in the hospital. We found out about this because Amanda suddenly added a bunch of women from our social circle to a chat group that she called ""The A Team.""  Once she added us to this group she started ""assigning"" us shifts of childcare and cooking and cleaning for her husband!! This is how Amanda is. But the thing is her husband isn't in the hospital with her!! Todd is in the house pursuing his hobbies while she wants us to come over to cook, clean, and take care of the child.   


Because we were shocked we went along with this but then Amanda started referring to these shifts as being ""auditions"" and saying her husband would be reporting ""feedback."" We weren't sure what she was getting at and she is on serious medications. It slowly dawned on us they think we are auditioning to become the new wife and mother if she doesn't make it. We understand she may actually be delusional but we don't understand why Todd thinks this. He was never involved with a woman in any way, shape or form before Amanda and he has zero social skills. He's also extremely self-centered and selfish.  


None of us want to be involved with Todd whatsoever, we don't even want to be friends with him. Also, none of us are kid people to begin with, but especially not Amanda's kid. He has never heard the word ""no."" I hate to say it but he is the most spoiled brat I have ever met.   


Some of us are somewhat fine with taking some of these shifts just to give Amanda peace of mind while in the hospital. But there is no universe in which we want to get married to Todd and be the new stepmommy to her son. But she thinks she is giving us some kind of amazing gift we should be auditioning for. Would we be the asshole if we told her this or DIDN'T tell her this?",0.22
"AITA for saying no to a play date. I (M52) told my wife (42F) that my daughter (13) didn’t need to be friends with her friend groups kid.
AITA?

My wife has a tight friend group. In this friend group are “tony” “tina” and their daughter “terror.”

I first met Tony at a wedding. For bg, I worked at home in the arts. I didn’t own a suit. So I rented one.

I love to talk smack. BUT I don’t do it irl to people I’ve just met. I don’t know them. I don’t believe in being too familiar until you get to know someone.

Someone compliments my suit. They asked me what it was and I didn’t know and I explained I rented it because I don’t own one because I don’t need one. 

Then this fucking guy goes on about renting tuxes for the prom. And after a couple of jokes I’m like this isn’t a tux, and why should I buy a suit for one night, asshole.  And I walked away and didn’t get near him the rest of the night because I didn’t want to ruin the evening by decking him. 

 I know Tina, who’s FINE, and Terror who is a smart mouth little shit at the time 9 which talked to adults completely inappropriately. 

Come Christmas, they’re both at the friends group Xmas get together. We’re not going to stay long. Tony is there, I wish him a perfunctory Xmas greeting and basically avoid him. 

So I’m taking to my wife and tina and she’s like oh you have a daughter terror’s age! Should we do a play date?

Now this is my daughter with my ex (who, as it will become important later) is a GREAT mom. So I simply say maybe, you know, if the logistics work. 

Later we’re driving home my wife asks me what I think. And I say my daughter doesn’t need to be around that girl and fuck her dad anyway. He’s an ass and I don’t want to spend any more time around him than required.

to her credit she understands and just kind of makes excuses until they get the hint. 

It comes up at another get together. Her friends, not Tony and tina, asked me if we ever got the girls together. I said no. They asked why. I said logistic didn’t work. Oh we can help, maybe a sleepover. And I just say I don’t want my kid around that kid. My kid is polite, deferential to adults, kind and sweet. Their kid is a loud mouth terror and her dad’s a dick and my kid has enough friends. So no thanks.

On the way home I asked my wife if she’s mad. Apparently she was but not at me. She had told her friend basically what had happened and that it would be a no go and was irked they tried to push again. 

I pretty much think I’m NTA but I am keen to hear other points of view. Do you control who your kid sees partly on your view of their parents?  

TL/DR: I didn’t let me kid play with another kid because the dad is an asshat.",0.86

"AITAH for yelling at my gf for attempting to spoil a movie for me. So me (M23) and my gf (F22) live together. We were watching a movie which is a sequel. She starts saying ""i know what happens in the next movie, can I tell you "". I obviously say 'no'. She goes again ""I will only give you a hint "", and I say ""NO!"". But she keeps going ""just a hint"". At this point I got frustrated and also worried what if she just yells out the spoiler, it's not like I can voluntarily chose to not listen . So I yell at and tell her ""NO I DO NOT WANT A HINT!"". 

Now she gets visibly upset , I tried to get close to her but she pushes herself away. Anyway we finished watching the movie and I again try to talk to her asking why she is so mad, it's because I yelled at her, and I could have spoken to her nicely, even though I did say it nicely the first time. Then she goes 'i was joking anyway, I wouldn't have actually spoiled it ' like I was supposed to know at that point she was joking ? Now I get upset too as she is playing the victim, rather than apologising to threat to spoil the movie.

Now I get ready for bed thinking she will join as usual. But she wants to sleep on the couch while crying how I yelled at her .

"AITA for not getting a 50 dollar hair cut from my soon to be sister in law? Basically just needed a hair cut, am always on a budget, and usually spend about 20 bucks for a haircut.

The sister in law is ""elite"" at her job whatever that means, but I guess with that comes higher prices. When my fiance texted me oh it'll cost 50 bucks, and you'd have to go during these specific times on Sunday.

Immediately I thought to myself that's way too expensive for a cut, and Sunday is getting stuff done day and don't wanna be hung up on an app (they're all right in middle of day), AND I know the final cost would be at least 60 bucks cut it'd be awkward to not tip at least 20%.

I just texted my fiance back I don't think I can fit that in my budget I was anticipating spending 20 bucks on a cut.

But I get how that could come off, because it'd be getting her sister another client because she's low on appointments. But I know if I do it this one time I'd be on her ""list"" and she'd text me having me come in and spend 60 more bucks on a cut if she's slow one day (my fiance goes in like once a month for stuff she doesn't probably need but just to help her out but whatever it's her money, like today she went in for just a blow out)",0.1
"AITA for not taking the blame for putting our cat in danger? Background story: me (25f) and my partner (23f) live together with our cat who recently had a liver problem and is on meds. I’m off today so I slept in, my partner had to get up early so she fed the cat, gave him the pill and left. I got up after she left, saw the food bowl and thought she had fed the cat and left. I’m usually the one who gives the cat his pills as I used to live with a cat with medical needs (yall cat owners probably know how tricky it is to shove a pill down a cat’s throat), she’s never done it before and still learning. I gave the cat his pill and went on with my day.

An hour or so later I get text from my partner saying the cat did surprisingly well when she gave him the pill this morning. Which freaked me out as that means the cat got two doses, I took the cat to the vet to run a bunch of tests and the vet said he should be ok but I need to monitor him and bring him in if he later starts getting sick. Obviously we paid a fat vet bill for it and my partner got mad because ‘I should’ve asked’ and I was mad because she ‘should’ve said something’. 

TBF both of us are responsible for not communicating but it rubbed me the wrong way that her first reaction was to shake off the responsibility and be the first to point fingers saying I should’ve asked her rather than acknowledging the fact that it happened because none of us said anything. Though she did get up early, took care of the cat so I could sleep in. AITA for throwing it back on her face and not taking the blame?",0.83
"AITA For “putting music before my girlfriend”? My girlfriend and I are in our mid 20’s. She usually needs to be in bed much earlier than me. Like 10 on weekdays and 12 weekends. She can’t party all night and stuff when we go away to festivals. Which is fine. She just goes to bed and I meet her there later. 

She has painful periods sometimes and I’ve seen her in the middle of the night crying and not able to sleep. She gets dizzy sometimes and a few times in our relationship she bled heavily to the point of me being worried for her and her having anxiety. She always has anxiety before it.  And I try to be sympathetic and loving. Which I am. We get along great. I always ask her what she needs and if I can help her in any way when she’s down. 

But we got into an argument because of what happened last weekend. 

I am a huge music lover. I have a few bands that me and my buddies follow around the surrounding states. There’s this one local band and I’m a huge supporter of them. I’ve seen them maybe 25 times. My girl comes with me to quite a few in the two years I’ve been with her. 

Last weekend, they played a show on a week night and it was from 8-12 ish. Around 10:00, she tells me that her stomach isint feeling good. I ask if she needs water or anything. We dance together. Have a good time. Then she said she’s dizzy and needs to go home. So I drove her and we went back home. 

My buddy the next day sent me a video of a song they played. The second we left. It was a song I rarely ever get to see them play. So I was upset. 

The next day, she noticed I was being more quiet than usual and she asked what’s wrong. I finally told her “ I was kinda a little bit mad at you because I missed the song” She said “Really?! I’m not important as that?” And tried to put it perspective of  if it was the other way around. 

She got quiet and is upset. AITA?",0.96
"AITA i may have ruined my friend's engagement by telling her mother what she is hidding from her fiance... I'm at lost here and need an outside view. I have been friends with ""may"" since we were kids. When we were finishing hs, may got pregnant and decided to keep the baby. It was a very difficult pregnancy and the birth was very traumatizing. She had to stay in the hospital for several weeks, had difficulty connecting to the child, had PPD... a few years later she needed an intervention for health reasons and asked her obgyn to have her tubes, as she said to us, ""fixed"". At that time she had a good job, the child R., was in elementary school and she told us she wanted to go back to dating but was terrified of being pregnant. She since has dated on and off but nothing serious. Until now. May has been with Lucas for about a year and he proposed to her. 

Last week they had a celebration dinner with some close friends and relatives, R. drive from uni and was able to join. 

Lucas was taliking to a bunch of us, including myself and another of ours friends, Lucy, and was so happy! We congratulate him and he said it was the perfect time, they were already speaking about kids and his mother would disown him if he got a girl pregnant without being married. Myself and Lucy froze. We started to get uncomfortable. We both know about the intervention and from what May told us is pretty irreversable. I assumed it was a sensible issue, maybe they already had a plan (like a surrogate in another country, here is not allowed, and wanted to keep it quiet). 

Myself, Lucy and May had luch on tuesday. She was going on about the dinner, her marriage plans... we were teasing her she loved him so much she was opened to having kids. Her smile faded and she tried to divert.... I finally asked if she was ok. Lucy left early and i asked directly what was going on. She said he was pushy about kids and she closed that chapter a long time ago. She couldn't conceived naturally and didn't really want a kid anyways. After dome back and foward May admitted Lucas did not know she was, in her words, ""fixed"". Things just went fast, it was casual first, then serious and she was never able to tell him. I was shocked and told her what he said at the dinner. May wasn't surprised.

Long story short, i don't think she is going to tell him. To be honest, she deserves to be happy but this feel wrong. 

I believe he should know but i don't want to be the one to tell him. Yesterday i called her mother, she is like an aunt to me so although i was conflicted i tough this was the best option. Her mom was very quiet and wanted details about the cirurgy years ago. That when i realized maybe not even her knew. I feel an ah. Lucy is not as close to her as i am and was horrified at what i did.

Should i have kept it to myself? Although we drifted a bit in the last few years i think of may like a sister,and i believe she is going to suffer a lot more if she goes through with this. But maybe she was going to tell him? I don't know... was i the ah? I haven't heard from anyone yet...",0.67
"AITA for sending my friend's mean texts to my other friend? I'm 17F. I have a lot of friends. Two of them that go to my school, let's call one ""Vicky"" and the other ""Jessie"", they are the ones involved in this. 

Vicky has always been one of my best friends. We tell each other all of our secrets, trust each other with anything, and are great friends.

However, recently, Vicky has been a bit of a bully. Being mean to me and all of her other friends. Verbally abusing us, stealing my food, and just being a jerk in all.

She really hates Jessie and when I asked her why, she said it's because she's ""rich"". Ummmm.... okay? Jessie is really nice, and I don't understand the hate.

She was texting me last night, telling me about how much she wanted to 'ruin Jessie's life' and 'make Jessie get expelled' Then she went further, talking about how tomorrow she was going to spread a bunch of really bad rumors about her.

I sent the pictures of our texts to Jessie, because this was getting out of hand. Jessie thanked me for letting her know, and sent the pictures to a group chat.

The only problem is that Vicky was in the group chat she sent it to. She got super mad at me, started yelling at me over text, and then she was crying, crying a lot. She felt really heartbroken and sad because of that. 

After that... well, now I feel like I actually want to die. I can't live with the grief of knowing that I made one of my best friends this heartbroken. I never ever ever want to go to school ever again.

So AITA for sending the texts to Jessie?

"AITA for having a newborn at brothers wedding ? I will have a brand new baby at my brothers wedding, originally I was asked to be a bridesmaid  (they new I’d be pregnant or have a newborn at the wedding) my husband is in the grooms party and my toddler is also in the grooms party. 

Today I was given the ultimatum by the bride of get someone to come to the wedding to the ceremony to watch her (2 hours away from where we/friends live)  or send her to stay with someone else. If I don’t, don’t be a bridesmaid because she’s not in the party nor will anyone at the front hold her/no space to accommodate for her.

They know we have very limited childcare to start with and have had maybe 6 nights away just us in two years. 

Now AITA for advising them outside of our entire family at the wedding we won’t have someone to watch her and I could walk up the aisle then go stand out of view with baby ? they’ll be tiny ! I planned my due date a month early so I wouldn’t be pregnant/due for the wedding. It’s not a massive wedding either and they seem to be forgetting that my toddler is probably going to need someone to keep him calm/entertained during the ceremony ? Or maybe they think toddlers follow order 😂

I’ve suggested I stand at the back with her but it seems I’ll mess up the entire order of the ceremony they have planned so it’s daughter or be bridesmaid and I’m absolutely going to choose my newborn every time. 

Me and my brother are so close we’re like twins, he walked me down the aisle. I’m devastated that I’ve been shunned out the wedding party because they can’t make any room for a newborn. I think I’d get it if other kids aren’t included but they are so AITA ?",0.6
"AITA for telling my mom the truth about how horrible she can be? My mom and I (25f) have never had the best relationship. Throughout my childhood, I did my absolute best to stay in line. I was a star student. I graduated top of my class and attended a prestigious university. I didn’t sneak out to drink or do drugs or fool around, and I was relatively introverted. My mother did an amazing number on my self-esteem growing up.

My mom is emotionally and verbally abusive. She construes any little disagreement as an attack on her character. Any mistake I made — and today still make — was made to be a huge misgiving. If I was wrong, I was “stupid”. If I was being a smart ass, I “thought I was so smart but really I was just a fucking idiot”. Insults hurled daily wore against me. I grew up watching her attack and insult my dad, who was a great father to me. My brother isn’t in contact with her anymore except for special occasions. My sister was an alcoholic in her teenage years, and I remember it being particularly rough, as my mom would spaz and sometimes even get physically rough with her. She always told me to never turn out like my sister and would put her down all the time. However, now that I’ve grown, it appears that I am now the scapegoat and my sister should avoid ME???. She immediately goes to putting people down whenever there’s the slightest hint of an issue. 

Well, now that I have grown up, I am at a loss. I always believed I should just let her be, given her traumatic upbringing. But any argument we have devolves into screaming. I cannot defend myself. I can’t even say “sorry” and agree with her, because she will sense that I don’t truly mean it, which results in more arguing. She claims that I hate her. She asks me why I am so combative, as if I am the one starting arguments, rather than acknowledging what is actually happening: that it is her who starts arguments, who insults, who puts down others. When she is in a bad mood, she will come to me and find a reason to be angry with me. I’ve come to know there is no way for me to find peace unless I stoop to her level.

Which is precisely what I do now. She wants to tell me I am miserable? I bring up examples of her dumping misery all over me and my siblings. She calls me combative? I tell her that her offensive style of communication is the reason she has no friends. She tells me she walks on eggshells around me? I say oh, no, mother. Walking on eggshells is indeed the reason your son does not talk to you anymore. Basically, I look for faults of hers that have caused me great pain and I throw it all in her face. I know it’s not right. But damn, it shuts her up.

"AITA for yelling at my SIL and brother for leaving their gun unattended with kids around 
Today I (24M) was in my moms house and I came downstairs to 5 of my nieces and nephews (aged 2-12) playing in the kitchen/living room and I noticed a handgun on the kitchen counter. All the adults were in other rooms, leaving just the kids with the gun. The gun was on a counter that’s about 4 or so feet off the ground. Easily accessible if a kid stood on a chair. I asked my SIL (32F) if it was loaded and she very causally said “oh no it’s not loaded” and walked up to the gun and took out the magazine and it had bullets in it. She set the gun and magazine back down on the counter right next to each other.  I was taken aback by how nonchalant she was with the whole situation and told her that’s irresponsible and dangerous. She kept brushing me off saying it’s not a big deal and it’s not her gun (it’s my brothers) and I raised my voice out of frustration. I was not red faced and screaming, but I did raise my voice at her.

My brother came into the room and jumped to his wife’s defense and began excusing himself. His main argument was 

1. The gun didn’t have actual bullet in the chamber and his kids can’t cock the gun.
2. He has taught his kids about gun safety and they know not to touch guns
3. I don’t lock up my car keys to stop kids from driving away with my car, so he shouldn’t be expected to lock up his gun.

And my response to those three points was 

1. Kids are more resourceful than you think and you never know who is walking in and out of a house and could grab the gun. 
2. Kids are dumb and they make mistakes everyday despite you telling them not to do something 
3. That’s the dumbest comparison I’ve ever heard. 

The whole scenario was irresponsible, no one plans on leaving a gun loaded accidentally. No one plans on an emergency. I am being called the AH for yelling at my SIL when it wasn’t her gun, but I feel like that doesn’t excuse her not  taking it seriously. I think I could have handled it better but I don’t think I need to apologize.

She got used to not wearing them and actually prefers to not wear them. AITA for changing my mind?,0.78
"AITA for locking the bathroom door when i'm inside? I'm super mad at this point and am wondering whether this was my fault. this might be a little long. please dont blow this up or post it anywhere else, i dont want it reaching the wrong ears.

me and my suitemates are all in the early years of college, and me and several others have rooms but share a bathroom. two of my roommates, Ashley and Jessica are really annoying. the others aren't important in this story besides the fact they're mildly bothered by this too.

theres a lot of crazy things ive seen from them, but the one thing that's bothering me right now, is the shared bathroom. me and the others always knock firmly, then wait a second for any reply to make sure there isnt someone inside before we open the door since the light tends to be left on by everyone. jessica knocks lightly and opens the door right after, not even waiting for a reply, and ashley doesn't knock at all. i've nearly been walked into several times and started locking the door (they told everyone not to ""in case it's an emergency"" because the shower is blocked off by a non see through sliding door so technically one can use the toilet and someone else can shower at the same time)

i sometimes leave the door locked from the inside by accident just because of the way the lock works, and if the light is left on then the door is locked with nobody inside and has to be unlocked from the outside with a tool. i believe this might be the cause of the beef jessica has against me. jessica says she nearly had an accident because the door was locked and called me ridiculous when i said if i didnt hear the knock it practically didnt happen. 

honestly speaking i'm scared of her. my other roomate isabelle told me jessica has beat someone up before for doing something she didnt like at a bar, and shes the type that might force the door open just because she cares that little about anyone else's privacy.

unfortunately no authority figure in my building can do anything to them since what they're doing isnt illegal so any advice would be appreciated. i've tried talking to them but they're being stubborn. am i overreacting, and do you think i'ts my fault for starting the whole thing by locking the door?",0.21
"AITA for wanting money for landscaping my grandmother's new house? My (14f) grandmother(60f) called me today saying she has a job for me and my best friend(15f), who lives across the street from me. I used to live with my grandmother as a child in our apartment, and I still stay there on the weekends for church. She has recently bought a house and I am helping her move out. 

Me and my best friend are currently in a trade school, where I am in an art program and she is in landscaping. My grandmother brought me to her new house, it's a standard tiny home, 2 bathroom, 2 bedroom, a kitchen, and a living room. The rooms themselves are pretty small, however. 

The property has a couple dead bushes (6 in total) and 2 of them are huge compared to the house, like, they must've never been trimmed. She told me that she wanted me and my best friend  to take down the bushes and figure out a landscaping plan. I told her that we haven't learned much in either of our programs, since we're only freshmen, and it would definitely take more than a day to figure all of the plans out. Of course, she didn't care, saying she trusts us. Neither me nor my friend have ever done something like this, and we were told to never do something like this for free. 

I got home and called my mom about it, and she told me to never expect money for every little thing I do (I never did anything like this, the only things I asked money for in the past was babysitting for 3+ hours). Of course, she said my friend doesn't have to do anything, but we both agreed we'd start after agreeing to be paid. But knowing my grandmother (who is a cheapskate), she probably won't think of a reason to pay me, since I'm her granddaughter. But, she does supply housing and food for me on the weekends, so, AITA for wanting money?",0.18
"AITA for leaving my drunk friend? I F(19) am in college and go out with friends once or twice a week. It’s usually the same group of girls who I all know extremely well, one of which being my roommate. Last week we decided to go out and out of the four of us, only me and another girl had anything to drink. I was decently drunk, but still able to hold conversations and walk on my own, the other girl was a different story. She was stumbling on the way to the party, but we were all having a good time and knew not to let her drink any more. She didn’t end up drinking anything else but smoked a little. We stayed at the party for 1 1/2 hours with everything going smoothly. It was only once we got back to mine and my roommates apartment that things started looking bad. The drunk girl started throwing up for the first time all night, and it was clear at that point she was probably blacked out. Me and my other two friends helped her throw up for around 30 minutes, and I even got her to sit up and drink water. All of a sudden my other two friends got convinced that my drunk friend was experiencing alcohol poisoning. I immediately called them out on this because we had all seen each other in very similar states and never thought of it to be alcohol poisoning. After about 20 more minutes of them frantically searching symptoms online, they decided to call the cops/EMS despite the drunk girl begging them not to. 
This is where the asshole part comes in. 

Last semester I ended up on probation with my university for an alcohol related offense. Any further involvement with drugs or alcohol would result in me being permanently expelled from the university, all my friends are aware of this and I’m very open about the concerns I have when drinking now. So when my two friends were persistent about calling an ambulance (which I still didn’t find to be necessary) I told them I would leave and stay the night somewhere else. I was still fairly drunk and didn’t want to risk having to talk to cops. They immediately called me selfish and a bad friend for wanting to leave. They even told me that if questioned they would say I was drinking with them. I didn’t spend too much time arguing with them before I just left and didn’t come back until later the next day. 

Later that night my drunk friend called me and told me she was okay, and it wasn’t alcohol poisoning, they released her the same night. She now has to face consequences with the school and will likely be put on probation. Ever since that night my roommate has barely talked to me. Im afraid i’m going to lose her as a friend, but I still believe I did the right thing. AITA",0.83

The road conditions are kind of bad (snow chains needed and severe weather storm warning) and I’m kind of scared to drive. I drive a Honda civic and am the only one in the family without an AWD/4WD car. I’m also from a large city that never gets snow so I’m not a pro at driving in the snow. Typically for family trips I would drive with a family member but they can’t make it and everyone’s car is full! I texted my family and told them I’m a little scared to drive and might have to cancel, they were upset and I told them I would still pay for my portion, of course. They’re still pressuring me to go but I’m actually really scared to drive by myself. Am I the asshole for cancelling?",0.08

We usually share everything that happens to us so we can always be on the same page. Today while at the gym I was taking a brake from my workout when I fellow gym goer approached me. At first I thought she need help with something however to my surprised she said she thought I was cute and she wanted to know if I would be interested in going on a date.. I politely told her I was married and she quickly glanced at my hand where my wedding ring would be, however I don’t wear it during the gym. I said I was sorry and moved on.

"AITA for not wanting my MOH to bring her boyfriend to my wedding? I 27F am getting married in a couple of months to my fiance 29M. My maid of honor (25F) wants to bring her ""boyfriend"" (22M) to my wedding. I use the term boyfriend loosely and i most definitelydont want him there. For the past two years their relationship has been weird. They only want each other and have only been with each other but he refuses to make things offical with her. And whenever they try to date he starts acting up and saying he wants to be young and mess around before settling and they end up breaking things off. He has even forced her hand into breaking up with him so he can play the victim. This has been the case for the past two years and they've probably broken up and made up like 10 times already. She swears he's the one for her but he keeps treating her like a toy that he can play pretend with for a bit before getting tried and breaking things off. But then after a few days, maybe a week at most, he comes crawling back to her and she accepts but they just won't label their relationship and then the cycle continues. 

I've only met him twice and both times were at parties where I barely even spoke to him. She knows I don't like him so her mom asked me if he can attend. I can't stand the thought of him being there with my family and close friends acting as if I'm okay with how he treats her.  If I allow him to come I want him no where near me, I don't want him in any photos and i definitely dont want to speak to him. And if i do speak to him nothing nice will be coming out of mouth. I want to be able to know he's not present nor will I tolerate how he treats her. But I also want her to be happy and to enjoy the party and i want to be considerate of her feelings I just wish she could understand that she doesnt deserve to be treated they he treats her. She deserves soemone that is loyal and genuinely loves her and wants to show her off. AITA?",0.08
"AITA For Not Going to my Husband's Grandmother's Funeral? To start, three weeks ago I did something very uncharacteristic for me and auditioned for a play because it was something I'd always wanted to do. I ended up getting one of the 2 leads in the play. My husband was so proud of me, and I'm really proud of myself because I've struggled with confidence issues. We're in the early weeks of the production and have only been meeting on Saturdays the past two weeks. Last week was a read through and this week we're starting to work through scenes together. 

This past week has been eventful. My uncle died Thursday before last and my husband's grandmother died on Monday. My uncle's funeral thankfully fell on Sunday and Monday, but if it had been Saturday/Sunday, I probably wouldn't have gone to the visitation on Saturday, or at least would have come later so I could do both the play practice and the funeral. My husband's grandmother's funeral fell on Saturday at the exact same time as the planned play practice. Before I even broached the subject, my husband insisted I still do the play practice once he found out the time. He knows how much I want to do this and would rather me be doing something productive and that I enjoy. 

We were trying to figure out when else I could go to his families (like a visitation or even just to his grandmother's house), but his mom and her siblings didn't hold a visitation and were not consistently together. The plan was for me to originally go over there the morning of the funeral (it's an hour away) then leave about 12:30/12:45 ish to be back for the practice at 2, but we learned earlier today that no one will be at the church/near his grandma's place until 12. I told my husband I was completely fine going and only being able to stay for 30-45 minutes, but he insisted it would be a waste of time to only get to stay that short of a time since it would be a 2 hours drive round trip.

My husband has a large family, so he will have a lot of people around him, but I know that's not the same as your spouse being there with you. I was glad he was with me at my uncle's funeral and lucked out he was off work those days. If I weren't one of the leads and other people in the show's scene dependent on me to be there, I would skip it with no hesitation, but it's not just me the show involves. Essentially, AITA for choosing something for myself over my husband's grandmother's funeral?",0.17
"AITA? My man guilt trips me everytime I dress up and I snapped on him this time So literally I'm trying to figure out if I'm the a****** or not for snapping on my man. Every time I dress up whether, it's cute whether. It's modest whether, it's sexy. Any time I'm literally full of myself and feeling myself. I take photos and I let myself appreciate how I look. And who I am how I dress and how I carry myself. I do my whole own little photoshoot. Video shoots and vlog it. Sometimes my man even joins in and take pictures of me. Tonight he did and we had so much fun, usually we'll be having a great time together but afterwards almost every single time....  My man feels the pressing nagging need to ask me  ""Are you gonna send photos like that to anyone?"" (MIND YOU most of my friends r woman....IM IN INTROVERTED, I BARLEY GO OUTSIDE..... AND MY ONLY GUY IS RESPECTFUL AF) but still he says things like  ""Lemme rephrase that I don't want you sending photos like that to anyone"" And it got to me deep this time. 
I snapped and I cursed him out for about 20 state minutes. This is like the 7th or 8th time he's said things like this to me and ONLY SAYS IT when I've dressed up and take a nice photos of myself. I was so pissed too come in the room start dressed down and hear him again ask me that ish. It's like he feels the need to try to tear me down and make me feel bad for being confident in anyway about myseld...and told me to my face when I was snapping on him. ""It's up to me to help boost him up and help him feel less insecure"" And honestly that just sounds so vrazy to me..like why would be dressing up and loving myself make him feel insecure? And to suggest I would send sexy photos out to anyone me just INSANE and crazy disrespectful to ask. I told him it's not my job to make him feel secure about me feeling myself, and that I refuse to be shamed for feeling good about myself. In bewteen cursing him out.

"AITA for writing my parents a check for everything they say I owe them and telling them to STFU and GTFO. I am 30 years old and fairly successful thus far. My parents are a huge part of my success. The kept me motivated through school, they gave me a great childhood, they helped me graduate debt free. My mom's contacts helped me land a well paying job straight out of university. I'm a nepo kid. Without them who knows where I'd be. 

They think this gives them carte blanche to interfere in my life. They constantly critique everything about my life. I cannot think of one aspect of my life they approve of. And I'm not a bad person or anything. It's not like they have a problem with me because I am a drug addict or working as a sugar baby. They just think they know better about everything. 

I had them over to my place for my dad's birthday. And everything was wrong. My apartment was too small, the stove didn't have precise control of the heating elements and I scorched the sauce, I did not it was perfect. Just everything. And they kept saying they wanted better for me. And that after everything they did for me I should be doing better. 

Well I'm doing well. And because I live the way I do I've actually done fantastic for the last eight years. 

So I wrote them a big check and asked them to hold it up. I took a picture of them with the check. They asked what it was for. I said that it was everything they had wasted on me since obviously they think I have failed so I'm giving them a refund. I told them that I loved them and that I appreciated their help but now that they were paid back they could keep their opinions to themselves and out of my apartment.

He kinda saw my reaction and certainly shifted his demeanor after that. I know he vapes now (this is... whatever tbh) but I really just can't get behind the drug use. Even having a past of it bothers me. I never thought i'd be someone that cared a lot about this but I have high standards for myself, and the people I want to surround myself with. I don't even know how to feel about this and that bothers me too. 

Let it be known I would never continue to hang out with him if he said he still does them occasionally, he just vapes and drinks. Used to smoke cigs.",0.95
"AITA? Friend is mad at us for answering her questions regarding to her boyfriend Mountain - Best friend

Sea - New friend

Sky - Boyfriend of Sea and our classmate

Soil - Girl that doesn't have character development and also our classmate

First incident. 
Soil accidentally or not bumped to Sea's close friend and didn't apologise. So she's slightly irritated and we share our thoughts and the deeds she did to me. She's a mean girl and we thought she changed because her friends just used and betrayed her. Then Sea and Sky had a fight because of it.

Sea (we know her for 6 months or more) is mad at us for answering her questions regarding to her boyfriend. She said that we are destroying Sky image to her. And that we are creating an issue. Mountain showed a picture of her boyfriend and Soil (partner for prom). 

She didn't warn her on what about the picture is. I tried to stop her since last time(first incident) she ask about Sky, she didn't approached and talk to us unlike before. I didn't know about the picture tho. Now they are both mad at us and Sky messaged Mountain that we should talk to her boyfriend if we want to be friends with her and stop ruining the reputation of her boyfriend. Then Sky message me that he hope we are happy for ruining their relationship and he also blocked both of us. We didn't want to ruin their relationship of course. We just basically answered her question and she jumped to conclusion. Mountain is wrong to show her the picture and I explained it why to her. She also understands it.

I plan to talk to them a week later so that the emotions are not high. I also suggested to our friend that she should talk and apologize to them especially we saw Sky is crying. Another info, while Sea is chatting Sky after she saw the pic and send it to Sky, she's really intense typing. Then she cried and I comforted her. Mountain didn't want to go near her because for her it's normal to cry when having a fight with your boyfriend.

"AITA for not giving my nieces and nephews the same amount of gifts as my other niece and nephew? Background: My (30F) family have gone through things financially, we were doing great even the best in our whole extended family but our business went into loss and we struggled a lot for more than 10 years, we even had to sell our house due to it. All these things have taught me a lot about human behavior specially about family dynamics in extended family and lets just say I have learned to keep my relatives at a distance.

My family and my uncle's family were quite close in childhood to the point where I, my brother(36M) and cousins (30F,35F) were as close as brother and sisters but all this changed when we started having our financial troubles the way they changed and started treating us I remember it quiet well and hence I keep distance from them.

  
Lets talk about the present, today my family is doing great, I am also doing great I am the highest income earner. I am on good speaking turns with my cousins, we live in the same city but I am not close to them anymore and do keep a distance and distance does show out in the way I treat my N.&N. I treat all of them quite well but I favor my brothers children way more than theirs.

"AITA? My friend got mad at me for telling the truth. Before I start, I want to give a little background I (18F) has been friends with (18F) let’s call her Susan. Susan has a BF (17M) let’s call him Rick, I have known them since high school. Now it was said that Susan and Rick always fight, and most of the time Susan asks me to watch Rick to make sure he doesn’t do anything wrong, since Rick and I are classmates; up until now. 

Now there are two incidents, the first one was Susan telling me that she fought with Rick because Rick went to a girl’s house with his friends without updating Susan, she asked for reassurance but Rick didn’t give her one so they fought, Susan ended up unfriending Rick on her social media. During that I accidentally mentioned another girl (19F) let’s call her Quinn now Quinn and Rick are seat mates and it seems to us (me and a friend) that Quinn has taken a liking to Rick, Susan dislikes Quinn because of her bad attitude, I told Susan that Rick pities Quinn since she got depressed when her friends betrayed her. Rick takes Quinn whenever no one takes her for groupings (Rick’s group usually contains guys). I’m not sure, but I remember Susan mentioning that Rick doesn’t like it when Susan has guy group mates or hangs out with guy friends. Susan was pissed even more. 

The second incident happened recently, we’re having prom and it was by partner, the downside it’s by class now here’s the thing; prior to finding out our partners I talked to Susan she said she’d be okay if I became Rick’s partner, and she doesn’t want it to be anybody else, I told her I’ll try. Here’s the thing Rick and Quinn became partners, I updated Susan and told her the news, she said she didn’t care but she wasn’t okay. The next day we talked she asked me who Rick’s partner is once again I answered her it’s really Quinn and I told her what I heard, Quinn said something about her and Rick always being partners, and her insisting for Rick to be her partner. 

I think AITA because I showed her a pic of our table and guess who was in the background Quinn and Rick they were sitting quite close to each other, I wasn’t able to warn her or anything, I just told her to look at the picture without context and Susan was mad. She took a picture of what was in my phone and texted Rick, she texted for a while before she cried. I also witnessed Rick cry. Later on Susan texted me, she said that if I wanted to make amends with her I should talk to her BF, and she told me to stop making rumors; I never said anything bad about her BF since he’s my friend too, all I talked about was what Quinn has been saying. Rick blocked me and I did the same. My friend told me, I should make amends but I kinda don’t want to make amends, since I saw a post on how she ranted about me and said that she’ll make rumors, AITA for that. It will feel uncomfortable if I make amends with someone who’ll badmouth me, I realized that I never really knew her at all. 

Should I have not shown her the picture and just kept my mouth shut? She didn’t clarify about the context of the picture at all. So AITA? I might post some more updates but for now that’s all.

Edit: The two incidents were a week apart, I found out that the day before the second incident happened, they reconciled.

Edit2: I took the picture of the table no. to not forget about it. (They were sitting across from me). A friend tried to stop me from showing the pic, because 1. Susan ignored us for a week during the first incident, and 2. She didn’t think Susan was ready to see the pic.",0.47

"AITA? Boyfriend screamed at me in my sleep over a vape. So I (23F) and my (39M) boyfriend haven’t been getting along the greatest lately, to keep it simple. I have my own room with a twin bed I’ve been sleeping in, but we have our shared room with a Full. I tend to be a very light sleeper and am an insomniac so it’s not uncommon for me to stay up late, or to fall asleep in weird places . 
Last night, same as always. I had told him I was going to stay up a little and I would take care of the few dishes we had in the sink. 2am rolled around and I made the mistake of dosing off on the couch watching a movie. He wakes me up at 4am SCREAMING that he can’t believe I didn’t do the dishes and that he knows I stole his vape. To preface, when I dream, I dream HARD, so I didn’t know what was going on. I grabbed the rubbing alcohol next to me (i was doing my nails) and asked if that’s what he wanted. I told him how confused I was and that I didn’t mean to fall asleep but he stayed very bitter. 
I had swooped his vape but it’s never been an issue, I just couldn’t find mine and he doesn’t get up until 7 anyways. 
Even though only max 5 minutes passed until he got his vape back, he looked at me like he was disgusted. 
My main concern is being awoken by screaming brought back a lot of deep childhood trauma. I have a strong physical/ mental reaction when I feel unsafe and despite him being very apologetic (after I painted the picture that HE would never get treated like that) I don’t know if I can look at him the same. We’ve had a lot of issues when he drinks but he was entire sober.
I also am very clean and put together so he definitely isn’t taking it as me being lazy.

"AITA mom flipped out So, my sister stays over for a week with her tiny chihuahua, and when the dog does its business on a carpet that my mom laid in the living for her to serve as a puppy pad. I'm already grabbing wipes to clean up the mess when she walks in, and she swears she didn't see me, passing right by me twice. I call her out and ""are you fucking serious yo"", things get heated, and she starts getting a attitude so when she comes back in for the 2nd time i ask what's wrong and she flips out.  
  
I decide to take a breather and head to my room with my dog, Taco. As I'm ignoring her and trying to get my dog, she keeps going off. I'm sick of being talked down to, so I go for a walk to cool down. I come back after about 8 minutes, and she's still ranting to my sister about the whole thing.  
  
I don't really want to go back in, but I'm a type 1 diabetic and realize I left my test kit inside. I go grab it, check my sugar, and it's 55. Panic mode sets in because I can have seizures from low blood sugar and have had 2. I ask for some candy she brought, but she ignores me. I grab some gummies and head back out on my walk while eating them.  
  
Fast forward, I end up passing out in the driveway. My sister finds me, calls my name, and helps me up. My mom, instead of checking if I'm okay, just walks away. I'm freezing, with dried blood on my face, and she's sitting in the kitchen eating pizza or whatever she was doing, completely ignoring me.  
  
Later, I swallow my pride, go into her room to apologize, say I love you, and goodnight. No response. I know I could've worded things better or not been annoyed by it, but seriously, was flipping out and letting me walk alone in the freezing cold while I'm low justified? I don't think so.

"AITA for refusing to help my bf's mother? Throwaway account for privacy reasons. I (28F) have been with my bf (32M) for almost 5 years, living together since the first lockdown. His mother (71F) never liked me, mainly she has issues with my parents and background, my height and my line of work. I don't really have a relationship with her due to her being mean to me, I really tried at first but gave up because insults never stopped. Last year her long term partner died and his kids kicked her out of his house about a month ago. I own a very small studio apartment that my parents bought me when I was going to university (a tenant lives there now) and a 3 bedroom house where me and my bf live now. Again, my parents helped me buy it by giving me ~45% of downpayment. Bf contributed to nothing nor did I ask him. His mom is temporarily living at her sister's and is increasingly unhappy about not having her own space. She can't afford to move anywhere on her own. Without consulting me, bf brought up my apartment to her and implied she could move in there. When he told me about it I said absolutely not, first I'm not kicking out a good tenant, second she's been mean to me, third my parents (that she's been badmouthing) paid for that apartment so that I could have a head start in life and not for his mother to have a comfortable retirement. He asked to at least pay a deposit for an apartment, I said no - his mother, his problem. I saw text messages where she calls me a bitch, no way I'm helping someone who's this mean to me. We had a huge fight and he said I'm spoiled, selfish and this is why he didn't want to marry me in the first place (I did bring up marriage some time ago and he did not give me a straight answer at the time). Now, I don't think I'm selfish or spoiled. My bf has been living at my place rent free for nearly 4 years, I also gave him ~5000€ when he was buying a car and he never returned the money. We earn a very similar amount of money, which is above our countries average yet he has no savings while I have a lot. He could have saved tons of money while he was living at my place rent free, instead he took up expensive hobbies and bought his 'dream car'. I on the other hand am very frugal and even my own car is worth less than what I contributed to his car. My bf's cousin who's also my friend told me I'm being a bit of an asshole and should help his mom as she's old and has nobody else. Her being mean is just what she is, she can't help it. I do agree that I could easily help her but it's not true she has nobody else. She has 2 kids of her own (her daughter is no contact with her) and if she needs my help so bad, the least she could do is apologise for being rude to me and ask for it herself. So AITA?",0.12
"AITA for agreeing on a place with my partner for moving in, placing a holding fee, and then upon further inspection of the place, didn’t want to go through with it Long story short: me (33M)and my girlfriend (33F) are finally making the decision to move in together about being together for about 4 years. My lease ends in May, and hers end in March. As a result, she wants to find a place by early March. Something apparently happened between her and her roommate at her current apartment so she’s staying with her parents for now. Because my lease ends in May and I want to move out but within the same apartment complex, I have  to pay a transfer fee to move into a new unit.

We found a 2 bedroom place, that was very cheap, and me and her can easily afford it. However the first time I saw it, I was not impressed at all. My partner however loved it. In my complex, these apartment units sell out like hot cakes, and I felt pressured from both my girlfriend and the leasing agent to make a decision soon. 

Out of desperation, I agreed to move in there and place a holding fee for the unit. However, yesterday I requested to do a final inspection, and found out the walls were and ceiling were very dirty, there was no bathroom exhaust, and the building is very old compared to the current building I’m living in. I just didnt like it at all, and felt if I moved in a place that I didn’t like just for my partner, I would end up resenting her for it.

I explained this to my partner, and she’s now heartbroken because of this.  I told her I would’ve hated her if I was rushed to move into a place I didn’t like. I explained to her that we both have to move into a place we are 100% in, and shouldn’t act in desperation, because finding a place we both like takes  time. She just said she didn’t appreciate how she felt like I “lead her on” and now she’s back to square one. 

I now have to talk to the leasing agent on Sunday, and explain to her that I do not want to go through with the move in. 

**TLDR: found a place to move in with my girlfriend. Wasn’t thrilled about it, but my gf loved it, and in a fit of desperation, placed a holding fee. Upon further inspection of it, it solidified my decision of not wanting to move in there. Told my girlfriend I do not want to go through with moving there. Girlfriend is now heart broken, and I have to explain to the leasing agent tomorrow I’m not going to move in there**",0.12

"AITA for choosing to spend Christmas with my family rather than my boyfriends? I (f20) and boyfriend (m22) decided we would go to his parents for Christmas as we did my parents the year previous.(this was decided months before the ‘incident’)

We have been together for 3 years in which time he has bought a house and I have moved in with him, this was in the first year so nothing was really serious. Me and his dad have never seen eye to eye but as my boyfriend is the only child and he is like the Crown Jewels and golden boy. 

Summer 2023 I stupidly agreed to go on an all expenses paid vacation with his family for 2 weeks, I can now say it was the worst experience of my life! We all went out to the bar for a few drinks but as I’m under 21 I couldn’t get anything which I’ve never been bothered about as I don’t like alcohol anyway. 20 minutes into being at the bar I was approached by a complete stranger, they initiated a conversation with me thinking I was someone else, he introduced me as ‘Justin’s girlfriend’ where I corrected him and explained I wasn’t who he thought I was, he apologised and moved on. We were at the bar till  it closed and as we were all leaving the dad pulled me aside and screamed at me, calling me a wh**e and a s**t, no one stopped him not even my boyfriend. I ran out with my dead in my hands crying as no one has spoken to me like this before. All the way through the vacation I was questioned by all the family and my boyfriend asking if I had cheated because of that one uncounted in the bar!?

Since this I have refused to go see any of my boyfriend’s family due to the way I was treated, I feel like an outcast when I’m with them, no one deserves to feel that way. 

I agreed I would stay civil for my boyfriend’s sake but I have nothing to say to them, since the vacation our relationship hasn’t been the same. He checks my phone and always calls me when I’m out with friends? Red flag? 

Well since Christmas was coming up my boyfriend asked me if I was ready to go to the family’s lake house for Christmas I point blank refused and said I was going to my families as what happened on the vacation trip was completely uncalled for and that I was victimised as they have never liked me and I wasn’t prepared to put myself in that position again as it was all the same family. We got into a massive argument and well I went to my moms for Christmas he went to his…. We haven’t really been the same since and he is always arguing with me

"AITA for telling my mom to leave my brother behind because he won’t wake up for our road trip to see his son? I (17) have a brother (21) who had a baby about 2 years ago. Him and his girlfriend (at the time) had a beautiful baby boy: with their better judgment they let this awesome couple adopt him. When I tell you this couple is top-tier, they are. 
The issue is my brother. He’s very emotionally immature, recently we’ve gotten into a fight that’s left me indifferent towards him. I love him, I do, he’s my brother, but after having an estranged relationship with my father; I’m not necessarily tolerant to whiny men. I won’t go into details about the things my brother said to me during our fight but I will say a lot of it had to do with me and hell. 

Anyways, we planned a trip to visit my nephew months ago. This is my first time meeting the little guy so I’ve been very excited, I put in a request for the day off as soon as I heard but I have been a little nervous thinking about being in the car with my brother for 3 hours. I was also worried he would bring up the situation with his ex to the parents. Him and the baby’s mother split, and because my brother is my brother, it was a nasty break. (This is another issue that brings me and him to butt heads because he seems to forget his ex is still the mother to his child) 
This is worrisome because the parents are really nice, clean people. My family is on the rougher side, we’re lower class with addiction    all over so you can imagine why I’m anxious. 

The problem is this morning (I’m writing this on the way btw) my brother wouldn’t wake up. We told him he needed to be ready by 7 am because it’s 3 hours away and we wanted to visit some shops while we’re up there. We texted him, called him, nothing. My mom was bent out of shape, she’s scared that it will cause a big fight. I, on the other hand, was relieved. He lives 30 minutes in the other direction of our destination and while we had started the drive my mom got nervous and said “should we turn around and go get him?” I said no. She fretted over the fact that it’s his son but I reminded her that he is being irresponsible for not being awake. Hell I even had 5 alarms set staring at 5 so I would be awake. It’s not our responsibility to keep track of him.

"AITA for potentially moving out because of dog? Hi all

Please be gentle, as I am hating myself enough currently but I just wanted to get your take. My partner and I have been together and 7 years and live together, in a house we bought 9 months ago. We rescued a dog about a year and a half ago and from the moment we have had her she has put my anxiety absolutely through the roof. There’s spells where I go days without eating just because of the anxiety I feel in that space. I have tried therapy and a range of anti depressants, and whilst they have helped slightly, I am still really struggling. It came to a head at the start of December when I told my partner I felt like I could no longer stay under the same roof as the dog. She suggested that I take some time away and stay with my parents for a few months whilst I take stock and try to reset a little. She has been really great. She has told me however she will never rehome the dog and that’s not an option and she can manage the dog easily.

Our dog is a big dog and whilst not perfect, she’s also not the worst either. We have had multiple trainers work with her and she has made a lot of progress, however she is still a lot of dog and we have been told she will forever be a resource guarder (which we can manage fine around the house but it in general gives me the absolute fear) she also can get mouthy when excited but again that has improved.

Even now when I am trying to come back to the house I am still feeling similar and now I am seriously considering moving out permanently and staying with folks temporarily until my partner can find somewhere else to stay. She is my priority and making sure she is ok, because I feel so awful and guilty to be feeling this way. A dog just isn’t for me. I hate every second of it.

Anyways, I would still want to be with my girlfriend whatever happens and she feels the same but I just know that the permanence of having a dog is ruining my life and I feel I need some sort of escape.

Am I an ass for feeling this way?

Thanks so much",0.4
"WIBTA for accusing her of lying about my dress (Background info): I participate in cultural performances for school, and with that comes costumes. In 2023, I did a performance that required me to get a custom-made costume that cost $70.
 

For graduation later that year, some of the girls that participated in the cultural performance were planning on doing another celebratory dance for the graduates, but adding in extra girls since some of the originals didn’t want to do it.

 
The girls that were added in didn’t have a costume, so some of the girls that weren’t participating but had costumes lent out our ones to them. I lent mine but wasn’t even aware of who wore my dress until after the performance.

 
I lent mine out, thinking that it would be cared for and returned. I ended up not being able to collect it the next week, so I just said that I would get it the next year.

 
Next year comes around, and I go and ask for my costume back, only to be told that the girl who borrowed it “lost” it on graduation day in the change room (classroom).

 
I wasn’t informed about it whatsoever, and it sounded like there wasn’t even an attempt to look for it. I believe that was because it was never even lost. Some of the other girls in the performance said she was doing tik toks in it and had it in her hands after changing.

 
The girl who borrowed my dress said she would pay for it, but I don’t want the money, as I honestly don’t believe that she lost it in the first place. I, as well as some of our mutual friends, believe that she still has it.

 
It’s currently the weekend, and I’m planning on going up to her during school and asking that she either return it to me because it’s still mine or help me find it if it’s lost.

 
I wouldn’t be so upset over it if it was from a shop down the road, but it was custom made specifically for me. It has sentimental value to me, and I only get to wear it twice.
 

Even if she does have it, I’m not even sure what road to go down to get it back if she refuses to give it to me.

 
Will I be the asshole for insisting that she’s lying about losing it?

"AITA for telling my daughter to stop mentioning her father? My daughter, River (F15) has always been closer to her father, Steven (M37) than to me (M34). He honestly is just a teenage girl stuck in an older gay man's body, he's always done the things you'd expect a mother to do with her daughter ; they go out for manicures together, he explained periods and puberty to her, he's always making melodramatic comments about her boyfriends etc. 
River and I still have a good relationship, but it's just vastly different than her and Steven's.

Steven and I got divorced not too long ago, I initiated it. I've been with him since I was eighteen, I never got to explore my sexuality or my identity completely because of it. I started questioning myself too, and figured out that I wasn't gay, I was bi.

Since my divorce and remarriage to my wife, Angie (F36),  River has been distant with me. She completely ignores my wife too, even when she tries to build a relationship with her, but the thing that bothers me the most is that she constantly speaks about Steven.

For example, if my wife makes dinner, River will criticize it and tell her what Steven would've done differently. River puts down Angie's hobbies too, she talks about how her dad's interests are more 'intellectual' and 'nuanced'. It just goes on. My breaking point was when she kept telling me and my wife about Steven's despair over the divorce, and that he still tells her that he loves me. 

It upset me terribly that she keeps bringing up my ex as a way of putting my wife down and trying to make me feel guilty, so I told her to stop talking about her dad, to stop even mentioning him if she's using him to make me feel bad about my choices. Since then, River has been spending more time with Steven and only ever speaks to me in short, curt sentences.

EDIT ; As recommended by some comments, here's some context.
-we divorced 4 years ago.

-Steven wasn't the best partner, we had many issues.

-River has been in therapy for the past 10 years.

-I did do more 'feminine' things with River, she just preferred them more with Steven.",0.88
"AITA for asking my husband to come on a trip with me for support? A little backstory on me is that I suffer from panic attacks which can result in physical symptoms (shaking, getting sick, etc.) that can last a long time depending on the situation I’m in. Usually this happens when I’m in a new environment/situation where I feel I have no escape.

I’m trying my best to expose myself to new situations to help with this and recently I took a leap and booked a trip to visit my friend who lives a 4 hour plane ride away. After the booking of this trip had settled, I realized that I may not be able to handle this situation like I thought and am now worried about my panic attacks. Unfortunately, if I cancel this trip, I lose out on 80% of the ticket cost because I picked the cheap route with cancellation for a fee. 

My solution was to invite my husband on the trip; I’ll pay for his flight ticket. Essentially he would need to miss 3 days of work, but he has family that lives in the area of my friend and where we’re going is beautiful and has mountains / places to explore so it’s also an opportunity for us to have fun on a trip (which we never do). 

My husband feels like this is asking him a lot. He doesn’t feel right about me paying for him and he also just doesn’t want to go. He says it’d be boring for him. Part of me understands but part of me thinks that if the roles were reversed, I would support him regardless and I feel semi hurt that he isn’t here to do the same. I explained that I knew I messed up by booking this without thinking clearly about how I’d manage it, but would like to think that if he made a mistake, I’d be there to back him up, so why can’t he do the same for me? I don’t feel like asking him to join me on this trip is a lot, but he’s acting like I’m asking him to sacrifice the world. AITA in this for needing him there? I just need perspective.",0.92

When I mentioned that she’d still be wearing her brace, she freaked out about how embarrassed she’d be for Mary to see the brace. I know that a single night of non compliance isn’t going to have an effect on her, but she has been non compliant in the amount of time that she wears the brace for the last two months because Mary’s been coming over more and more often and staying later into the evening.

"WIBTA - parking infront of his house? 
Setup. So I (34m) live with my parents, because the economy is awesome. Pretty much the same situation for many houses on my street. Adults living with parents, and 3 or 4 car households. It's a nightmare.  
Anyway, my street is a T shaped cul-de-sac and I'm half way up one of the sides. There's no space near my house to park, so most days I park by the entrance of the street along a stretch where you can park 3 cars along the fencing of a house that lives on the entrance street.

So the guy at this corner house has space for 2 cars in their driveway, one in front, and two across the street on their actual street. Yet this guy will always park both of his vans on my street, on the 3 car strip. He's tried to have words with me in the past because I usually end up in one of those spaces which I guess annoys him. He will constantly park his van mm away from my front bumper, and my reg plate has received a few cracks from obvious bumps. Bloody typical.

Anyway this morning my car was in its space between a car and one of this guys vans. His other van was previously infront of his house. I went out to the shops to do my weekend shopping and 20 minutes later he's moved his van into my spot. I know this was done maliciously because it was infront of his actual house, on his actual street 20 minutes ago when I left.

So now I've had to abandon my car half way down his street and walk up 2 streets to get home with a load of bags. I couldn't help but notice though that there is now a space directly infront of his house where my car could happily fit.

"WIBTA for asking family back for money I lent again? To preface, I understand I’ve got myself in a messy situation but I wanted to help. I (23F) leant £750 to my cousin to relieve her financial situation. My cousin was down this money after paying a bill for a friend in 2022. The friend had been paying her back monthly but began failing to do so towards the end of last year which created difficulty for my cousin.  

The friend does not know that I have leant my cousin money to help however I am close to the friend as well and am aware that this month the friend payed back £250. I have asked once lightly for the money to be paid back over text but received no response. I make good money for a young adult (more so than cousin and friend despite being younger than both)  however this is largely to do with working an additional 2 days a month on top of my full time job which is a stipulation of an employer agreement I have (therefore, I value this money more because I have to sacrifice the equivalent of a full weekend a month for it). 

I am not in a difficult financial situation however I feel frustrated that I bailed cousin out of difficult situation and they now have my additional £250. I don’t want to put them in a difficult situation but they have not expressed needing this money and been spending money on enjoyable activities such as dinner and coffee. Given that the agreement was that they would pay me back as they received the money I feel upset that they have not kept to their word.

"AITA for not wanting to help my stepdaughter because she chose to want to live with her dad? Married to my wife for 10 years now. When I met her she had three children from a previous marriage but had been divorced for a year.

Their dad saw them one weekend a month and for the first two years we were married did not see them at all.

It all changed when he got married. His new wife pressured him heavily into seeking custody. My wife even told the children: “If you want to spend more time with your dad, that’s fine.” It all appeared amicable until he filed an emergency custody order. It was legally against my wife, but I was the person against whom all the complaints were against. I was emotionally abusive, I bribed them, I manipulated them, I turned them against their dad, all these things. The judge ruled “in the interest of the children, they will go with dad 6 days a week, and in 1 month we will come back for an evidentiary hearing. Stepdad will not be around the kids at all. No contact.”

During this entire time the kids asked about me, where I was, if they could talk to me. It gave me hope.

My wife at the time admitted to me she has always been afraid of her ex, although he never physically abused her. I tried so hard to get my wife to fight. I begged her. I fucking begged. And she just did the bare minimum. She didn’t put any evidence together. I am sad to admit this, but I think she reacted the way her ex expected to.

I went through 7 years of text messages, I made PDFs, I found texts from him to her during the divorce that said: “One day I’ll get my children back from you, no matter how long it takes.” “If I ever get them, they’ll never see you again.” And she just never gave it to the attorneys.

As time went by the kids stopped asking about me. 

The kids went with Dad. And at the next hearing she had nothing. And they appointed a Guardian ad Litem, an attorney to represent the kids. The visitation stayed as it was and when another month went by we learned that the two oldest kids did not want to go back with mom. The oldest kid, 13, said “I do not want to be around stepdad at this time. I do not want to do overnights with mom.”

Visitation was awarded from 1 day a week to 2 (but no overnights), them to the weekends (with overnights ordered by judge even though the 13 year old said she did not want to) and my wife just never pressed the issue.

Now we see the children on the weekends, he gets them Monday-Friday. The 13 year is now 17 and has had her drivers license for a year. Her father cannot afford to buy her a car at all.

This is where I am afraid I have become the asshole. The 17 year old came to us and said: “Can you guys buy me a car?”

I told my wife given how for over 4 years she didn’t want anything to do with us except for 1 day a week, and she wanted to live with her dad (and still does), and that’s who she lives with now, then she should depend on Dad to provide that for her.

Plus, I don't think my sister would like having 3 extra kids in her house every time she wants to see the kid she helped raise. 

Kelly and her kids are saying this is unfair and favoritism and that if Brooke gets to go, so should they but Brooke doesn't want to let them go and says if I try to make her take them with her, she'll move in with her aunt and won't come back. AITA for not sending my step kids with Brooke to visit my sister?",0.17
"AITA Wife wants me to deposit full gift into Joint Account A little bit of background. 

I met my wife 4+ years ago, we had a few months ago.  We have a solid relationship and I've never once thought about divorce.  During our relationship we have had a few hiccups including her treating me like trash for around a month after we found out I was not able to have kids naturally and her thinking it was because I was taking steroids (I was not). She has also been divorced twice when she was younger but one was because the other spouse wanted to open the marriage and the other was because the guy was a total POS.  I have never been unfaithful to ANY degree and have never said anything to the effect of ""We'll maybe we shouldn't be together.

Lastly I came into the relationship making good money with her and having around 200k of assets and no debt outside of a mortgage that have all grown and are worth around 400k and are all community property.  She came into the relationship with around 60k of debts and poor spending habits. Before we even got married I paid off a significant amount to debt collectors.   In the time we've known each other she has worked a steady 40 hours a week, I have worked around 50-68 hours per week, in fact I have been doing that for the last 15 years my life and I believe that is a big contributor to why I am  could be coming into a significant amount of money.  Now that we have a kid she has stepped back even further and only works around 32-35 hours per week, even after the kid starts school, this will continue.  I contribute at the house and with taking care of the kid as much as possible, to the point where I get maybe 2 hours a night if I am lucky to myself.  I am not materialistic, when I met her she was driving what I consider a higher end vehicle, I drove a 2015 base model beater, when I got a new car from work which was nice she immediately got a 2023 new car. 

I am possibly coming into a sizeable amount of money, it's basically an inheritance, my plan is to deposit 70 to 80 percent into an account in just my name and putting the rest into our joint account.  I would not be spending ANYTHING on stuff for just me and the individual account would still go to benefit the family, if I was to die she would inherit just about everything. 

My wife is claiming that this means that I plan on getting a divorce in the future and that it's not fair and that all I care about is money and that she doesn't care about the money but it hurts her to think I would protect these assets in some way. ",0.11
"WIBTA if I don’t include my roommate on an upcoming vacation? I’m going to try my best to squeeze the past six months into something that is not a novel, but bear with me. I met my two roommates online through a Facebook group last January, and while I absolutely adore one of them, the other one has become insufferable. 

We had all been messaging from January-August before moving in September. Over text, she was warm and friendly and we got along super well but she’s completely different in-person. She’s incredibly moody and treats me and my other roommate like shit when she’s in a bad mood — she’ll give us the silent treatment for days and then suddenly snap out of it and just claim that she was tired. She’s also very judgmental and shares details of our personal lives, such as me recently coming out, with her ultra-conservative boyfriend and then relays his unwarranted responses to us. So overall she is not a kind, caring person that I want in my life. 

Unfortunately, we do live together so I can’t completely cut her off. However, I’ve gotten to a point now where I don’t want to continue tip-toeing around her and letting her negativity impact how I live my life. I will be civil and respect that this is also her home, but I don’t want to invite her to join in things that take place outside of our apartment. 

For example, my other roommate and I are planning a trip for spring break and we don’t want her to come. She’s waiting to see if her boyfriend will visit during that time, in which case she won’t go, but she said if he doesn’t she’ll join us. She’s never asked and simply assumes we’ll wait to book things until she figures out her own plans. I’m tempted to book accommodations through Airbnb that have a maximum occupancy of two people in hopes of deterring her from joining. WIBTA?",0.03

"AITA for parking in someone else's driveway? The story is simple but context is important .

This story takes place in a small town in Spain. Most towns (meaning 99% of them) have specific regulations for driveways, where the owner must pay an annual fee AND hang an official sign (called VADO) next to the door , so people know they are not allowed to park there. 

Disclaimer specifically for US redditors: urban sprawl is not a common thing in Spain, so most towns / cities are compact and somewhat vertical. Even towns with a lot of independent housing are compact, and those houses are close of each other, on narrow streets with sidewalks and generally walled. Driveways are usually a narrow gate (3-4 meters wide), and vehicles enter through those ""VADOS"" marked with yellow paint on the pavement and the official sign on the wall.

 So, the story is at it follows: 

My wife and I pick our son from school every day on this part of town that has not a lot of parking. Sometimes the area is packed and there is this house with this driveway BUT without the vado sign. So it is legally permitted to park, as the owner of the house has not paid the permit to forbid others from parking in front of it.

We don't park there UNLESS there is no free space anywhere.

So we have had some arguments with the owner and their relatives about us being ""bad people"" , ""not thougtful"" and also got some insults and threats. 

Our polite response has always been : if you don't want anyone park here, just pay the license. Also to note that parking there doesn't take long... just 5 minutes, so if they REALLY need to get in / out of their home, they only would need to wait for 5 minutes.

"AITA for being on a hook up app, when I am in a monogamous relationship I (32M) am currently in a relationship with Justin (29M). Our relationship is fairly new. We met four months ago, and have been together ever since. 

When we met, Justin let me know that we would probably only get a few weeks together before he had to go to Europe to complete his last semester of college. I was fine with that because I’ve had long-distance relationships before and it was only for one semester.

So far, we have been managing the long distance very well. There are some difficulties mostly due to the time difference and how busy he is with school work. But we have been managing with open communication and a lot of FaceTime dates.

Last night I went out to the bar with my friends, and I’ll admit I got pretty drunk. I started telling them a story about 6 month this guy messaged me on this hook up app asking if I would poop on him for $80. (I declined btw lol) My friends didn’t believe me so I decided to re-download the app so I could show them and we all had a laugh.

This morning I woke up and the first thing I did was call Justin and he didn’t answer. I suffer with really bad anxiety and while I’m not proud of this I decided to check the app, and just to see if I found his profile in the country where he’s at. I found nothing and realized I was being jealous for absolutely no reason.

20 minutes later, I’m get a phone call from Justin and he is pissed off because he saw that I was active on the app. I tried to explain to him why I was even on it in the first place. The only part I didn’t tell him was that I had previously checked his city to see if he was on that app.  I could tell he wasn’t listening to what I was saying, and he kept making comments insinuating that I was unfaithful to him.  He even said that if I was going to be active on the apps, then he would be active on the apps himself. After going back-and-forth for a while, he finally told me that this whole conversation was making him lightheaded, and he would call me later.

On one hand, I’m annoyed because instead of him trying to even hear me out, he’s just assuming that I’m unfaithful. But on the other hand, I feel bad because I do recognize that it looks bad especially since he doesn’t know the full context, and why I was on there this morning. 

I have talked to a couple of my friends about this and most of them say I did nothing wrong. They say that I need to questioning him about why he was even on the app in the first place. But one of my friends tells me that I might be the asshole because regardless of me, telling a funny story to my friends, I probably should not have downloaded the app in the first place.  So am I the asshole?",0.67
"AITAH For getting upset about not having my boyfriend’s full attention while he’s playing a game? To put it short, My boyfriend (M20) And myself (21F) have been together for a year and a half, we both work full-time  but live with our parents still trying to move out. he absolutely loves Videogames just as much as I do, I bought him a brand new Xbox series X for his birthday because I knew that’s what he loved most. However he admits he’s extremely committed, and he can’t exactly multitask meaning I can’t have a serious conversation while he’s playing his game, or watching his YouTube shorts. if there’s a screen, he’s engaged. If I try to small talk to him he admits he doesn’t really pay attention since he’s occupied, I make small talk with him all the time while he’s gaming and most of the time he’s not all there. As much as it frustrates me sometimes, I try to deal with it. The handfull of times (4 times) I’ve asked him to pause the game for a couple minutes he’s gotten so mad at me then got off the game completely just to sit there and be mad at me, while I sit there and cry like an idiot. Ask, not yell or anything crazy, just ask if he’d please pause it so I can have his full attention for a few, not even 10 minutes like I tell him. Then he threw an excuse that he doesn’t like having a serious conversation because he said I get upset when I countered that all of those past conversations had nothing anyone should be upset about so that didn’t make sense. Then he’d get mad. I question whether I’m greedy for attention but it’s questions about something important that I just haven’t been able to ask or say any other time.",0.5
"AITA for not wanting to apologize for the contents of my bedside table Last week on my day off (I 26 Female) , my mom and I arranged to spend some time together and bake some bread since that is our new hobby together. I did also want to mention that her and I don’t ever get to spend time together since she runs a full time business and I work full time, and we haven’t spend time alone together in years. My mom most often sees my sister (30F) because my sister has two children and she wants to spend time with them. I don’t get jealous because they are children but I do miss my mom. my sister called me and invited herself to come with the kids. it is rare when they come over (bc my house not baby proofed)  
My one nephew (5years old) likes to play video games on my computer.My other nephew (2 years old) is pretty much going through every drawer and cabinet that is in the house and I’m trying to redirect him to a couple toys he could have. During this time I don’t leave either kid unattended for more than a minute. The youngest is getting into everything. But I am getting no help from my sister. My mom and sister are sitting at the kitchen table talking and providing no assistance to me while I go back and forth between the kids.   
Eventually I ask my sister to please watch the youngest.  She isn’t really watching him at all and my youngest nephew goes into my bedroom. I don’t let the kids go into my room because I have things like personal items, and a safety item in my bedside table. I have a good reason for the item and I lived alone for some time after an event.  Stuff I can’t get into. It’s a long story but everyone knows this in my family. I had my youngest nephew leave my room as his mom did not get him to leave. Back to the story, I hear my sister talking about my behavior because I seem annoyed and then grills me. I feel like I have to explain myself to everyone, even small children. I start saying I am overwhelmed, the kids are going through everything, and I am baby sitting when this wasnt the plan for today. My sister starts telling the kids that I want them to leave and that I am essentially kicking them out. Shortly after I texted my sister and apologized for my outburst and asked her to question me privately next time. I explained the item in my drawer and said that was a concern of mine that contributed to my overwhelm.   
She ignored me after reading my text to her for 2 days, she responded to my text a few days later wanting an apology for my item, upset at a hypothetical situation.  Anyways I do not feel like I want to apologize because I shouldn’t have to explain every item in my house and I didn’t sign up to babysit anyways. By the way I bought a safe for my item. Also I have my own house and it is up to me how I run it and don’t want to apologize for protecting myself.  I feel like I could be the asshole for not apologizing about the item just to squash this?

"AITA for telling my boyfriend my family is more important than him I (F 25) startet an argument with my boyfriend (M 28). This is not the first one but the one that escalated the most:

Regarding the background of how everything has evolved over the years:
I moved about an hour away from my family to study, met him in the new city, and we moved in together. It almost always leads to an argument when I visit my family. Here's what he says about it:

- I'm an adult woman and shouldn't constantly visit my family. Nieces, nephews, siblings, and parents are too many visits. (I don't even go to all birthdays.)
- They shouldn't ask me to babysit or help out; they never help out either.
- They constantly make me drive back and forth, but they never come by themselves (that's true, I invite them more often, but I think they're actually too lazy).
- It's too exhausting for him; there are quite a lot of people.
- We work, and he wants to spend his evenings with me; it annoys him when I'm not there on weekends too.

I also have trouble with my sister because she resents me for the last time she asked me to babysit and I declined.

I absolutely don't know how often it's okay to visit his family, whether I'm too clingy and helpful, or if I prioritize my family over my relationship. By now, I might be there for a day a month, sometimes two, and I don't think that's too much.

 By now, I get actual panic attacks when my family asks me for a favor or asks if I'll visit them at a time when I know it bothers him.

Today I came home and saw a message from one of my sisters, ""would like to go on vacation with the parents, can one of you take care of the dog for a week?"" That really brought my mood down because I feel guilty (it's also my dog), but I know I would have a big fight with my boyfriend if I brought it up. When he asked me what's wrong, I started crying and explained to him that the situation is weighing on me. He started attacking my family ""How often do people go on vacation, it's so ridiculous, nobody helps us either..."" and then against me because, I'm crying and unnecessarily ruining the day, he hasn't done anything.

I told him he would never be more important to me than my family (I knew it would trigger him). When I then said that my family isn't the problem, but his behavior towards me is, he completely lost it. 

I don't think I'm wrong but i feel guilty, so AITA?",0.16
"AITA for calling my bf, “my man” I’ll keep it short and sweet. I’m (25F)  dating a guy he’s great, I usually refer to him as “my man” rather than bf. I try not to talk about him much to my family because I don’t like the way they will bring him up later in a negative way unprovoked like they’ve done with exes. So I was talking to my mom and sent her a list of areas with good schools close to a city she is looking to relocate too. My bf sent me the list because he was raised in the area. She said “who sent you that?” And I said “my man”. And she got pissed off saying “you could’ve just said his name” which I’ve never told her his name and don’t want her to know until I’m ready for her to know it. She said I think I’m better than her and sound like I’m being a defensive bitch by calling him “my man”. Tad backstory my mom is single and has been for many decades and has issues dating and with men and general. I don’t really see the issue with me calling him my man as that is what I refer to him as when I’m talking about him to anyone. I think my mom is dealing with a bit of jealousy and feelings of inadequacy in her own life. I’m wondering if I’m the AH because I asked her if it would be an issue if I answered my “bf” instead of “my man” and she said it wouldn’t be as bad. My sister hates me and any chance she gets to disagree with me she takes it so she’s also calling me a bitch about it. I don’t know if I’m over looking something here or if this is just another weird toxic unnecessary issue my family who doesn’t really like me that much is blowing out of proportion.

"AITA for asking my brother if he is gay? I (17M) have a brother (14M) and he's constantly talking about how hes tired of being single and stuff like that and how I need to ""Put him on."" My girlfriend told me that she has a cousin(15F) and she showed her a picture of my brother and she was interested in him. She also plays in her schools band so I honestly thought they'd be perfect for eachother as my brother plays the trombone at our school. 

My girlfriend sent me a picture of her and yesterday I showed my brother a picture of the girl and asked how he'd feel about her and told him that she plays in the band as well. To my shock he said that she was pretty but he wasn't interested. I asked him if he was sure and he said yeah. So I asked him what his type in girls and he just shrugged.

So in my mind I was thinking like if he doesn't even know what type of girls he like do he even like girls. So I just asked him if he was gay and said I could probably find someone for him. But when I said that he got like super upset with me and started crying and told me that he wasn't. I got worried because I didn't mean to make him cry or upset him. 

My brother went to his room and my mom asked me what happened and I told her. She told me that I had no right to question his sexuality just because he denied some girl. I told her that I was only trying to set him up with someone since he asked me too and she said ""That's fine. However, when he rejects someone you have no right to question him on why he did that.""

 I tried to apologize to my brother but he just told me that it was fine and to leave him alone. This morning he's been ignoring me and I honestly don't know why. I tried to apologize to him again but he just nodded his head and gave me a thumbs up. Our dad said I didn't do anything wrong but my mom was like very adamant that I was in the wrong.

"WIBTA if I don’t pay my sister back for lunch? I (17f) have a friend (19f, let’s call her Sally), and we refer to each other as sisters since we’re so close.

So Sally and her friend Jane (19f) and I went out for lunch to an all you can eat place. Sally, Jane, and I all work, so the money for eating out with friends is ours and never from parents. Sally and Jane are in college w/ cars, while I’m finishing hs w/ no car so they have more expenses, but also work more.

We went there at ~11:30 as lunch is cheaper than dinner w/ the same food, lunch is ~ $25 and dinner is ~$45 (nj prices). 

Earlier, Sally’s manager wanted her to cover an extra shift, originally a 2-10 but it ended too late for Sally so she decided to do a 1-9 and her manager agreed, not giving us a lot of time.

There was confusion about how I’d get home, since Sally’s schedule means she can’t drop me off before work, in a rush before her shift, so it would be better for Jane to drop me off (she agreed). 

I was haggling on the phone with my mom (strict) for permission for Jane to drop me off, while Sally rushed to pay & leave so it was chaotic when the check for $45 was placed in front of me. I asked the waitress about lunch price but she said that’s only a weekday thing (it was a Saturday). I was panicking because I really can’t afford almost double what I’d budgeted for, when Sally apologized for not reading the website and offered to pay for me, since she hadn’t noticed herself. I double checked if she was sure, while on the phone with my mom negotiating ride permission. Sally said yes,, I said thanks as I got permission from of my mom, and Sally paid our bills.

Jane dropped me off, Sally got to work on time, all fine, except shortly after I get home, Jane texts me and asks me to pay back the 45 dollars I owe her.

I was shocked. First off, I can’t pay that and she knows. Secondly, Sally and I never did the “I owe you” thing. We go to get food often, for over a year, and it was always either both everyone pays our own bill, or sometimes one of us offered to cover. In the last abt 6-8mo, I’d covered for us both far more than she has. Over the summer I got extra hours, so I was covering about every other meal, and a lot of snacks and drinks, and continued to do so a bit less regularly through the fall, and once in a while in the last few months. I never asked Sally for money back, though she almost never paid for both, except one time I asked her for a few cents because I was short. I was ok with it because she has more expenses.

Tbh I expected when she offered to pay, it was cause she could afford it, since she’d mentioned picking up a lot of extra shifts since the holidays. I can’t, and wouldn’t’ve went if I knew the price. Most places we go, I either know the price or check the menu before but since this was all you can eat, I went with what Sally told me, as she’d been there before.

So WIBTA if I don’t pay Sally back? Or give her only the lunch price she told me it would be?",0.87
"AITA for hanging out with my friends the day after my partner got a major tattoo? My partner, we’ll call them Pat, got a major tattoo on their back yesterday, and while they were at their appt, some friends of mine invited me out their place to play a table top game we all engage in. Pat was fine with this, so long as they’d be able to come too and I could help them with their tattoo while there. They know one of my friends spouses really well, and usually they hang while we game. 

Well, it turns out the spouse didn’t want to hang out today (tired, just wanted a day to themselves), so Pat felt like they didn’t have the space to go and it would be kind of awkward. Pat said that they felt dejected and wished they could go, but that it would just be weird to not be able to hang out with their friend but also be there at the same time just hanging with us. Honestly I kind of agreed…it’s not that Pat isnt friends with my friends, but Pat wouldn’t have anything to do while we play. Anyway, Pat said it was fine that I still go and when I offered to reschedule they said it was fine and don’t worry about it, but I could tell they were upset. I was really hesitant about going and felt super bad, but again Pat said it was fine.

Now I’m over here feeling like a POS because I didn’t just reschedule like a good partner would, even thought Pat said it was fine. Their tattoo is really big and they can’t reach all of it themself, and they expressed yesterday that they were relying on me to help care for it and idk I just feel like a huge asshole now.

I'm taking AP human geography and (not technically an ap class, but it's a college class and I get most my homework from it) an EMR/ aintro to Health class. It's so much work I can't take it anymore. My daily schedule consists of, Wake up at 5:00, start walking the 45 minutes to school at 6:00, arrive at school just in time for it start at 7:00, go school for 7 hours until 2:10, walk the 45 minutes home and get there at around 3, do my homework until 5:00, make dinner until 6ish, my mom gets home and we all eat until 6:30, do my daily chores until 7:30, go back and finish my homework until 9:30, finally I can relax! Oh wait, nope it's my bed time and I have to go to bed because I'm only get 7 and a half hours of sleep as it is.

Anyways, Saturdays are the only day I get to sit down and relax so this Saturday I woke up at 12:00 because I was so exhausted (usually on weekends I wake up at 9ish). I get to go get some breakfast and the first thing I heard her say is ""finally someone's awake, hurry and eat your breakfast so we can start cleaning. 

I lost it. I yelled at her and said how unfair it was that I had to clean when I hadn't gotten to relax at all, and she said. ""You can relax while eating breakfast, if you live in yhis house your gonna help clean. It's not my fault your teachers give you homework."" She wanted me to clean for 4 hours which I know isn't a lot but i was so tired. I've tried to explain to her how I feel but she won't listen to me because this is her daily schedule.

they made me gain weight when i didn't want to, made me spend money when i didn't want to, and they refused to clean which along with my increasing depression and lacking will to live ended up making our small apartment one step removed from an active health hazard.

i moved out half a year ago, and i couldn't afford to send myself all of my belongings. so i asked them to, since they have a stable job and people who are willing to help them by virtue of being kind and also liking both of us. about a week ago i recieved one small box that had about three things in it, one being a blanket, then a broken mug of mine, then *empty* game cases — meaning the caseless cartridges are still with them. i am still missing far more important and expensive items, and i am not willing to wait another half a year for them.

with all that said, i know that their mother would be willing to help them not only pack my things into a box but would likely also help with the cost of sending them, but because of their strained history i know that my ex roommate would be livid with me for calling their mother on them. it seems juvenile to have to resort to ""snitching"" to someone's mom, but i'm sick of my things being withheld from me simply because they don't want to bother with it.

so, tldr, would i be the asshole for calling my ex roommates mother to ask for help getting my things back to me?",0.93
"WIBTA if I made pancakes for my younger children and not my older ones? Obligatory I'm on mobile excuse layout comment.

I (f33) have 4 children. 9f, 7f, 5m and 2f. On Friday, we were invited to the beach by my friend (28f) and her children (10f, 7m). My older girls share a room, and their room has been atrocious since Christmas holidays.

I told the girls if they got their room clean on Saturday, then we would go to the beach on Sunday with their friends. I think you see where I'm going here, they did NOT do it. It's now Sunday morning as I type this, and it is still not clean. So obviously, we're not going to the beach today. 

My toddler, not a huge fan of the water, but loves playing in the sand, doesn't really understand that she's missing anything, but my son is pretty upset that he's missing out because his sisters were so selfish and lazy. Said sister's have not apologized to him, even with prompting. 

I want to do something to make up for his missing out because of them, so thought maybe I could make him some pancakes for breakfast, but I don't think the older girls deserve that treat.

So knowing full well how upset/pissed off my older kids would be, WIBTA for make my younger kids pancakes?",0.8
"AITA for refusing to give my parents money for something I *thought* they didn't even *want* to do? For starters, I should mention I'm not a little kid (or even a teenager). I'm in my 30s (In other words, I'm past the stage of following my parents' every command just because they said so. We have more of a fellow adults relationship at this point than a parent/child relationship).

Anyway, I went out to lunch with my parents today. There was a lady with a booth set up outside the restaurant asking for donations. As we were about to leave, my parents commented that the donation lady is going to put us on the spot when we leave. Then my parents asked if I had any cash on me. They said they didn't want to give the donation lady their credit card. And they said they'd pay me back.

I said yeah, I have cash on me. But I refused to give my parents the cash.

Here's my explanation of why: When anyone asks for donations in front of a business (or anywhere on the street for that matter), it's a scam the vast majority of the time. I was under the impression this was a scam, my parents didn't truly WANT to give her money (especially with the comment they made about how she's going to put us on the spot), but they were simply looking to give her a little something to shut her up. The way I saw it, by refusing to give my parents cash, I was helping them learn to say no to scam artists.

Come to find out (and I had no idea of this until it was too late), the lady was looking for donations for diseased children. My parents said we ended up looking like jerks for saying no (and made me feel like a terrible person, saying this is yet another example of me acting difficult, etc).

So who's the a-hole here? The donation lady for putting people on the spot? Me for unknowingly making a jerk-like decision? My parents for shaming me over a decision I made *when I didn't even have all the details* (and I had valid reason to believe this was a scam)?",0.06
"AITA for wanting to be called by my name? Sorry in advance: englisch isn’t my first language and this is on mobile. 

So I‘ve been with my gf for a couple of months now and things have been fine so far. 
The only thing that really bugs me is that she won‘t stop calling me by one of those cutesy couples petnames (eg Honey, Baby, …). I never liked these petnames and told her so even before we started dating. They just make me feel unconfortable no matter who says them. 
I told her numerus times to please just call me by my name but she just tries a different petname the next time. 
I do feel like she’s just ignores a boundary because „she just felt like calling me that“. 

Sometimes I do ask myself if I‘m making a big thing out of nothing.

"AITA for not teaching a 1 on 1 lesson to a student who was 28 minutes late? I'm a private voice teacher who teaches voice lessons online via zoom. I quite literally built my business from the ground up starting two years ago and have almost 2 dozen students. My lessons are 45 minutes long. 

I've also been battling a pretty wicked sinus infection for the last few days, and currently feel like my head is being squeeze by a hydraulic press. 

I have a weekly student, let's call him G who has been relatively inconsistent with payments and scheduling times and I have been extra lenient with him as of late. 

Today he was supposed to have a lesson at 3pm  I sat in a zoom call five minutes past 3 and then got an email from him saying that he was almost home and he'd jump on soon. I reminded him politely that we'd still have to end at a quarter to 4. He seemed cool with that. At 15 minutes after, he attempted to jump in the call on his phone and told me he'd be willing to try in the car, but was having a hard time hearing me. Then he said that he'd just rejoin when he got home and that he was minutes away. 

10 minutes later, which at this point is over half way into the lesson time, he still hadn't shown, so I emailed him and told him that we'd be better off picking up next week, because of time constraints and left him a few vocal exercises to work on. 

I got a notification that he joined the call three minutes later but at that point it was 3:30, and we'd only have 15 minutes if he joined. 

I give all my students cancelation polices to sign and he agreed to them, so I feel like as someone who has given him grace multiple times, it was fair to do so.

"AITA for calling my wife selfish for wanting a pit bull? I (32M) and my wife (31) have been married for 2 years now. She always has been a dog lover; me not so much. For the past couple of months she has brought up about getting a dog bc she's never had to opportunity to have a pet growing up. I'm not very comfortable about the idea of living with animals in the first place, whether it's cats or dogs because I'm allergic and it causes me eczema outbreaks. She knows this. She always tries desperately to make compromises but I'm just not comfortable or want to deal with pets. I told her no several times and she's been upset with me for a couple of days.  
One day I finally relented because I wanted to make her happy and said we can get a dog but I'm going to try avoid it as much as possible. She was ecstatic. She expressed she wanted a pitbull. And this is where I drew the line. I told her I was extremely uncomfortable about getting a pitbull because they're bred for aggressiveness and due to their nature, they are unpredictable. No matter how much training you give, you can never predict when it will snap. I don't think either of us can handle a pitbull if it goes off the rails. We also have families with kids living on our floor.  
She started calling me a liar and saying how I was being selfish and it turned out into a huge argument. She just went on about how they won't attack anyone and that they're just as dangerous as any other dog WHICH IS NOT TRUE. I argued about how must fatal dog attacks have been from PITBULLS. I called her selfish and that's what set her off. We continued arguing for a while until I stormed off to cool down. We haven't spoken for 2 days except for dinner or if we need something. AITAH?  
TLDR; wife wants to get a pitbull, I don't like pets and have allergies and i don't like pitbulls which are dangerous and unpredictable dogs. I told her this numerous times. We argue. I call her selfish",0.29

Max has always been slightly overweight, not fat but not skinny either weighing around 250lbs at 6'4"". He was incredibly active in highschool Playing Football as well as wrestling for his school. He has always been a little embarrassed by his extra chub but has been slowly growing more and more confident as he has gotten older, which has been incredibly encouraging to watch.

My 39 F Sister who I will call Beth and I have never had a strong relationship, during our childhood she was often given preferential treatment due to minor health conditions she had which led to her constantly tormenting me until I was Finally able to move out at 18. After I moved I went limited contact with all family however when I began to have children My wife encouraged me to try to be more involved with family for the sake of my kids. My children became very close with my nieces and nephews over the years so I continued to Keep the peace for the sake of my kids.

All of this leads to today, my nieces 22nd birthday. Of course my family attended the party which was held at Beths house, In the beginning everything was going fine. The kids were Spending time with their cousins while My wife and I were enjoying the party as well. Max was sitting on the couch in the living room playing a game on his cousins xbox along with his younger cousin when Beth decided to provide the unwanted comment of ""you know Max, if you spent a little less time on those video games you could probably drop a few pounds... Maybe find yourself a girlfriend"" The party fell quiet as Max sat there embarrassed by Beths comments. I Responded to Beth by saying ""dont be ridiculous, this is a party. We're all sitting around eating and drinking having a good time. Why are you trying to embarrass him?"" To which she replied ""I wasn't trying to embarrass him I was just trying to offer him some advice. Its not my fault he's so sensitive."" After I heard that I snapped back at Beth saying ""Who the fuck do you think you are to be giving my son advice about his weight? Max Goes for a run every morning and works as a carpenter, when was the last time you climbed a flight of stairs?"" Beth, looking offended snarled ""Good lord I was just trying to help him out and you insult me like that, you always did have an anger issue, I feel bad for you wife"" After that I snapped, I yelled back ""You're just a fat bitch who tried to embarrass my son in front of all our family just so you could get some attention!! Then you have the balls to try and insult me? Go fuck your self you stupid bitch.""

"AITA for pointing out to my BF that his dog in heat laying in our bed is disgusting? My BF's dog goes in heat all over our bed sheets and even if you wash them the stains stay there just faded. This has been a complaint of mine for a long time and he does not care to put dog diapers on it when she is in heat. He had the nerve to tell me last time I got my period why have I left pads on the floor when it was my son who got into the bathroom sometimes and would tilt over the used trash. I was like really? Do you want to judge me for seeing used pads on the floor when your stinking bed is full of old dog heat stains?! At least no one lays on the floor to sleep; however, people lie in bed to sleep and use that!

He thinks the two scenarios do not apply and thinks comparing myself to a dog is pathetic. It is not when he is nasty when it comes to dogs in that sense. I don't even like dogs in bed period but one in heat and especially a huge one that drips more, yes that is disgusting and so infuriating that he wants to judge me when I get my period and I am a human and supposed to be his girlfriend.

"AITA for saying I have a ""partner"" instead of a boyfriend and not correcting people that my partner is a guy? So last year me (22M) and my bestfriend Jasper (23M) realized our childhood feelings for eachother. We're still the only guys eachother has ever been into and for most of our lives we felt we were just completely straight. We've just decided to stay unlabeled about our sexual orientation so far since we got together. We are officially a couple now and its definitely a change.But we just feel right together.

Jasper's always been more confident than me so he's more likely to just call  
me or introduce me as his boyfriend or to initiate PDA. Even though we dont live in the same small town we grew up in we still don't live in the ""friendliest"" place for a couple like us. When talking about Jasper (his actual name is kinda adrogynus)to someone I usually say my partner instead of boyfriend and I guess cause both of us are pretty ""straight passing"" they think I'm talking about a girl   who just happens to have the same name as my bestfriend/roommate. I don't usually correct them unless Jasper kinda just starts my hand if were somewhere together or something. 

I was playing baseball with a few friends I  met from my biology class yesterday and Jasper came to give me a ride home. He waited while we finished playing..After we got done he goes up says hey I'm  ""my name's "" boyfriend and they all like loook confused because I hadn't told them that Jasper was a guy. he looked confused and was I thought u already told them. I got kinda red and said I did just not that he was a guy.

He walked off all mad and I followed. He starts going off on me about how I  never correct people. I ask him why that bothers him so much but he refuses to answer.. his older brother is in town and I know Jasper confides in him even more than me. So I ask him while Jasper is asleep and he tells me that Jasper thinks I'm not all in and that I'm still struggling to be with him because I wont just say ""boyfriend"". That he thinks I'm just experimenting and not really in love.  I say of course Im not just experimenting I'm just getting used to it but his brother says I'm doing a piss poor job of showing it.

"AITA for asking my husband what he has planned for dinner for my birthday? I (24 F) asked my husband (30 M) what he had planned for my birthday dinner. I always go above and beyond for everyone’s birthday. I planned something very extravagant for my husband complete with his favorite foods, a chocolate fountain filled with cheese; because he loves cheese; and snacks, and family a couple months before. I don’t expect a lot for my birthday as we just recently moved and money is tight but I did expect my favorite food to be made for dinner and maybe a card or balloons. Nothing fancy I just wanted to be thought of in the way that I think of others. Well I asked my husband what he had planned for my birthday dinner and he got mad and started a fight calling me curse words and ungrateful because I got upset that he said the only thing he had planned was a cake that I have every year that I have to make.

Edit because I’ve had a couple comments asking about past birthdays 

We’ve only been married for 2 years and in the past we lived with his family while we got on our feet and they have a tradition that they’ve done ever since they were kids where the house is decorated with birthday balloons and HBD banners and a cake and a special meal or if we had the money we would go out to eat. And the whole day is tailored to what they like to do but like I said we just moved so I didn’t expect anything fancy or a lot of money spent just a little thought into what I would like for dinner because regardless of the day we still have to eat",0.11
"AITA for enforcing a rule and taking someone’s part? i (m16) recently wrote and directed a play for my schools international thespian society. i had originally casted “jason” (m14) to play the lead. i thought he was a nice enough guy, and we had gotten along fine up until this point. 

it’s a rule at my school that if you don’t show up to school, you can’t participate in any extra curricular activities after school. he didn’t show up for school on a day we had rehearsal, and was apparently unaware of the rule. i told him i could get in big trouble if he were there, and as the director it was my responsibility to tell him he couldn’t be there. 

for context, our theater teacher would always supervise rehearsals, but this was a few minutes before she arrived. so jason leaves in a huff, and a bunch of people are telling me i should have just let him stay since there weren’t any administrators around, but i would have gotten into big trouble for that. it’s not like i like the rule, and i’ve been in trouble by it before, but i was in charge and it was my responsibility to enforce it. 

then, jason starts texting one of our mutual friends “eff [my name], eff this play, eff [my name] and his boyfriend(making some pretty gross comments about him)” and that’s the point i thought he went too far. he dragged my boyfriend who had absolutely nothing to do with this into it, made that disgusting baseless accusation towards him, and was generally saying some pretty hurtful things about me when i thought we were cool. 

i had someone else fill in for him that day, and i sent him a message on instagram telling him that i was hurt by what he said but that id be willing to put it aside for the sake of the show if he was. he ignored my messages, so i started looking into someone else to replace him.

 he marched up to me the next day telling me that i can stop trying to replace him because he’s here. i told him the things he said about me were disgusting and i’ll do whatever i please with my own show. i ended up having to fill in for the role last minute because i couldn’t find anyone to fill in. 

my theater teacher advised me to just let him do it since he’d had the part for longer, but at that point he hadn’t been to a rehearsal for weeks and the show was the next day. he also refused to meet with me and the teacher to sort things out. i still wonder if i made the right call by making him go home and then replacing him. 

i feel like i might be TA because our friendship got really ruined by this whole thing and if I had just let him stay we could have avoided the whole thing, and if i’d let him play the part day of maybe we could have salvaged the relationship. i feel like i may have been too harsh in the whole thing.

"AITA for not wanting to watch my wife's TikToks? My (21M) wife (19F) and I used to do this thing where throughout the day, we would each collect TikToks while scrolling, and show them to each other that night. I say 'used to' because while I do still have things to show her every few days, I work full time and just don't enjoy using TikTok as much anymore, so I have way less. She, however, still uses it frequently and still collects things. The thing is, she collects like, thirty to forty-five minutes worth of them. All of them vary wildly from shitposts to drama to cute animals to fun facts she thinks I'll like.

I love her, and I love that she thinks of me even when I'm not around. I did the exact same thing back when we were both using TikTok around the same amount, though we usually had ten minutes of them each, tops. 

It's not like I'm mad that she's saving these videos for me, but I've told her before that sitting there for that long sometimes just feels like an onslaught of information. I'm well aware that I have a short attention span, and when I have the energy to sit down and force myself to focus, I do. But I don't have the energy to do that every day, and then the next day she finds even more, adding to the time commitment, meaning it will take more energy than usual to stay focused. I don't want to sit down and half-ass it or not pay attention, I want to be able to absorb what she's showing me, but it's getting to the point where I'm asking to take breaks in the middle.

I have communicated before what I stated above, about really struggling to keep my attention on the videos for so long. She said she understood, but nothing's changed. Whenever she asks if I can sit with her and watch the videos and I say no, which is growing increasingly frequent lately, she gets upset. Not *mad* upset, but visibly disappointed, and it makes me feel like shit. It's not that I don't want to give her attention. This is not the only way we bond. 

I don't know if I'm actually being the asshole here, if I'm just making excuses to ignore her. I don't like to disappoint her like this, and every time I tell her no even if I'm *sure* I have a good reason, the problem becomes twice as bad the next day and it becomes more and more difficult to actually make myself do it. Am I just making excuses at this point? Am I being an asshole?",0.25
"AITA for wanting my Fiance to do more around the apartment I don't know where else to ask this, so I'll ask here.   
My fiancé and I have been together for about 3 years now. I have worked for about 2 out of 3 of these years. We had a baby last April and I took a 3-month leave, because I had an emergency c-section and wanted to heal fully and to be able to enjoy the first months of my baby's life.

Well, I went back to work for about 2 months, and then my car broke down, and I haven't been able to have it looked at, and at this point, it was our only vehicle. Unbeknownst to us, his parents bought him a car for 5k. We used it for about a month or two, and the thing had issues where it didn't want to start a lot. it would pick and choose when it started and sometimes took over an hour for it to work. We thought we got it fixed, and then found out that the strut tower busted through the trunk of the car, so it is very unsafe to drive. Because of this, my job stopped giving me hours, simply because I wasn't able to get to work on a timely manner and because there were days where I couldn't get to work.   


A few weeks after, my fiancé's parents let us borrow his sister's car, because she is at college right now. It's been several months now, and I am a stay-at-home mom to our 10-month-old. But my problem is, is I am taking care of the baby 99% of the time, and he expects me to do all the chores around the house, because I don't work. but it isn't my choice whether I want to work or not. I feel like he should help out around the house. Basically, the only things I'd like for him to do to make my life easier, is to do the dishes and take the dog out in the morning before he goes to work and at night before bed. I also would like for him to do the litter box and garbage.   
Am I the A-hole for wanting some help around our apartment? I feel like I'm not, because I am only one person, and our baby is a very needy girl who takes up a lot of my time. He uses the excuse as he's too tired, doesn't feel like doing anything. He had to take care of baby, etc etc etc. and I am just like, but I take care of her all day, and I am still able to get things done, and taking care of her is a full-time job in itself. I love being able to be home all the time with her, but I am constantly drained and tired. I feel like it's just one sided all the time and I am at a loss of what to do. I feel like he doesn't care, and I'm not sure what to do about it. I don't know who to go to about this, as our family are too nosy to be in our business. ",0.08
"AITA for telling my wife to spend less time with me Coming in very fresh off another argument so we will see how this goes. Wife and I have been together for 10 years and have moved around every 2 years or so for work - sometimes for mine and sometimes for hers.

I am pretty independent and can manage fine on my own most days. I’m not super social but have a core group of close friends that are not local but we stay in touch often,  I also play in a bowling league and soccer league 2 nights per week + golf 1-2 times a month with a group of guys.  So, generally have enough outside social interaction to keep me happy and some local quasi-friends. 

My wife has a few close friends but no one local and everywhere we’ve lived she’s never really established her own things to do to find friends or establish a social circle. 

This leads to conflict as I can sometimes feel drained having to spend every minute together on the weekends or guilty when I have things going on without her. I’ve told her that she needs to find some social circle or things outside of our time together and work as I think that’s healthy for our relationship overall. I feel like an asshole though because I’m essentially telling her she has no social life and she feels like I’m trying to just push her away.

"AITA For wanting to follow my filmmaking dreams instead of comply with my family expectations? Hi reddit, I'm new here so I don't know what to expect but I really need some advice right now and a friend recommended this subreddit for some answers (sorry for the bad English, it's not my first language). 

I (24M) have always loved telling stories, since I was a little kid, my dream is becoming a big named filmmaker like Guillermo del Toro (I'm from Mexico so he is a big inspiration to me) so I'm currently trying to develop a horror series along the lines of supernatural that I have been writing for 4 years now. Yet this is very hard in my country, you need contacts that I don't have and I'm a rookie so I wanted to start my career before this series took off and tried to make an adaptation of a story called ""the russian dream experiment"". 

I tried to make this entirely with my own means but I was failing spectacularly, an aunt actually caught wind of my endeavor and gave me 300 dollars to make it, I was baffled and so happy.
But my aunt learned that it was in fact a story that existed (I told her that it was an adaptation of an existing story from the beginning but I guess she didn't put much attention) so she started barating me, telling me that I was just a copycat and that my story was trash, everything just exploded really because that was it for me, I defended my work and everything just went to shit from there, she scolded me and started to make criticisms of me, she told me that she was better than me and I couldn't even dare talk back to her or my dad because I was just a ""stupid little boy that doesn't know nothing about anything"", It was so bad that I actually cried, it was the first time that I cried from a place of frustration and impotence because I knew that she paid for the damn Proyect so I couldn't be mad at her and I just, I'm done.

I called my mother crying and she was furious, she gave me the support I needed and told me to follow my dreams so I took the decision to move to Canada as soon as I finish college to try and make my career from there, I know it will be harsh and difficult but I'm willing to do everything to become the person that I know I can be.

Since then my aunt have made fun of me on multiple occasions telling me that ""I don't have what it takes"". I want to stop receiving her help as soon as I graduate and I told my father my desicion but he is really mad that I want to cut ties with my aunt (I don't wanna stop seeing her, I just want to stop depending on her) and it has been subject of discussion in my house because he says I'm being ""disloyal"" and I don't know, maybe? She has done so much for me and maybe I should listen to her and start working part-time somewhere in my city instead of going to another country just to chase a foolish dream (Maybe I don't really make it and return to my family defeated and that would be really horrible for me).

I'm  really conflicted right now. So I ask you reddit: AITA For wanting to follow my filmmaking dreams instead of complying with my aunt's expectations?",0.33
"AITA for embarrassing my son's mom at her job? I'm divorced and receive $400 a month in child support from my ex wife for our 8yo son. That money goes directly to a savings account for him or when I need to cover an expense for him and don't have the cash. Whatever is there once I stop getting payments will go to him.

For the last eight months my ex has been late with payments. Anywhere from a week to two weeks. I finally had an argument with her over the phone about it in November. She was laying it thick about how money is and she's having health issues and boo hoo. 

I asked her if things were so bad then why did you buy a Mercedes? I told her if she missed a payment then I'll request that child support be taken out of her paycheck at work since she can't do it herself. Sure enough she was late again and I had Support Collect Unit get involved. Now they dock her paycheck. The order was issued to her HR department. She works in HR so her boss and coworkers all know she's not on top of child support.

She was outraged and said I embarrassed her at her employment and potentially cost her pay raises. I brought a private family matter to her employer and she had to have a meeting about it. She even said she has a medical issue that I made worse and she could die at any moment.

I told her I don't give a fuck. Go take cry in your 2022 Benz.

But I know plenty of women have found him attractive.

I was hanging with my friends and the topic of boyfriends and exes came up. My friend said that she didn’t find any of her ex boyfriends attractive per se and asked if we had felt like that before. I told her that of all my exes I only found 1 of them to be very attractive like conventionally attractive. I said that he would be hot by basically everyone’s standards. Then I said that my current boyfriend, while gorgeous to me, isn’t exactly that. He is attractive but not in the way everyone would agree with. My friends agreed and said he is cute but not their type. 


Later that night I hung out with George and he asked how my day was and I told him about the conversation. And he was offended. Very offended. I tried telling him that I think he’s hot and whatnot but he wouldn’t listen he kept insisting I was calling him ugly, which I absolutely didn’t. He went on a rant about how he was out of my league and that he has had multiple girls before me and could get many girls whenever he wanted. He nearly showed him his phone but pulled back. I told him to stop. But he wouldn’t. Eventually he went on his computer and put his headset on and completely ignored me so I just left. 

I went to home and cried. He ignored all my calls and texts. The next day he and I were supposed to hang out but he blew me off. When I called to ask what was going on he said he was hanging out with friends and he will call me back later but he never did. It’s been 2 days and he still hasn’t spoken to me, except for today when he texted me asking to borrow $100 dollars. 

I told my sister and she said I was an asshole for even bringing it up saying I should apologize immediately before I risk losing him. 

Was I the asshole here?",0.88
"AITA for not wanting to have a bridal shower anymore because I keep being forgotten by my family and friends? 
My MOH is planning my bridal shower for me this February. We picked this weekend because all my bridesmaids are off that weekend (which is very rare because most of us are nurses with super inconsistent schedules). Also, one of my bridesmaids lives across the country and will only be visiting this week other than the week of my wedding. So it seemed to be a great idea. However, this shower has been causing me nothing but sadness and stress. 

First, my grandmother (who I am incredibly close with) told me she wasn’t going to come to the shower because she was helping plan her nephews’ baby shower which is the same weekend and “couldn’t cancel”. I felt like she was choosing her nephews wife (who she barely knows) over me. This caused me a lot of hurt given that we are so close, I am her oldest granddaughter, and the first to get married in our family. We worked it all out (turns out she got the dates wrong) but nonetheless the damage is done. Then my FH told me my future MIL and all his sisters (he has 5) wouldn’t be able to come because his sister has a dance competition that day. I totally understood but was still upset about it. Again, we fixed the issue, my FH is gonna take his sister to the competition so my MIL can come. Than tonight one of my bridesmaids told me she wouldn’t be able to come because she booked a trip to Europe to see her boyfriend and totally forgot the shower was that weekend. I understood and told her I didn’t  want her to worry and knew she would come if she could. 

Honestly, at this point I wondering if it’s even worth it to have a shower. I’m feeling like it’s disappointment after disappointment. I don’t want to seem ungrateful or like a brat. I have never been someone who likes being the centre of attention. But at the same time this is the one time I get to be celebrated and I feel like it doesn’t matter to the people who are supposed to love and care about me. 

AITA? Should I still have the shower? Am I overreacting or being ungrateful?",0.53
"AITA For refusing to travel in the front seat? So, for a bit of context, I (M21) have been an incredibly softspoken person most of my life, doing what was asked of me all the time because I always felt like the stress of arguing was bigger than just giving in.

Today, I went out for a couple drinks with my older sister and aunt since we were meeting up with a cousin of ours. When the Uber arrived my sister and aunt asked me, as always, to go in the front seat. I had asked them before why would someone have to do that since we were 3 total + the driver, and they said it was more confortable that way. Despite very much disliking going in the front, I once again gave in.

After getting home, I spoke up and let them know I would no longer be the one to move seats for their comfort since I had zero problems sitting along two people in the back. My aunt said it would be the gentleman thing to do and I replied that it was a problem that they were creating and I no longer was willing to be the one to solve it for them since they could volunteer going in the front. She was ok with that apparently, my sister however was not having that and got very mad saying she hoped I didn't act like that with my girl friends, to wich I replied that I never had to, because we only have someone sit at the front of an Uber when we don't have space in the back.

Now, I should add that neither me, my sister or aunt are particularly big, we are all quite slim and I don't understand how they could feel uncortable having me in the back with them. I do understand that they would want me, a male, to go in the front IF we were in a bigger group, because Uber drivers are often male and in our society, sadly women are often at risk of being harassed, especially within a strangers vehicle.

I just don't think I should be cattering to an issue that they are creating, especially since both of them are the only people who I have ever seen asking for this kind of thing. I don't want to feel like I am minimizing women's struggles, but I'm tired of doing this and not saying anything, AITA?",0.18
"AITA for ""cheating"" on my math test? Last week, I took a math quiz and, in my opinion, performed exceptionally well for someone who is not great at math. For context, all test-takers in Ms. Jingles' class are allowed a notecard during their tests, where they can include formulas, problems from the study guide, practice problems, etc. I was absent for the initial test day, and the teacher granted me two extensions. On the first day of the extension, I couldn't take the test because my friend couldn't get a ride home, and she insisted I drove them.  
  
On the second makeup day, Ms. Jingles made an entirely new test for me, borrowing problems from the old test but changing the numbers so it wasn't exactly the same. This was in the same format as some of the study guides and tests. The study guide was essentially the same as the test, with only different numbers, and some of the answers were even the same. This carried into my rationale for what I did next.  
  
I borrowed the older version of the test from my friend Peter, who was not in my class but had already taken it, and copied the problems down onto the notecard. I simply thought this was acceptable, considering the test was essentially the same as the study guides, and I was copying problems from that.  
  
Later that day, I showed Ms. Jingles my notecard, and she approved it, but I guess she didn't look hard enough. She then made me go down to the teacher's lounge and take it while she had a meeting, constantly watching me.  
  
The next day, the dean, Mr. Howard, talked to me about how Ms. Jingles told him I had cheated on the math test. I explained that I thought I was using the resources available because using an old test was similar to using the study guides, which were always in the same format but with different numbers.  
  
I learned that the teacher tried to accuse my friend in the class, Gavin, of helping me cheat, even though he clearly had nothing to do with it, and it wasn't him. Ms. Jingles told me I should tell her, but I said I'd rather take a 0 than tell her who I got the old test from (Peter).  
  
Later that same day, I had Ms. Jingles' class. In class, she began by asking the class about hypothetical scenarios on what cheating was, without directly asking if it was cheating or not and what the consequences should be. It was clearly about me, even being very specific. She asked questions like:  
  
1. ""Would it be rude if someone got an extension and cheated?""  
2. ""Is it cheating if someone uses an old test?""  
  
The class knew it was about me too, and they gave mixed answers, which made me even more upset. I was going to talk it out with Ms. Jingles after class, but if she wasn't going to face me and talk about it head-on, instead going to the dean first and not talking to me, being the adult she is, then I felt I shouldn't either. Although I did later that day apologize, but not right after class as I felt I should've. I apologized kind of half-heartedly.

"AITA for giving my roommates 1 month notice before moving out This week, I 26F gave my roommates Nigel (30M) and Fiona (27F) a one month notice of my moving out, does this make me an asshole? 

Background: I have always fantasized about having my own place and in my free time I often look into rentals in my area. This has been a habit of mine for about 4 or 5 years. 

What happened: In January I guess you could say I entertained the idea of getting my own place more seriously. A little less than 2 weeks ago, I was surfing all the usual sites, and I saw a rental that I really wanted to tour. I toured the place and loved it. I signed my lease and received my keys 1 week later. I told Fiona and Nigel that February would be my final month (on the same day I signed my new lease). For clarity, I said that I would pay through February and be off the lease for March.

Today: Fiona, Nigel, and I sat down because they had a few questions/details to iron out. After we figured things out, Fiona really laid into me - for lack of a better term. Saying that what I did was f**d up, shady, inconsiderate and that she basically doesn’t consider me a friend anymore. She said our friendship was a waste of her time. She also said that I have a history or pattern of discarding people when they don’t serve me anymore. I asked what relationship she saw that in, she referenced when I didn’t give 2 weeks notice at my recent serving job. 

For context we have known each other roughly a decade, and have lived together for 2 years.

I may be the asshole because: I gave short notice, and didn’t tell my roommates when I was in the “seriously considering it” phase. I planned to tell them the day after I toured what is now my new place, but we had schedule conflicts, and I ended up telling them a week later.

Fiona also noted that “anyone” who had “just the stated facts” would agree that I was TA. So I tried to keep this to just the facts, please let me know if you see personal opinion so I can edit and remove.

So, reddit, am I the asshole? 
Edit: I would like to know if I’m TAH in the context of these people being my friends. Did they deserve more notice because they are my friends?

P.S. also wondering if this situation would constitute as “disgarding of people who no longer serve me”


Edit 2: When we spoke today, I let both of them know that I heard where they were coming from and apologized. I understand it is a bit of a blindside and puts them in an stressful situation. Fiona essentially said what I did was me showing my true colors and she doesn’t F with me anymore bc I’m shady etc.",0.08
"AITA for not repaying student loans my mom took out in her name? (EDIT)

My mother disowned me due to my sexual orientation, told me I was no son of hers and that she would never claim me as her own. 

I arranged a meeting with a trade school, they had a representative come to my house and I had my mother attend as we went over the specifics of what the school would entail and options for loan and whatnot. He directed us towards a parent-plus loan. The original agreement was that I was to pay off the student loans myself.

Fast forward a few years, and I have left school, working in my trade career. I'm paying all my own living expenses as well as making payments towards the loan. Total amount after graduation was around $40,000 or so. I paid the loan down to around $11,000. Then my mother and I have a falling out, she has been completely removed from my life. 

Just before we had a falling out (for separate reasons than this post), and her divorce with my father had been completed, she wanted to buy a car. She had noticed that her credit had jumped significantly over the last few years and thought she was in a good position to get something newer and more reliable. So she goes to get a loan for the car, and it gets denied due to her having too high of a DTI. She calls me and demands that I have to get the loan ""transferred"" to my name so she can buy a car. I did try looking into it, called the lender multiple times trying to figure out what the options or process would be but was left on hold for hours and due to my work schedule and their operating hours it was proving difficult. So it was never done. Then loans went into forbearance for a while. I had paid way ahead on loans so I took the opportunity to stop paying on them for a while. Since the falling out I haven't paid anymore towards them.

Now, my mother is using my oldest sister to try and get ahold of me to get the loans transferred once again. The original lender has been bought out, and is now contacting her to set up a new account to continue payment. We haven't spoken in 3 years. I'm not tied to the loans in anyway, she completely disowned me but still wants me to take these on as my own. I explained to her that the reason her credit-score had gone up was due to me paying off a loan that was solely in her name. I lost out on years of credit building history. Then as soon as it was an issue for her thats when it all of a sudden becomes my issue to resolve and responsibility to take on. During that time of repayment I even bought my mom a car because she was so poor and her car was so old and broken down she couldn't get to work. I've done more for her than anyone in my family ever has. But now that the connection has been severed, I no longer feel that it is my responsibility to handle. She's a grown adult that signed onto a loan on her own, that (as far as I am aware) has no legal tie to me. 

So, AITA for just telling her off and that its her problem to deal with?",0.44
"AITA for telling my mom to fuck off and that I demand ALL of my money back? So, I (17F) have never had a good relationship with my parents. We are a poor immigrant family and don't have much. Just enough to have a roof, clothes, and food. Zero luxuries which I have always been upset about. I decided when I turned 16, I would get a job and buy myself anything I wanted and that is exactly what I did. I got a job as a cashier at a small restaurant in town. I don't care about my grades in school (as long as I graduate, I'm a straight C student) and I don't have any friends to hang out with or talk to, so I had a lot of time to work and earn a lot of money. In just a year I was able to make a decent amount of money.   
  
I spent some money on stuff I wanted for myself, helping my parents with bills here and there, but I mostly saved most of it because I don't have any college aspirations after high school because of my poor grades so I needed the money to move out (my original plan.)   
  
  
As stated before, I come from a poor immigrant family. My parents don't earn much but what little they do make; they send a lot to family back in their country. I never really cared, as long as our basic living needs were fulfilled, I couldn't give a damn. I didn't give a damn until 6 months ago; my parents approached me asking me for $3000 to send to my uncle back home. I said no because my money/ My parents didn't accept that. They insisted on it, they promised me I'd get all my money back. I still have my job, so I'd still have more money. I gave in to make the pressure stop and gave them the money. They told me I'd have it back in 5 months; it's been 6 months. When I asked them about the money, they told me my uncle needed more time. I got upset but what could I do?  
  
Today, my parents told me that my uncle could only afford to give me back only half the money. I got angry and asked why and it all turned into a massive argument between my parents and me. My dad actually sided with me, but my mom just told me to accept it because I don't need the money since the government will pay for my housing and everything after I graduate (I'm joining the U.S. Airforce after high school.) I got even more angry, and everything turned to yelling. My mom stopped talking about the money and told me not to yell at her because she is my mother and she deserves my respect, and that I need to accept the reality she is telling me. I told her that her telling me to accept half of my money being stolen is more disrespectful than me yelling at her. I went to the extreme and told her to fuck off out of my room and to leave me alone. At this point, my dad pulled her out and told me to lock the door.   
  
  
Hours later I'm thinking about all this and wondering if I want too extreme. I do believe there was already a mutual disrespect among us.

"WIBTA if I call the AP’s wife years after the affair ended? I recently (just recently) learned the identity of the AP that destroyed my marriage.  And that he was married at the time.  And he’s still married to the same girl, apparently.

  
Background:

  
I married a girl (call her Michelle) 10 years ago after dating her for about 6 years.  I brought her to live with me.  She took a job working as a bartender at a nightclub near our home. 

There, she met a guy I’ll call Andy.  Less than 1 year after I married Michelle, I was seeing numerous indicators that Michelle was cheating on me.  I was constantly being accused of cheating on Michelle with absolutely no evidence to support that.  But there were other indicators.  Once, Michelle passed me her cell phone to watch a movie trailer.  While watching the trailer, a text popped up from “Andy” saying, “Hey, can you send me some more naked photos?”  😉

  
At that point I was confused.  See, I’d already done a bit of detective work.  I was 99.99% certain my wife (of 1 year) was cheating on me with a guy named Sven.  So when I saw the text from Andy, I was wondering if that was the way she referred to Sven.  Or, was I wrong about her screwing around on me with Sven?  Was she actually screwing around on me with Andy?

I eventually found out she was having sex with apparently every guy in the county except her husband.  Some of the guys I knew, some of them I did not know.  Her most significant affair was with a guy named Andy.  For a while, Andy and her were actually engaged.  Yes, engaged.  While she was married to me, she was also engaged to Andy.  

  
But I knew the full names of some of the affair partners, and only the first name of Andy.  
While I couldn’t prove anything, I was not stupid.  So I of course divorced her.  
But ironically, after the divorce I remained friends with some of the affair partners, including Sven.  

  
Sven had proof (photos, screenshots of text exchanges, etc.) that Michelle was both having sex with and \*engaged\* to Andy.  He gathered this evidence (ironically) to prove that Michelle was “cheating” on Sven, as Sven was also nailing her…

  
I’m still friends with Sven when Sven learns his own new wife is cheating on him, and he has irrefutable proof of same.  He does research on the AP, finds that he’s married so he calls the wife.  The wife is filing for divorce in an at-fault state.  Sven is also filing for divorce.

  
But while Sven is telling me all this, he confesses (because now he knows how it feels) that he and Andy were both among many guys screwing my wife.  And he provides the full name and “proof” related to Andy.  

Quick research on Andy shows the guy is currently married,  and WAS married while he was banging my wife.  I have the wife’s contact information, they live in an at-fault divorce state.  Would the wife want to know her husband was banging my wife in 2015?  WIBTA if I called her?

AITA for not wanting to watch church? So I (16m) am an atheist of 2 yrs my parents found out Abt a year ago my dad had taken it pretty well and my mom never mentioned it. But for about a year and a half we have watched a church Livestream every Sunday. I personally do not want to watch it because I simply do not believe in the thing but my parents are forcing me to every Sunday.                                                                                     _.

I don't like it but they won't stop I keep on telling them that I don't want to and that I'm not going to believe it simply because I watch Church but it doesn't seem to get through to them .I try to have conversations about my stance and my beliefs but they shoot me down instantly and either say I don't want to talk about right now or why don't you just try it whenever I was legitimately a Christian for 14 years before this.                                                                 _.

And I simply say I already did try it I don't believe it . Every once in awhile they like pull a call to action or something where they're like God has an intention for you and I'm just like no I have no completely universal purpose I only have the one that I set for myself.

"AITA for telling my MIL she can get herself a glass of water in my house Bit of a long one sorry.

My husband (34M) and I (34F) celebrated 14 years together yesterday. We have 2 kids. 11M and 5F. My MIL is very narcissistic and used to have a very emmeshed relationship with my husband, her youngest son. Since  the early stages of our relationship she was very uncomfortable with my presence in his life as he started to spend more time with me and gave me more attention. It also became very clear very quickly that she felt threatened me being in his life. I tried to be the voice of reason about the way she would talk down to him, belittle him in front of people and used him to regulate her emotions because she had no coping skills as an adult.  At some point she made him choose between her and his wife.... infront of me. He chose us and was was livid.

  
Fast forward years later, we got married, had kids and built a lovely life together. Since then, I have set firm boundaries and have established a limited contact relationship with her that my husband supports.  
  
My husband has a really good job that allows him to work remotely so he is home everyday. My MIL would show up sometimes at our house for the entire day, for no reason. She is also not willing to help herself to any tea or food and demands a lot of attention from my husband. We have set a boundary 'just because husband is home, doesn't mean he is available' It is a work in progress.

  
Yesterday when I arrived home, she was there too. MIL asked our 5YO to get her some water, my 5YO went to the cupboard, got a plastic cup that she was able to reach and went to the bathroom sink to get some water and very proudly offered it to her Gran. MIL freaked out because ""how do you expect me to drink water from the toilet."" she says to my 5YO who is on the verge of tears. MIL was still in the process of ranting at my kid when I stepped in ""If you are unsatisfied with the care our 5YO offered you, you are most welcome to help yourself or leave but I will not tolerate treatment of my kids like this. Why did you not help yourself in the first place."" She then proceeded to look to my husband for support, he only offered her a glass of water from the fridge. Didn't address the situation.

  
I am obviously upset as I hoped he would defend his daughter if not me too. At dinner we had a conversation about it. I said I did not like her actions nor his non action and I would like if in the future he would please stand up to his mom when it came to his kids. He said I was over reacting.

  
For context, we have things like this happen all the time where MIL would shame my son for cosplaying. Or demand he changes out of his anime merch before leaving the house with her. my daughter is not allowed to wear 2 different color socks when they go out to Gran. My kids choose their own clothes. We only step in when they try to take something from the dirty laundry. We let them express themselves.

"AITA for asking my girlfriend about the smell after she uses the bathroom Tldr i am the asshole i just want to know how i should have asked or if this is one of those things that you dont ask

So me and my girlfriend of x years started living together recently and ive noticed that if i ever use the bathroom after she pees theres a smell and im curious 

I wasn’t going to bring it up but tonight we were having a deep conversation about our relationship and various other things after fighting on whether or not this would be a good opportunity to bring up the question i have 

Side note we live with others so when we talk about personal things we usually type them and show the other

My first mistake was even bringing up tjat i had a question i didnt know how to ask. Bc once that sentence came out of my mouth i had to tell her. So i decided to try and word it, im a slow typer so she kept telling me she hates how i bring up things bc i make her feel likr its gonna be something horrible. 
Heres what i typed and my thought process
I don’t exactly remember 

“ 
“Does my pee smell” I figured this would be a good way to make it seem like it was out of genuine curiosity. Bc it is
“Is it a woman thing” same as above

Then as she read it she made this face of almost horror. And asked if i meant it smelled bad. I said that i wouldnt classify it as bad. She said that she didnt think it smelled and that it might be the sink. 

Then she said now i have another thing to be insecure about. 

This is where it hit me that im an absolute dick. Then we both got quiet and the conversation ended. She turned over in bed and hasn’t said a word to me(i dont blame her). I sent her this text a bit ago and she read it

“That is one of the things that you were me you would’ve not said

"AITA or am I being held to a high standard Please be easy on me! I’m not trying to be an Asshole I swear! I’m genuinely looking for opinions on whether this is a reasonable request for all time or if maybe it’s something for her to kind of analyze and work on? I’m doing my best over here!

My gf and I (we are both women) were having a lighthearted conversation. She goes to the bathroom. I say a few things until I realize she closed the door. Then I’m just walking around in my apartment sort of talking to myself, kinda laughing to myself. I’m walking around because I’m getting ready for bed and turning the lights off and such. 

She comes out of the bathroom looking upset. I’m like confused, what did I do? She says “hey you were shouting to me through the bathroom door and I told you that gives me a lot of anxiety. I had so much anxiety in there” 

Now…I’m pretty good about admitting when I’m wrong. And yes she totally has told me that she has anxiety when I talk to her through the door during an argument. But like, this was not an argument at all, I swear. I was walking around MY apartment just talking out loud and I didn’t even realize she was in the bathroom at first. I told her all of this and she got upset me with me. She told me that I don’t care about her feelings! I even said “if we were arguing and I was shouting at you through the bathroom door then yeah that’s wrong! But like I can’t guarantee that I won’t walk around my apartment talking to myself a bit. I just think you could give me a little grace in this situation” 

Also I’m just gonna add for context, she is currently sleeping on the couch for some pretty awful things she said to me last week. She waited three days to apologize ! But she can’t give me grace in this situation…",0.75
"AITA for asking a customer for paying for her groceries before she eats them This is my first time doing an AITA, so I’m sorry if this is going to be long winded.

I (21M) work at a combination market place and fast food restaurant. I generally operate the market area. Often times there will be customers who will pick some groceries and then pay for them at the register for fast food. I’m not bothered by that, I’m sure there’s probably a reason like credit score or something. 

This time, a woman (I couldn’t really grasp an age, I’d probably say late 20s) grabbed a bag of Cheeto puffs and went in the line for food. Around 5 minutes later I see she is still in line but the bag is open. I ask her “ma’am, if you’re going to open them, can you please go ahead and pay for them.” She said she was going to go ahead and pay for them with her food, but I insisted that she pay for them. 

Her husband is the one to come and pay for them, and as I’m scanning the Cheetos, he says “my wife is pregnant, that’s why she was eating them.” I legitimately did not notice that when asking her, so I don’t know if she is still very early in pregnancy or if I just didn’t notice something obvious. 

Anyway, as he’s paying for it, he goes “we were not going to shoplift $5 chips” and I did feel bad for maybe coming off as accusing, but I still feel like it’s expected that you don’t start eating something until you’ve paid for it.

If this is an IATA, then I understand and do accept that.

"AITA for rethinking my relationship because of my partner’s kid? Hi all! In October I moved out of state to live with my partner of a year. When we discussed me moving in, the plan was for his 18yr old to have moved away to college. Fast forward, she dropped out of the first college after only giving it a month saying she was miserable and wanted to come home. She did do all the legwork to apply immediately to another college, but instead of living on campus, she is living back at home and commutes. She is an extreme homebody and I feel that it’s effecting my relationship with my partner as we really don’t have any alone time anymore. She’s home every evening and wants to always be involved in our plans. This isn’t the living situation I signed up for and I’m struggling with instituting boundaries. Shes extremely smart and independent, but also very 18. I don’t have any children of my own by choice, and while I really love her, I’m not sure this is sustainable long term.

"AITA for changing my name in front of foreigners and people who don't speak my native language? I recently visited my partner's county and hometown. My name is Elena, but literally every English speaking person pronounces it wrong (like Ei-lay-nah), which is not how you say my name in my country and that has always slightly annoyed me. 
So, for years I have been introducing myself as Helene/Ellie to foreigners. My family and friends know about this and it has never been an issue. 
Fast forward to today, my partner has expressed his discomfort that I told his family to please call me Helene or Ellie and not my real name. I just replied to him that I'd rather not hear my name be constantly butchered. I got the feeling that he wanted to imply that I'm acting wrong.

Cam and I never got along. He was always that ugly nerdy kid that everyone makes fun of. I guess he is still salty about our childhood and is holding a grudge.

I have a 14 daughter Thea who is a mini version of me and I guess because of this Cam doesn't like her. My sister however adores Thea and of course she wants Thea to be a junior bridesmaid in her wedding.

She asked Thea and Thea was trilled and accepted it quickly. 

Cam was not happy about this and my sister and Cam started arguing over this in front of Thea. I could see that Thea was upset and had tears in her eyes because her soon to be uncle didn't want her in his wedding.

"AITA for raising the price on someone after he insulted me? I'm a electrician and I run my own company. I got a call about an emergency, a guy is supposed to host a baby shower for his wife and he's a bit stressed since many of the light switches and outlets aren't working. I get there and I see its only going to take a few hours of work so I only charge him 250. As I'm fixing it the guy says to his son in Korean ""see this is why I tell you to study so hard in college, do you want to be like this guy, doing monkey tasks repairing stuff in people's homes? This guy couldn't go to college, study hard so you don't end up like him."" 

I worked in the navy, I was a Cryptologic Technicians Interpretive, basically I was a Korean linguist and I'm proficient in both North and South Korean dialects. I responded back in Korean ""being an electrician is a very highly specialized skill, if its a monkey task why can't you do it? Just for that, I'm going to increase my rate to 500"". 

One of the other kids who was on the other side of the room on her phone burst out into laughter and her dad yelled at her telling her to shut up. He profusely apologized and said it wasn't what he meant and tried to change the subject and asked me how I know Korean so well, that I almost sound like a native. I told him I don't care and I'm still raising it to 500 and he begged me not to saying that his wife will kill him. I told him fine, go find another electrician I'm done. It was friday evening and his wife was supposed to return in a few hours, baby shower would be the next day so no way he's going to get someone on such short notice. He reluctantly agrees and we raise the price to 500. 

The wife showed up when I was about ready to leave and she asked him how much, he said 500 and she yelled at him in korean (she's unaware that I speak Korean) saying why he got ripped off and he kept trying to shush her and she kept yelling at him saying ""don't tell me to be quiet"" and to answer him and he said ""lets just talk in another room"" and she kept yelling at him saying I scammed him so I responded back in Korean ""I was only going to charge 250 but your husband insulted me in front of his kids so I doubled the price"" they went into a massive screaming match but they carried it outside. I packed up my shit and left. The kids of course were laughing but then the parents yelled at them to go to their rooms. They left a nasty review pretty much lying sayign I scammed them and whatever so I responded back, in Korean and English, explaining what happened. They then deleted their review.

"AITA for being upset whit my boyfriend because he doesn’t share expenses We are together for a bit more than a year, he is really nice and kind but when money enters the chat, is not the same.
We were planning to move out together and we even talked about getting more serious (marriage). Of course we want to go one step at a time, so it came the opportunity to get a place together, the problem started when he told me we need €1200 for the deposit of the apartment. Clearly it should be half - half, shouldn’t it? There are so many things here…
Currently I’m a working student, I have a job but my salary is a third of what he earns as a full time. He thinks it’s fair we both pay half of everything (groceries, internet, etc), I told him I literally can’t. 
As I said before, we talked about the deposit and even though I was willing to pay half of it, right now I don’t have the money and I would need to save some before. Here comes the worst part, he has savings (a lot), I understand that’s his money but I asked him if maybe he could lend me the money and I would pay him later, he said “what? that’s my money” and he started to tell me that there’s this website where I could get the money for the deposit and bla bla bla. Of course I would have to pay some interest, and how tf he thinks I would be able to do so if I can’t save money, I won’t save even a cent if we share expenses half-half. 
There is something important to clarify, I can ask my dad for money (because my bf also told me to that), but I don’t want to. Since this is my first time living with someone I don’t think is okay to ask my dad for money so I can live with my boyfriend, also I want to show my family that I can do it alone, I want them to feel proud of me and not to think that every time I am making an “adult” decision I’m calling them for money. 
I know my dad, I know he wouldn’t even think twice and he would give me the money but no, it’s not okay. 
Also, we both live in Germany and we don’t have our families here. Less than a month ago I went to America to see my parents, (I don’t know if what I’m a about to say actually makes me the a-hole) and I spent more than $600 on gifts for my bf. He never went to America and I wanted so bad to show him everything, I ended up buying a lot of stuff for him so i can get a bit of the country for him. I didn’t even thought for a minute about the money, I just wanted to make him happy. 
My dad once told me that if some day I need money for starting a business or whatever, there’s some sort of inheritance for me… you know what I was thinking? To start a business with my boyfriend, I was willing to give him half of that money so WE can have something together.
Now all this happened and he’s giving me this kind of answers, I’m sad folks.

"AITA for not taking my sister to the hospital for taking an edible I’m 24F and went to my parents to set up a party for my dad’s birthday with my fiancé (Michael), friend (Rachel) and sister (Amber). For context I’m 7 months pregnant and both me and my sister work in the medical field. Michael and Rachel usually do edibles at family events rather than drink (it’s legal to buy and consume where we live and it’s from a legal dispensary). Amber usually doesn’t drink or do edibles as her boyfriend won’t let her. He wasn’t at the party and so she wanted to experiment and take an edible. We all thought it would be a great idea since she wanted to for a while, I’m pregnant so I would be able to watch her sober and she’s smoked weed in the past. She wanted two 10mg edibles at first when we all suggested 5mg. She compromised by just taking one 10mg edible and proceeded to panic with questions about how long it takes to kick in, if she’ll dissociate, have psychosis, die, have other medical issues. She’s a psychiatrist and claimed to know so much about weed so it was shocking to see her ask questions like that. We all reassured her saying she’ll be fine as long as she relaxes and we can celebrate my dad’s birthday. As we’re eating dinner she suddenly asked Rachel to go upstairs with her. I got worried so I went with Michael to check on her. She then proceeded to tell everyone she’s not feeling well and she wants to call 911 to go to the hospital. We tried everything to calm her down, I offered to help her by checking her vitals as I work in neurosurgery and see patients in many different states on different drugs until she shoved my hand away saying you’re not a doctor what do you know. (She’s always been competitive/ has an ego over the fact that she’s a doctor). She told Rachel and Michael they wanted her to die and started blaming everyone for not taking her seriously. At this point she was getting too aggressive with me and refused to listen to anyone. I decided to tell my parents she was high and demanding to go to a hospital despite having absolutely no reason to aside for checking into psychiatric treatment. My parents being horrible enablers decide to rush upstairs encouraging her saying they would help her go to the hospital and take care of her. Growing up she’s always had an issue of being too dependent on my parents anytime she has any issues and now she’s 33 asking to sleepover their house anytime her boyfriend won’t be home. I tried to tell them to let her be and stop enabling her negative behavior but they refused to listen. Magically she calmed down and was not dying when they came rushing in with help. Am I the asshole for not taking her to the hospital and for trying to get her to be independent?

"AITA Elitist High School About 20 years ago, I went to an elitist regional high school. My parents sent me there in hopes of building a better life than the ones they had. We didn't have a lot of money so this was a huge act of love on their part. I knew going into this school it was going to be a culture shock, but nothing prepared me for what I encountered. The school was built around its sports program, and it drove the majority of their revenue. The varsity sports players ran the school - to a level where you would not imagine. I got two detentions once for being late to lunch, and the afternoon of my first one, 4 football players were pulled out of detention to attend a practice. Stuff like this was commonplace.

I was a very quiet kid, but every once in a while I'd try to say hi to someone new and chat about a class or homework assignment. There were no friends to be had outside of a close group of us that could not stay after school. These people really did look down on the rest of us, whether they were conscious of it or not. I remember being bullied for talking to a few of the preppy guys and girls and being told to ""go back to playing my gameboy"".

So one day, I overhear the football players and they're laughing loudly. There was apparently a huge party that weekend. Other people were walking by and chatting them up and laughing. I kept hearing ""is Gill okay?"". Gill did not come to school that day. Eventually it gets around that a football player had a party with booze, weed, and rumored other designer drugs, and that Gill had ""fallen asleep in the driveway"". Someone had hit him with their car at a very low speed. The part that confused me was hearing that the police showed up and everybody had dispersed. How did nobody get arrested for this? It turns out the chief of policy's daughter was at the party. And who was the host? Mr. Gameboy comment. At this point I flew off the handle. After school I *67'd our town newspaper and gave them all of the details. Names, people, Location, cover up. They printed the story on the front page of the town newspaper. The host was suspended for a week and kicked off the football team for life. He went to a no name college after that and didnt play sports. A few other players got probation and missed some key games. We had an assembly to talk as a class about not drinking and being responsible. Princess Police Chiefs family was embarrassed but they weathered the storm. I destroyed the lives of a few athletes who did not go to their division whatever colleges because of this shit.

"AITAH (kicking my brother in law out?) I’ve been married for 6 years now and my husband and I have a 6 year old son. 

Currently my brother in law (19 M)  lives with us since late May of 2023. At the time he didn’t have a job. The reason he moved in was because he wasn’t in a good place, along with having family issues. We were the only people that showed up when it came to his living situation. We understood what he was going through and we wanted to help him out in anyway. We were willing to be patient with him. From the very beginning we set boundaries with him. Now, I live a specific way, and  keep my house a certain way. We did tell him…more than once what was expected of him, set what rules not to break, and we vocalized how protective we were of the safety of our home (He had a set curfew due to my husband being out of town for days and also  not wanting him to come home at late hours since we have a son )
He took our extra room which was our office. Well not even a month of him moving in, around June he snuck out of the house while my husband and I were out of town. Also he used his car that wasn’t ready to be used due to insurance and his license. The reason we found out was because the WiFi was out for more than 10 hours, that never happens. My husband confronted him about it. The excuse he gave us, for his actions were that he had an emergency with his girlfriend, and he also said he didn’t disconnect the Wi-Fi. Which we call bullshit, but we still gave him the benefit of the doubt. He promised he wouldn’t do it again.

Around September my brother comes to visit and stays for a couple of days. During this time my brother in law is still with us and  I don’t recall him having a job. One morning, my husband wakes me up saying, “he was sneaking out of the house through the window!” When he told me that I was pissed off! Mind you we have window sensors that let us when they are opened, coincidentally it fell. He claimed this was his 3rd time doing it. 
Which of course we call bs. We ended up confronting him about it. He wasn’t helping us financially (he did at some point but now it’s been inconsistent) he had already broken our trust more than once, he disrespected us in our own home and put our safety in danger. He took advantage of us. I was very honest with him and I told him “I don’t even want you living in my home anymore. I don’t feel comfortable you living here.”
At this point, I’ve been very vocal with my husband and I don’t feel comfortable with him being in my home. I feel terrible because at the end of the day this is my husband‘s brother and it’s a tough  position to be in. I love him very much and I love that I get along with him. He’s my sons favorite uncle, He’s like another brother to me but this is too much. I’ve been stressed and I don’t feel comfortable in my own home. I want him out of my house. 

Side note: we’ve had multiple conversations about other things he lacks in and he’s now changing them but this point  I just don’t care anymore.

"WIBTA if I refuse to bring my speaker to class because I can't enjoy the radio like everyone else? Edit: I'm ASD, so blocking out noise is very hard for me!

No name shortenings in this post!

  
I (20f) study Beauty Therapy.  By class, what I'm referring to is days where students come in and perform practical units at their own pace.

  
To keep things not so boring during quieter moments, or as just some plain old background noise, we'd listen to music. My teacher usually forgets to bring her speaker, so I tend to bring it upon myself to bring in my own.

  
I usually tend to leave Bluetooth on on my laptop, for convenience's sake. However, this means that unless I've deliberately turned off Bluetooth before closing, every time I open my laptop, my speaker automatically connects to it.

  
My teacher prefers to play the radio during class. I personally hate listening to the radio, for multiple reasons. I can explain these in a comment, for those curious.

  
So in order to rectify this, I've made a Google Doc that lists all the songs on my computer, and posted it in my class' Facebook group, encouraging everyone to recommend songs they like, and ask for the removal of songs from my playlist that they don't want to hear. At the time it was first created, over half the songs on the playlist were in Korean (because I'm a big 2nd - 3rd gen fan), and aside from the K-pop, it was mostly songs by AURORA.

  
There was one time where music was playing from my computer, and other students complained to my teacher (not onto the Facebook post, or to me, but I think it's because they weren't aware of either the Facebook post or the fact that it was my music) that they couldn't enjoy the music because it was in another language. That's fine by me, so I removed all non-English songs from the playlist.   
However, that meant most of my songs were by AURORA, and that didn't go unnoticed. People complained to the teacher, and what was being played on my speaker went from my music to the radio. So, in order to make them happy, I downloaded all the English songs from my TBA list.  
But at a random moment, my teacher overrode the Bluetooth connection to play the radio, and while I didn't let it show, it genuinely hurt.

  
I feel like I've been refused the chance to have a choice in what's played on my speaker, and that they're just using me for it. All the effort I've made to keep everyone happy feels pointless, so I no longer see a reason to keeping using it in class. But I also don't want them to think I'm being salty by not bringing my speaker because I'm not getting my way.  
  
TLDR; I bring in my speaker to class for my teacher to play the radio. I'm the only one who doesn't like the radio, but I try to compromise by telling everyone to recommend songs, which 0 do, yet I only hear complaints about my song choices. This makes me feel like I'm being used for my speaker, so I don't want to bring it anymore. WIBTA?",0.41
"AITA for wanting to get my Dad a nice gift? My Dad has always wanted a nice set of golf clubs. I thought it would be a good idea this coming birthday to get together with my older sisters and get him some. They were all pretty excited about the idea. I collected screenshots of some good options and sent them to my sisters.

Each screenshot featured the product and its cost. I put the price we'd individually pay in the corner of the photos I sent out. We all agreed on the one we wanted to get our Dad and I told them I'll buy it and they can pay me their share.

My sister Jessica texts me angrily. She thought the price I stuck on each photo was the price of the clubs, not the price she would have to pay. I was a bit taken aback because you couldn't look at the clubs without seeing the total cost right under them and I pointed that out to her.

Suddenly I get a phone call. My sister is livid. She starts yelling at me that I'm texting her while she is in a meeting. I told her I didn't know she was in a meeting. Mind you. I answered her texts immediately when she sent them. She then lays in to me that she is buying a car and can't afford the golf clubs. I tell her that I can cover her side of the cost and she can just pay me back whenever.

She refuses me and yells at me some more about her finances. Then she gets even angrier and tells me that I intentionally did this to trick her with the prices. She hangs up on me while I'm still talking, a common Jessica move. Then she immediately starts calling me back and I don't answer because I'm crying. I instead texted her saying that we should talk another day because it's escalating. She texts me back that if I was going to play games and ignore her calls then that I could consider myself blocked. This is where I lost my temper. I told her to grow up and to stop being a f*ing child. She told me to f*ck off and blocked me. 

Our sisters are pretty upset with Jessica and the oldest of us all called Jessica and got into a fight with her herself. 

That night my dad wanted to talk to me. He told me that Jessica called him and said that I tricked her on the price of the golf clubs we were getting him, got her in trouble at work by texting her, and got our oldest sister to tear into her. I was shocked and felt betrayed that she spoiled the surprise. I said that the only thing I did wrong was call Jessica a child and to grow up.

My Dad insisted that Jessica was crying so hard, and he feels like Jessica has been picked on. That I needed to fix it. I told him I don't know how I'm supposed to fix it when my number is blocked. I ended up texting Jessica's husband trying to apologize. He told me Jessica doesn't want to talk about it. My Dad is not happy with me. I feel like some drama villain and about 2 inches tall.

I have had enough years ago and stopped being her puppet. She disrespects me I open my mouth. So she had a flight coming up with the airline I work for. First she wanted me to use my discount for her but I told her no because I can only use it X amount of times and I will not use it for her. She argued but eventually bought her own ticket. 3 days before her flight she asks me to upgrade her to business class. Now I do have authorization to do that and told her that we'd see on the day of the flight. (most of the time we upgrade people due to weight and balance or because they are super nice and why not). So the day of the flight arrives and I was working as usual. My sister came up to me and demanded me to check her in (check in was opening in 1 hour). I told her to wait 15 minutes and the first agent will arrive by then and she told me no can you not just check me in. I became annoyed but just let it go and told her ok. I check her in and she starts complaining about how I still have not upgraded her and I am always being mean to her. She literally threw her suitcase on the belt and was like ""ok enough just check me in already I am so done with u"". I told her ""this is your first and last warning we are not at home you are here in my work place at the airline that I represent and I will not have my hands forced by you. So you either start behaving and appreciate me checking you in because I never check people in or you can go straight back home."" 

2 hours later I proceed to the gate (we only have 5 flights a day and I am at every gate to supervise so nothing special to my sister). And my gate agent comes up to me and tells me my sister just threw a tantrum because she asked for a free upgrade and my agents told her only the representative is allowed to upgrade. My sister got in a fight with them but eventually gave up. When I came to the gate she came to me and demanded an upgrade because I do upgrade other people that I don't know but not my own sister. I told her it has nothing to do with being family but it is about respect. I left the desk to check the aircraft and heard my sister call my agent stupid and me an idiot. I walked up to my agent and told her ""You can go ahead and remove madam from our passenger list because I already gave her a first and last warning guess she decided to go back home"".

A few months ago, I found out I was pregnant and my husband and I thought it would be a nice idea to tell his parents on New Year’s Eve . We put the positive test in a frame and wrapped it up for them, only for my mother in law to react hideously. She scoffed and looked my husband. “You choose her of all people” is along the lines of what she said, she then went on to accuse me of cheating on my husband, because “he’d never want to have children with me”. 

I snapped, snatched the frame from her hands and told her to go f herself. Years of pent up frustration had finally overcome me. I told her that she was one of the most vile women I have ever met and that she should be ashamed of herself. I didn’t stay for the rest of the evening, I drove myself back home and cried. When my husband came back home, he shouted at me, told me I was out of line and how he is incredibly ashamed. Ever since then, he’s been blanking me, not pulling his weight in the home, not helping me with my pregnancy and will only speak when spoken to. What do I do to fix this?",0.31
"AITA For Accidentally Calling My Husband An Idiot For A Purchase He Made? (Burner, my husband is on reddit)

My husband (40m) is really into tech (not more than medicine though I guess) and ix probably his number one bonding thing with my son (10m). They repair and fix their own computers together,  go shopping for parts, etc. The only thing I don't like about his hobby is the fact that he buys things like he's a tester. He bought the all the Meta VR sets (that he eventually Gave to my son and daughter) to see whether he liked it or not. And spoiler: He only liked the second and third meta sets. He also gets the newest iPhone and Samsung every 3 years, which I won't complain about since that means a free phone for me every 3 years. 

Well if you don't know Apple released their VR thing, and my husband had a verbal celebration toward me about how he wants to buy it and test it out and stuff. I saw that price tag ($3500) and my brain went into ""nah"" mode. 

Turns out he already put a demo reservation at the Grove on Friday and the demo is on Monday. He told me he's calling out of work to test and taking my son out of school for it. I called him an idiot on accident for doing that. It slipped out kind of I didn't mean to call him that.

He stopped talking and he left the room to  ""talk to someone who actually cares."" I feel bad, and my husband is still mad about it but I actually didn't mean to call him that.

"AITA for getting upset at my (25M) girlfriend (26F) for being on her phone when she’s with me? So my girlfriend and I have been dating now for 7 months and things generally are going well. But sometimes when we’re together she just gets glued to her texts. We’ll be having a conversation and I’ll get no response from her. I’ll look over and she’s on her phone texting. This morning I was trying to talk to her in bed and she was just texting and not responding. So I reached over and turned her phone off. I thought it was kind of playful and she would toss it away, but instead she snapped at me. She told me she doesn’t want to be unresponsive to texts.

"AITAH for saying my BF’s sister’s house isn’t for me? Recently my boyfriend (25M)‘s sister and her husband bought a house. His parents, my BF, and I (25F) went over there a week or so ago. A few days later BF and I were hanging out and his sister’s house came up. I said I was happy for them and am glad they got what they wanted. I said the house wasn’t my style (the layout). My BF asked me what I didn’t like and I explained it was the layout (split ranch) and that I would be nervous I wouldn’t use all of the space and that it just wasn’t my preference. Well this started a huge fight and he kept saying I was being negative and rude and that he’s happy for them and he likes the house. He was seriously mad at me. I kept saying he asked me what I didn’t like and I wasn’t saying I didn’t like the house in general, I was saying what I didn’t like for me personally. I feel like he completely overreacted. I liked the house but not for me. I didn’t say anything negative or mean about the house. It’s a nice house just not for me, not what I would pick. 

I feel like he took it as a personal attack on him. When I was given the tour my BF made a comment in the guest room that it’s his room when he stays over. The whole family, BF, his mom and his dad all have slippers over there too. His sister and hubby have a no shoes in the house rule which cool I respect, but isn’t it weird that people who don’t live there have slippers there? (Prob being the ahole here)

Anyway I digress, I didn’t think I said anything bad. Honestly was hoping our conversation about houses would lead to us talking about the things we would want in a house in the future. I was disappointed we ended up fighting. It ended with him snapping saying “I’m done talking about this.” 

We haven’t spoken about it since but it’s been bothering me. So tell me, was I being the ahole for saying the house wasnt for me?",0.29
"AITA for refusing to ever meet my unborn child? Last May I (male 38) started a relationship with a mother (33, unemployed student, dad pays the bills) of a boy (2) who was in an open relationship with a father (51) co-parenting two children with his ex wife.

Their relationship was, according to her, nothing serious as he could not and would not devote all his resources to her because he already had family and was living together with his ex-wife. At best they met once a week. I'm OK with open relationships and wanted it to work.

In summer my girlfriend got pregnant with chances being very high it's my child. I had not planned kids anymore for my life but immediately started thinking about a lot of things. Parental leave, building a house for her, her son, our child and myself near the big town we live in, finding an office to work from so we could live together until that happens.

In October last year I got sick with pneumonia again (third time that year), my general condition being between recovering and sick in bed with fever till the end of the year. Nevertheless I tried to see them (""my new family"" my parents called it) as much as possible – meaning whenever she didn't meet her other boyfriend – got sick again almost every time (children tend to bring every virus known to men home) and had little to no time left where I was feeling at least somewhat better. Every time we met I helped her around the household, went shopping or cooked (I'm a fairly decent cook). I haven't done any sports since September due to my health.

Two weeks ago she broke up with me, saying there will never be a real relationship between us because we don't see each other often enough. No other reasons. Since I met her she not even once did anything ""for me"". No gestures, small presents, anything telling me she cares. When confronted with that, she said her time was the most important thing in her life and choosing to spend it with me was more than enough relationship building. Apparently her chosing not to spend it with me was my fault somehow.

Immediately after breaking up (literally the next message she wrote) she started demanding I still take parental leave and my parents also care for the baby (while she's meeting her boyfriend or whatever).

When my mother later confronted her on that she's probably planning to take the child away as soon as she finishes studying, she didn't even deny it and said a 15 hour drive wasn't that far anyway.

After all that I told her she'll never see me again (only if legally required for the paternity test) and I don't want to see our child, ever. I'm heartbroken, can't sleep, can't think of anything else, but I hope that the distance will let me heal in the end.

"AITA for getting annoyed my boyfriend invited friends over again I (30F) have been with my boyfriend (30M) for 6 years, lived with his parents to save money for 2 of those years until we bought a home together last year and moved in. No kids. He is a much more social person than I am and loves hosting. Having people over makes him happy whereas I need down-time to relax, enjoy my home etc when I’m not working. He loves taking over the lounge with his friends to order a takeaway, watch football or binge watch tv episodes. We had an argument because whenever he does this, it means I often just have to go into the bedroom and chill out there instead, or go out. From my perspective I hate feeling like I have to go elsewhere and am sick of the constant need to host and have people in our home. We had his parents round yesterday (Saturday) and spent the majority of the day with them. Am I being unreasonable by just not wanting more people in the house today (Sunday)? It’s too much for me but when I bring it up he tells me I’m spoiling his happiness by having a problem with it. I don’t see why he can’t go out or to someone else’s home.

"AITA for being upset at my transgender sister? Hi,
For context I’m 17F and my sister is 15F. Me and her have never gotten along, as she was the “favorite golden son” and I was the older sister expected to be the best. When she came out as trans at age 12, I was fine with it. I’m lgbt, so I have trans friends. But soon, the fact that she was trans started getting used as an excuse. For example, my grandparents really love me and treat me really good. They actually recognize me as a person and treat me like my age. But my sister was always immature and very sensitive, and my grandparents wouldn’t just put up with whatever she wants. So now she just says they’re “transphobic” and refuses to see them, which makes me irritated because I can’t see them either. The same thing happened with my Uncle. He works in science and has doubts about it as a “you’re trans when you’re born” thing, but he hasn’t acted any differently towards her. She did the same with him. I really love my relatives but my sister makes it so hard to see them because she’s always insisting they’re transphobic. You can see how this is irritating for me. 
The biggest deal, though, was that she and my mom decided to move out of TX where we live, on the year of my high school senior year. This was because my sister claimed tons of people were bullying her and that the med care wasn’t good in Texas because of the laws. I felt extremely hurt by my mom just packing up with her and leaving on my senior year just because my sister wanted to. Many of my trans friends who I’ve asked have said that no one bullies them, and I’ve never seen anything happen either. I personally just think she wanted to leave so that she could have a new life as she messed up big time with her friends back in Tx. By the way, our town in TX is one of the most progressive in the state. I don’t know. I just really want my mom back for my senior year. My family is not the best, and are pretty toxic generally, but my dad is extremely lonesome as a single parent here while my mom is gone. 
Now I was told that my dad is going to visit my mom and sister for my 18th birthday week and leave me here alone (as I have trauma surrounding plane rides and the house they live in.) . He could have gone to visit her at any point! Sometimes I just feel so mad at her and my parents. I feel like I deserve to have a family too. But AITA for blaming it on my sister being trans? I feel bad for it, I just might have misdirected anger but I really don’t like my sister and don’t want to blame it on the fact she’s trans either. Ugh.",0.21
"AITA for losing my temper about my spouse's hearing issues? My wife has been experiencing hearing loss over the past few years. For the last 2 years or so, it's very common (several times every day) that my son and I have to repeat ourselves 2-3 times for her to understand us. Sometimes, she and my son are in the same room, I'm in a different floor of the house, she can't understand what he is saying, and I can hear it just fine from much further away. She works almost exclusively from home, so (apart from her) we are the ones that experience the effects of the issue most often.  


I feel like I've tried every way to support her. The calm conversations, the nudges to get it checked out, and my patience (limited to start with) is running low. I lash out when it happens, unable to comprehend what it will take to do something about it. She has spoken to a doctor about it and had a hearing test, but is told her hearing loss is ""mild"". The impact on our communication is anything but ""mild"".

"AITA for asking my wife's for her best friend's phone number to apologize to her? I'm a 26M. My 27F wife, Carol, has a 26F best friend, Jessie. Carol is in the US Navy so we live in virginia, and Jessie lives in our home state of colorado.

Throughout the last week or so, I have seen so many social media posts from all my friends and family back home about how colorado has been getting 10+ inches of snow. So earlier this morning, I took a picture of the clear blue sky in 50 degree weather. I put it up on my facebook, instagram, and snapchat stories with the caption, ""So how's that weather in Colorado?"" and ended it with that tongue sticking out emoji. Keep in mind I was only doing this is a gag joke to mess with my friends because I miss home and the snow. Some people were responding back to me with enthusiastic jokes back and talking about how jealous they were for my current weather situation

About 15 minutes after posting, I get a reply on facebook messenger from Jessie saying, ""I'd rather have snow than bland weather anyday. Thanks for being passive aggressive after seeing my story though. Grow up!"". Before I could even respond with an apology to her, she blocked me from all ways of contacting her.

When this happened, I called Carol, who was fortunate enough to get wifi reception on her ship. I told her what happened and asked her to text Jessie telling her that I'm sorry for offending her. Carol said she would.

For the rest of the day, I thinking that it was dumb and immature for someone to do an apology for me so I texted Carol asking for Jessie's phone number so I could make the apology myself. She said no because ""it's disrespectful to her and her choices, as well as her privacy"", which I do understand. But I simply asked Carol back, ""How am I gonna be able to apologize to her myself then?? I cannot simply do that because Jessie completely blocked me"" Carol still has yet to respond.

The thing is, if Carol made a post on social media and one of my friends took offense to it and blocked her, I would immediately give Carol their number and make her apologize because we need to own up to mistakes. For some reason, Carol is not letting me be that adult.

I normally don't mind negative responses to my posts on social media, but Jessie is my wife's best friend so I'm definitely taking this on a personal level. Was I wrong for making a gag joke about the weather? AITA??",0.89
"AITA for asking my dad that he doesn’t always need to come to my games I’m a 15F sophomore. I’m in Varsity Tennis.
 Last year, my dad came to everything; practices and games. He watched me all the time. He was the only parent that did this. When I had to go away for games, I rarely rode the bus with my team, I had to drive there with my dad. After I was done with my individual match, I had to drive with my dad home early while everyone else took the bus after everything ended (which was a bonus at times). I appreciated how much dedication and support he had, when I needed comfort after a big loss, or motivation he was always there. However, I felt like I didn’t have much of a chance to REALLY connect with my team. Everyone was bonding, and I was only mainly talking to my dad during meets and tournaments. It also felt suffocating and uncomfortable to always have my dad watch and criticize what I do. I felt like I always had to be the best during practices that were more laid-back. I always felt tight when I was supposed to feel relaxed. Overall, it felt like I had limited freedom. 

I decided to let my dad know that this year he doesn’t need to always come to my games. I made it clear that I was grateful for his support, but it wasn’t necessary to always be there. He started to say that he won’t ever come to my games again, and that “there are parents that never come out for their kids”, and “you are lucky”. Even though his tone was calm, his responses sounded so passive aggressive. I began to feel guilty. I thought I was being ungrateful.

"AITA for taking cross off the wall? I, 30f, have been living with my partner, 31m, for half a year.
what's important is that I'm an atheist and he's religious.

When I moved in, I said that I didn't like the fact that there was a cross in our living room. he said that he would prefer it to stay, I agreed but said that he would have to disappear someday.

I repeated this information when we repainted the apartment.

We often disagree on this issue, I respect his beliefs, and he mostly respects that too, but yesterday he crossed the line. when we talked about it, he said that I was ""demaged"" because I didn't believe in god. I decided that since he was insulting me because of his religion, the cross should disappear. since he has god in his heart, he can pray to his cross but there are to be no religious symbols in our space, since he does not respect me and the fact that I am non-religious and I will take off the cross tomorrow.

he replied that he forbids me and that it is a CATHOLIC HOUSE and it is HIS house. I replied that ""the house"" is not catholic, only ""he"" is catholic. he won't forbid me because it's my house too and in that case I'll take it off now, not wait until tomorrow.
as I said, so I did.
I took off the cross.

he shouted at me that I should give it back to him at that moment. I said I would give it to him but I don't want to see it on the wall or anywhere else. I'm not going to put up with the fact that I have to respect his belifes when he doesn't respect my lack of religion.

"AITA for cancelling plans with my friend ? ***- Context :***

  
Hello everyone ! I (27M) am **B1polar type II,** meaning that every winter (in my case) i feel really down, it could go from profound sadness to severe depre$$ion that can lead me to ho$pital.

  
**My gf, family and close friends, know about it. It's a part of who i am.**  
Though, i need to be alone when i feel down, rationnalize my feelings and focus on myself *(meditation, therapy, journaling...).*  
Two years from now, **i just used to** disappear and **ghost** everyone for at least 2 months.  
But **now i learned** that this can worry people around me and **can really cause panic**. So i stopped doing it, now i just say *""i'm not doing good, no one should worry, i just need time for myself"".*  
That's what i did this year because **starting from October,** i was just feeling pretty **DOWN** (i'm doing better today).

Around 3 pm, i just **felt awful** and really **not ready to go out**, *(when i force myself to go out when i'm depre$$ed, it just worsen things).*  
So**, i texted Sarah** to tell her to get me out of the equation. **She replied** with a LONG text and her **response** **made me question a lot of things.**  
***The main idea of her response was that :***

&#x200B;

1.   
**She was ""sick"" of me cancelling plans everytime.**  
(i did for like 4 or 5 times since the depression phase started but i forced myself to go out with her pretty much the same amout of times even though she doesn't know about it)
2.   
**She was the one obligated to justify my behaviour to other people and that it wasn't her responsibility.**
3.    
**My behaviour puts her in ""awful"" situations.**  
(I thing she meant that she was the one who plans the nights out and suggest to other people to come etc.. then because of me they maybe change the plan, i really didn't understand her point)
4.   
**If i behave like that with people, i ""better not"" do it with her.**

  
So i just answered by saying *""okay, i'll tell others myself"",* so i did and everyone's response was very cheerful and comprehensive. **She never replied and i never sent a message.**

So I have a friend (22F) who never been in a relationship. Since we have meet she’s been actively looking for a guy and made us now that she’s would like for us to set her up with someone. She’s a little socially awkward and doesn’t use any social media platforms whatsoever so it’s hard for her to find someone unless the guy approaches her first. 

So in the last two year we would helped her meet with some guys and get on dates etc not like constantly but here and there. However none of them went well so she’s still single. Last night she was complaining about being single and feeling ugly and i said she isn’t , she is lovely , it just about time, I’m sure she will find the right person etc yk typcial supportive stuff . She then murmured “yeah sure as if you believe that” I heard that and asked her what she meant.

Sshe said “let’s be honest, I’m the ugly duck of the group, isn’t that why you always try to set me up with ugly dudes as well? Or with deadbeats? Because you know that only they would go for a girl like me” I told her she was BSing and we started naming some of the guys we found for her to prove that was not the case. And she found something the complain about every guy. Like “Z was handsome” “yeah but he didn’t even had a job” or “what about Y he was an engineer” “yeah and he was bald and fat” “he was awkward” “he lived with his mom”

She said we better don’t because it’s almost insulting who we think she is worthy of. She said something along the lines of “I mean only one guy you found was both decent looking and successful but then he was crippled-wheelchair bonded.After that she obviously got some looks from everyone in the table so she awkwardly laughed and said “sorry girls I didn’t meant to offend you, i do truly appreciate all your help.But my point is there is a reason you think these guys are my equals, so don’t lie to me and tell me you think I’m pretty” And I just said “ok I won’t anymore , and then laughed and said “seems like you started to believe in it” she called me and asshole over that and left shortly after. Most of friends are on my side but some of them think i shouldn’t have said that last line.

"AITA for telling a bunch of teachers that maybe they are teaching wrong? About 2 years ago, the laws changed in my country, making some classes which had not previously been mandatory be mandatory - in high school. This has caused quite the fuss where some students says that they used to get As and Bs on the old lower level mandatory class, but the new higher levels they can barely pass.

Unlike mandatory classes were extra types of classes not under the same regulation and rules in terms of teaching. All you had to do as a teacher was to teach the expected in the expected way, because the students themselves had chosen to be there and weren't forced to be there. Now with the higher levels being mandatory have problems occured.

I myself have taught classes before though in university where we had to teach our fellow students and become much wiser. We had to do this a couple of times, and it was expected we took the critique we were given to change things up for next time. So called we had to improve how we taught people, so they understood the subject better and deeper, even if it was outside their interest zone. For many Americans this may not sound hard as people choose to go to college, but taking university is free here, many just goes for the sake of going but without major plans as to why or because there's a few classes of interest but you still have mandatory classes you need to take to get your degree.

I ended up in a discussion recently with some teachers who said the young people are too lazy to learn. I of course questioned the teachers if they've tried to teach them? Yes of course they would say.
But as soon as I questioned if they had changed their way of teaching to fit the new generation the answer was no! The old ways worked so well with the old generations so why wouldn't it work now?

I ended up telling them because it doesn't. If you think the old ways will still work on the current generation, then you are teaching wrongly.

I got met by pissed people who told me that how could I, a mere researcher know about teaching?!

Of course I haven't had my on hand experience, but I still feel like their pride is pushing away the idea of updating the methods of teaching to fit the current generation.

But AITA for saying that even though I don't have the same type of on-hand experience?

TLDR: some classes has become mandatory but the teachers haven't updated their ways of teaching and thinks the students are lazy no goods. Am I wrong for pointing out maybe it's time to update the methods of teaching, even though I don't have the same on-hand experiences?",0.77
"WIBTA if I told my bf to get better handwriting or get over it? So basically boyfriend and I have an erasable grocery shopping list hung in the kitchen. I'm generally the one who goes grocery shopping, so this was a way to ensure I didn't have to try to call bf to be sure he didn't need something while I was at the store.

At some point, we did use one of those family planning apps but he changed phones and never reinstalled it (kind of a long story but he had to downgrade back to an old phone and the battery doesn't even lasts the whole day when using apps) so that's why we got the kitchen list.

Anyway, the list would work a lot better if we *both* wrote on it, but he's ashamed of his handwriting (it's not the prettiest but it's legible) and will always ask me to write things he thinks of. Just now, he asked me to write stuff as I was sitting in the couch and he was in the kitchen.

"AITA for expecting my husband to prioritize me and our holiday plans? 
Back in December I booked a 3-day theme park holiday for me and my husband. I booked the flights, 3-day park tickets, and 2 nights at a premier resort for the express pass. I also did all the planning and research to help us make the most of our time there as it was his third visit in a long time and my first. 

My MIL really wanted to come but didn’t have the immediate funds. She’s pretty cool and we didn’t want to leave her out, so we comped her flight tickets, 2-day park hopper tickets, and added her to our room reservation so she could get an express pass. 

On day 1, I did the rides alone as my husband and MIL had to work for a bit in the hotel room. No big deal. We had dinner together later. 

On day 2, we went on several attractions together and had fun. However, as the day went on, it became clear that with only a 2-day park ticket MIL would not be able to enter the park day 3. My husband kept pushing to watch the Pro Bowl as he and MIL spotted two American football players at the park and wouldn’t stop talking about it (he doesn’t normally care about football). It started to seem like spending the morning with me at the park and then leaving me to watch the Pro Bowl with his mum in the afternoon was going to be the plan. I was a bit annoyed because I felt that the money, time and effort put into planning this trip would be wasted.

This morning (day 3), MIL bit the $170 bullet and purchased a 1-day ticket but not before making saying things like, “What am I going to do for 8 hours?!?” It bothered me because she insisted on coming on this trip and could have planned in advance knowing our itinerary. 

On our way to early park admissions, I vented to my husband about that as well as the fact that we haven’t spent much time just the two of us. I didn’t appreciate that he was okay with abandoning me for his mum or the Pro Bowl when we still had a whole day at the parks planned and paid for. Even if his mum hadn’t purchased a ticket and had be alone for a while, she’s an adult and can take care of herself. He got defensive and walked really fast leaving me behind. I was very upset by that point and walked back towards the resort. He caught up to me and told me to “fuck off” as he stormed away. I was stunned and decided to solo the rest of the day. Husband has not contacted me since and I don’t know if I’m in the wrong here.

After thinking about it, I told her that I was flattered she asked me, but that I didn't think I would be a good bridesmaid for her for a couple of reasons. 

First of all, I get incredibly anxious being in large groups of people and just the thought of standing in front of 150 or so wedding guests is almost enough to give me a panic attack.

Second of all, I have some health issues. Mainly intractable migraine and a seizure disorder. Going to a wedding and wedding reception already leaves me in pain without the added stress of being a bridesmaid. Bad migraine days also make me more prone to seizures. I'm worried if I were to have a seizure shortly before the ceremony, leaving her short a bridesmaid suddenly. One of the reasons I don't like large crowds is because I hate having seizures in public, but usually I can slip away and find somewhere private. I wouldn't be able to do that in the middle of a wedding ceremony. 

Basically, I'm worried about the toll being a bridesmaid would have on my physical health. After explaining all of this to my step-sister, she told me she wants me standing with her on the most important day of her life and that I'm more than my health problems and I shouldn't let them stop me. She doesn't seem to understand what chronic pain is like and how a person can only take so much. I can understand being disappointed, but she has made me feel guilty for saying no.

"AITAH for not thanking my mom for cleaning up? I (F18) am autistic. My mom (F40) is neurotypical, and I live together with just her and my younger brother (M16). 
I have been annoyed and frustrated all day today. Firstly because my mom used my dog's leash and she didn't put it back in the right place, so I lost it. And I couldn't ask her because she was out with her boyfriend. So I had to walk my dog with a fucking *string*.
Apparently, the leash was in her car. And don't get me wrong I don't blame her for forgetting the leash. I blame her for ignoring my complaints over and over and over again.

Then tonight, she came home, and it went like this:
* mom gets home
* mom sees dirty dishes from dinner
* Mom: ""are y'all gonna clean that yourselves?""
* Me: ""yeah""
* mom walks out to the kitchen
* mom walks back in not even 2 minutes later
* starts gathering our dishes
* I explain to her why I think this is annoying, first of all because of her lack of logic and second of all because it makes me feel like i'm being lazy when she does that
* her telling me to just say ""thank you"" and accept it
* I explain to her that she now makes me feel like I'm being ungrateful
* she jokingly says she'll just shut up, making me feel even more toxic/ungrateful


* later she comes to me to 'talk about it' and essentially tells me I'm being overly dramatic and I should ""just not stress so much about it""

It feels like she guilt trips me, even if it's completely unintentionally, and I'm having a lot of difficulty dealing with this. I truly am grateful for the things she does for me and my brother but I find it extremely hard to ""just accept"" this. I'm very sensitive to anything that feels manipulative (due to multiple traumas) so whenever I feel manipulated in any way, I get and feel very defensive and upset.",0.84
"AITA for going to a concert with my friends? I (M19) am turning 20 soon. My favourite band is touring right now, and they have a concert in my country. The concert is close to my birthday, and since my parents and brother all like the band, we decided to go together. 

My mum is a big fan of the band as well, so I told her I wanted to queue so I could get barricade, and I asked her if she wanted to come along. I had this conversation with her when we got the tickets (around September). She didn't say anything, so when I found out a couple of friends were also going to the concert (a couple of months after I asked my mom), I made plans to queue with them.

Now (February), she's saying that I'm neglecting my family by going to the concert with my friends, that she's not going to have fun if she isn't with me and that I am a narcissist for putting my friends before my family. I can see her point, but I did tell her I was going to get barricade, no matter what. AITA?

* I am autistic and this band has been my special interest for years. I'm also not very tall, so I have to get a good spot so I can actually see them irl. So barricade is non-negotiable.

Edit: since we (my family and I) all got tickets back in September, they're still going to the concert, since they also like the band. 

Edit 2 (I keep forgetting to add stuff): When I say queuing, I mean pulling up to the venue at 5 AM. Security will start giving out wristbands to the first 100 people to be there at 8-9 AM. Once you get a wristband, you're free to leave the queue.

Edit 3 (hopefully the last) (I keep forgetting to add context): I asked my mom to get barricade with me months before I found out my friends were going. I had also told my parents barricade was non negotiable for me before we got tickets. ",0.22
"AITA for intentionally avoiding a girl because she's autistic? Some background knowledge. I (soon 18/f) am an exchange student. I also have ADHD, which I got diagnosed with only last year, I'm also on medication for it and always actively working on myself.

So, one of the other girls in my class (from home country) is autistic, I'll call her ""Imogen"".I have ADHD ( I understand how that is no excuse to be a horrible person,) so I struggle with thinking before speaking and emotional regulation (I struggle with a lot more lol, these are just the ones mostly relevant in this context).

We do swimming together at school two days a week and there are not many of us. I did swimming at competition level for a couple of years but had to quit during covid, so I chose this sport to launch myself back into it again. However, the other girls have never done swimming before. Imogen (amongst others) constantly stands in my way AND way in my personal space, and asks me questions she should've asked the coach.

I've been having a hard time lately and have been looking forward to swim practice. So the other day, when in the pool Imogen kept asking me questions, I told her to ask the coach because its his job and not mine, ""its actually not my job to teach you this"", and after that I pretended that I didn't hear her and if she talked to me I just ignored her and kept on swimming to avoid interacting with her.

Another instance was in the changing room. Imogen kept talking to me in English when we were alone. I told her I find it uncomfortable to talk English amongst ourselves when it's not necessary, but she just laughed at me and said she liked it, so she would keep doing it. I told her again I didn't like it and she responded with ""well too bad for you, you're missing out on improving yourself."" I stopped responding in English, and after a while stopped responding at all. I was told ""there is no reason for you to be rude""

I constantly have to suppress myself and my personality so she can understand me, yet she constantly misunderstands.

She often talks to me like I'm a child which is infuriating and patronising. In situations like these I have to seriously control my temper to not talk back, and that can again alter my behaviour to appear very rude.

Am I the asshole?",0.22
"AITA for kicking out my nephew since he thought it was only his house? 
OK, so I'm female(25) and my nephew is (20). This all happened a few weeks ago, but heres some backstory.

Me and my nephew grew up together, and I took care of him for most of my childhood and teen years. Even though we’re five years apart, I still had to take care of him and I really never minded.

He’s family, and I care for him a lot, but growing up he would steal my stuff and not give it back or give it back ruined or damaged. Instead of getting in trouble, it was always me getting in trouble since I was the oldest. Since he had a rough childhood, I had to let him do whatever he wanted. I honestly did not like that because I raised him the best I could being teenager and I didn’t have a choice. I had to clean, I had to cook for him, and it made me upset, but that’s in the past.

Currently I have an apartment and I needed help paying rent and my nephew offered to live with me and pay some rent. His college is a 10 minute drive away from there, and where we used to live it’s like a 40 minute drive, so he moved in with me.

At first he was paying it, and then slowly he stopped paying it. Obviously I let him know that he does have to pay rent and that if he could pay me soon and he never did. He just said that since I am his aunt and I’m older, I have to pay for everything for him which pisses me off. I know that I didn’t raise him to be like that. I found out that he was doing certain things that he wasn’t supposed to. I also found out he’s been stealing money from my room. He doesn’t give money for anything. He just goes to school and stays in my apartment rent free and I can’t support both of us.

I’ve told his mom about it and my mom and all they told me was that I should support him and give him money since I’m his aunt. I have money but I can barely afford rent and they want me to give him money, just so he can go spend it? like no.

I told him that he has to get a job or he can’t live with me. Then he threatened to kick me out of my own apartment, so I snapped and I kicked him out. I threw his clothes out and I told him to not come back.

Most of my family doesn’t want to talk with me right now. They’re mad at me, and my cousins are the only ones talking to me.The rest of the family is not. AITA?

edit: English is not my first language so sorry for any errors!

update: I want to say thank you to everyone for being brutally honest with me and I want to clear a few things up. I am the youngest of my siblings and yes I get it that maybe it wasn’t the best idea to let him live with me but I raised him and I really just couldn’t leave him like that and since he said that he would pay, I thought it would be ok but obviously it wasn’t so but ive cut them out and i left his stuff  in the lobby and nobody wants to take him but they want me to take him like no. im not going to so im done with  them. i gave up everything for that kid and this is how he repays me? but its time he learns that im not always gonna save him. oh and i will be making a police report also yes i am hispanic to who ever was asking",0.15
"AITA for stressing out my mom? Ok, so I (12) have self-diagnosed myself with AuDHD, which my parents to not know about. I also feel pansexual. I have difficulty talking to my parents about these things, I really just want to be seen as a good, smart girl who makes people happy, not one who is super independent and gets in trouble. But my mom expects me to do all these adult things that are hard for me. 

One day my mom was trying to show me how to make a burger. I really needed step-by-step instructions, but when I made it wrong my mom became mad. She told me it’s ridiculous that I can’t make a simple burger, and I became really sad. Then she told me and my brother(9) that we really need to learn how to do these simple things, and I started to cry. 

She told me to stop crying and that I was being too loud, but it’s really hard for me to just stop crying. She told me I was being selfish and that it’s unfair for me to act this way next to my brother, and if I needed to cry I should go to my room. But my mom has this way of saying things that sounds really accusing, and what I really wanted was for her to sit next to me and not yell and I felt really scared and I sort of curled up into a ball ( something I do when I’m overwhelmed). But I don’t think she understood and she just wanted me to be more normal. I just really didn’t want to stop crying. 

But she told me again how selfish I am and I got mad and told her I’m allowed to do things that make me feel happy before worrying about others, and she told me that was not true and I can’t do that if it hurts other people.

I feel so ashamed and I just really cant find a way to describe how I feel, but I think I should have calmed down when she asked. AITA?",0.88
"AITA for reminding my gf of the things I do for her My gf (21) and myself (24) were having a conversation about why I don’t get her flowers. I took it as an insult or her being ungrateful  because I do everything for her to make her life easier. I brought up how much things I do for her and told her that I cook and clean, furnished the apartment and gave her the downpayment for her car so she can take a job that’s further away from home . Her share of the housework is usually less than mine as she irons my clothes for work on mornings and packs my lunch which I am grateful for as I know how hard it can be. I communicated that she’s always asking more of me and I feel like I always have a new glass ceiling to break because she wants a $50000 dollar wedding ring and a $500000 dollar car and house before I can propose to her. These expectations give me so much anxiety because I question whether or not I can fulfill them and has led to me being unhappy. I understand flowers are a small thing to hey and they’re not a big deal but within the wider context of the relationship and expectations placed on me I don’t know if I can do enough to make this person happy. I really would like to know AITA for bringing up the things that I did",0.38
"AITA for leaving my pads/tampons out where my parents can see? throwaway because I’m a little nervous about privacy and am slightly embarrassed about what I’m about to share and don’t want it somehow traced back to me. 

I (F17) live with my parents in their house and we have three bathrooms. One bathroom is connected to my parent’s rooms, another is an extra bathroom that is closer to the kitchen/living room, and another is right next to my room. I am the only person that ever uses this bathroom, if my mom or dad go, they use the one connected to their room. If we have people over or family staying with us, they use the extra guest bathroom we have. I also clean my own bathroom, and although it isn’t always spotless and I do sometimes leave my makeup and hair products out, I keep it hygienic at the least. My parents have a habit of just walking into my bathroom/ room, seeing if it’s clean, poking around, and then leaving. It’s their house, they can go anywhere they want and it’s not that big a deal most of the time. Once a month, this habit of theirs is a problem between us. I have really heavy periods. I’m healthy as far as I know, I just happen to have heavier periods and need to change pads and tampons pretty often (I use both based on what I need when). Whenever I throw away my used tampons or pads, I put them in a trash can that’s tucked away in a corner hiding next to the toilet. You wouldn’t be about to see the trash can unless you walked well into my bathroom. Whenever I’m on my period and either of my parents walk into my bathroom they get upset whenever they see the bloody pads or tampons in the trash can. There isn’t a lid or cover on my trash can, so the top is open and you can see some of the trash in it. The reason they get upset is because they say it’s disgusting to have my bloody tampons visible where they or anyone can walk in and see it. They tell me that I need to wrap it in toilet paper then put it in the trash so you can’t see blood. I’m the one who takes out my trash wherever it gets full, and I think it’s a little dumb and wasteful to wrap my used pads/ tampons in toliet paper before I throw them away. Maybe it’s because it’s my own period blood, but it doesn’t bother me to sometimes see a bloody pad or tampon sitting in my trash can. It’s trash, I don’t care, but my parents do. Even though I know they get mad I just forget to wrap it sometimes, especially when my period first starts lol. Whenever they then walk into my bathroom, they come into my room and start telling me how disgusting it is and then they make me grab my used pads and tampons out of the trash and wrap them in toilet paper and then throw them back away. I honestly don’t think it’s a big deal and think I waste a lot of toilet paper whenever I do this but both my mom and my dad have told me how gross and disgusting it is for me to leave used pads visible in my trash and want me to wrap them up. Is it really gross leave my used tampons and pads visible in my trash can? AITA for not covering them up?",0.32
"AITA for not picking my partner up from the airport? I (33M) was planning to pick up my GF (27F) from the airport last night at 8:45 pm.  I was also invited over to my best friends fathers house to Celebrate Lunar New Year (which gf knew).  Originally the dinner was at 6 pm (so I would have plenty of time to get to the airport after and felt good committing to both - airport is 25 mins away) but around 5:30 I was notified it was getting pushed to 7 pm.

I immediately called my gf who was on the plane but hadn't taken off yet and asked her to talk through the situation with me.  She said that she was supposed to land early around 8 pm now and that I clearly couldn't go to dinner and pick her up, that there was nothing to discuss, and I had to pick what my priority was.  I was a bit taken aback by her response (I was hoping she would want to uber to us and join for dinner or we could agree to hangout after dinner), tried to reframe the situation to talk it through together, and she reiterated that there was nothing to talk about, there was no way she could help me and that she would pick for me if that's what I was asking.  

Additional context: My best friends dad has stage 3 cancer and this could easily be one of/the last opportunities to spend time with them like this.  My best friend and I have known each other for 25 years, grew up together, and his mom passed away suddenly when we were in high school - gf knows all this we've been together 2+ years.

In the end we ""decided"" I'd go to dinner and she'd uber home.  She was supposed to let me know when she landed/got home but I haven't heard from her at all (don't even know when she landed), have called/texted multiple times but no response, I guess I'm getting the silent treatment.  AITA?",0.44
"AITA for lying to my friend's girlfriend? My friend Kelvin (m34) has been dating a new girl Cornelia (f22) for 2 months, and I invited them to a party 1 week ago. All of my friends knew about it, so we were all down to party. Cornelia was also super excited to party with Kelvin for the first time. All of a sudden, Kelvin texts me 6 days later saying that he wants me to lie to Cornelia that the party isn't happening. NOTE: this party happens every week.

He tells me that Cornelia's parents told him secretly that they want her back by midnight every time they hang out, and that she doesn't know about this secret midnight curfew - it is between him and her parents (this doesn't sound believable on his part). He said he wanted to honor her parents wishes and keep their secret. He also tells me that she used to have a drinking problem, and he doesn't want her to go down the same path. 

I told him that this would be a problem, because our other friends know that the party is happening, and this lie will probably be exposed by them if they talk to her. So he requested that I should get our friends to not mention the party around her and lie about it if asked. I ended up getting my friends in on it and they reluctantly obliged to not mention it, but they said they wouldn't lie if asked. 

So I proposed the idea that I'll say I can't make it to the party. That way our friends don't have to lie (but they will stay silent about it), and she won't want to go if the inviter (me) isn't going. He ended up agreeing, but bummed out that I wouldn't just lie that the party wasn't happening. I made it clear that if I did that and my other friends expose that the party did happen, then I would look like a liar and an asshole, but he kept insisting.

I asked him why doesn't he just say he's uncomfortable going to the party and talk it out with his girlfriend. He responds with ""I can't tell her parents about the curfew"", and I say bro, you don't have to mention the curfew, just say you don't want to go to the party (he hates partying and drinking). He then tells me that he can't do that, and he can't tell me the reason why....

Fast forward, we end up meeting together and I tell her that I can't make it to the party this week. She then says ""OK, but next week for sure!"". I just nod my head in a defeated manner, because I realize she will never attend the party while he's around. We hung out a little more (along with the other friends who were in on the issue), but I started to become bothered for having done this. I succeeded in getting myself and my other friends to lie and say I wasn't going to the party, when I was. Everyone felt uncomfortable, but we did it for his sake. 

It's been 2 days since then, but I don't think I can keep lying like this every week. On top of that, I think he lied to me about the secret parent curfew to save his own image for me, because that sounds like bullshit. Why wouldn't the parents just tell her to be home by 12am? Why won't he just say he's uncomfortable? AITA? Please help...",0.85

"AITA for not wanting to parent my husband’s adult children who are my age? UPDATE: had the dinner but decided to hold the talk for when mom can attend so we are all together on what needs to happen. Talked it out w/husband as to everyone’s expectations and my involvement. Thanks to everyone who helped me look at this from all sides!!

*2nd edit: I appreciate everyone’s opinions on both sides here! I convinced him to keep the dinner on schedule. As the day has progressed he actually started to get more and more nervous about “the talk” so I think those who said he wanted my support are spot on. I’ve decided to be here, but am still unsure of my place in the money conversation - this is what I’m uncomfortable with. Do I leave the room?

*Edited to add that I do not need my husband financially and have a good career in which I make plenty of money to support myself.*

Let me start by addressing the age gap. I was in my 30s when I met my husband and as I don’t want kids of my own or to be a parent, I liked that his kids were grown and that he wouldn’t want any more. I pursued him. There was no grooming situation here. We’ve been together 8 years. 

He has two kids from his first marriage that are roughly 35 & 40. Occasionally they would ask for money here and there and he always gave it to them. Sometimes it would be paid back, sometimes not. Personally, I believe that the way to help them is by saying “no” so they can figure out their own finances (and have told him this on many occasions), but it’s not my business to tell him how to parent his kids. 

Over the past couple of years, things have gotten out of control, particularly with the younger one. They have a baby now so obviously expenses have risen. Asking for money is monthly and has clearly become the “solution” to money problems. Their mom also recently received an inheritance so now they think she’s a cash cow. She has confided that the younger kid owes her over $10k! I have not totaled what we are owed (the asks are generally between $100-$500/mo) and I’m sure that it’s more than my husband lets on. 

Tonight he wanted to have them over for dinner (and to see the grandbaby) to talk about their finances and what they’re going to do. New jobs? Move to a cheaper part of town? Figure out why they are asking for money every single month and what to do about it. This is too much parenting for me to be involved in, and I let my husband know that. I would make plans to be elsewhere so as not to be in the uncomfortable situation of acting as a parent to people who are practically my own age. 

He said that it was fine and that he would go by himself to the store. I asked him to wait for me and that I would go with him, because there is no money in his account (he just gave them $150 each) and we could use my card. Then he got upset and said “you’re not part of this.” Which, yeah, I’m not going to parent your adult children but I can supply the food for you to make them dinner. 

I grabbed my coat and was ready to go and he was still upset and no longer wanted to have them over at all and texted them to cancel and told them he didn’t have enough money to make them dinner. Now he’s complaining that he “thought we were a team” and that I can do whatever I wanted to do tonight. I haven’t made plans yet because it all happened so fast. He’s acting like I ruined his plans with his kids. 

I love my husband and we have a great relationship. We ARE a team, I just don’t feel like I should be involved with parenting his kids. We’re so close in age it makes me extremely uncomfortable. It’s not my place. I did not raise them, so I’m not sure why I should be expected to start doing so now. AITA?",0.12
"AITA for being on my phone during my bfs family dinner For context, I have been with my bf for 10 years. I know his family well and he lives closest to his mum in comparison to his siblings so we are at his mums house almost every other weekend for dinner or games night and it's all very casual.
His mum is going on holidays tomorrow so we went there to say our goodbyes and have dinner. His dad and brother were there as well.
We were there for around 2 hours. I am usually very engaged in conversations but I have been doing some work for a potential job all weekend and have been struggling with it, having no time for myself at all on top of my normal job and i have been feeling very burned out to say the least since eveything bad is piling up. I keep telling my boyfriend who doesn't seem to grasp that I am not doing great. 
So first I had quite a long chat with his dad then we eat, talk, facetime his sister, have coffee and talk more for around 2 hours. Then the topic falls on movies I have never seen and actors that I don't know. They were all talking lots about it having a good time and I just went on my phone. At this point I had nothing to contribute and felt like we were there for too long already tbh but I didn't say anything, just looked at stuff on my phone while they watched some movie clips. 
My boyfriend loudly asks what I am looking at on my phone and I am just saying that I am catching up on something since I didn't have time today. 
10 minutes later he asks if we should leave and I say yes sure. We say our goodbyes and everything seems normal. His mum was pretty tired and ready for bed anyway. Once we were outside he doesn't speak and I can tell something is wrong. I ask him and he says it was so rude of me to be on my phone and if I didn't have to come I should have stayed home. I only went to dinner to not be rude and miss seeing his mum before she travels but I guess I was rude after all. I currently feel even more stressed and upset because of this but I don't get it. No one needed me to participate in this movie talk. There are a lot of times when his dad has a whole conversation in portugese with everyone (which I don't understand) and no one translates stuff and I just sit there and stare.

"AITA if I kick my son out just before graduation? I need advice please. Im a 41 yr old mother of an 18 yr old son. His father was in & out of jail & rehab his whole life, finally 3 yrs sober and living in another state. He got to see him for the first time since he was 3 only last year.Well this state has legal Marijuana & my son has no rules there so he plans to go live with him after graduation. He's always been a difficult child but since deciding to leave he has been impossible. Refusing to do anything & being down right hateful & disrespectful all the time.

 A little more than a year ago they found something on a mammogram that they didnt like. A biopsy showed cancerous/ pre cancerous cells that had not yet formed a lump. A very positive thing as far as it goes. In order to keep the news from my child i chose to go a very conservative route allowing them to remove a small part of my breast, doing targeted radiation treatments and monitoring it closely. I thought once he leaves I'll have the major surgery to remove my breast. (Its important to note that my mother died from ovarian cancer and I just never wanted him to know the fear and worry I went thru unless I had to.) He has been so awful to me tho and some days I do just need his help. The treatments are (comparabley) mild and targeted but I suffer side effects nonetheless and am so weak some days. I finally told him just a little trying to get him to help me. He still refuses and most hurtfully, has never even asked about the details. Im heartbroken. He doesn't seem to care about something so serious. Im the only parent he's had his whole life but lately he says im a horrible monster and its his father whose so wonderful. My own son doesn't care that im sick.

Here's where I need some advise. What do I do? Hes months from graduation but I cant bear it anymore. Not the disrespect or how hurtful it is how little he cares about me. I dont understand and I want to ask him to leave now.  Perhaps then I could at least just have some peace on my worst days. Some days it beaks my heart so much I dont even want to fight it anymore. Why am I trying to live? For almost 19 years hes been the purpose for everything i do and its all been for nothing. Am I awful to kick him out now when it could mean he doesnt graduate?",0.22
"WIBTA if I told my mom to do the dishes this time around? Mobile user here, details will be kept mostly vague or switched up for privacy.

I(16F) have chores that I do at my house. One of these chores includes doing the dishes almost every day that I am here. I'm involved in sports, and yesterday I had a big event where I was gone for a decent chunk of the day. I was not asked to do dishes upon my return, however they piled up pretty badly. Today, I woke up feeling extremely sore and bruised up from the day before, as it's quite a demanding sport, and I just wanted to relax before I have school and all my other extracurricular events through the week. My mom asked me to do dishes, and I couldn't help but recoil at the thought.

My mother(early 40s) has a pretty open schedule, with it being filled with making dinner, getting my two younger siblings changed and fed for school or putting them down for naps, and running my dad to work. Otherwise, she is on her computer gaming or watching a show. The last time she has done the dishes was around 1-2 months ago when I forgot to, and I was reprimanded for that.

I know she never does them while I'm away for some weekends because I'll come back and find the dishwasher sorted in a way that only I ever sort the dishes. I just find it irritating that over the years, a once and a while thing became my constant chore, and I'm not even paid for it. She denies ever saying it was an only occasional thing at any point. On top of this, I also do the cat litter, sweep and mop the kitchen, take out the trash, vacuum, and clean certain rooms. None of these are nearly as often.

I usually just do as I'm told without complaint, but I'm just so tired and this on top of everything I have to do this week feels like a crushing weight on my back that makes me want to break down and cry. Would it be unreasonable to ask if she could do them this time around, just once? Or am I just subconsciously finding an excuse to be lazy? Any advice is appreciated.",0.42
"AITA Youth Basketball Last week my daughter (11 years old) played in a game of rec league (not travel) basketball. This is an instructional league but of course you should play to win.

 The game got started late because the other team’s coaches showed up 5 minutes late. One of their coaches smelled strongly of marijuana in the elementary school gym. Their players were all 1-2 years older than our players and much more skilled. The score got way out of hand by the end of the 2nd quarter. By the end of the third my daughter’s team was down by 60 points. The 4th quarter the other coach (not the high one) benched his weakest players and ran his best 5 again against us. And they ran it up breaking 100 points. Our girls lost by over 80. Towards the end of the game their coaches were laughing and taking pictures of the scoreboard right in front of our players (2 of whom were crying out of frustration).   

I have to be clear. His players were excellent. They were good spirited, played hard, and followed their coaches directions. 

After the game I told him that we didn’t appreciate them laughing at the score and our players. He denied laughing even though I was literally doing the scorebook for the game sitting right in between the benches next to the scoreboard. I then pointed at him again and raised my voice more and told him his coaching style is inappropriate for this level of play and he got mad for me pointing at him. I then walked away.",0.25

"AITA for wanting my [F27] partner [M31] to take my last name instead? I’ve been engaged to my partner, I’ll call him G, for the last year and we’ve been dating since college. He is the love of my life, and we have already planned most of our life decisions (ie, baby names, big purchases, vacations) through long talks. One thing we can’t agree on, though, is who’s last name we will keep after our marriage.

To start, keeping our own last names is not an option to me. People who truly love eachother wouldn’t do that, just like getting a prenup. I’ve made this very clear to G in the past few years, as I’ve been getting angry thinking about how men only get to pass on their last names. I come from a long like of “Mary” middle names, but I want to have my last name be carried on. I’m the one giving birth to our children (twin boys due in April), I’m the one doing the heavy lifting of family building and it’s that simple to me! 

So I brought this up to him again last night. Our wedding is set for July of next year, so quite a ways a way still because we are still saving. He doesn’t want to talk about it because he says the wedding is too far away and we have enough to worry about, but aren’t our identities more important? 

Anyways, I had just got home from work and errands and he had a nice dinner made for me (he is unemployed at the moment, working seasonally as a lawn care worker only in summer). I had been thinking about my last name all day, so as soon as I set my bag down I asked him if he had been thinking about it. I started to make my way over to sit at the table with him, our plates already steaming and set for eating, but he just looked at me angrily and stood up. He took my plate away, dumped it onto his and left the room. 

I didn’t think much of it, we fight sometimes and it’s ok. I carried on with my evening. By the time it was 9pm I was finishing up some emails in bed, just to realize he hadn’t come to join me. I checked my phone and found he had texted me basically a novel, saying awful offensive things. He said that he is the provider, and what would his father think of me rejecting their name. He said there is a reason women go from Ms to Mrs (as in Mr’s, like I am his property or something) when they get married and I should learn to respect that or he wants nothing to do with me. I was very upset and crying, went downstairs to see him sleeping alone on the couch, at least he stayed while angry this time. 

Now he hasn’t contacted me all day. Usually when we fight about this he seems to be joking, I didn’t think he was this mad. I feel so sad thinking about the women who are my ancestors, who stand behind me and are represented in me, and how my boys will have no blatant indication of the years of powerfully rearing children. I know tradition is important, I just want us to be recognized. Am I the asshole for wanting to share my last name?",0.83
"AITA for telling a girl she overstepped her boundaries in insulting my family? I met this girl on the apps a few months ago. I learned shes on low contact with her mom. At first she didnt want to discuss that. Then I found out her mom is actually very ill but she doesnt even visit her family that much. She got angry with my concern of her relationship with her fam and then decided we wont work out.

 It was my only issue with her so i messaged her a week later that id like to understand her situation and maybe help her reach a healthy compromise with her family. She in return said that I should instead focus on helping out my slutty sister not be such a slut and that my mom needs to stop dressing like a hoe and then have the audacity to give her family advice. She never met my family all she knows is from instagram and fb pics.  I then tell her at least we are close together and a close together family is important in dating and marriage prospects esp in our indian culture (we both indian). She then says LOL stay in the delusion that your sister and her used up pussy will get good marriage prospects.

"AITA for being upset about getting the birthday gift I’ve always wanted? Hi, I’m typing this directly after a 17hr shift so please forgive me if this is poorly written.

I’m going to start in chronological order. In June of 2022 I was over my friend’s house and he has an electric drum set. I immediately fell in love with it and wanted buy one of my own. At the time, I was 19 and still living with my parents. No job, no money, addicted to weed, and I wasn’t in college. I spent spring-fall of 2022 making friends and partying.

Yes, I’m fully aware of how irresponsible I was. So anyways I begged my parents for an electronic drum set. There’s plenty of room in our house and noise wouldn’t have been an issue either. I was disappointed when they said no but I wasn’t surprised either.

So yeah on paper it sounds pretty bad lol. But they promised me that I could get a drum set if I started college. Having a tangible & realistic goal was incredibly motivating for me so I signed up right away at my local community college and put myself on an accelerated track to graduate with my Bachelor’s in 2 years.

I was acing my classes. I quit weed. So again I went to my parents and practically begged them for a drum set. Again they refused, saying that I needed to get a job first. 2 weeks pass and I find myself working full time as a night security guard, still passing my classes with straight A’s. 

So again I go to my parents, begging them for a drum set, even offering to pay myself. Again they refused, saying that I’d have to wait for my 20th birthday (feb 2023). My 20th birthday comes and goes without a drum set. I don’t even remember the excuse they gave me- I was adamant that I could pay for it entirely. I treated my parents with respect, was killing it in school, and I even got a promotion at work!

A whole year goes by without any mention of the drum set by me- instead my new focus is on saving for an apartment. That brings us to today. My 21st birthday is in 3 weeks and I graduate in April. You won’t believe what I saw in my living room when I got home from work today. That’s right- my parents standing next to an Amazon box containing an electronic drum set.

Seeing that just felt like a slap in the face. I feel like they’ve been ignoring my wants and commitment to self improvement all while fully funding my twin brother’s apartment and giving him an allowance (he goes to in-person college and doesn’t have a job).

I still thanked them for the drum set but I’m probably going to ask my parents to just return it. Part of me wants to keep it but I’m just turned off with how they handled this. I feel majorly disrespected. AITA?",0.22
"AITA for going to Rio without my fiancée? I’m (31M) working on a 6-month project in Buenos Aires, Argentina. I’ve taken some time to travel around whenever I can (at my own expense) because it’s my first time in South America and I want to make the most of it. So far I’ve been to Patagonia, Uruguay and Chile. 

Before I left, my fiancée (30F), who was already bummed because we’d be spending this time apart, asked me not to go to Brazil because that’s on her bucket list of countries to visit and she wants us to go there together for the first time, possibly as a honeymoon destination.

However, a group of co-workers was just organizing a trip to Rio for Carnaval and it was the sort of decision I had to made in a hurry because there was only one spot left in their Airbnb and the cheap flight they had found could soon sold out. So I ended up buying my ticket and agreeing to share the accommodations before I got to talk with my fiancée. 

I figured I could explain to her that this was a once in a lifetime opportunity and there’s still so many places for us to travel and experience together in Brazil alone. But she was furious. She said she asked me for one thing and I didn’t act like we had agreed. I understand that. But also it didn’t make sense for me to miss this chance. 

Also worth adding: my fiancée’s family is financially comfortable and she grew up traveling all around the world, while this is my first major international trip and I think she should understand that opportunities like this might not come as often to me.",0.3
"AITA for backing out of my friend’s bachelorette? My (F26) friend (F29) recently got engaged. My friend asked me to be a bridesmaid & I happily agreed. During the bachelorette party planning, MOH & bride decided on Vegas, with little consultation from the others. The MOH & bride have planned out required outfits for every day & had created a trip itinerary. These decisions incl. picking hotels, flights, dates, & relatively fancy activities.

Recently, one of the bridesmaids dropped out of the trip. The reasons were unclear, but the bride & MOH had a lot of negative things to say about this. Shortly after, we were told that we were going to book the trip & pay the deposit. When I asked about staying at a different hotel that was cheaper, I was told “all questions are welcome, but we have chosen where we are staying & changes cannot be made any longer”. I paid the deposit for the flights & hotel & asked for a cost outline for the rest of the trip. The bride & MOH made a word document outlining all the costs, which was higher than I expected, but I came to terms with it.

Before the wedding planning started, another person in our circle made me uncomfortable with manipulative & concerning behaviors. I spoke to the bride & another bridesmaid & let them know I was uncomfortable with her & that I didn't like being around her, but I was okay with them being friends separately. We were all on the same page though, & we communally let the friendship fizzle out.

As of today, this person received a Save the Date, which blindsided me because I had not realized the bride was still close with her. When I asked the bride about it, she told me that if this other friend asked why things had fizzled, she would tell that friend to talk to me directly as it was me who had the problem with her. I felt as if the bride had thrown me under the bus. Since we agreed to let things fizzle, the bride had not been inviting this friend to events or actively trying to hang out with this person. At this point my feelings were hurt, but it is not my wedding, so I moved on.

My career & work are important to me, & I am currently starting on a new work project, which will require travel & longer hours. The new project had important deadlines that interfered with the bachelorette trip. I spoke to my manager & my time off request was not approved. Before this work layer came up, I was already uncomfortable with this trip because of my hurt feelings, the trip prices, & the lack of communication, but work made the decision easier.

I spoke to the travel agent directly before the bride to see what cancelling entails (losing my deposit, & my roommate having to pay more). I then spoke to the bride in person saying I would no longer be able to make it, I was apologetic but light-hearted, & she seemed understanding but didn't say much.

A day later, she texted me asking me if I could work remotely from Vegas so I could still attend evening events. She followed it by telling me she was disappointed I was choosing work over the trip. AITA?",0.86
"AITA for making a sad face when my boyfriend raises his voice? My (19 F) boyfriend (21 M) plays video games with his friends after school sometimes. He doesn’t play that often and makes sure to spend time with me after school as well. Sometimes when he plays, he gets really excited and starts yelling to release his excitement. He will be speaking to his friends about the game and then all of a sudden, I hear: “LETS GOOOOOOO!!!!” Or “NOOOO YOURE SO BAD! YOURE SO BAD! “ or something along those lines. 

I wish I didn’t mind his yelling, I really do, but I grew up in a home where my parents yelled at each other, me and my siblings, the pets, etc… just lots of yelling. We also have a roomate (20~ ish M), and I’m not sure how he feels about my boyfriend’s yelling.

I’ve confronted my BF multiple times and told him how his yelling makes me uncomfortable and scared, and how I really wish he wouldn’t raise his voice so much.  He usually responds with: “I just get excited” or “I’m not mad when I yell I am just really into the game”

So cutback to today. He’s on the game and I’m painting. He’s giving callouts to his friends and is doing fine until he dies on the game. “NOOOOOOO!!” He yells loud enough that I can hear through my noise canceling headphones. 

I look up at him with a sad face and he sighs. 

Before he’s told me that when I frown at him, he feels like I’m judging him for being an awful person, or I’m looking at him like he’s done something terrible.

I feel like I could be the asshole because I do remember him telling me that he feels judged when I frown at him, and I could have used a different way to express how I feel to him.

"AITA for cancelling on dinner with my bf family? Hey all, just wanted to start off and saying thank you for reading my post and I look forward to hearing if I am in the wrong or not.

I, 23M, have been dating this guy, 22M, four 4 months. Let’s call him Micheal (not real name). He currently lives with his family while working on a co-op (in school, but not taking classes for a semester to work for a company in his field). I just graduated and living in my own apartment. Bc of the living situation he comes over to my place to stay the night all of the time (3-4 nights a week and all day on the weekends). I have meet his family multiple times and even went to one of their Christmas parties.

I am very much an introvert and need time alone to recharge. I also have a dog to take care of. Also I am very connected with my family, but it has been difficult because for my job I moved away from my home town. However my younger sister does go to college where I live.

A few weeks ago I cancelled on our plans of watching the football game with his family because I mixed up what weekend my sister was coming in town. My other sister was planning to either make the drive to where I live that weekend or the next. My fault for not following up, but she texted me that morning saying she would be in town around 6pm. So I cancelled on my bf in order to see my sister for dinner.

Last week, my boyfriend cancelled on me to watch the game with him and his family bc he forgot he had work that day till about halfway through the game. He remember this on Saturday. I was fine with this bc things happen.

Anyways, to this week, my bf slept over at my place Sun, Wed, Fri, and stayed until 1:30 pm Saturday (about 30mins) before my parents arrived). My parents were coming in town for the weekend, staying at my place, to see my sister and bring her some things she forgot for her dorm. My family and boyfriend had lunch together on Sunday and then I ran some errands with my family before they left. I ended up falling asleep.

My bf woke me up by calling me a little past 5pm (5:03). We had planned on me coming over to his place to eat dinner with his family. I apologized for falling asleep and told him I was exhausted and needed to take a rain check. He was quiet but said okay and hung up. He then texted me asking me if we can talk on the phone later bc he is very upset that I have now cancelled on his family twice.

"AITA I don’t want my friends younger brother hanging out with us anymore This has sparked a major argument in the friend group so i dunno, looking for opinions. 

So me (29) and ‘Paul’ (28) have been mates since childhood. His younger brother ‘Will’ (22) became a pretty permanent staple in our group hangouts when he was around 15, and we were early 20’s. No one minded him, Will was a nice kid and he usually stuck pretty close to Paul when he was around. They were/are practically attached at the hip, you’d think they’re twins. 

I think Will’s a very alright kid. He gets along with everyone and is the clown whenever he’s in a room, naturally hilarious without really having to try. A sweetheart too but he isn’t a pushover. My only problem with him is he’s a bit… too much, sometimes. He’s very rowdy, very hyper, and sort of childish. Paul doesn’t help as he’s always acting like the kids on a leash when we all go out so we’re usually always around him. He’s got a knack for making everything about him, conversation gravitates toward him and he seems to never run out of things to say. 

What really sparked the rift was last Saturday. Will came out drinking with us and Paul and, in my opinion, overindulged. It was a karaoke pub, and he was up there for about ten minutes singing. Loudly and he gets unintelligible when he’s drunk like that. everyone else was having a good time so I didn’t say anything about it. When we were leaving, one of our friends pulled me aside and said that Will was getting sick in the restrooms so they’d be a few more minutes. 

I waited in the van for ten minutes before everyone came out. Will was so drunk he was hanging off his brothers shoulder. The drive home was unbearable. He even started crying about his breakup pretty hard, which I understand but he wouldn’t have been doing it if he wasn’t so drunk. I sort of snapped and asked him to keep it until I dropped them off, and Paul got upset at me and said that it was a six year relationship and all that, I tuned him out. I told him to watch what Will was drinking next time if he was going to be short with me, and Will started arguing with me about why I didn’t like him. He accused me of always taking the piss out him and treated him like the ‘little brother’, so I reminded him that, well, he WAS the little brother.

A couple of our friends got defensive, and a couple were in my side about my point, and we dropped them first. When we did, I casually tried to bring up maybe not inviting Will out with us anymore. 

The driver said he agreed with me and he thought Will was being a jackass. We didn’t talk about it anymore after that. 

I talked to my girlfriend about this because my friends have been passive aggressive toward me since, and even she scolded me and said that Will was perfectly fine.

OP: yep

F: That's shit. No wonder we have housing issues

OP: that's not the issue but ok sure 😅🤣

F: That is bullshit but ok sure. People from other countries coming here is a major contributor to the housing issues. Together with the fact that people stay single more often. The big boomer generation. And the fact that there are restrictions to build more.

"WIBTA: Quitting a Girl Guide group Hi! I (21f) am currently a leader in training at a guide group (Girl Scout but British) near to where I work. Due to a slight arguement with the main leader I am planning to quit so I am wondering if it would be the asshole move to do so. 

I am reasonably active scout and guide leader. (Two separate organisations where I live) which has caused a few upsets. I am used to the 'scout guide rivalry' but this leader takes it too far. 

This week, the university group I am part of is running a combined activity night for both groups. My guide group cannot come because the main leader (60+) did not hand out letters informing the girls until last Thursday, five days before the event. 

She then proceeded to indirectly blame me for both the activities being ran as well as how short notice the guides where given, either not realising that I was a major organiser of the event or knowing that. When I calmly pointed out that information had been sent out before Christmas, that she could have asked me at any point what the activities where and that it was not on fact scouts organising it but in fact the uni group. She replied with something along the lines of 'well you're certainly a know it all'. I then deleted wattsapp because I didn't want to respond. 

If I leave the group it would certainly burn a bridge. A lot of the girls would leave with me because she's dependent on how much I do. It would be seen as an asshole move because it's close to census and it's £40 now for a leader. I would pay it but still... the other trainee leader is moving away in the summer and so it would leave one other 'functioning' leader in the group. I'm not sure but we would no longer hit the adult to young person ratio for the indoor camp they are planning. However she turns down all my ideas on what to do and is the antithesis of what guiding should be. She does a lot of crafts and baking and I want to actually do 'scouting for girls' which is its founding principle. Figured I would ask an unknown mass of people on a burner account before I actually start looking at other groups with intent.",0.09

I won't go into every unecessary detail, but suffice to say the collision of various medical, work, and relationship stressors all at once have me on my last nerve. I banged my wrist on a doorknob yesterday and sunk to the floor and cried on the spot for a half hour because I just couldn't take one more fuckshit thing.

I had brunch planned for today with a pretty new acquaintance. It was actually scheduled weeks ago, so I didn't anticipate what kind of shape I was gonna be in today. We've hung out a handful of times and we have a lot in common, but she has a bit of an oversharing problem. My life sucks in the short term because right now I'm like a lightning rod for two years worth of shit that goes wrong to happen all at once. Her life sucks for more long-term family and mental health-related reason, which she has started going into with ever-increasing levels of morose detail. I'll be honest: It's way too much for how little we actually know each other. And I am really not in a place to become close friends with someone who chronically does not have a modicum of their shit together. But because of my current lightning rod situation, I have not been able to make a clean break. So I figured I would just get through today and then tell her I needed to take a step back when I had a crumb of dopamine to spare for that uncomfortable convo.

At like 6 am this morning she starts texting me stuff like ""You are literally the only person I can trust"" and ""I guess I've got a week to find my own place,"" and ""everything fucking falls apart."" Like ok relatable but also WHAT. Girl, I am not your facebook wall circa 2011. And I'm just thinking ahead to the hour-long hardcore trauma dump session that I am about to endure, so I text her back and say hey I'm really sorry for everything you're going through right now, but I am really in no position to be anyone's emotional support rn. So if you don't think you can have brunch today without bringing up intense shit, I'd rather just cancel.""

Response was basically ""Wow. Ok."" followed up several hours later with a bombardment of tweets about how the world doesn't revolve around me and how she's so sorry that the shit going wrong in her life right now didn't wait until it was convenient for me, but it sucks to be vulnerable and in need of a listening ear and be told essentially to shut the fuck up. Also that I care more about enjoying my brunch than I do about being an empathetic person.

"AITA for Farting During a Wedding Service? So, my sister’s (22f) wedding was yesterday, and it was a beautiful event overall. The venue was stunning, the decorations were perfect, and the bride looked absolutely radiant. However, there's a little incident that's been bothering me, and I (24m) need some perspective on whether I’m the asshole here.  
Everything was going smoothly during the ceremony. The vows were being exchanged, tears were flowing, and there was this serene ambiance in the air. That’s when it happened – I let out a tiny, involuntary fart. It wasn’t particularly loud, but it was definitely noticeable in the quietness of the moment.  
Now, here’s the thing: it wasn’t intentional at all. I swear, I was trying my best to hold it in, but sometimes your body just doesn’t cooperate. My sister, the bride, shot me this look of horror, which instantly made me feel like I’d committed a mortal sin right there in the church.  
Immediately, my family started shooting glares at me, and a few suppressed giggles broke out among the guests. It was mortifying, to say the least. I tried to apologize discreetly to my sister after the ceremony, but she was too overwhelmed with everything to really address it.  
Some of my friends are saying it’s not a big deal, that everyone farts and it was just unfortunate timing. But then there are others who are saying I completely ruined the sanctity of the moment and that I should have excused myself.  
I get that a wedding is a formal event and that bodily functions are generally frowned upon, but come on, it was just a fart. Am I really the asshole here? Should I have excused myself, or was it just an innocent bodily slip-up? Any thoughts would be appreciated.",0.15
"AITA for respectfully telling my friend that he shouldn't make fun of the weight of a man who was rude to him? My friend and I were shopping two nights  ago and we bought a decent amount of groceries. There was only one checkout lane open and while we were checking out, there was a middle aged guy behind us who seemed really impatient throughout the process, based on his face and he had his arms crossed. The cashier was very polite and cracking jokes with us, and when my friend paid, at first he accidentally put his credit card in backwards. It took us a few seconds to realize this and then the cashier said ""My good man, your card is in backwards!"" My friend laughed and put it in the right way, and as he did this, the man behind us says, somewhat softly, but loud enough for us to hear him ""brainless."" 

On the walk back in the parking lot, my friend was like ""dude what the hell was up with that guy behind us. So impatient."" I agreed, saying the dude looked like he had a stick up his butt, saying it was incredibly rude and  for him to call him brainless like that.

My friend then said ""I might not have a brain, but at least I also don't have a giant beer belly."" (The man was very overweight). I told my friend ""Well, he was terrible, but I don't think we need to go there."" For perspective, both my friend and I are thin, but my brother was ruthlessly bullied for being overweight in high school, and my friend is aware of this. So when people mock others for their weight, it does not sit well with me, even in the case of this man who was very rude.

My friend responded saying ""Well, it's true."" I again told my friend that while I agree that it was horrible for that man to insult him, it is not okay to mock other people's weight. I explained that even bad people should not be mocked for certain things, and weight, along with race, gender, and sexual is one of those things. He got defensive, saying I was sympathizing with the rude man, and said that it was ""Stupid"" for me to put weight in the same category as race, gender and sexual orientation.",0.03
AITA talking to a old friend at a party So I 15M have been talking to a girl 16f for about a month. I’ve known her for a year before hand but we just started talking. So she had a birthday party (her sweet 16) and one of the attendants was her friend who I’ll call Sofia. Me and Sofia have talked in the past around a year ago but decided to be friends and I hadn’t seen her in a few months so it was a nice surprise. Now the girl I’ve been talking to was busy talking to her family and other friends so I gave her space to do so. Something to note is I don’t know any of her friends besides Sofia so me and her end up spending most of the night hanging out nothing romantic just catching up. We went in and out the venue mainly for the bathroom and animals outside. So after the party I get a text from the birthday girl saying she was very mad that i didn’t talk to her at the party. I did tho multiple times it was just brief because she was busy. Then she told me that Sofia still liked me. Now Sofia did not know me and birthday girl were talking so ig she said something to birthday girl but I had no idea until after the fact. I’m also really oblivious when someone is flirting with me so I had no idea she was the entire night. But this whole thing led to a huge argument and we haven’t talked all day. I didn’t understand why she was mad until she said that she tought me and Sofia were flirting (we were not). It just turned into a huge thing that it didn’t need to be.

"AITAH for telling my boyfriend to stop sending his friend money?? Let me explain, I (22female) had a boyfriend
(22 male) I started dating him back in august and we hit it off when I first moved back to Florida to try n better myself but sadly that did work out, anyway I’m getting off topic. I met him in august and we hit it off but it was stuff the I immediately noticed where red flags in the relationship.
 
1. His Ex girlfriend text me telling me how he was still texting her still being intimate with her while we were together. She even went as far as to threaten to fight me. 

2. Another thing I noticed & BIGGEST turn off for me is that he would send his best friend (male 22: he has his own apartment, job and fiancé)
money every week, 
So my boyfriend works at Disney springs and he gets paid well but they don’t really give him hours so he gets paid like 95-125 every week depending on how they schedule him. So every week his best friend would text him and ask him would his check hit or if he got paid and then the following question would be “can you give me X amount of money” this amount would range from $25-$100 and my boyfriend would be left with nothing and I would have to foot the bill which is not really a problem but when I lost my job it became a struggle, so that is when I confronted and told him “you don’t have money to give away if you barely have any for yourself. You make me empty promises for some things and I think that now you are in a relationship that you shouldn’t be giving out money so willingly” he got angry at me and told me that he was his best friend and they have been doing this kinda thing since they met in college and that I should mind my business after this argument we had I found out his friend told him to break up with me and after I didn’t like him after that because he called my “behavior” “unhealthy” but what really upsets me about his best friend is that everytime me and my boyfriend have a argument his best friend has something  to say about it and then my boyfriend will listen to the bug that he puts in his ear about me saying that my behavior is unhealthy for him and his broke up with me 3 days ago and I’ve been heart broken ever since because I was only trying to tell my boyfriend what’s right.

"AITA for asking my girlfriend why she won’t post us on instagram? I (23 m) have been with my girlfriend (24 f ) for almost a year and a half, I personally have had a lot of girls cheat on me and so on in the past so that’s a big concern of mine obviously, I’ve asked my girlfriend over the time we’ve been together if she’d ever post us or put anything in her bio on instagram and Ik that’s dumb and not important but for me it helps ease my mind if that makes sense in the way of it shows from my girlfriends perspective of her life that I exist, I mean she posts me on Snapchat on her “friends only” story presumably but will post everything else on her “public profile” (she claims she doesn’t know the difference and hits my story which I believe to be false and a very weird coincidence but anyways). Not too long ago I did catch her with some guy she was talking to on instagram and that they actually met up and stuff, I still have the screenshots of the post the guy made with her which Ik maybe dumb I’m still with her but I was willing to give her the benefit of the doubt on her story but since then she’s been “leading me on” about posting us on instagram and when I asked about it the other day she blew up about it and we’ve been off the past few days but idk, am I acting too paranoid? Is there more red flags I should be looking out for? Another thing is I tend to spoil the hell out of her which I plan on stopping now because it’s like I told her I shouldn’t be buying her this and that if she can’t do something as simple as posting me which she claims as really dumb but will post herself btw.

"AITA for creating a ""drawing wall""? This is stupid but. My stepdad's son is having some problems in his marriage so his 4 kids are staying with me, my stepdad and my mom for a while. Two of them have an annoying habit: they like to draw on the walls.

Now, I used to draw on the wall as a kid, and my mom always made me clean it afterwards. But when I told them to clean it, they started throwing really big tantrums. I'm not an authority figure to them so I don't really feel like I'm in a position to give them a timeout or anything of the sort, so I told them that if they wanted to draw on the wall they had to draw on a specific wall. It took a bit of convincing but eventually they agreed and now only draw on that wall. It's easier for me to clean it up there instead of when it's scattered all over the house. 

I thought it was a good enough solution but my stepdad is saying that I'm encouraging their bad behavior and going against his orders for them (don't draw on any walls). I think that since they just ignore him, I get to find a way for them to make the least mess. My mom is neutral but thinks they should start learning to clean it. AITA?",0.86
"AITA for supporting my friend when she found out her husband had an affair with our friend? I (34F) have been friends with (let’s call her Alana) 33F for around 7 years. We met through work when we moved to another country to support the company expansion! We very quickly became close friends and I have always thought of her as more of a sister than anything due to us spending so much time together and us being so far from our families. Around 5 years ago we met Ronald (37M) and George (35M) who moved to the same area as us for the same company! We all became good friends and often described ourselves as a family. Things were great between the 4 of us and our bond became much stronger in 2020 due to the pandemic and us not being able to fly home to see our families for 2 years. Shortly after this we met a married couple, Ben (34M) and Fiona (36F) who were again moving to the area for our company! The 6 of us would all spend holidays together and socialise often! 6 months after Ben and Fiona moved here I was out for dinner with Alana when she told me she had a crush on Ben! I told her to shut it down because we were all friends with them as a couple and that it wasn’t cool that she was thinking of Ben like that. I thought that it done until 4 months ago when I found out from Fiona that Alana and Ben had been having an affair! I was shocked and upset that they had done this but trying to remain neutral in the whole mess I messaged Alana and told her that although I didn’t agree with her and Ben having an affair I would be there for her as always as I didn’t want her to be alone! Understandably Fiona was upset and angry and I wanted to support her too so when she asked if I could tell our mutual friend Rose (36F) so that she didn’t have to speak about it again, I did. Rose was a close enough friend that she would have found out the next day anyway so I didn’t see the issue if it was helping Fiona when she was hurting! That night Ronald messaged me asking if I told Rose, I told him I had as Fiona had asked me to and he was angry with me. He accused me of gossiping and not having Alana’s back, he even said I had clearly been “masquerading” as Alana’s friend for the past 7 years! I tried to contact Alana after this and she had ignored all of my calls. Ronald has never spoken to me again other than to call me a piece of shit and George has clearly sided with them! I’m not sure how me supporting my friend Fiona after she just found it her husband had been having an affair with our friend has let to me losing the people I considered family for the past few years?

"AITA for telling my girlfriend to mind her own business? I(28M) was pretty pumped to introduce my girlfriend of two months(28F) to my younger sister(24F). She lives nearby me so I thought it made sense for her to just come over to my place and meet my gf there.

My sister comes over, and they meet and the entire night, I thought things went well. As soon as my sister leaves, my girlfriend goes, "" She needs to start watching her weight"".

I was shocked she went immediately to that. Now, does my sister have a weight issue? Yes, a noticeable one. She's probably 75-80 lb overweight, but I don't get why my GF would just kick things off with that.

I asked why that mattered. My girlfriend at first insisted it didn't but then proceeded to say that obesity should always raise concerns. I asked what the issue was. My girlfriend said that her takeaway from my sister being "" so fat"", was that my sister lacks self-control and is lazy.

I told my girlfriend to just shut her mouth and mind her own business. My GF said I was over the top rude.

"AITA for telling my son he won't be getting any inheritance because he had an affair? My son is 27 years old, he had a great girlfriend(let's call her Kate) who helped take care of my wife when she had surgery, for context, my wife had Cirrhosis and was frequently hospitalized. Kate was almost always there every day for it. My wife eventually passed away. A week ago, we found out that my son and Kate broke up. This was very strange to us because they had a stable relationship and everything seemed to be just fine a month ago. After practically interrogating Kate, she told us she caught my son cheating with someone, while they were still in a relationship. And apparently, that affair has been happening for over a year. I had a sit down with my son, and after presenting to him what we know, he admitted to the whole thing. He said he hadn't enjoyed the relationship for a while but didn't want to break up with Kate because Kate was ""too nice."" This was very upsetting to me because Kate has been a great help to us over the years and was like a daughter. And the way he treated this relationship was immature and hurtful. So I told him he wouldn't be getting any inheritance because he is an adulterer, and I will be damned if any of my money goes to an adulterer. (I know he technically isn't married so that is not true in the strictest of terms). This greatly upsets him as he believes the punishment is too harsh for the crime. Truthfully speaking, it is not the adultery part that bothers me. 99% of it is because it is Kate. I love her as a daughter so it was very personal when my son did what he did. AITA?",0.38
"AITA for being mad that my fiance left our son with his ex? My fiance and I have a 18 month old son. Recently, he flew out to visit his mom and brother with our son. It was a mix of wanting to spend time with them and a ""send off"" as his mother's health is failing and she can no longer live independently or take care of his brother who's mentally disabled. I wanted to go with them, but I couldn't take off work.

Both his mother and brother experienced health emergencies while he was there. Specifically, his mom had a stroke and had to be rushed to the hospital. A day later, his brother was admitted for a seizure. The whole thing was very distressing for him and upset our son. So, he ended up taking our son to his ex-girlfriend's house while he made trips to the hospital.

The ex doesn't live too far away from his mom, so I get why he did it, but I don't like it. Mainly because I suspect he still has some feelings for her. He always speaks fondly of her and  they still text each other. Granted, he's transparent about it and they've never crossed a line. The breakup was mutual but he never told me what the reasons were.

I confronted him about this and asked why couldn't he have contacted another family member. He said it was more convenient and the first person he thought of. I told him that I wish he would've called me first and got my approval. He said that was crazy and to put myself in his shoes, saying I wouldn't have done that if I was in the middle of a crisis. He says his ex is basically a pseudo-relative anyway.

I got mad and said he wasn't considering my feelings and he said I needed to let it go and stop being childish. I don't think he realizes how much this bothers me.",0.77
"AITA for sleeping with the clean pillowcase my fiance washed? My fiance (28M) and I(26F) have lived together for almost 3 years. I usually wash the sheets, or they get washed because I asked him too. I have never washed sheets and only washed my pillowcase, I always wash both. Today he asked me to leave the washer open for him to do clothes, no problem. He then decided his pillowcase could use a wash, but not the whole bed. Didn't take my pillowcase off, just his. I told him it was wrong and joked about how I 'would never do this to him' to make him feel bad, but he never offered his pillow instead. When we got to bed he took his pillowcase out and put it on his pillow. He went to get the dog so I switched our pillows(we have the same exact pillows and sheets). When he got back, I told him what I did. He's saying I'm wrong for this and it's a 'bad quality' of mine to be vindictive like this. I say that after 3 years I literally can't believe he thinks that, considering I would never think to waste an entire load of laundry on just my pillowcase when his is right there. (Obviously this is NBD but the first time we both can't agree to disagree) AITA?


UPDATE:

To clear up a couple of things: 

1. He washed the pillowcase on it's own, not with clothing or other items.

2. I DID communicate with him that it was wrong of him before I took the pillowcase. I expected him to offer me the pillowcase since I would never think to wash my pillowcase on it's own and not at least grab his too. Since I'm the one who normally will wash the sheets, our pillowcases have not been washed for the same amount of time. If his is dirty, wouldn't mine be too?

3. I'm very capable of washing my own things, and I do. I also do our towels and usually our bedding. I just think in a world that makes sense; if you're gonna do a load of laundry for one pillowcase, you may as well grab mine too. Especially as a 'you always do it for us, so I'll do it for you this time'. I don't mind or complain about doing these things, I just think it could have been reciprocated.

4. We recently bought our home and upgraded to a king bed. We will be buying a second set of sheets I promise hahaha

UPDATE 2:

My fiance has told me to tell everyone that he has clinically diagnosed OCD, knew he hadn't washed his hair in a couple days, and wanted a clean pillowcase since he did wash his hair yesterday. He didn't throw it in with clothes because shirts are washed one way, pants another, pillowcases also their own way. He says not grabbing mine was essentially an oversight, and knows he was wrong and an asshole for it. The post wasn't to ask if he was wrong, it was just to ask if me taking the pillowcase was fair all things considered. For everyone thinking there has to be another piece to the puzzle, there isn't! Sometimes OCD can make you have tunnel vision just like ADHD. This is the last time I'm updating this, but thank you for all the therapy and break up recommendations. We won't be taking them!",0.56
"AITA for attacking an acquaintance because she said I was a colonialist? So I (21f) am currently studying in college in the United states as an international student. I want to preface the interaction by saying that I am not the best of conversationists out there, and try as I might there are so many moments where I doubted if my words are too rude while in the shower. This is one of them. I have this acquaintance / friend of a friend/ someone who really overstayed their welcome, whom I shall call Anna. I'll freely admit that I've never liked her much, as while I'm not the most tactful person out there either, she fully takes it up a notch. 

Most clear memory was the time where when we were studying in the library, one of our friends asked Anna to borrow notes for a class cause they were tired and dozing off. Anna proceeded to tattle on said friend during office hours; we found out when the instructor called friend over after class to ask if their sleep schedule was ok. That left a bitter taste in everyone's mouth. Still, she accosts us at the library and we sadly can't hog all the seats at the table; and being the non-confrontational fools we are, no one has yet said you can't sit here. 

So, its spring semester right now, which means internships. I was drowning in applications and made a casual remark that life would be so much easier if I just got a green card, and my friends were joking about marrying me to help me out. Anna suddenly jumped in and said that I'm contributing to the settler colonialism of the United States, and that all of our existence here is unjust. We should all return to our ethnical ""homelands"" and cede the land, and I certainly shouldn't be contributing to the settler colonialist project by moving here. Instead, I should've stuck it out and help my ""home country"" to rebuild and ""decolonise"", even though my home country loves me not. It took us all by surprise. 

I admit I might be TA here. I said well you just said I can't come due to my race, and since if its my job to stick it out in my ""motherland"" however she hates me and watch her decay, shouldn't you be back in Africa rebuilding your ""homeland"" and helping them to decolonise? If I can't stay here because I'm Asian why can you stay when Blacks are not indigenous to the Americas either? She said she's been here for generations and ""her blood's all mixed"", so I said ""damn you can take your pick now."" She stormed away calling me a racist.

"AITA for ignoring my abusive wife? So I (45M) was playing Fortnite, as I usually do. I am pretty good at the game and I take it very seriously. One time, I even made $100 from a local tournament.

I looked online for the skin, and saw it had not been in the store for a little over 6 whole years, and saw an account that had it for $4,500. For context, I work for $19.19/hr at Charley's Cheesesteaks as a foreman, and my wife (26F) is our primary breadwinner. We have two kids (5F and 6M) and we have a college fund for them that contains \~$10,000 so far.

The listing said it would be going away soon, and besides, you don't even know if your kids are going to go to college anyways, right? Push comes to shove I can make the money back pretty easily. So, I spent $4,500 on the account (plus a small tax) and started playing with the awesome skin. It made me feel so great, I even ended up getting a crowned Royale.

However, my wife ended up checking our shared bank account and came to me, furious. She claimed that my purchase was utterly useless (it wasn't) and that our kids would suffer for it. I calmly and politely explained that it would be good for my mental health, but all she did was keep yelling at me and even cussed a few times (in front of our kids, too!).

"AITA for following a woman all around a place where she was supposed to be working ? So I just got back from an trip that I took for a few days ago and I went somewhere to see a friend. She's someone who I have been friends with for a long time, since 2018 and lately I seemed to have grown attached to her. I believe this has happened as I've had dated women within the last few years who just shredded me into pieces and emotionally abused me from criticizing my finances cause I'm poor and harassed me for having aspergers and not speaking a lot when I'm nervous around someone new. That isn't a case when it comes to my long time friend as I feel so comfortable around her. 

I traveled up to Maryland this past weekend to go see her at an lunar new year festival. She's a musician and so she had a gig there for a day so I drove up there to see her. I haven't seen her in a year and so I missed her so much. I went with my family and my aunts and uncles and during the whole time I was at the convention center, I followed her around the convention center when she was busy doing a few stuff. I developed feelings for her so I couldn't help myself but wanting to talk to her more which I did get to. I've talked to her multiple times each time I got a chance to and even went backstage to find her and talk to her. 

We have a close knit friendship and so she wasn't bothered by it. My uncle and aunts on the other hand had a different opinion. On the way home, my uncle criticized me cause I was following her around the places which made a whole bunch of people stared at me and started pointing and laughing. I didn't even notice any of it cause I was focused on talking to her that I basically tuned out the whole crowd. My uncle told me ""Your so obsessed with her to the point where you are literally stalking her."". I don't believe a one bit that I'm stalking her as she didn't seemed to be bothered by it as she knows me well enough that I mean no harm to her. 

I just don't understand why is there so much hate for me loving her. She's the only woman whoever treated me right so it makes sense in my opinion to want to talk to her and spend time with her. She brings me joy, hapiness and makes me feel good about myself whenever she is around as she is so sweet and treats me well. She's the only one who has never criticized me or made fun of me for being autistic. Would it be bad to follow her around places when we have been friends for so long ?",0.83

I (23f) Sarah bought a rose bouquet for my girlfriend (23f) today to ask her to be my valentine for Valentine’s Day. I had seen it all over TikTok and thought it would be a cute idea to ask her on a date in a romantic way. 

I had told my friend (24f) lily about saying how the flowers looked beautiful and my girlfriend would be so happy. My friend asked me why I was buying so many flowers and wasting them because they would die before Valentine’s Day.

"AITAH for refusing to share a bed with a male friend for weeks? I (F) am going on vacation with five of my friends. We want to rent a whole house together. Four of them are in a relationship, so they will have two rooms as a couple. So there is me and the male friend left. Of course it would be way cheaper if we slept in a room together and would not have to rent a 4-bedroom house. I've shared a bed with him before during a short vacation and he's a good friend, but this time I insisted on having my own room. I'm going to spend 1600$ on a 2 week long vacation. I'm honestly sick to always have to share a bed with someone I'm not in a relationship with or sleep on the couch during vacation, just because I don't have a partner. I know he doesn't have any intentions to make a move on me, I just want to have some space for myself to relax and not having to worry about another person in my room (changing clothes, different sleeing schedules...) during my vacation. I even offered to pay extra for having a room to myself. The problem is, he can't afford paying extra. AITAH for still insisting on having my own bedroom?

Since there are still questions left,  going to try to explain it better.

Renting a 3 bedroom house = 2 people/room

So we'd divide the costs equally.

Me having a single room means my friend will have a single room too. So let's say the costs increase by 600$. For me it would be fair to divide the costs between us two, so each of us has to pay 300$ more.

The problem is he can't afford the +300$.

So I'd have to cover the difference alone while we both have an upgrade and I'm wondering if that's fair.

It just feels like I have to pay more to have the same comfortable holiday as the couples, just because I'm not in a relationship.

  
UPDATE: Surprisingly, we found someone who will go on this trip as well and will share a room with him, so I have a spare room for myself. So we need to have 4 Rooms anyway.

I offered to pay a bit more as I am the only person sleeping alone and I guess that's a fair solution for everyone.

"AITA for being upset that my fiance talked through my birthday dinner to his sister for two hours so that no one else got to chat? TL; DR: Fiance talked during my birthday dinner at a steakhouse for 2 hours with his sister whilst everyone else was able to say maybe a few sentences total. I was not happy at all by the end of it. AITA for getting upset? 

At birthday dinner for me with my fiances family. (We've been together 10+ years so, nothing new!) Short and simple, my fiance talked practically the entire time to his sister and almost none of us were able to converse besides them. I tried talking with his mom and brother, but it was hard to talk over the two of them. His mom kept mishearing me (she's not hard of hearing either, she's pretty young for a grandmom) so I just gave up talking and sat in silence for a while, along with everyone else that couldn't get a word in edge wise. And our daughter sat there completely bored out of her mind.

 They weren't leaving the conversation open for anyone to join either, if that makes sense. Played on my phone at the very end when I was fed up because he didn't even notice at all that no one else was talking besides him and her. The food also took forever, so we were sitting there just shy of 2 hours. Yes. It took. that. long! Thank goodness his younger brother noticed my discomfort and herded everyone into leaving the restaurant finally. 

I mean, it was supposed to be my birthday dinner and I didn't really enjoy it. 
He didn't even notice that I had a sour face until we got in the car when he started repeatedly asking me what's wrong and I just knew if I said what was bothering me that it would start an argument. So I lied and said ""nothing, I'm just tired."" 

 I would have rather cooked at home.

"AITA for asking my aunt how old she is? I 19(F) went to boarding school when I was 10 years old and after graduating went to college. so I rarely saw my relatives or attended any functions. My aunt ( father's sister in law) comes to my town every year because her mother lives there. She stays at our house the whole time she's there. 

Yesterday me and my father visited their home . I was visiting them for the first time. Immediately I could tell she wanted us gone. She kept asking if we had some work and how long it'll take. 
She was telling me about how she exercises and goes swimming and how she looks so much younger than she is. This went on for about an hour and I was tired. 

I asked her how old she was. And she got mad and said that I shouldn't ask anyones age and how wrong it was. I felt really bad and also sort of embarrassed. I didn't say anything after that because I didn't know what to say .  She is also telling my other relatives about how disrespectful I was. But I don't think it was that much of a big deal. I don't know if I should apologize.

"AITA for making a dinner I know my partner doesn’t like? So I (F22) and my partner (M24) have been together for 2 years and living together for just over a year. 
Tonight he gets home from work and I’m laying in bed with a splitting headache and feeling shit over all (I had also worked all day but from home). We exchange the usual “hi how was your day” stuff and then I tell him how awful I’m feeling he replies with “are you still making bolognese for dinner?”
I look at him with disbelief and say no to which he says “oh ok I will put the mince in the freezer” and walks off.
He then comes back in 15 minutes later and I ask if he can do anything for dinner. Response “no I don’t want to cook”
Me “ok so what will we have?”
Him “I don’t know.” Then walks off again.
I could hear him go into the office and start playing video games, and as I lay there with an awful headache and every part of my body hurting I just think “f**k this, I’m not having takeout I need nutrition”. So I roll out of bed trying not to fall over as my head goes fuzzy, take two more Panadol (I had already taken some earlier) and head to the kitchen.
I open the fridge to find the mince that he had not put in the freezer a sad carrot and a container of leftover mash potato and I decide to make shepherds pie. Which I love and haven’t had in nearly 2 years because my partner says he doesn’t like it.
I get to cooking and just as I’m about to put it in the oven dish my partner comes into the kitchen.
Him “oh you put peas in it..?” (No are you feeling better? Can I help?)
Me “ yes it’s shepherds pie.”
Him with a raised voice “why would you make that you know I don’t like it!?” 
Me “well you weren’t going to make anything..”
Him now yelling “well it’s just rude you would make something I don’t like!!” As he storms back to the office saying stuff under his breath I can’t hear.
I’m left standing in the kitchen in utter disbelief. I do most of the cooking in the house and I always try to do substantial nutritional meals with leftovers he can take to work, and when he does cook, it’s usually something frozen or ordered. Sometimes when it is his turn to cook, he will make things I can’t eat and just says  “I’ll cook mine and you cook yours.”

So I’m sick, feeling like shit ,now crying. All I wanted was some comfort food. and my partner yells at me and makes me feel bad for cooking, something he doesn’t like (he has also never tried it).

"AITA if I sue my brother for the $1500 I loaned him? I (F, 26) loaned my brother (M, 34) $1957 back in September of 2023 to get his car fixed. I honestly feel sick reading the text messages of the whole situation because I feel like he guilted me and took advantage of me. My mother also said that I was being selfish and need to help my family when they need help because I am more financially responsible and stable. 

Anywho, I ORIGINALLY loaned him 1957 and he's paid it down to 1244. But he missed his payment last month and then guilted/harassed me into giving him an additional $241. My husband was very upset with me, but I tried to explain that I felt guilted into it. My brother made me feel like he was going to fail in life if he didn't get his car back. 

I keep asking my brother when he's going to make his next payment but he hasn't responded to me. He gave me his laptop which he swore was worth over $500 but I've been having a hard time finding anyone to even buy it for $300. I regret loaning him the money and should've just blocked him and told my mom to shut up about her thoughts. 

AITA if I sue him for 1244? I don't know what background I should provide honestly it'll just make me look dumber for loaning him the money in the first place. He bought a BMW and he races it around and has practically destroyed the car and it needs tons of repairs all the time. He always takes it in without a plan on how to pay for it when it's time to pick it up. I'm a sucker for helping people in their time of needs but I feel like my brother took advantage of me.

"AITA for not attending a classmates wedding ? #AITA There is this classmate of mine who i heard last year was planning on getting married to a guy who graduated last year on the same Degree as us, a little background on this, me and the classmates are not close to each other, we only talk when we are in the class and that's about it. The thing is I am the class president and usually such news on the class comes to be first but this time I heard that she was planning on getting married last year around August during the summer break, I was happy for her ofcourse and just thought since I heard it from someone who is not her and is not close to her that maybe she would want to tell me herself and so I didn't go and talk to her about it.

Fast forward this January, we were all taking Finals exam in the uni and on the last day I heard from other classmates of mine that she was planning on having a small party for the class and announce that she is getting married, and after that day I still did not hear anything, mind you I am still hearing from other people that she is indeed getting married.

And so, last Wednesday a close friend of mine called and informed me that she was invited to the wedding and asking me if we could go together because we live close to one another to which I replied, I wasn't invited and so wouldn't be able to attend, she said she thought that I was invited and that it's fine she will go on her own. 

Fast forward to the day of the wedding which was last thursday around 10:00 a.m in the morning, I saw from one of my close male friends status on WhatsApp that he was attending the wedding and I asked him, were u invited by the class mate and he said a guy that she is close with on the class told them and invited them( they are about 9 guys) on her Behalf and I said okay. And on the afternoon of that day i saw from Snapchat and status that a couple of classmates were attending too and were congratulating her, I didn't congratulate her because I thought since she didn't inform me that she was getting married that I didn't need to congratulate her.

After the wedding, this Saturday I suddenly get a call from a couple of my good friends individually asking why I didn't come to the wedding or congratulate her and I said, I only heard her getting married from other people and not from her, so i didn't want to attend a wedding I wasn't invited to because that will make me feel embarrassed. But they all argued that since I was the class president this was wrong of me and I had to attend whether I was invited or not.  This is an Eastern African culture were u can attend the wedding even if u don't have invitation.

My thing is those friends of mine were invited to the wedding and I wasn't, even if I am class president, I felt like this wasn't a good thing to do.

"AITA for not wanting my kids to engage in unsafe activities? To preface, I’m from the city and my husband is from the countryside. So there’s definitely a slight culture clash.

We have two girls, 16 and 14 years old. They get along very well and the 14YO is a part of 16YO’s friend group.

A few days my youngest posted a story on her IG account and I was horrified. It was a video of her and her sister riding in the open back of a truck. I was very scared for their lives, so I immediately grounded them and explained that what they did was unsafe. I also notified the parents of another kid who was sitting with them.

They went and complained to my husband and he said I overreacted, he rode in the back of the truck multiple times as a teen and he never once died or gotten hurt. He said it’s completely okay and I’m overprotective of our girls.

Now I’m worried that maybe I did, in fact, overreact. But I think what they did was very irresponsible and they could’ve gotten hurt.",0.64
"AITA for setting a boundary? I've been with my girlfriend for 4 years and before me she had been in 2 other relationships. She hasn't had any contact with any of her exes while we've been together. One of them added her on facebook and instagram around a month ago. She told me and didn't accept the request.  
  
He then messaged apologising for adding her and just said he hopes she's well. She told me about this and said she hates being on bad terms with people and asked if I was okay with her messaging him back to let him know how she is and to say she hopes he's well. I told her I did find it weird that she wanted to reply but I can't stop her from messaging anyone.  
  
She then mentioned a couple of other messages he sent and what she said in reply. We then went away on holiday and she said he mentioned that he'd asked her to let him know when she arrives safely. She again asked if I was fine with her messaging him to let him know. I said I again found it weird and that I don't want her spending the holiday messaging her ex. She said she wouldn't be and it would just be 1 message.  
  
When we got back home he messaged again asking how the holiday went and she asked if it was okay for her to reply. TI told her that if she replied then I'd like it to be the last reply she sends him since it's becoming a common occurrence now when it was only supposed to be 1 message. She said she didn't see the problem but I just repeated that it's weird how much she wants to talk to her ex. 

We were watching videos on my girlfriend phone later in the night and I saw his name appear 4 times to say he had messaged her.  I said if she wants to keep messaging her ex she can be single and do it but that I'm not going to just sit back while she enjoys catching up with an ex boyfriend.  
  
She said I should just trust her and that I shouldn't be telling her who she is allowed to talk to but I just pointed out it seems suspicious that she cares this much about talking to an ex boyfriend that she clearly doesn't care about how it makes her actual boyfriend feel. I said I'm not stopping her talking to him, I'm just pointing out I won't be here while she does it.

"AITA for going on vacation without my GF ? Hey guys,  


My GF (32) and I (28) have been together for a bit more than 1 year. She's Chinese and lives in France and I'm French. We already went on vacation 3 times together in 1 year. In August, my brother and a friend were talking about going 3 weeks to Japan in March 2024. They asked me and I accepted but didn't tell it to my girlfriend because I wanted a trip with them and to be honest Japan is quite expensive and every time I go on vacation with my GF I always end up paying more than her (usually 70% for me and 30% for her) eventhough I don't really earn more than her but it's ""her culture"" that the man pays more.

To be honest I didn't tell her because I knew it was going to be super expensive for me if she was going too and that I wouldn't have enjoyed my trip with my brother and my friend as much as if she was with me. I'm already paying like 3kUSD total just for me. I'm going to take into my savings since my job is not really paying well but with her I would have ended up paying like more than 4kUSD at least... I told her only in November that I had a trip planned to Japan because my friend and my brother convinced my to join them. She's really mad because I didn't talk to her before and she said she could have come with. Now she wants to break up because she says I only think about me and she doesn't excpect her BF to take decisions like this without telling her.  


I know I'm wrong and should have told her but at the same time we went on vacation 3 times already in a year together and I wanted to enjoy the time with my friend. And as I said before, didn't want to use all my money tbh... AITA for not telling her before ?

"AITA for driving a car into the curb which resulted in a huge fine/damages?   
I (M27) am upfront about what I don't like and cannot do. Since 17 I have had a fear a well as a type of just apathy to driving. I can walk, take public transport - it has never been such a big problem. However all my friends --- they drive.. they are the type that really studied a lot about their cars before they bought cars that they took loans/years of savings for - and some of them are reckless drivers.  
Today (not the first time someone has asked) my friend (MAX 25)'s new boyfriend (PAUL 30) asked me to drive over to his place to pick up something. I said I don't drive I would be happy to split cab fare with you and PAUL said it as okay.  
Later on, we went out to join a group of friends and everyone got drunk and wasted - except for me because I have to take my medications without alcohol or other substances. As everyone partied, I was with some friends from work who stopped by for the live band. I was then waiting to pay my bill and leave with them and go to another music show with my friends.  
PAUL runs over and says that I have to drive them to a hospital because he had too much to drink. I said once again I didn't drive but I can get you a cab. He then went on the give me a 5 minute lecture on how his car was super valuable and could not be left at this bar.   
That was not enough. With MAX wasted Paul basically ordered me to show him my wallet and he saw that I have a driver's license which I only have as a form of identification. He said you can drive for sure and then we headed into a car with two other people that I know casually from the bars - CLEO (36) and SIMON (28).  
SIMON was extremely anxious and worried and kept telling me to speed up and go faster and faster. I kept it at the speed limit and just before the hospital there were two signals. At the first signal the light was red for a long time - which means that the light is either broken or the road is closed..  
Then one of them puked inside the car and PAUL freaked out and with everything happening I got super anxious and had a panic attack and I just pressed down on the accelerator instead of hitting the break and swerved the car right into the sidewalk/curb area. We had to call the cops who wrote us tickets and fines (also some for drunk and disorderly conduct/public nuisance etc..) and I told them that I never drove and only did so because someone needed to go to the hospital. SIMON ended up getting his stomach pumped. Not fun.  
PAUL has since insisted that I was the cause of the accident since I didn't perform well under pressure even though I as sober. MAX is still friends with him but no longer dating him and said I should not consider it. He started sharing my name and number in groups saying that I wrecked his car and his life because I am a child who cannot drive. I made it clear from the beginning that I don't drive.

"AITAH for getting married the same year as my cousin I (26f) plans on getting married in the year 2025. For context I am NOT engaged yet. My boyfriend of 2.5 years plans on proposing sometime this year, and our plan is to get married after we buy a house together in 2025. We currently live together in his house. We are very specific on where we want our forever home to raise children in and grow old in. We have gone over finances and created a plan to hit our goals within the next two years. My cousin (27f) has been engaged for a year and a half now, she decided to put her wedding on hold due to the future grooms cousin getting married in 2024. My cousin will be getting married late 2025, and plot twist: the grooms cousin decided to change their wedding date to a few weeks before their wedding after they booked a venue. I have been told by two family members it would be rude and inconsiderate to get married in 2025 since our cousin is and I should just wait until 2026. By the time my cousin gets married her engagement will be close to 3 years long. Before her engagement she told me that I better not get engaged or married before she is. Personally, I am not extremely close with my cousin, her family may or may not come to my wedding. My future fiancé and I will be doing a destination wedding that we are preparing for financially. We aren’t sure when or where, we don’t even know if realistically we can book a place in 2025. But if a place is available we want to. No one is required to be at our wedding besides our parents, honestly the smaller the better. I come from a small family but two weddings in one year doesn’t seem like it should be this huge issue. I don’t feel like I should put my wedding on hold for her as she will be at a 3 year engagement. Kudos to her for putting her. wedding on hold for others but I don’t think I should have to.

"WIBTA for wanting my boyfriend to get a new mattress? Am I crazy for thinking it’s disgusting that I’ve slept in the same bed my boyfriend has had many other girls in? He says that it’s perfectly normal and that I’m just crazy and insecure for thinking that. I only just found out this information and it made me sick to my stomach thinking about how I’ve slept in the same bed that he’s  had sex with other girls in. 

Coming from me when I broke up with my ex, I almost immediately got a brand new bed and mattress because I thought it was disgusting to continue to sleep in it after we broke up, now I’m not saying he should buy a whole brand new bed. All I’m saying is atleast a new mattress 🤷‍♀️ mattresses aren’t too expensive and they last years so investing in one wouldn’t be too bad.

Some may side with him but it’s honestly a personal preference of mine and I wish he would respect that because if he asked me to do the same I would do it in a heartbeat.

"AITA for calling out my partner's bad habit? I (40f) and my partner (40m) have known each other since high school. I like almost everything about him, but he has one habit that I find disgusting. If he's eating something with his hands (like fries,)
 he does this thing where instead of wiping his hands on a napkin, he kind of rubs his fingers with his thumb and brushes the salt and crumbs off his fingers over his food. I don't normally say anything because it's over his own food, so it's not like I'm eating it. I do find it off putting though, and try not to pay attention to him when he's eating something that doesn't require a fork.

Last night he was over. I always keep a big bag of almonds on hand because that's what I eat for a snack. He started eating the almonds, then I noticed he was doing the finger thing over the open bag of almonds. He saw the look of disgust on my face and said 'what?' I said 'nothing' at first, then I said 'can you not do the finger thing over the open bag?'

He looked at me like I was crazy and was like 'it's just salt. Would you rather I wipe my hand on the couch?' I said 'no, but it's kind of gross.' He was petting my dog and throwing his ball for him so it's not like his hands were clean. I was mostly surprised that he justified his actions, because he always did it so absentmindedly that I didn't even think he realized he was doing it. I said 'can you just not do it over the open bag? Cause now I can't eat them.' He repeated that it was just salt, but ok. I dropped the subject because I didn't want to make a big deal of it, but he seemed a bit short and standoffish for the rest of the night. 

So AITA for calling him out? I feel like I embarrassed him, which wasn't my intention. The reason our relationship works so well it's because we don't make a big deal out of petty things. I'm sure I'm not perfect either, so now I'm worried that I opened the door for him to call me out on the things he doesn't like that I do. I also have PMS so I feel like I might have made a bigger deal out of it than it should have been. It really has been bothering me though, and all I could see were dirt particles being sprinkled over the almonds.",0.82
"AITA for throwing soup all over my sister Hi, I (28F) hate being touched. Like, the feeling of being touched is very overwhelming to me. For example, a friend tried to link arms with me while we walked to a bar a couple weeks ago and I was so uncomfortable, all I could focus on was the sensation of her arm touching mine; so uncomfortable to the point that she noticed and asked if I wanted her to let go (I said yes). This aversion to touch and closeness in general is something everyone in my life knows about, my friend even got me a “Don’t touch me pin” that I now keep on my desk to ward off unwanted touch from my coworker friends. During the holidays my family laughs about how much I hate being hugged and then proceed to all hug me like it’s a fun tradition. Friends laugh about how every time they take a step toward me, I take a step back to keep a decent distance between us. Okay enough background, I hate touch, you get it. Okay, so yesterday my sister (29f) walked by after I had just settled in a cozy chair with some yummy soup. She immediately got close to me and started making weird sounds. For a minute I was like “hahaha *grinding teeth* get away haha” but she just came closer and closer. To the point where she was bending down so her face was in my face, and she was standing in front of me so put one of her legs up on mine and continued with these extremely overwhelming weird sounds as she got closer and closer and closer, all the while I was trying to get her to stop in a fun sisterly tone (I didn’t want to embarrass her). Eventually she started reaching for my spoon but in quick movements so I couldn’t catch her. These quick jabs for my soupy spoon resulted in some soup being splashed on me…. The sounds. The proximity. The touching. And THE SOUP DRIP. It all became too much. In that moment red rage filled my vision and without thinking I splashed the entire bowl of soup all over her. It not only went all over her, but also the ENTIRE ROOM. Including under/on/in furniture, the curtains, down the floor vents, literally everywhere. The actual splash event also happened right as my dad walked into the room. So all he saw was me throwing soup, he was mad. Right after I threw it I regretted it. Not because of the mess, but because I embarrassed my sister. I feel really bad about it, but part of me has this thought: everyone knows how much I hate being touched, even back to my childhood; I asked her to stop and she wouldn’t, what else should I have done if she was literally blocking me in, not stopping when I said stop, and doing something that she knows makes me extremely uncomfortable. 
 

So, does that excuse my soup toss, or am I a total AH for embarrassing my sister?",0.88
"AITA for screaming at my boyfriend to GTFO of my car? 
So I (24F) feel like I have been a victim of narcissistic abuse from my boyfriend (22M) for the last year. I’ll try and provide as much context as possible. 

He always tells me how bad of a girlfriend I am and said to me a couple of weeks ago that he was going to continue to try and hurt me mentally until I was 'broken'. He also finds fault in everything I do, nothing is ever enough and sometimes makes up problems that don't exist to try and make me be sorry for something. For example, he said I refused to take him to work one day (I never said anything like that), called me a lot of horrible names and tried to make me apologise for something Id never said or done. He also told me that both his ex girlfriends had described him as abusive but told me they was 'crazy' and out to get him, but on reflection now I believe them. 

Today I smoked a cigarette (we was attempting to quit together) and he smelled it on me and I admitted it. He ignored me for an hour whilst we was out together with his brother and when I dropped his brother off home, the verbal abuse started. He told me he was done with me, he was sick of me, I'm a liar, I'm a tramp, disgusting, he hated everything about me etc. He then got out the car and walked away - a minute later he called me saying he was getting in the car and speaking to me again. He got back in the car and said he wanted me to drive him somewhere to 'say what I wanted to say' (i didn't want to speak to him) and then he can decide how finished he is with me. I was driving for around ten seconds and in that ten seconds he proceeded to say he was sick of me, 'is this really the kind of tramp i'm supposed to dedicate my life to', and call me a liar repeatedly. It is at that point I slammed the brakes on and screamed at him to get the f*** out of my car. 

He looked genuinely shocked and I proceeded to tell him I thought he was a liar about the abuse he had faced - he told me his last girlfriend was extremely abusive and he was an innocent victim in all of it - and that I thought it was the other way around, or if she had lashed out at him it was a matter of reactive abuse as he had emotionally abused her to her wits end. I asked him why he was with me if he hated me so much and told me he loved me so much and wanted to see through all the awful parts of me as nobody else would love me or want to be with me but I had ruined everything now and he was never going to see me again.

Since then he’s blocked me on everything and his family has too, as I imagine he turned the water works on when he got home and told them all I was abusive etc etc, same as he did with his ex partner. The worst part about all of this though is, I don't feel bad for what I did? I feel like I was just truly pushed to my absolute maximum of abuse I could take and I snapped. Doing so has added so much hindsight to what I was missing the past year. So the question is, should I feel bad? AITA?",0.17
"AITA for wanting my uncle out of my house? I (F19) live at my dad's house, and a few months ago my uncle moved in with us with no warning due to financial issues.

At first I was okay with it. I thought I'd have time to tidy my old room for him, but no. My uncle shows up not even 10 minutes after I was told he'd be moving in.

I wanted to clean my old room for him, but I never got the chance. Him and his girlfriend are up all night vacuuming, moving things around, dumping full garbage bags outside the door which stresses me out because everything in that room is my whole childhood.
That night I had an anxiety attack and ended up staying at my mum's house for like two weeks. 

I would pop Into home after work each day as it's in the same suburb.
When I got home, I had realised my uncle's girlfriend was messing around with things. They had cleaned my old room and put everything in boxes. The girlfriend had repotted and overwatered all my plants and succulents, it was chaos. When I got home that day, I had to completely fix everything. I did end up losing a few cacti and succulents from her rampage though.

Not only that, but they had used up all of my bathroom products and my toothbrush was submerged bristle side down in a cup of cloudy water... To this day I have no idea what the fuck they did to it, but I never used it again. I bought a new one and keep everything in my room now. Im pretty sure they now use that toothbrush to clean their bong....

My uncle is nice, he minds his own business and is mostly in his room all day. In fact I'm glad my dad has someone to hang out with. The only real problem is the condition of the bathroom. I'm not use to having to wipe piss and shit off the toilet seat every time I want to go. 

The girlfriend is the worst part. I'm sure she's on drugs, or at least used to be. She's no better in the bathroom either. I'm always finding fake nails and little circular Bandaids all over the floor, plus the place is splattered with fake tan, which I know isnt hers.

Their room is right beside mine, and all they do is smoke cigarettes and weed in there all day. It smells awful, and they often open the door to air it out, but then I have to deal with that smell wafting into my room and all through the house.

Any time I try to talk to my sister about this she insists I'm being unreasonable because my uncle is nice and keeps to himself, but it's all starting to build up to a point where I can't take it anymore and I'm about to start staying at my mums again.

This girlfriend brings such an awful presence. She's always crying about something, trying to talk to me when I obviously don't want to talk (eg, having noise cancelling headphones on!!), just being so annoying always.

My dad has been away these past few days, and this house doesn't even feel like mine anymore, it's like they've taken over.

"AITA for questioning if my husband gave me a fake Gucci bag? Since I met my husband he has always gifted me expensive things. My husband has a job that pays him a good amount of money. Over the years I would tell him that he doesn’t have to keep buying me expensive gifts bc we both have expenses such as a mortgage and other bills.  I also gift him expensive presents that I save up to buy him.

A few weeks ago we welcomed a beautiful baby boy. My husband a few days ago before I had him gave me a push gift. It was a huge gucci bag and inside was a gucci tote bag. It was a very lovely bag. He said the reason why he got me that huge gucci tote bag was because I would need a big bag to carry around so that I can put the babies things inside when I travel with him. 

I gave my husband a huge hug and I thanked him. The gift to me was too much but he kept insisting that he appreciates me and is excited for this journey we will both experience. And that he saw how miserable I was mentally and emotionally during my pregnancy. 

The next day while my husband was at work I took the bag out of the box to place it on a shelf next to my other bags. As I held the bag something felt off. I noticed that the material of the bag was different. The inside of the bag looked a little off and the handles of the bag felt very bad quality to the point where I placed too many things in the bag I am sure it would tear. The bag also smelled different. It didn’t smell like leather to me. I quickly went to the gucci website and looked for the bag. The bag is on there, but as I compared both bags, I came to the conclusion that the bag was fake. I still tried to give him the benefit of doubt by looking for an older version but everything still points to the bag being fake.

 I began to wonder why would he buy me a fake bag . He didn’t have to get me anything expensive I made that very clear to him many times. Later that night when he came home I asked him where did he buy the bag at . At first he said the actually gucci store. I kept asking him if he was sure a couple of times. He then told me no it was ebay. He said he got it for a good deal . I quickly told him the bag was fake and that he should try and get his money back. He angrily said he was offended and that ebay authenticated the bag and how dare I call the bag fake. I showed him the pictures and he just even more mad and called me ungrateful. I even compared it to another gucci bag that I have and showed him how the material is different. I also explained to him that if he paid a lot of money for the bag thinking it was real then he got scammed and should get a refund. He paused for a second and took the bag. He keeps calling me ungrateful. So AITA because I keep questioning if the bag is fake?",0.12
"AITA for suggesting my son's fiance is a predator? I (55F) have a son (23M) who just recently got engaged to his fiance (46M). Now I know there's a significant age gap, I was weirded out when I first found out my son was dating someone only a few years younger than me, but if that's what makes my son happy I accepted it. He treats my son amazingly and is a great partner. The problem arouse when I met him for the first time. I realized he used to be our old Family doctor before we moved states, and when my son was 10 he had Alot of small medical issues, so he'd have to see The family doctor often, that was mainly why I was concerned that the fiance seaked out my son. This striked a nerve in me, I didn't mind my son dating an older man but that man knowing my son when he was a kid was really off to me. 

I talked to the fiance about this and he understood why I was concerned, but insisted it was nothing like that, he said they didn't even realize they knew each other beforehand after 5 months of dating. But I wanted to also talk to my son about this. When I asked him he wasn't defensive or disgusted he was just confused, he kept asking me questions about why I even thought that his fiance was a potential predator, In the end he ended becoming frustrated with me and called me an asshole for even thinking that.

"AITA For Not Believing That I Should Pay My Ex Back For Expenses So, my Ex and I broke up after 4 years together, and 3.5 years of living together.   
When we moved in together, instead of splitting bills by bill, we opened a high limit joint credit card and put all of our joint expenses (bills, food, travel, clothing) on that card, and would just split paying the balance each month. This actually worked beautifully, and took all of the guesswork out of things (divide balance by 2- that is your bill amount for the month). When we broke up, we had no debt (aside from auto loans for each of us, but those are separate). We owed no creditor, and neither us of had borrowed money from the other. We paid our bills as we went, so money got tight occasionally, but- and I stress- neither of us left the relationship with debt.   


She made a little more than double in income than I did, and there were many months in the relationship that I couldn't pay my full half of the credit card expenses. Of course, she was a great partner and would always take care of the difference in my half of the bills and what I could actually pay in to the credit card each month. The result being that she paid about 70-75% of our expenses monthly- however, I was putting in everything that I made. We were living UP to her income, and not down to mine.   


Fast forward to today, and we have broken up- again with no debt- but she kept a running balance of the amount of my half of the bills/expenses that she paid over the course of our relationship. It was a little over $30,000 dollars. We had agreed in the beginning to keep a log of any balance that accrued in case we split up and one person had paid more than the other, but I didn't keep track of that balance after the first year and a half or so- once I had decided that I wanted to marry her- because if the roles had been reversed I would have never kept track of if I was spending more on bills than her or not. I have been paying her $500 a month since the breakup because I wanted to be a person of my word, but I keep struggling with the thought that I'm paying her back for choices that she made (continuing to subsidize/include me in her activities that I could not afford to do)...

&#x200B;

So, long story short, am I the asshole for thinking that I have no obligation- moral or legal- to pay her back any further? She willing offered to pay for our lifestyle for years knowing that we were living beyond my means, but now wants all of that back. Again, we owed no debt when we split up, and I never borrowed money from her... All of the money that I ""owe"" her were daily expenses that I could not fully cover my half of.

"AITA for using the shower while dog sitting? I 20f an a college student and have started to pet sit for money. My college is in a nice area, so the pay of good and the work is not demanding. 

I get my work through an app, and got a last minute request to dogs it overnight for a new client while she was out of town. I don’t take new clients as I don’t know what their boundaries are but as it was last minute, the pay was really good so I took it. 

I took the dog on a walk when I got there. Afterwards, I used the shower and fell asleep in the downstairs bedroom. I was requested to not go upstairs, so I took the bedroom I saw and in the morning cleaned it to leave it as it was before, putting my sheets and towels in the washing machine and told the owner when she got back as I couldn’t find the washing powder laid out and didn’t want her to feel like I snooped through her stuff.

She thanked me for my help and when I got home, I saw she left me a one star review for being entitled and using her stuff when I was there and was withholding half the payment. We get to dispute reviews, so I did and she said expected me not to shower as it was an overnight stay not multiple nights. I contacted the support team, but my friend that also dog sits and got me into the job, said I should have figured out if it was allowed first as me using the shower affects their water bill and that at the very least I should have brought my toiletries. 

I am new to dog sitting and as I knew the client was away due to a family emergency I don’t want to ask to upset her and when I saw her she never mentioned being upset that I used her shower.",0.14
"AITA for being sick and canceling my driving test? I (33f) woke up feeling awful today (fever, chills, headache) and took the day off work. I also couldn't attend a driving test my partner was supposed to take me to (30m).

He got so upset this morning saying I wasn't that sick. He also went on a rant about how it's taken me way too long to get my license and that it's super important to him and I'm just dragging it out. He is right that I was nervous about starting lessons with an instructor and that I did miss a couple of them, but we have also been practicing a lot, and sadly I did fail my first test but I've gotten better. I guess he just thinks it's too slow. I just find it pretty hurtful that with me being sick he thinks it's ok to act like this. Tbh, deep down Im proud that I've learned how to drive, but he said it's still useless until I pass to the next round.

Im feeling really hurt on top of being sick but AITA? He thinks I should have pushed through.

"AITA? For thinking that my boyfriend isn’t really pulling his weight. As you know, Valentine’s Day is approaching and I’ve been subtly dropping hints about it towards the end of January. My boyfriend (17M) and I (17F) have been together since the beginning of November 2023 and things have been wonderful. However I can’t help but feel like he’s dropped the ball a bit and isn’t making an effort for Valentine’s Day, and I feel guilty for feeling this way. 

He told me a few weeks ago that he was going to take me to see a movie and then we’d get dinner in a nice restaurant in the town, however, nothing has been booked or bought yet and I’m worried that places will quickly fill up for such a popular day of the year. I told him that I’d bought one of his gifts the other night and his only response was that he “didn’t realise we were getting gifts as well”. I’m not too fussed on the gift giving but a simple hand made card or smth would really mean a lot. He then went on to ask if I would like flowers, I got a little upset because who wouldn’t want some flowers on Valentine’s Day? It felt inconsiderate? 

Despite this, I haven’t said anything to him about how I’m feeling because I fear that I’m feeling this way over nothing? Maybe I’m overreacting? I told my best friend and she said that’s it’s different for men as they don’t think about these things but I can’t help but feel as if that’s a weak excuse. Am I overreacting?

She took it out of the oven completely black. “Dearie, dinner’s ‘a ready.” Out of impulse I said “Ew, what. Is. That.” She started crying and yelled at me for being rude as she tried her best.

"AITA for telling my pregnant wife she should work less? So my (30m) wife (30f) is pregnant with our first child and is about 6 or so months along. A piece of information that is potentially relevant to our situation is that I make significantly more than my wife. My income makes up more than 85% of the household income and we could very easily live off of just my paycheck. Now that being said I have never asked or implied or wanted my wife not to work. I want her to work as much as she wants to work. If that's 0 hours a week, 20 hours, 40 hours, or 80 hours if it makes her happy that's what I want her to do. As far as finances go we have a joint account all the money goes to and once it hits that account there is 0 concept of ""her money"" or ""my money"" it is the households and we both have equal access, control, and discretion with it. I say all of this to try and lay out that from a purely financial point of view my wife is not forced to work. It's also relevant that there isn't anymore progression in her job path. I'm not saying that in a negative way its just potentially relevant that's she's not pushing for a promotion.

When we were trying to get pregnant she mentioned that she wanted to taper her hours as she got farther into the pregnancy which sounded great. About 3 months into the pregnancy she started getting really fatigued because she was growing a whole other person. She asked me if I could take over some of her half of the chores. I said of course because again she's growing a person, that's impressive, of course I will take on more of the chores. At that point I mention"" hey if you are getting tired and fatigued maybe you could start tapering your work hours."" That was a mistake, since then she's been working extra shifts and staying late and doing extra hours. She's stressed and exhausted. She comes home from work, wolf's down whatever dinner I made as she's walking to bed and then falls asleep till it's time for her to leave again. Her time is 100% sleeping, working, or commuting between the two.Anytime I ask if she wants to cut back on hours or if she needs a break she gets really upset and goes off about ""proving she can work"" and not being told what to do. 

Finally last week I said ""I don't think this is good for you and you should really let yourself have a break"". I'm not trying to be controlling but I'm genuinely worried the physical and mental stress she's been putting herself under for not much additional gain. And I will admit selfishly I miss my wife, I haven't had a meal or conversation longer than 6 min with her in months. I hear she's trying to prove she can but it's hard to see her run herself into the ground if there's not a real need to. AITA for telling her it's time to take a break?",0.3
"WIBTA if I told my adult friend how to shower? My (30f) friend (28f), who we’ll call Lily, lives out of town and stays at my house whenever she’s in town to visit me and other local friends - so 2 or 3 time a year for usually just under a week. Lily is a pretty chaotic individual in ways that aren’t relevant enough to get into, but has a heart of gold and I love her.  She has lots of strange habits that I can fairly easily ignore for the short periods of time in which we cohabitate, but I always get stuck on her showers. 

To paint a picture, I have a small, but not tiny bathroom with a shower over a full sized bath. I have two shower curtains, one that hangs inside the bath, and another more decorative one that hangs outside - I grew up with this shower curtain situation and it’s what I’m used to.  Lily and I do not have the sort of friendship that involves me being in the bathroom when she takes a shower, but here’s what I suspect happens:  when Lily takes a shower, she pulls both shower curtains inside the bath, and after the shower she pulls them both to the outside of the bath (I’m guessing this is what happens because both shower curtains are too wet to have been outside the bath the whole time). She also must step out of the bathtub the moment she turns off the water without drying off inside the tub at all (bath mat is always drenched). This is all to say that every time she takes a shower in my house, my bathroom floor is utterly soaked in a way that takes hours to dry. I’ve tried leaving subtle hints about the shower curtain, by correcting it after her shower, but Lily is not a woman of subtly and this hasn’t worked.  Other guests have showered in my house without any issue. 

My question is: WIBTA if I brought this up with her or do I keep my mouth shut and mind my own business?

On one hand, it feels like kind of a personal thing and she’s a sensitive sort. On the other hand, damp is a problem in my house already and my bathroom isn’t super well ventilated and it’s also just kind of frustrating.",0.85
"AITA for telling my parents they need to get some sort of legal visitation agreement with my BIL This is a lot so I will get right to it. My sister passed away recently and left behind 4 kids. The first child was with her first baby dad when she was around 19. They never got along, and he made her life and ours a living hell. They spilt custody of my nephew from the time he was born until around 5 when the abuse from baby dad turned onto my nephew. The court ruled that he needed to go full time with my sister and that he could have supervised visits. My sister job was brutal and often she would work 12-14 hour days. My parents and myself helped with childcare as well as bringing my nephew to his sports and school. 

My sister got with fiancée when my nephew was 2 years old and within a year, she was pregnant. She was the full-time bread winner, and he (fiancée) would do the childcare of their children together, while my parents and I would help and mainly still took care of my nephew. Every time one kid became old enough to enter school age the condom would ""break"" and my sister become pregnant and then would return to work leaving him home for another 4 years to take care of new baby. Which is fine, but you need that for context. My sister passes and we, meaning my husband, and my parents take care of everything, the funeral, the kids, all the arrangements. My nephew from the first relationship is immediately taken from my family, and we have lost all contact because the father is a complete and total narcissist and just wants to hurt us more. Now for the Fiancée, instead of looking for a job, or a career path, he moved on. Like within a month of my sisters passing he was bringing a new woman around my nieces and nephews. He is not paying the bills, they did not own their home, vehicles, or really have a ton of assets. My parents have been paying the house payment, the kids school tuition, and giving allowances. My parents lost their daughter and grandson, and they are just trying to hold onto the other kids. I however am looking at it this way, they, my parents, are going to get screwed over.  

I have never been in this position and pray I don't ever have to. I cannot judge him for how he has chosen to move on. I did caution him in a very nice way to give it more time and to not short himself by choosing the first person that looks his way. However, I do judge him for introducing my nieces and nephews to this person and allowing them to see them being physical. The kids are all upset and still grieving. They have expressed to me their confusion and how they feel odd ""liking"" new lady. I have always been extremely close to them, and they feel comfortable talking to me. Which I know bothers their dad. Dad doesn't want them telling me anything at all about new woman. 

I know in my heart that he would not hesitate to pick up and move. Without warning to my parents. Leaving my parents with all the debt, heart break, and misery of losing more people they love. I feel that the only solution is getting something legally in writing.",0.41
"AITA for wanting to travel against my mom's wishes? I (21F) graduated college early and have time to travel before starting my job this summer. I am looking into different opportunities that would allow me to do work abroad in exchange for free stay so I can travel cheaply. I have a job lined up that starts this summer, so it's not like I am just fucking off to travel indefinitely, it would only be for a few months and I would fund it entirely myself before starting a corporate job. 

Originally, I was going to stay at a hostel in Puerto Rico, but my mom got extremely upset and said that she did not move to the US and work her ass off for me to clean up after others and scrub toilets in a hostel. I do not believe this work to be belittling and it would just be for a month and a half, and I would have saved a lot of money on accommodation while having a good experience in another place. She still did not let me go and complained about me wanting to do it for days. She then promised that we will find something I can do to travel that she approves of. 

She expressed that she wanted me to use my education and find a role that involves teaching English, which is something I would love to do but am struggling to find positions for. I found other roles that did not require cleaning and brought them up to her, but instead of hearing me out, she went on an angry tangent about how i and my brother have been stressing her out for the past 3 years and how it's taking a toll on her body, how she never doesn't feel stressed about me, etc. I understand having kids is stressful but we are pretty decent kids! We get good grades and always stay out of trouble, I don't know what more I can do other than cease to exist. 

I feel like no matter what opportunity I find to travel she will shoot me down and i feel kinda helpless. I worked hard to graduate early and get good grades and get a great job to make her proud, but I just want to travel for a bit before starting it and she won't let me. Am I the asshole here? Am I really in the wrong? I don't feel like I am but the way she says no to everything I have been asking to do all month has been making me feel like there's something wrong with where I am coming from.

"AITA for defending myself against my boyfriend's ex (also the mother of his child) Just a bit of background. I (26F) started dating a guy (30M) a couple of months ago. Things have been going *really* great between us,  and as a result I met his 3 year old daughter a few weeks ago. Up until the incident that occurred last night, I had not met his ex (31F)

To make a long story short, I was spending the day with him and his daughter at his place when his ex popped up a demanded to be let in. Her excuse for popping up was a box of clothes she  still had in the basement, but I believe she popped up to spy on him. 

Anyways, my bf opened the door because she threatened to call the police if he didnt (under what grounds, I have no clue. The house is owned solely by him). Almost immediately after being let in she began to interrogate me, and her demeanor was very hostile. I did try deescalating by telling her I wasn't confrontational and hated conflict, and hoped we could have a cordial conversation (especially since this was our first time meeting and this was all occurring in front of their child). 

But this had the opposite effect. She began calling me out of my name, telling me she could (and would) beat me up, that she'd have me jumped. All the while, she's attacking my bf (who's trying to get her out of the house) and throwing/kicking a few of my items I had lying around (shoes, pots and pans, etc). 

At one point, he did get her out, but she was able to wrestle her way back in and lunged toward me. At that point, we were both in the kitchen and (being someone who has NEVER fought, doesn't EVER want to fight, and was SCARED OUT OF MY MIND) as a reflex, I picked up a knife and held it to my chest and told her to get away from me. I had absolutely no intentions on using it. It was simply a shield. I dropped it almost as quickly as I'd picked it up. 

Anyway, his ex is now using that as leverage to keep his child away from him. If I'm in the picture, she says, he can't see their daughter. Everyone keeps telling me I did what I had to do in the moment (although i do think my bf is slightly/secretly upset with me), but I feel horrible. Not only because I'm absolutely not a violent person, but because I never expected for my first encounter with his ex to go as it did. I wanted her to like me. 

Also, before anyone says she reacted that way because ""maybe he's cheating"",  he has physical proof that SHE broke up with him months ago and is now engaged to some guy she met at work.

AITA for telling everyone about my pick me old bff? So my old bff and i always got along perfectly but when i told her that i had a crush on a boy and told her who she started talking to him a lot and she played games with him instead of me i noticed that of course and asked her about it a lot but she always said that she hated him but i never believed her because if she hated him why would she talk and play with him even though she had a boyfriend? Well the other day I wrote her and said that I need a break from our friendship because it's just too much and whenever I have crush on someone she is with that person and it was okay for her but I should tell her when the break is over. Well the next day I wasn't at school and even though she knew I needed a break because she always tries to steal my crush she stayed with him at lunch and they even almost hugged (I was told by a friend.) So I wrote to her to say that I don't want to be friends anymore and she replied: no don't do that they are all lying and are jealous of our good friendship. But that's not true and she always lies about everything. In the end I decided to give her another chance because she wrote to me: I will stop talking to him but please give me one last chance (I already gave her 3 or so before) but later she wrote me that she wants to break off contact because she said: she's an emo and only has 1 friend. I said ok bye and we blocked each other now she's only been with guys for a few days and she's really short and skinny but she takes advantage of being short and skinny.. she's become a pick me since the last few days and says she's one of the boys and she hates girls.. I heard her say to a friend during the break: all girls are sl*ts I hate girls I'm one of the boys and I can be what I want and do what I want. When I heard that I had to stifle my laughter so hard and so did my friend who was talking to her I imitated her and we laughed a lot but she noticed it and didn't find it so funny well I went to the girls in our class at the end and told them about it and they are mad and planning on telling everyone else.,0.5
"WIBTA if I tried to rekindle an old friendship that ended bad? Four years ago, I had a falling out with my best friend of 10 years. A week following the incident, I reached out to apologize and she apologized as well expressing that it might take a while for her to warm up to me again.  
  
For a short while we sent cordial texts but it all felt fake to me so I unfriended, blocked. Then the guilt caught up on me. I reached out about 3 more times through text within that year to send warm wishes, and apologize again (I was a mess!). Each time she would text back and give me a cordial answer which again felt very fake to me so I wouldn't text back.  
  
The last time I reached out in 2021, I decided to comment on her picture to see if she would acknowledge it but she didn't.

"AITA for wanting my husband to work less, I've had 10 nights off in 3.5 years, my friends come with me on family trips because he's too busy and I'm alone with kids 5/7 days + nights but he says the financial responsibility is all on him This is my first time posting, please be kind. I'll try to be as objective as possible.

I (f30) voluntarily stayed home with our twins for 2 years, which was 100% my choice my husband (m33) wanted a nanny.  Government assistance was decent around 1750Є/month. He didn't help at night at all and I would sometimes be in tears from exhaustion and his response was always that I didn't want a nanny so I should stop complaining (we could never have afforded one anyway). 

At the time my husband was work 45-50 hours a week managing two shops. He left mid morning and would come home after bedtime 5x a week. Honestly, I did complain to him a lot that he was not sharing the mental load and asked him to consider working less or at least switching off from work when he was home, he emailed, worked on computer and answered calls a lot. He said that the maternal mental load doesn't apply to me since I don't have a job.

Now the twins are 3.5 and we've moved to his home country. I'm looking for work and they go to school about 35 hours a week. As soon as he moved here my husband took a job of about 80 hours per week. 

He works 10am-2am 5x a week. Obviously has to sleep in in the morning so wakes up after the kids have left for school. 

On his days off he offers for me to 'go out' but similarly doesn't cook for them or prepare lunch for school the next day, check whether they have clean clothes ready or go shopping if the fridge is empty, he never cooks for us either, so if I were to 'go out' I would come home to all the same chores that I had left behind with much less time to finish them. 

His job is unskilled for want of a better word, absolutely no judgement at all, but I have a masters degree in a tech background and could earn more than what he does now with less than half the hours. 

The problem is, I cannot take on a full time job on top of what I am already doing. If I work full time, my evenings will be so full that I would never have the time to enjoy my children and they would not have a mother who is fully present. His days off are also midweek, which would mean we would never have a day off together again. 

He says if I get a job and its too difficult he'll reduce his hours. He says the hours that the children are at school is time for myself. But its actually cooking, laundry, shopping (including christmas and birthday for his entire family), cleaning, school drop offs and pickups, and being the only parent for two three year olds who seem to be home sick every other week, he does almost no chores, he didn't take them outside without me for 2yrs, hes never taken them to the dr or bought them clothes or gift. Using work as an excuse. 

I feel like his job is stopping me from having one, or a life, I feel like I'm trapped at home and he takes advantage of the fact I will never choose what I want over whats best for my children, i.e. having at least one parent that is present and not burnt out/exhausted all the time. ",0.27
"WIBTA if I pursue a relationship with my close friend's ex fiance? I (26f) think I'm falling for my best friend's(28f) ex fiance(32m)

My best friend (F) and her ex fiance (T) were together for a total of 8 years. At a certain point, T and F got into a pretty big disagreement so T left to live with his family in another state. They continued the relationship long distance. 

A few months after T moved out, I moved in with F. We had a lot of fun, except.. I'm a very moral person and she had been actively cheating on T. Dangerous men, too. I had only met T a couple times at this point, and F was my best friend, so I didn't tell T. 

Eventually, T comes back and he and F have plans to move in together. Apparently, F had promised both T and one of her affair partners that they would break it off with the other and be together. It didn't quite go as planned. T thankfully was told the truth and made the decision to let this other guy have F, and she was promptly kicked out of their apartment they just started renting. This was in 2021.

Years pass, they've all made amends, and T moves in with F and the guy she was cheating on him with. They're *married* now. Somehow they worked past it all, they're all really good friends now, surprisingly. 

Although I disagreed heavily with F's past choices, she's someone I repeatedly see potential in so I stay close. I go over there all the time and T is always there. I remember double dates I've planned with them and my then boyfriend, back when they were still together, or times I've come over and played Smash or Kart with them and just goofed off. I developed a small crush on T over the years but would never tell F or ever act on it. I'm a very loyal person, normally..

T had at one point (mind, this is 3 years after their breakup) asked F if she'd be comfortable with him pursuing me. She said no and was pretty adamant. I didn't know. A couple weeks later, I had asked F if T was single and she just said ""don't"" and kind of yelled so I backed off completely. 

About a month later, I'm on Facebook dating (ugh) but I see T's profile. I sat there for so long, debating if I was really going to press that stupid like button and risk a friendship I've been growing since I was in junior high with F.  My inner demons won, and I remembered how she habitually cheated on him and the times she's mistreated her dog, and I chalked it up in my head in that moment that I'd rather have something special with this long time crush than hold on to a generally toxic friendship with F.

Now, I'm just hung up with guilt. T and I started talking because my impulse control sucks and I swiped on him, and he told me how he asked F if we could try dating and she said no. That's how I knew the feelings have been mutual, at least for a while. We haven't gone anywhere beyond getting to know each other better, nothing sexual, but.. I like him a lot..

What should I do? Sacrifice my relationship with a (not very good) friend I've had for a decade, or cut it off with T now and try to keep things how they already are?",0.78
"AITA for not wanting to give my ex back something she gifted me? I (27F) was with my ex-gf (24F) for almost 2 years before we called it quits.

A bit of backstory... growing up I loved dolls, loved collecting dolls. I have a decent sized collection that my parents allowed me to leave at their house. My ex knows I'm passionate about collecting and she gifted me a doll that she got from a collection of toys her grandparents for my birthday last year (March). Long story short, the doll is worth several hundred dollars and my ex wants it back since we're no longer together.

I don't want to give it back and she thinks I am stealing from her because of how much its worth. AITA for keeping the doll since it was a gift?

&#x200B;

EDIT - The gift is not an heirloom, she didn't know how valuable this doll is/was. She became part of my collection when my ex gift her to me. I got her a display stand and all. I definitely want to keep her.",0.17
"AITA for snitching on some students for vaping in a teacher's closet? I (17F) and my twin sister eat lunch in our teacher's room every day since she keeps it open to students who need a quiet and relaxed place to eat. We both struggle with being in the lunch room since we don't get on with a lot of the students in our class–It's a really small school, and we already know everyone by name.

Recently (within the past month or so) students have come into the room every lunch period to go into her closet for 2-3 minutes, leave, and then return 15 minutes later to go in it for 2-3 minutes again. All these students are known for vaping/smoking, and eventually, they bring in more of their friends, then more, and more.

I don't think I have seen a single day where at least 6 of them didn't come in. At this point, me and my sister are getting slightly frustrated, not only is it the room used for students who need a getaway from the loud lunchroom, but also the students doing this are abusing the teacher's trust in them. She’s the nicest teacher I have ever had, and she doesn’t deserve to be lied to straight to her face especially after she’s been so gracious to even let us use her room on what is supposed to be her break.Today, even more students walked into the room to vape, and my sister ended up leaving after she saw them walk in. This made me angry, but I kept my mouth quiet. I didn't think it was my place to say anything, I didn't want to be involved in conflicts. But then this girl who sometimes enters the room herself started talking to the teacher about how she and the other students who use the closet use it to ""get away from judgemental people"", and that ""it's a getaway space"".

This made me really angry since she was lying. I’ve seen her vape in class all the time. I ended up speaking up out of frustration and saying ""No, you guys vape in there. Why else would you enter the closet for 2-3 minutes every day, leave, then come back 15 minutes later?""

This started a small argument between us before I walked out of the room myself and caught up with my sister. We both agreed to just quickly swing by the dean of students office and let them know what's going on before leaving.

Looking back at it, I think I overreacted, it’s not my place to dictate who can and can’t use the room, and I feel like I’m being unfair in deciding whether or not students should be punished for something they weren’t even caught doing. I wouldn’t even care if they were vaping anywhere else, you can do it outside of school, hell they could do it in the locker room; I wouldn’t care as long as the room used by me and some other students is left alone.

I feel like a hypocrite for thinking this way…Plus, these people may struggle with addiction, and I’m taking away a place they know they can get relief–I don’t know, I feel regretful for saying anything in the first place. So, AITA for snitching on them?TLDR: A really nice teacher lets students use her room during lunch, students abuse her space and vape in her closet without her knowing.",0.2
"WIBTA if I don’t buy my (22F) niece (almost 2F) a birthday present because her parents (36M, 34F) can’t keep their house clean? My (22F) mother (65F) cleans the house of my brother (36M) and my sister in law (34F) 1-3 times a week while babysitting my youngest niece (almost 2F). 

She started doing this before they even had kids in hopes that they would keep it nice if she gave them a “clean slate” as a birthday or Christmas present. They couldn’t keep it clean so she started coming more and more and now it just seems expected that she will clean their house whenever she is there.

When she gets there, they typically have clothes (both clean and dirty), toys, and old snacks covering the floors. Dishes pile out of the sink (even though she bought them a dishwasher) and they never clean their bathrooms. The kitchen table is usually covered in yesterday’s arts and craft project. While I know all new parents are disorganized, they take it to a new level. I have no idea how it gets so bad in the 2-5 days between my mom cleaning. I wish I could attach photos and videos (my mom sends me before/afters every time she goes over) but I will not for safety/privacy reasons.

While she doesn’t enjoy doing it, she wants my two nieces (5F and turning 2F) to be able to safely walk around in their home. They never have friends over because their house is so dirty, which she thinks is bad for their social development. Additionally, my mom gave them the downpayment for the house and paid their closing fees so she takes how dirty the house is as a sign of ungratefulness.

Now we get to the birthday situation. My oldest niece had her birthday party about two weeks ago and I did not buy her a present. It was a big party with all of her classmates who all got her toys. She didn’t notice and I don’t think she knows who bought her what, just that she got tons of presents. 

My younger niece feels a bit more forgotten about in the grand scheme of things. My brother and sister in law did not have a party for her first birthday (even though the oldest had a big catered party at the community center) and told my mom they weren’t planning a second birthday party for her. 

My mom knows they won’t remember a party at this age, but she doesn’t want it to become a pattern as they get older or for her to hear years later that she didn’t have birthday parties like her sister. As a result, my mom is hosting a family party for my niece, but asked that I do not bring any presents because they have too many toys. Unlike my older niece, my younger niece isn’t in school and won’t have tons of friends to bring her presents, so I feel like there’s more pressure to bring one. My sister already got her a present (and got a present for my older niece) so I know my mom didn’t tell everyone about the house situation. Still, I know my mom’s frustration with their messy home and I don’t want to make it worse.

So… would I be the worst aunt ever if I didn’t bring a present?",0.11
"WIBTA If I (31F) asked this girl (28F) why she excluded my fiancé(31M) from her boyfriend’s (33M) surprise party? I’ve gotten bad vibes from this girl Melissa for a while, and I have kept my mouth shut for the most part. My fiancé has been best friends with her boyfriend, Tyler, since they were freshmen in high school. His birthday was a few months ago, and Melissa texted my fiancé to invite him to the surprise party she was throwing for him at a restaurant. She said she didn’t know what day the party would be on. I thought that was odd, because she was the one planning the party and you have to have a reservation for that sort of thing. 

My fiancé went to their house to give Tyler his birthday presents on a Wednesday. At this point, Melissa still hadn’t told him what day the party was going to be on. On Friday night, my fiancé saw on Snapchat that the party had already happened. I learned later that everyone else knew by Monday that the party would be on Friday. Since my fiancé was over at their house on Wednesday, I do not think she forgot to tell him. I believe she excluded him. (There have been many little incidents in the past, I do not think this girl is a good person). 

My fiancé has asked me to not say anything whenever she does something that upsets me. He hates conflict. I believe that conflict is necessary in certain situations. WIBTA if I asked her, in front of her boyfriend, why she never told my fiancé what day the party was?

"AITA for worrying about the kind of co-workers she's hanging out with? I (27F) have a college friend (26F) who usually stays in touch with me through social media and frequent phone calls. We mostly share almost every single life update with our little girl group that stayed together even after college.

Recently, she's been hanging out with a couple of male co-workers who she considers close friends. One of the guys though, clearly likes her to a point that he wants to marry her and is not stopping even after she has openly rejected him twice. Another guy (in the same group who already has a long distance girlfriend) have multiple times invited her at his place during WFH days so they could ""work together in peace"".

"WIBTA if I confronted my father about using my face cloth for his hands? My father and I rent a apartment together because Ontario is a expensive place to live. I have always had very difficult skin. I have PCOS which means I will always struggle with acne, as well as combination sensitive skin. Basically it is always a little broken out and anything from a cold to stress can cause massive breakouts.

For a while I got it to a manageable state which included a gentle cleanser and a specific microfiber cloth to wash my face at very specific intervals to stop my skin from reacting to the cleanser but still being semi clear. COVID happened around the same time my father and I moved in together. I pointed out my face towel, explained everything, and asked him not to touch it. He agreed but I started majorly breaking out like a lot.

I thought it was stress and mask related but I asked to make sure he wasn't using the cloth when I found it in a different place one day. He insisted he didn't touch it and that I already told him not to, so he knows not to mess with it. This breakout continued for a year before I started getting desperate and looking for new cleansers assuming that was an issue. Que like 3 years of breakouts, severe skin irritation, face bouncing between dry and flaky and burning from product. and going through like a hospital's worth of new wash cloths trying to figure out what was going on and I was giving up.

Then this year I went to my mothers place for Christmas and due to family drama ended up staying for like 3 weeks... and my skin cleared up. I had forgotten my face cloth and was washing and drying with a spare roll of toilet paper. That was the only thing I was doing different and it made no sense because I even missed a few days of washing my face due to festivities.

Since then I was suspicious and have been washing and drying with a product and toilet paper because I don't trust any of my towels. He even made a show of telling me he washed all the towels when I was gone and didn't touch my towel.... I ran it under water and wrung it out and the water was murky and yellow like nicotine. He is the only one who smokes. 

It is pretty clear that he has been using my face towel to dry his grimy nicotine covered hands, lying about it, doing it specifically with my face towel, and probably enjoying pulling one over on me. The moment I stopped using any of the towels in the house my acne started to heal to manageable levels.

WIBTA if I got mad about it and called him out for making my life harder and making me deal with pain and low self worth for the past three years.

"AITA for selling my girlfriend tickets? This situation happened last year, but my girlfriend and I are arguing about it again and we’re both 100% confident each of us is right.

So for context, we both are college students attending different schools in Boston. Every year, the four schools in Boston hold a hockey tournament called “Beanpot”.

Me and my two friends purchased tickets to Beanpot through my university for $40 each. This gets you two tickets: Tickets to the two semi final games, which occur back to back, and tickets to the consolation&championship game, which occurs a week after the semi final games. My girlfriend’s university had a similar offer, but she forgot/didn’t have interest in going.

My university lost in the first round, while hers won, meaning that my team would be playing in the consolation game the following week and hers would be in the championship. Practically nobody shows up to the consolation game, people only care about the championship. Me and my two friends now had tickets we didn’t want to use. 

This event is a pretty big deal in Boston, however, and the tickets were going for $150+ on ticket apps. We were planning on selling our tickets, but I asked my girlfriend if she had any interest in seeing her team play before we sold them. 

She said she did want them. I obviously wasn’t going to try to make a profit off my girlfriend, so I said her and two friends could buy them off us for the original amount we paid, $40 each, which I thought was a pretty generous thing for my friends to do considering they could have sold them for at least $100 more on the market.

Her perspective on it was different. She argued that because I spent $40 for two events and already attended one, by selling her a ticket for only one event, I’m still profiting off of her. My argument is that the reason I spent the $40 in the first place was to watch the championship, and that the semifinal and championship are not equal value. Plus we gave them the opportunity to go at a very cheap price when tickets were hard to come by.

At the end of the day, I understand her perspective, but it felt like a more than generous offer to me. Also just want to add, neither of us are super hung up about the money, it’s more the principle of it.",0.28

I showed up for my scheduled tour which happened to be the time slot after his and he looked annoyed and didn’t say hi to me. He said goodbye to the realtor and drove off. He called me 10 minutes into his drive to tell me what he thought about the house, and I told him I was upset and confused as to why he didn’t say hi to me and why he left without saying anything. His response was that he didn’t see any calls or texts from me so he didn’t know I was coming. I also told him that I was in the house at that moment and thinking of making an offer, then wished him the best of luck. I really do love the house. It’s in my price range, doesn’t need major renovations, and it has a really nice sunroom. It’s close to my hometown and job.

"AITA for not giving my close cousin our family's car at a significantly lower price? I (28M) am from a middle-class family. We moved to New Jersey from Yemen in 2010 but weren't financially stable. In 2021, my older brother and sister moved to California, and I'm staying with my mom. We work at good paying jobs and are now stable.

In 2013, my mom hardly bought my sister a Prius. My sister then moved to CA with a Benz, and the Prius has been sitting in our driveway since then. In 2022, I noticed a lot of issues and brought it to a Toyota dealership. It cost $2k in total.

I thought it was time to sell it. I paid $200 for interior detailing and listed it for $13k. I was getting offers for $10-11k, but my sister and I thought that it was worth $13k considering what I put in to fix it. It had no accidents and around 90k miles. I couldn't get a sale and took the listing down. wanted to use the car when she visited anyways.

In Oct 2023, my close cousin (34F) and her husband came to Long Island on a visa for a couple of months. They rented a daily car at an expensive price because they needed one ASAP. They were looking for cheaper options and knew that we had the Prius. The car was under my mom's name and insurance, so I told them that they could borrow it if they could put it under theirs. They said they couldn't because they just arrived and didn't have a driver's license to get insurance. Although my cousin told me she was a good driver and I believed her, I was not comfortable lending her the car under my mom's or my insurance, because **if** anything happened then our premiums would be fucked.

She then asked if she could buy the car. Without a second thought, I said $13k. She said that it might be too expensive. I said that that's what I listed it at. She said she'd ask her husband and look into it.

I didn't want to leave her empty-handed, so I looked up safer ways to lend the car. A day later, I figured out a way to lend the car on Turo, and they have their own policies for covering renters. The initial cost was $13 per day, which was cheap in itself, but I could lower it to $1. I thought was a great option to protect my mom and gave my cousin this information and the link to the active listing. She said she'd ask her husband and look into it.

I didn't hear anything from her for 2 months.

Fast-forward to last Christmas, my brother visited her in Long Island and then visited us in New Jersey. He brought up and asked why I didn't just give her the car. I asked him for what she said. She said that I wasn't willing to lend her the car and inconsiderately asked for $15k. I got angry. I was willing to negotiate the price, but I wasn't going to bid against myself, and I didn't ask for $15k. She was putting me in a bad spotlight when I tried to give her the car. She has a highlander now.

My brother argued that I should have given her the car for free because we were financially stable and they weren't. America is expensive, but they came here to give their autistic son special education not available in Yemen. So, AITA?",0.14
"AITA for turning my dog into a ""support animal"" to live in my own property So my dad passed away and he left me his apartment. The HOA there forbids large dogs, even though half the building has large dogs that were grandfathered in.

So instead of moving in, I leased out my dad's apartment to someone else. And I'm in California so of course they decided to stop paying and it took me 6 months to evict and I lost out on like $25k.

Now the apartment is finally vacant and I don't want to deal with another tenant. I own the property outright and want to live there peacefully with my dog.

So I found a Dr to diagnose me with anxiety and wrote me a letter saying my dog is a vital part of managing my anxiety, etc.

It just seems crazy that I have to lease another apartment while leasing my own property to someone else. All because of some arbitrary weight/breed limit.

On Thursday, dinner with his parents followed by online games with friends. On Friday, D&D from after dinner until basically bed time. On Saturday, online games and family dinner. On Sunday, D&D and/or online games with friends.

I’ve brought up how I feel multiple times. His solution at first was date night, which was nice since we didn’t even have that before. However, his most recent solution was eating dinner together.

there is a dollar general around the corner from my temporary job. The other day, I went to get some legit desperately needed stuff, and this dude was checking me out. It was decently busy and my card wasn’t working. Each time it declined, he would send me to the back of the line (another 15 minute wait each time) FIVE TIMES. Took my entire lunch hour and then some. But i desperately needed it, like, feminine stuff...

I finally got my card to work, not sure what was wrong with it, and I went on my way.   
 So today, I went back to grab a couple things for my mom (same workplace) and something I’ve been majorly craving. Same dude was there to check me out. I told him before I handed my stuff over to be rung up, if my card declined, HE WOULD NOT send me to the back of the line each time. That wasted way more time than if I was to try each time consecutively. I told him he would piss me the fuck off if he tried, and I’d refuse.   
Backstory, I wore my fleece onsie because it’s cold outside (26 degrees) and I have to WALK 1/2 mile one way. Being in a hot office, I wasn’t about to wear pants to work. No way. This dude looks at me, laughs, and says “HOW THE FUCK DO YOU EXPECT ME TO TAKE YOU SERIOUSLY WHEN YOU ARE WEARING \*THAT\*”    
This pissed me off even more. So I told him the fucking truth. “After you sent me to the back of the line so many times, sent me out of the store to get a new card, HALF mile ONE way, I’m gonna fucking wear something to keep me fucking warm.”   
He checks me out, putting one fucking thing per bag, SMALL THINGS. I asked him to bag it all together, as they were all small things that were NOT heavy, and he told me “I can’t do that. I’m required to bag separately.” And sends me on my way. Or so I thought.   
 As I was going out the door, he says “hey wait!” So even pissed off, I said “yea?” And THIS FUCKING DUDE HAD THE GUTS to ask “are you single?” OMG.   
So pissed off already. I said “Nope, and even if I was, Id never take a fucking IDIOT like you who can’t take a person seriously based off of what they are wearing. If you can’t take a customer at your fucking job seriously, you wouldn’t be able to take a partner seriously.” And this IDIOT said “you didn’t have to be rude…” like he wasnt a total prick to me.

I tried let Susie know that I am really interested but I feel she is looking for Alice's approval. 

Alice keeps bugging me over the whole thing. Me and Alice are still friends, we hang out, call each other and give support. 

I really would like to build something long term with Susie but Alice keeps ruining things and it seems Susie is getting far away from me. She already seems to have trust issue and she keeps telling me that she feels something off. I don't know what Alice could have told her. 
I know for sure Alice didn't tell Susie about us, because Alice wanted to keep our relationship secret. 

Alice keeps saying that she is upset about my behaviour.

"AITA For my attitude and perspective on money? For some context, my parents and I are immigrants. I came here as a very young child, and have been in the U.S. ever since (20+ years). Growing up, we were not rich at all, we actually started off as lower class, moved up to middle class for some time then some things happened with a failed business venture by my father and then we went back to “lower class”. We were not “poor” per se but we made enough to get by, my parents tried their best!

Fast forward to now, I graduated university a few years ago after making the decision to go to community college for 2 yrs and then transfer to university, sacrificing the full “university experience” in exchange for no debt upon graduation. I still live with my mother but I have a stressful but rewarding job that pays me about $4-4.5k/month after taxes. My mom asked me to pay some bills which added onto my own personal bills, I was a bit reluctant, but I agreed. My bills and the new ones I’d help my mom with added up to about $250-$500/mo. So after paying this and sending $1k to my Roth every month I have about $3k/month to spend on other things and save a percentage of.

 Then a few months later, pretty recently, my Dad asks to meet up with me to ask for a favor. We meet, then, he asks me to start giving my mom $1,000/mo to help out since she’s “sick” and getting older, and then gives a whole financial spiel on how “money is meant to be used instead of hoarding it” and how I should be “spending it more”. Frankly, on the outside I was nodding my head, but throughout the whole convo on the inside I was just… rolling my eyes.

I have never specifically asked anyone for money in my life. Everything from my credit score, having no debt, money in my bank acct, checking, investments, savings, investment knowledge and new job attainment has been a product of ME seeking this info out for myself and applying it. My parents never gave me any financial advice or guidance growing up, and tbh, although I love them to death, I would not really take financial advice from them now. I also remember my sibling calling me “greedy” or something along those lines before due to my frugal nature. 

I decided to give my mom $700/month, then my Dad asked for it to be raised to $800/month, so I agreed… then my mom tried to ask for it to be $1k, I declined because at that point I’d rather just move out right now than to give $1k out of my check monthly. I am saving up for many things, such as new car, house down payment so I can move out, etc. My job is increasingly stressful and when more people just keep asking me for money with their hands out…  I start to remember the blood, sweat and literal tears it took for me to get this and it irritates me…. A lot. Am I the asshole?",0.62
"AITA? Fiance on an overnight trip with a platonic female friend and her family AITA? A few weeks back my (30's F) fiance (30's M) said a platonic female friend had invited him to the other end of our country for an overnight trip to a fancy winery resort with her family. He asked if he should go and I said it was quite weird, and that I felt quite uncomfortable about it all, but if he wanted to he could. We didn't speak about it again until the night before the trip, when he told me he wouldn't be home the next day. 

He has been friends with this girl since before we met 3-4 years ago, and I do believe it was genuinely platonic - he used to date her friend. I've met this girl a few times and found her quite standoffish to me, but my fiance says that's just how she is. We live really far away from her but I've had her around for a meal, and we've been to a couple of events all together, but I don't feel like she's attempted to initiate a friendship with me. Also she is half my weight, and gorgeous. 

I was really blindsided that he actually thought he should go. I consider it completely inappropriate for a stunning single girl to invite a recently engaged man to a luxury resort with her family and I'm really surprised my fiance does not see how this is weird or why it would make me feel awful. 

I don't know if I would have felt different if I had been invited as well? I have a lot of close platonic male friendships with single men myself, but these are usually through work and I make a point of including my partner anytime we socialise. I asked him if he would be comfortable with me going on an overnight drinking trip to a romantic location with a single man friend and he didn't answer it. 

He also bought me flowers 'just because' a couple of days before he left, and I discovered this morning that a new tube of hair removal cream has been used in the last couple of days. 

For disclosure, my fiance and I do have a degree of non-monogamy in our relationship, which has included us both sleeping with other people with the other's OK and support. I have ranged from mild jealousy to zero jealousy, and there have been a lot of difficult conversations / compromises about boundaries, but overall it's been working pretty well. 

Am I overreacting? I feel like a total clown and maybe a hypocrite. ",0.8
"AITA for going off on my co-worker for speaking to me in an unprofessional way after me and another guy used the bosses computer to deal with a creature stuck in a storage unit? I work at a golf course, in a cart barn. The guy who runs the barn has an office in the barn. We have security cameras everywhere. For 4 years we have always had access to his office and his computer. He had the tee sheet that updates, trackers that track where the golf carts are and also cameras everywhere that we can see on his computer. I got a new co-worker (let’s call him C) about 8 months ago. 

The guy is THE worst worker I have seen in my life. Every single person has said this guy has to be fired and he’s horrible. He doesn’t answer radio calls, refuses to clean clubs, clean carts. Nobody likes working with him.

My boss explained to me that C & other guys for months have been going in his office, closing the door, feet on his desk and on their phones (we don’t use phones on the clock) and he has since decided to lock it. There is a key to his office hidden in a desk that only I and two other guys know about in case of emergency. Weeks later this happens.

 We opened the bagroom there was piles of poop and pee. We have over a million dollars worth of equipment in the room. Me and another co-worker immediately assumed there's a creature in the room that's still there. 
We discussed our options and decided this was a big enough situation to unlock the bosses door and look at the cameras to find out what it was.

 We watched the cameras and discovered it was a giant opossum. It tore up several bags causing thousands in damages broke some golf clubs and peed and pooped on other bags..We were closed the next day meaning if we didn’t get it out it would be stuck there and damage more equipment, once the closing shift came in and we had a discussion with the rest of the staff we thought it would be best to get the creature out, put him in a big barrel and relocate him.  

We go back to the office to go through the footage to see where it was and find it then safely get the creature out.. He wasn’t harmed, didn’t attack anyone and thanks to the cameras we knew exactly where he was. We have over 400 bags in storage plus other equipment. 

While we were locking the office up, C comes up to me and says ""what the fuck are you doing get the fuck out!"" I said ""excuse you I have been here for 4 years, I have permission to use the office I'm a veteran member of the staff. Don't speak to me like that ever again."" We went at it and he wouldn't stop berating me and saying he's going to taddle tell to the boss and I'll get fired.

 I then said ""you're the reason we can't go in there to begin with because you're lazy and decided to abuse the office privileges don't threaten me again."" He looked shocked and walked away.

 I've been dealing with this guys crap for a year. He also made a group chat for our staff and didn't include  me in the work chat Am I the asshole here? Was the situation justified in unlocking the bosses office to view the cameras?",0.07
"AITA for yelling at my best friend for telling me to get over my dad I (18 F) got into a heated fight with my best friend “Kay” (19 F)  (using fake name for her), over her saying something I never thought she would say 

For a little context me and Kay have known each other since primary school and we are both graduated from high school (I’m from Australia and don’t really do middle school) we have had on and off contact with each other since she does Uni and I’m trying to find employment but since COVID it’s been a struggle to find employment once again, Kay invited me out for a day in the city and of course i agreed, I love the city and it helps me forget all the bad stuff that has happened. 

Well in June of 2022 on my birthday week, my dad passed away, I was turning 17 that year, my dad passed due to a aortic rupture, (for those who don’t know what that mean, it’s when the main vein leading to your heart bursts and no you don’t live very long after) I had witnessed my dads health decline from my backyard patio to keep my dogs calm as my step mum and paramedics worked on my dad, my brother who was only in year 7 at the time was told to stay in his room. 

After my dad was taken in the ambulance to the hospital we got picked up by my mum while my step mum got ready to go to the hospital, sad to say it wasn’t even hour before we got the phone call saying my dad wasn’t going to make it and to rush to the hospital. 

I saw my dad in a state no one else should see their fathers, I held his hand and told him I loved him very much and I didn’t want to let go but I had to. 

The following morning on my way to school I got told that he had passed that morning. 

While me and Kay were walking around the city, I kept talking to her asking if she thinks my dad would be proud of me for graduating, she shrugged her shoulders and she said “I couldn’t care less” it hurt me for a moment but didn’t let the comment get to me, we continued our walk before we found a spot to sit down and she pulled something out I never forgot 

She looked at me before saying “why should I care your dad is gone, there are heaps of kids who don’t know their dad and they don’t complain” I looked at her with surprise and shock, I didn’t know what to say she then followed her statement by saying “I mean yeah it is sad but you need to hurry up and get over him” 

I started screaming at her, I told her how dare she talk like then when she doesn’t understand the pain of losing someone like your dad, knowing that he has health issues (my dad had an enlarged heart) and not knowing when something like this can happen, I yelled and continued to yell until I was crying, she stood up and said I was an asshole for screaming at her for her just giving me advice

"AITA for actively breaking screentime boundaries? I (17F) have been living with extremely controlling and religious parents who have insisted on seeing everything I do, especially when it comes to tech. They claim it’s for my ‘safety’, but based on previous actions they have pulled, it’s definitely not that.

 These restrictions only started when they found out I was queer around when I was 13, and have stuck their noses in every social interaction I’ve had ever since. I have two younger brothers (12 years old) who have virtually no restrictions because they aren’t queer (despite them doing questionable things on the internet, which my parents shrug off as them just ‘being boys’.)


I am now 17, have a girlfriend (which is taboo because dating isn’t allowed at all here, let alone with another girl), and about to graduate next year. I want to go into the arts, but screen time also blocks that out, along with all university resources I need and all ways to just talk to my girlfriend. Talking with my parents hasn’t helped in the slightest because they made it clear that they weren’t going to change their minds until I was grown up and married to a man so I can ‘make my own decisions’. I literally can’t get anything done for any future career prospects right now. Not under the rules we have anyways.

In all the time I’ve spent here, I’ve cracked multiple ways to break and even outright remove the three layers of restrictions I have (wifi blocks, qustodio blocks, and actual apple screentime). I’ve been using all my knowledge and not caring whether my dad can tell if I am bypassing things. He’s been furious with me and regularly checking both my iPad and phone. I’ve continued anyways.

"AITA for telling my mom it’s my baby shower, not hers? I (25F) am pregnant with my first baby. I am so excited for this new chapter of my life. My mom and I are currently planning my baby shower. 

My brother and I were primarily raised around my dad’s family. When I was too young to remember my parents decided to spend minimal time with my moms family. Her family is messy, several of them were drug addicts, they were always fighting, it just wasn't a good environment for kids. Therefore, weekends and holidays were spent with my dads family.

My parents recently got divorced. Since the divorce my mom has really struggled with my brother and I spending our time with my dads family. I understand how and why it is hard for her. She feels like we prioritize my dad’s family over hers, but we don't have any relationship with her family. My dad’s family reaches out on birthdays, holidays, for milestones, etc. I didn't hear from anyone on my moms side of the family when I got engaged or married, which is fine, it’s just a testament to the lack of relationship I have with them.

Now that the baby shower is in the works, I made my guest list which had about 57 people on it. I asked my mom who from her family she wanted me to invite. She had me add 17 people, 7 of which are friends she's had for less than 2 years. The rest are her family, who I don't really know. I added all of them with no questions asked.

I had too many people on the guest list and had to remove some of them. I removed 9 people from my list. I then asked my mom who I could remove from her list. She replied to my text and said ""everyone I sent you is important I would like you to keep them on the list."" I just said okay.

Shortly after, she asked me if I ended up removing anyone from her list. I told her that I removed 3 people from her list, who I haven't seen or heard from in at least 10 years. She told me one of them was already informed of the shower and verbally invited. So, she asked me to send an invite to this person. I did, with no hesitation.

A few days later while out to brunch she said ""there were other people I would have preferred you to take off the list than the people you did."" I explained that she could have told me this when I asked her who to take off. She explained that since she is paying for the shower she should be able to invite who she wants. (Side note: I did not want her or anyone to pay for the shower for this exact reason.) I said that the people who I took off from her list are people who I haven't heard from in a decade. She said my milestones are her milestones therefore she should be able to celebrate with whoever she wants. She said if there is room for 60 she should be able to invite 20. I told her it's my baby shower not hers. Needless to say we never came to an understanding. She just accused me of being inconsiderate of her and I left the restaurant crying.

It’s hard to trust my emotions right now between all the pregnancy hormones. I see where she is coming from, but I only removed 2 of her people. So, AITA?",0.5
"AITA for talking about my partner's depression to my friend although she asked to be discreet? My partner has been diagnosed with depression since a few months. We've been living together for more than a year. They have kept their depression a secret and it took them some time to even tell me. But over the months we've grown comfortable talking about it to each other. A very few of their other friends know but doesn't talk much about it to them all.

Although, they seem to manage the depression quite well, seek therapy, and take medicines and try to work on it, last few (especially 2 days) were quite bad and they isolated so much and barely spoke to me. They asked me to leave alone which I'm happy to, but they're in the middle of a crucial phase of finishing studies and searching a job which is also quite anxious for them.

I was left stranded and clueless (although for just 2 days), but living with a person who is like this and seeing them infront of your eyes that they're struggling so bad and feeling helpless was quite excruciating. That's when I realised the people I consider close friends are also her close friends. I didn't want to talk about it to them because my partner doesn't want me to talk about depression to others. 

But it's starting to affect me, and I was being anxious the whole day at work. I know the best person to talk to is a therapist but where I live, I don't have immediate access to one. So I decided to seek help and advice from my best friend who I think is very sensitive about this, as someone who has gone through depression themselves. 

I ask my friend what to do because I'm stuck anxious not knowing how to deal with this and if I should intervene and push my partner to start doing things that have a sorta deadline or give them their space and accept the silence and their struggle. 

My friend gives clear advice and a 3rd person perspective which helps me understand and helps my clarify myself. During the conversation, my friend is very empathetic in understanding my partner's illness too.

I come home, gladly to my partner atleast talking to me today, and that's when I bring up that I spoke about it to my friend and they offered some real good insights. My partner freaks out and lost their shit completely. They said I have no right to speak about their mental illness to someone else without their permission, which I think is a valid argument to expect privacy but my argument is that I am stuck and needing help and I spoke about it to someone who I thought is sensible, non-judgemental and also not someone who my partner talks to/faces regularly/has a personal friendship with. Especially in a time when my partner wouldn't even talk to me, and I didn't know whom else to ask what to do or how to handle this and I ended up feeling lonely and left aloof dealing with it.

"AITA for reporting my best friends for neglecting their cat? I have these friends who are practically family, but their mental health struggles absolutely consume them. They have trouble keeping up with dishes, trashes, and other common needs, and when I house cleaned for them I had to quit two weeks in due to how awful and hazardous the conditions were. They could only get their litter boxes changed once or twice a month for 13 cats due to financial issues, they keep bringing in strays regardless of whether they can care for them or not, and they have a snake, which we all bought together, that is now incredibly obese due to them only feeding it beef from the store due to how broke they are.  
I had to call animal control today because one of their cats has a lot of teeth issues that are preventing him from eating well, and they admit he is skin and bones because of this. Only five pounds, probably less now. They, instead of getting him to a vet, take in more strays and prioritize spaying and neutering them when their other cat is in constant pain and starving due to his health issues. I tried to help fund their vet visits, but nobody would help pay and people kept saying they need to be reported, as this is not a laughing matter.  
When you walk into the house, you can just smell the cat poop and pee. My friends are also sick often because of, what I can assume, is the ammonia buildup. I feel absolutely wretched, but I rescue myself and I could not just stand by and watch that happen. I am hoping that, with this officer getting involved, they will help my friends get the cats the care they desperately need, and maybe this will be a wake up call and they are able to get on their feet.

One day during the trip, some of her friends and i started talking about past relationships. My gf was out of the house at the time. They casually mentioned that my gf used to be ""a real heartbreaker"" and left a few guys pretty brutally. they mentioned that my gf has always been too independent, cold, aloof, and selfish for relationships, left men as soon as she got bored, and just generally did her own thing when and wherever she pleased. i laughed along with the group at the time. i don't know if they're serious or not, if they meant it as a compliment to me for sticking around, etc. but im concerned. admittedly, my gf is ""cool"" in that she doesn't really show emotion, is overly logical, needs a lot of alone time, told me she has left guys before poorly, and can be quite cold and harsh when she's worked up. but she also has called me the love of her life and can be sweet.

"AITA for holding a grudge against my brother? I (18F) have an older brother (21M) and I've always held a grudge against him since our childhood.  
For reference, my older brother has ADHD and had a lot of outbursts. He needed a lot of attention when we were growing up. I also have two younger siblings 15M and 13F. Due to his needs, this required me to become somewhat of a parent to my younger siblings. When my older brother would have outbursts I would have to lock my younger siblings and me in my room and distract them.  


This is not the only reason I hold a grudge.  


I have always been an independent child, I started working as a babysitter when I was 12 and continued until I got my first real job at 16. My brother on the other hand didn't get his first job until he was 21.  


Even though I technically have more life experience than him, everyone acts like he's the mature one and that I'm just some innocent teenage girl. My family refuses to acknowledge what happened in the past (except my younger siblings) and when I bring it up they get angry with me.  
This has caused me to act out in the past. I tended to point out differences between my brother and me like how I got my license before him and so on.  


The real reason I'm asking this here is because I'm working on becoming a better person and would like to know if other people think that I should just let this grudge go. I know that we have all grown and changed and my brother is not the same person he used to be.

I attend of the most prestigious colleges in the nation, and I have been dubbed an “elitist” by all my friends from high school. I have to maintain a level of prestige for my family, as education and etiquette is highly valued.

I left all of them behind because they got into heavy substance abuse. Even though it is just alcohol, weed, and other “party” drugs, I do not want to be associated with those type of people. I have made that very clear since middle school, and now that they have gone down that path, I do not want to be with them.

"AITA for letting my parents move into a house my in laws paid for? Am I the asshole for letting my parents move in to our house that my in laws paid for? 

Me (28F) and my wife (29F) were lucky enough to receive major help with buying our first house as a wedding gift from my wife’s parents (they paid a down payment of 50%, and we pay the monthly mortgage). 

Her parents are very well off and both make over 250k each a year. They do not have to continue to work but they often travel for a good 8 weeks of the year and in general want to continue to work for a few more years to support their lifestyle. My parents however live a more modest life. They can pay for what they need and a lot of what they want and own a house in a small rural area. 

My in laws live a 15 minute drive from where our house is, I am pretty sure part of the down payment gift was to ensure that we remained close to them. 

Me and my wife are expecting our first child together in may and are super excited. We’ve started to discuss child care options and in our city a spot in a baby room at a legit daycare is almost 2k a month! My parents knew about this struggle and my mother offered to stay and watch our baby once we’ve run out of maternity leave (baby will probably be 10-11 months). They however live over two hours from where we are so I offered them the bedroom and washroom in our finished basement. My fathers work place would actually be lesser of a commute from our place than where they live now. 

So in this idea my parents would live in with us while my mother provides free child care. This would save us a lot of money and ensure that they have an active role in their grandchild’s life. 

However when we told my in-laws about it it was awkward. And then later my wife came to me telling me that they aren’t comfortable with us letting my parents live for free in a house they paid for. She said that they offered to help pay for childcare if that was an issue. 

I feel as they don’t get to have a say with what we do with our house considering it was a gift. We are very thankful of course but I don’t think we owe it to them to not let my parents stay with us. I also think it’s unfair since they will be 15 minutes from their grandchild and could see them everyday, while if my parents stay where they live now they will see our child a few times a month max.

"AITA for considering going back to a mental hospital? I have struggled with my mental health for years. Right now is no difference. I've been in and out of mental hospitals this past year and when I got admitted to the last one back in December, my dad told me I need to stop going because they can't afford to keep going out of town to pick me up when I'm released. Issue is I'm not getting better, I haven't seen my therapist or med doctor in over a month and I was taken out of case management for 'no longer meeting the requirements'. Therapy and med appointments keep getting farther and farther apart and it's hard. I am not going to go into detail, but I'm probably at the point I need to go back. But I don't want to say anything because of what my dad said and I feel honestly a little guilty about it. I don't want to make them struggle with money more then they already are but at the same time I need the help. I mean, I brought it up to the hospital in December and they said that if it becomes a repeat issue they can help pay for gas! But idk, aita?",0.32
"AITA for picking me above his friends? My fiancée and I have been together for 8 years and we are getting married in 5 months time. I love him dearly and I can’t wait to marry him. I’m a pretty extroverted person and get a lot of energy from hanging out with my friends. However, he’s upset because I have recently been telling him that I would rather stay at home than go for dinner at his friends. Not the first time.

So, why? 

1. We are building a house, and we have 4 months left of the build; not only is it a custom build so there’s loads of urgent decisions taking up evenings and weekends. 

2. We are planning our wedding - we’re getting married in 5 months, which I see as an opportunity to invest in our relationship and also that of our friends and family. But we have to organize and pay for everything. While I might depend more on friends and family, mine live abroad (we recently moved to his home country) so I don’t feel the ability to ask for help from people I don’t know.

3. I’m still learning the language, and even though they are lovely people, I just can’t follow everything. This means these events, whether in groups or just couples, drain me a lot energy wise.

4. I’m working hard. Hard. I have a full time job and work up to 60hrs a week. I travel for work most weeks and there’s pre-trip and post-trip prep and admin that does take up extra time. With the cost of the build and the wedding, which we’re paying all ourselves, I feel a huge responsibility to ensure I keep earning enough to support it. My partner earns well but his job is less demanding and he does a lot more for our house project, but also has a lot more energy left. Right now doesn’t seem the right time to search for a new job.

So, I want to look after my body because I want to be healthy when we try for kids soon, and when I have an evening or a day off I have told him that I have to deprioritise something and my decision is his friends. Everything else is too important to drop right now. For important events, like family things, I’m always there and love to be. 

I’ve told him please not to make me feel bad for 5 months when I ask to cancel these things because I’m just trying to keep it together.

He says he’s disappointed that this doesn’t bring me energy and he then gets physically upset about the idea of having to cancel plans that were in the diary for some weeks. He thinks these events would help me relax by letting me talk about what we’re doing with his friends, or even distract me with other topics. He’s also worried that if this is what I say now, that maybe it won’t change after the house is done, and I’ll just come up with a different excuse.

tldr: overworked, planning wedding, building home and have no spare time so have deprioritised me seeing his friends to take care of myself. He’s upset because he feels as a couple we should be making the time to prioritise this couple stuff with his friends.",0.85
"AITA For Not Eating the Same Thing As The Rest of My Family? Throwaway acc bc ik some of my family’s on reddit.

so recently my father’s gotten deer meat, and has been cooking it a lot for family meals. i ate it when i was younger, but now that i’m older, i don’t want to eat it. i don’t like it. the way it looks is in my opinion, gross and i also don’t like the way it tastes. also for me, i really like deer. i can’t really describe it, but i have a soft spot for them, i think they’re cool. 

i’ve been holding firm on this decision and opting to eat other things, but my father isn’t happy about it. he’s been begrudgingly making me other things, constantly bringing it up in conversations, etc. 

i’d like to point out i never asked him to make me alternatives instead, he decided to make them for me, i was fine if i had to just eat sides. im grateful he’s taken the time to make me an alternative but some of the things he’s saying is making me feel really guilty about the entire thing.

i don’t think i’m TA because to me it’s not any different than not eating a certain side dish or not liking a fruit, but he’s been making comments. i’d ask people around me, but i want unbiased opinions, so AITA?",0.05

While he was at work, I cleaned the entire house, mopped, cleaned the bathroom, did our laundry, etc. When he got home, I was in our bedroom putting our laundry away and the first thing he asked was what was for dinner. I told him I spent the entire day doing the list that he sent me so I haven't cooked yet. He got annoyed and said that since I was just home all day, I should have been able to do a simple task such as cooking. I said we can just order takeout or something but he just got upset and went to his mom's for dinner. I don't know what I did wrong. I didn't call into work to be a housewife.

"AITA for Wanting to Press Charges Against a Tinder Date Who Ruined My Car? So, I'm a young woman who recently matched with a guy on Tinder. We hit it off pretty well over text and even had a great phone call, which made me really happy. It felt like we were starting to like each other. A few days into this budding connection, he was out partying at a club in my city and, out of the blue, called me asking for a ride home. We hadn't met in person before, but being the kind-hearted person I am, I agreed to help him out.  
The ride home turned into a nightmare. He was completely wasted, ended up vomiting all over my car, and made the whole interior a mess. Despite the unpleasant situation, I took care of him and made sure he got home safely, without holding his drunken behavior against him.  
The following day, I texted him to check if he was okay, only to receive arrogant and unappreciative responses. There was no thank you, no acknowledgment of the effort I put in, just him being a total jerk. I expressed my disappointment and asked him to at least compensate me for the ride and the extensive cleaning time my car required (over 3 hours, and it still reeks). Instead of addressing the issue, he blocked me.  
Now, I have all his information and am considering going to the police to press charges for the damage and disrespect he caused. Am I the asshole for wanting to take this step?",0.19
AITA for not paying for a dinner date for a girl after we placed a bet and she lost? So we went to a Colombian place thats not too expensive and shared a plate. Everything was going fine and we were talking about the Mean Girls movie that just came out. She said she’s going to watch it that night on her pirated website because “it has all the movies”. I doubted that because I use Soap2Day which doesn’t have Mean Girls on it yet. So I asked “how much you wanna bet” and she says $500. I thought about it and suggested we just bet who pay for this dinner. She lost and still didn’t want to pay. I said a bet is a bet and she makes a whole scene slams her card on the table and tells me to pay and walks to her car. I felt super embarrassed as everyone in the place saw what happened and I had to go up to the server and use her card to pay. Am I the asshole?,0.17
"WIBTA if I asked my brother to stay home for our family vacation? I (32m) have a brother (36m) and a sister (30f). My brother has two children (13m and 10m), the older one needing very specific treatment for his needs, being a very low functioning person with autism. 

Him being a single father with a special needs child, he tends to not be able to treat him, though he manages to do just fine during the day. 

For context, my family, including my sibling, their children, and my parents, takes a vacation to a remote cabin upstate. Though as my nephew has grown older his needs have increased. In an already small cabin, there is already plenty mess, which is just constantly added too with all of his devices and luggage. Not to mention the sound and extra cost. 

I have asked around my family and many people have shared my concern. What I do not want to happen is my brother getting offended or my younger nephew feeling excluded for his older brothers needs. My idea is simply bringing along my younger nephew and allow my brother and older nephew to stay home for the trip. 

I understand the need for inclusion, and I don't want to cause any unnecessary harm.

"AITAH If I want some alone time from my girlfriend? Hello, AITAH if I do not want to not hangout with my girlfriend every so often when we see each other about 4 times a week if not more including sleep overs? We have been dating for about a year now in February, prior to that I was in a relationship for 6 years with for 4 of those years living together.

My current girlfriend will tell me that's im patronizing her whenever she says she misses me and I tell her I miss her too even when I tell her that day that I want a 'me' day. I do not get a lot of time to myself as I have two onsite jobs, a family business that I will help at more often than not and do freelance work online, the times im not working she will typically ask to spend the night when she works the next morning because I live closer to her job


Last night she asked me to pick her up from a friend's house because she was too drunk to drive and a few hours prior to that I knew she was at her friends and told her if she is too drunk to drive let me know and I'll pick her up. I had just finished working a shift from 10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. and after that I helped out my family's business from that time right after until about 9:30 p.m. I got home at about 10:15 and she called me at 12:00 a.m. to pick her up, I work at 6:00 a.m. today and when I went to go pick her up she asked if I was mad and I told her that I'm not mad at her and my only concern was getting her home safely and then going home to sleep so I can wake up and work the next morning.

Today she asked if I would like to hang out and I told her that I have a lot of things to catch up on and I would like a day to myself, she said that was okay. She then later told me that I miss you and I replied I missed you as well and then she told me I was patronizing her and I'm trying to distance myself and I have no idea what to do or feel, because I I feel for her thinking that her boyfriend doesn't want to hang out with her and that sucks but at the same time I do need time for myself and I just really need it",0.09

When I found out I was pregnant I didn’t announce anything till I was out of the first trimester in case I suffered a miscarriage as the first trimester is the most sensitive. After the first trimester was over I told my family I was pregnant with a little girl and they were ecstatic. My older brother already has two kids of his own and my older sister also has one. My parents are divorced and my mom is single while my dad has been with his girlfriend since I was 10. When my dad found out I was pregnant he was excited and his girlfriend kept saying she’d be a grandma and that automatically grabbed my attention. She is not my mother so how would she be a grandma? I love her however she is not my mom and she’s not even married to my dad. My dad kept saying she’d be a grandma and her daughter would be an aunt to my baby. I love them both however none are related to me and I would never take my baby away from them they just simply do not get the title as my mom was the one who raised me and I only have two siblings.

"AITA for telling my dad to f*ck off I'll start this off as i'm 19 AFAB. I've never had a good relationship with my dad, i've only recently been diagnosed with autism. Growing up i used to have daily meltdowns after school. This would include me shouting, crying and more, yes i hold myself accountable for it even if i don't remember doing the things that my family said i did).

it started when i was around 6-7. It started as me having the usual meltdown after school it was the usual screaming and crying then my dad got involved and after i had managed to calm down i could hear my parents arguing, then my dad came into my room with a suitcase and told me to pack my stuff he was sending me away.
A couple of years later there was no food in the house and i had forgotten my dad had asked me to make sure he was up by a certain time but i had gone the shop to get food so me and my older brother could eat. When i got home my dad started to yell at me for not waking him up when he asked me too.

All of this continued for years to the point when i wouldn't even sit in a room with him and i was begging my mum to kick him out or divorce him (i was 11 at this time). She did kick him out but he guilt tripped her into letting him back because he said he'd get me taken away because of her mental health problems.

Things only got worse to the point my dad was purposely triggering my mums PTSD, but finally my mum kicked him out and had started the divorce process. Now my dad is bringing me into it telling me to tell my mum stuff and saying things about my mum to me, i've explained to him and asked him to stop but he carried on.

But now i'm planning on changing my second name to my mums maiden name becuase i don't even want to be associated with him anymore.

"AITA : Bride's social media habit vs. Sister-In-Law's parenting style This past summer, my partner's brother proposed to his girlfriend. She's the 'I've been planning my wedding since I was 5 years old' type. Our daughter was asked to be a flower girl. We've had a no social media rule for our kiddo since before she as born so when we gave a conditional 'yes' to our daughter being in the wedding, it came with the caveat that any wedding photos with her in them could not be posted on social media/the web by the wedding party or photographer. The bride and groom are well aware of our stance on this and had even spoken to us about a recent wedding where we successfully attended and took family photos with everyone respecting our wishes in regards to posting kiddo's image.  
Since being asked about the flower girl role we've had this back and forth where the bride tells the groom she just can't be limited on what she can post on social media, how awful his brother and I are for 'depriving' our 3yo of the privilege to be in their wedding, and how our parenting choices are ridiculous. Of course, all of this makes its way to us via the groom, not the bride herself. We've been super chill about the fact that if they don't want to limit photos and posting, our daughter just won't participate - she's 3... she doesn't care. This is met with loads of guilt as the groom wants her there as his niece and goddaughter. After a few rounds of this - all via text mind you - we are suddenly told that only kids who are part of the wedding party can attend the wedding. This felt a lot like a ploy to get us to cave on the photo thing, which did not work at all. Back and forth... you get the picture.   
Fast forward to Jan 2024 after interacting with the bride and groom over the holidays with no real resolution to this issue, we took the lead to get things finalized. A plan is made, everyone is happy and our daughter can participate. We ordered the flower girl dress. Then we get a call from the groom that after some additional thought, the bride just doesn't feel comfortable and thinks our daughter shouldn't be in the wedding which means she can't come at all. The reasoning we're given boils down to two facts (both offered up by the groom): 1. They are Gen Z and can't be expected to do anything but post everything about their lives on socials and 2. ""a woman deserves perfection on her wedding day"".   
We want to \*try\* and make the groom happy and feel as though we've put forward several reasonable options to make this work (I'll speak with the photographer, family, etc. about photos and posting, my parents are driving 6hrs to come and keep our daughter once the wedding is over so we can be present for the reception, etc.) and have now invested money in the flower girl dress and a great deal of logistical and stressful planning.

"AITA for silencing my sister? In my childhood, I lived in a room next to my sister’s. For many years, she did musical theater and frequently sang in her room to practice for her musicals. One week, she was practicing for an audition in which she had to perform a song. Throughout the week, she would sing the same song over and over again so that the lyrics became permanently embedded in my brain. She would sing at 11 or 12 at night sometimes and when I told her to stop, she would continue until I got my parents involved. After this, she failed her audition and blamed me for her lack of practice time. Snce then, she quit musical theater and it seems that I am the “root cause” because I enjoy a good nights sleep.

"AITA: For not giving a re-homed dog back to their owner? I recently found a dog on an online listing that I thought would be a great addition to my home; it had everything I was looking for. I met the owner and the dog, everything went great, we agreed to a meet up with the owner's other dogs in the near future and I even told the owner that I would give the dog back if they changed their mind. 

I took the dog home and sent plenty of updates and pictures to the previous owner. However, I soon realized that the dog was very sad about leaving her past dog siblings and came to the conclusion that a meet up so soon would not be a good idea for the dog as she adjusted to my home. I told the previous owner this and they went off on me saying that I went back on an agreement and that it was supposed to be a trial run (it wasn't). 

Anyway, the conversation escalated and the previous owner ended up asking for the dog back when I continued to say that the dog meeting with the owner's dogs so soon would be harmful for her progress in adjusting. I told the owner that that is not at all what I had meant by allowing them to have her back if they changed their mind. My daughter had already met and fell in love with the dog by this point and the dog was starting to get accustomed to my home. Well, after I said I wouldn't be willing to give the dog back under these circumstances, I received a call from the local police saying that the owner intended to bring this case to civil court if I didn't give the dog back. So, to save the headache, I gave the dog back. AITA? ",0.92
"AITA for hanging out with a guy? I (19F) made plans to hang out with one of my colleagues turned friend (19M) back in December. We know each other from volunteering together in our organization run by youth who are interested in politics and debate. We are both very passionate about debate, and while my friend isn't into politics as much as I am, we share that common interest of volunteering and attending each year. My bf has no interest in politics whatsoever, so we never really get to talk about that stuff. Usually I will bring up something I saw on the news and he will not engage in the conversation. Just remind me that he isn't interested in politics.

My bf (24M) and I are long distance. Over FaceTime I told him about my plans to hang out with my friend a week before it took place. He asked if it was a boy and I replied yes. He was a bit quiet after but l left it at that. A few days before I was supposed to hang out with my friend, I had tried bringing it up to my bf. I asked ""Do you want to talk more about me inviting [redacted] over?"", to which he said no. So I assumed there was no problem.

Yesterday, my bf had called me earlier in the morning to talk and I was cleaning up my place a bit before my friend had come over. I reminded my boyfriend of this and he asked me if he was going to be over at mine up until I had to go to work, to which I said yes. He said ""So, we don't get to talk until tonight?"", and I said maybe, but that I will try to shoot him a text here and there. My boyfriend asked that I text him periodically as it helps with his anxiety (his words) and I said yes. 

I had my phone on Do Not Disturb but allow my boyfriend as my only contact that can text me during that time. I would check my phone every so often to him messaging me multiple times and saying that he wasn't doing well. That his back was hurting and that he feels anxious knowing that I'm alone with a boy. I told him my friend and I were just talking and that nothing is going on between us. After a while of reassuring him I started to feel annoyed. I don't use my phone when I'm with people so I feel like I didn't really get to spend time with my friend.

Later my bf and I called before I had to go to work and l asked him why he didn't bring this up earlier when I had asked. He said he felt ashamed and that he didn't want to think that he doesn't trust me. he said he will be more honest from now on. But then said I needed to be honest too, which was irrelevant and made me upset. 

TLDR: I made plans with a friend from our politics and debate organization. My bf, initially quiet about it, later revealed anxiety when I spent time with my friend. Despite reassurances, he expressed discomfort, and when asked why he didn't mention it earlier, he admitted feeling ashamed. This led to a discussion about trust issues, with him asking for more honesty about feelings. The situation left me feeling annoyed and frustrated.",0.2
"AITA for Expecting Some Influence Over How My Financial Help is Used? I'm a father who's been fortunate enough to accumulate a significant amount of wealth over my lifetime. My son-in-law comes from a family that isn't as financially stable, but he's a genuinely nice guy, and I have a lot of respect for him.

From time to time, my daughter and son-in-law talk about their finances with me. Because I love them, I often offer to help out, and they've always accepted my assistance. My intention has always been to alleviate their stress and ensure they have a comfortable life. 

However, this has led to some awkward situations where I feel my generosity is being taken for granted, and they feel I'm trying to control them with my money. It's not my intention to dictate their lives, but I also believe that if I'm offering financial support, it's reasonable to expect that it's used in a way that aligns with the purpose it was given for.

I don't force my money on them; I just gently ask if they'd like me to chip in. They don't have to accept, but they do.

"AITA for feeling frustrated with how cat care is split up? AITA for feeling frustrated with how cat care is split up? 

Hello all, I (F19) need some input on an ongoing dispute with my roommates (F19, F19, M20) regarding our shared cat's care. A year ago, we adopted the cat with the understanding that he would eventually go with one of us after graduation. However, until that point, we agreed to share him entirely. We decided about six months ago that he would stay with me, but all of us agreed until we physically split the cat would still be shared.   
We agreed to evenly split cat care, including feeding, essential expenses, and daily litter box cleaning. The litter box is currently located in my roommate's bathroom. She said that I could keep it in there if I cleaned it daily and cleaned the floors. I'm the sole cleaner. She asked to move the box into my room and I asked if she would help me clean it then since the agreement was that I'd clean it daily since it was in her bathroom. She said no because even though he's a shared cat in the apartment, I'm the one who would be keeping him after graduation.   
My roommates now claim that since I'll be keeping the cat post-graduation, he's essentially mine, absolving them of shared responsibilities. This contradicts our earlier agreement six months ago when we decided I was the one keeping him to evenly share care until we part ways. I feel they're selectively avoiding the gross aspects of cat ownership while still enjoying the fun parts like cuddling with him, sleeping with him, and spending a significant amount of time with him.   
I've expressed my frustration, but my concerns are brushed off, and they consistently use the excuse that they no longer see the cat as shared. Despite our original understanding, I find myself handling the majority of tasks. One of my roommates doesn't even help feed him anymore, and two of my roommates rotate between the morning feeding. It's important to note that our cat is very food-driven, so they like feeding him since he likes people who feed him more. I feed him lunch and dinner, take him to vet appointments, and exclusively deal with litter box care. Two of my roommates help me brush his teeth every couple of days and clip his nails about once every three weeks. 

The way I look at it, it's clear he's a shared cat because they all hang out with him, sleep with him, etc. People who own animals in apartments normally don't allow the animals in their roommate's areas and their roommates don't interact with the animals.   
I'm torn between feeling upset over the unequal distribution of work and questioning if I'm being unfair. While I'm keeping the cat post-graduation, the agreement was clear about shared responsibilities until then. I'd like to know whether my frustration is justified or if I need to reevaluate my expectations. Am I being unreasonable in expecting equal participation, or am I in the wrong? Any input would be appreciated.",0.55
"AITA for expecting my friend to drive me home at 6am after a night out? My friend (22f) and I (24m) are having a bit of a disagreement and I want to know if i’m in the wrong. for context, my friend lives about 45 minutes from my house. normally i’d make the drive myself, but my fiancé and I share a car and he had to work that night, so my friend offered to just pick me up and take me home in the morning. before we had even left, it was established that because I would be leaving later than my fiancé, i would take the key and we would have to be home early so he wasn’t locked out of the house when he got home from work. i understand having 1 key is poor planning on my part, but this wasn’t anything new or brought up last minute.

"AITA for asking my boyfriend’s past sexual fling to not send him her sexy Christmas cards? My guy and I have been together about a year and a half. We were open for about the first year and in that time he saw a girl in another state when he was traveling for work. The agreement was he make it clear it was only a causal fling that it had an expiration date when his project in that city ended. 

He was there on and off over two months and they saw each other very frequently. The last time he was there she was asking to come see him again in our home state. I felt it was inappropriate and she clearly didn’t understand the assignment. 

Fast forward she hounded him daily for weeks after leaving over text, all about her life and what she was doing and asking to come see him. It was novels, and finally he got tired of responding so let conversation lapse. She finally got the clue and stopped the long texts, but they’ve kept a superficial exchange over IG.

This past Christmas which is a year since they saw each other he shows me she sent him her Christmas card which is her tits spilling out of a flight attendant uniform and bending over to show her panties under the skirt. Some cheesy taglines about it being a turbulent year yada yada. 

I asked him cause I wasn’t aware that they really kept up that much to warrant this attention and he said “I guess we’ve talked enough more recently she thought of me”. I have zero issue with continued friendly exchange, but she was aware that we closed our relationship in the past 6 months. When I told him to tell her I found it inappropriate she said it was weird and a red flag that I had a problem with it. So am I the asshole for asking a girl to not send her unsolicited Christmas themed “dick” pics to him?",0.67
"AITA for grounding my daughter less than 24 hours after she got ungrounded? Okay, so for some context I (32F) have a (13F) daughter who got grounded for about 2 weeks, and the day she got ungrounded was one of her friends birthday party, she asked me and I said yes, she said that they were going to the movies ( she left around 2pm and told me the movie started at around 2:45) and I asked her to be home by 7:30, she agreed and left.
 By 2:30 I check her location and she wasn’t at the movies she was at her friends house and told me she would be leaving soon. She ended up getting there by 4:15 and didn’t get home uu til almost 9pm and when she got home I grounded her so,

"AITA for liking my friend’s crushes instagram story 
My friend (20F) got upset at me when she found out that I (20F) liked her crushes instagram story. 

I am not close friends with that guy but we did hung out once or twice and we used to casually talk once in a while before my friend told me that she likes him. 

A little background story though, maybe four months ago after i was aware that my friend liked him, me and him we were snapping). We did have a long streaks before i became friends with my friend. No talking, just face snaps for the streaks. 

So 4 months ago or so, he called me cute (not in a romantic way and i dont think it was genuine). I was weirded out that he called me cute bc that was when he was in a “talking stage-ish” with my friend (accordigg to my friend). 

Then my friend tells me that the guy is toxic and he would ghost him and only talk to her at nights and weirdly get jealous that he would answer me but not her. 

Tired of dealing with her, i simply just blocked him on snapchat so she wont be jealous at me anymore. i didnt tell her anything abt him calling me cute or anything because i know hes a player and he says that to so many other gorls and its not that deep. 

Today i was mindlessly scrolling through instagram, watching people’s story and for the record, i like peoples ig story if i like what they post. He posted an outfit with no face on his story abd i liked it. I didnt even remmber liking it until my friend brought it up to me. 

My friend calls me in the middle of the night mentioning how the guy bragged to his guy friends that all of (my friend)’s friends like his story (ik such weird thing for him to brag..) and one of his friend told my friend that one of the people who liked the story is me.  

AITA for liking the story? Should i apologize to her for what i did. I understand that she could be jealous but i dont think she should be mad. But i do understand where shes coming from because i would be a upset if my friend did the same thing as i did and if i dont clarify to her she would think i had a flirty intentions(which i dont have).

"AITA for telling my co-worker that he’s just an order picker and needs to humble himself? I just started a new warehouse job, something I’ve no experience in. My role is called “Order Selector” but really it’s just picking shit for customer and building a skid. After 2 weeks, most people become as productive as someone doing this job for decades (at least at my warehouse). After 3 days of training I got my own rider and got a grave yard shift (because I’m new). At my shift there’s only 4 order pickers and one of the dude greeted me first and was fairly nice at first. He would give me pointers whenever I ask or when I mess up a bit. But he was very assholish when he did help. I’d ask some questions about how to build a skid and he would look at me like I’m a moron and called me an idiot multiple times. By week 2 at the job, our operations manager gives us our numbers. The average was 97, the target is 100, I got 115 items per hour. It’s all confidential of course but he asked me for my numbers and I showed him my paper, he looked surprised and said “well of course you got good numbers man, they only give you the easy shit”. I just laughed it off and said “true”. And btw I don’t get the easy bills, it’s literally random. There’s a pile of bills and you get it one by one… by the next day I could see he was visibly pissed at me, he stopped greeting me and would intentionally ignore my beeps when he was blocking the aisle. At break time he would brag about how good of a worker he is and how the operations manager just loves him to the now new guy. I just came by their table and said “calm down dude, you’re a 40 year old order picker. I reached your average within 2 weeks. Don’t worry man, you’ll learn how to build skids naturally.

"AITA for pressuring my bf to plan his future? I (23F) have been with my bf (25M) for over a year. I’ve noticed that he doesn’t like to plan far ahead or think about the future. On the other hand, I tend to be motivated by my long term goals and plans. Although we haven’t been together very long, I’m serious about our relationship and can picture our lives together (he’s told me he feels the same). He’s a talented athlete and is currently taking a year after graduating college to pursue his sport full-time. 
I’ve known about this for a long time and I support it. However, when I ask about his plans beyond this year he doesn’t answer. People in our lives have been asking when he’s going to get a job or start his career but he hasn’t decided. He hasn’t decided where he wants to live next year and whether or not we’ll live together. I don’t mind waiting to move in together or one day get married but I’d like to know how long so that I can plan accordingly. I’m currently focused on my career and I would like to one day own a house with my partner but I can’t afford it on one salary. I would also like to travel together but we can’t for now because of his practice schedule. I do tend to be impatient and lately I’ve been trying to get him to commit to a vague plan for his future.

"AITA for abandoning my niece and snapping at my SIL? I 28f work in law enforcement. Our pd is super understaffed so I often work long hours. If you ever worked in public service you’ll know how much bs I’m dealing with on a daily basis. Like your husband yelled at you 1 tone louder than usual, your child doesn’t listen, there’s a sketchy suv parked by a corner? Time for ~~divine intervention~~ calling the cops it ain’t like we have nothing to do on Friday night.

Anyway now to the conflict. I have a brother and a 12f niece. She’s generally a nice kid but her mom spoils her a lot. Again not my child not my business. Usually her mom picks her up from school but recently she couldn’t do so and asked me to help. I was omw home after a 24 hour shift either way so I said yes.

Well I pulled up to her school in my cruiser and my niece decided it’s time to make a scene. She goes to a nice school in an affluent neighborhood so a police vehicle is a rare sight and she thought it’d be embarrassing to get into one in front of her peers. She said I’m not getting in the car, I didn’t have time to try and persuade her so I said fine have fun walking home and just drove off. Btw she lives about a mile away from school so she could’ve easily walked home.

She called her mom and said i abandoned her, her mom called me back and started screaming saying that I left my own niece alone. I had no time for her bs, I literally just got home and wanted to finally have a warm meal and a good nap. So I said not my fault your brat thinks she’s above getting in a police car. She has two perfectly working legs and can survive a 15 minute walk. SIL said why tf did I pick her up in a cruiser, btw she knows full well I take the cruiser home sometimes and had no time to switch the cars even if I wanted. I said if you don’t like me picking up your child don’t ask me to do it ever again. She said I’m an asshole so I hung up and went to bed.

Now my brother is harassing me saying I was rude to his wife and his daughter, I said they were ungrateful and I already deal with a lot of bs at work no need to bring more into my house.",0.46

I walked up to her and talked with her on multiple occassions as she was getting her hair done and styled for the show. 

It was an lunar new year festival and so there was a couple of stations where they sold stuff and offered services like photoshoots. I followed her to all of them and tried to talk to her.

"AITA for having my son's best friend sleep in a different room? I (40M) have a son (16M) and daughter (18F).
Both of them have loved sleepovers since they were a kid, and as a stay at home dad I absolutely go all out everytime they have one. 
Now when my daughter turned 15 I implemented a rule for her that from now on any male friends he had would be sleeping in the guest bedroom during sleepovers (most of the time they'd all just sleep together in either the basement or if it was a small crowed, her bedroom) now before anyone starts crucifying me, I don't necessarily think my daughter would do something about that, my main concern is that I know what teenage boys are like, and I don't necessarily trust them around my sleeping daughter, this rule was made for her own safety. (But ofcourse now that my daughter is 18 she doesn't have this rule anymore since she's an adult, but she also prefers that they sleep in a different room).

Now my son, now my son is the definition of a ""rowdy"" teenager. I implemented that rule for him the second he turned 14. Another thing about my son, he's 100% gay. He hasn't come out yet, and I'm not forcing him to, but talk to him for more than 5 minutes, the closet is crystal clear and tinted with rainbows. My son has this school friend, which I also suspect is his boyfriend. I don't mind my kids have partners aslong as they keep it kid friendly. That's why when my son very sheepishly asked me if he could stay over for a sleepover I said sure but he'd have to stay in a different room. (Ps the guest bedroom is fully furnished, it's not like I'm having him sleep on the floor). He was distraught, and said it was unfair because I didn't have my sister's female friends sleep in a different room (newsflash your sister isn't a walking pride flag). I have my reasons for this, and I think I'm doing the right thing but still, reddit AITA? Am I being unfair?",0.5
"WIBTA for kicking my friend who’s visiting out of my parents house? About 4 years ago, I (22F) studied in Norway for a year after graduating highschool. I met a now close friend of mine, Christian (27M), while I was there. He was in the dorm room next door to mine, and we became really close. 

I always knew he had a crush on me while I was there, but I never reciprocated and have never been interested in him. He even offered to move to my country if I went out with him, once I had left the school. I declined but stayed friends with him. 

A few months ago out of the blue, he told me he was coming to my country on holiday and asked if he could stay at my place while he is here. I offered my parents place, since I live in a one bedroom and my parents have a spare room (I also just wanted more people around so he didn’t get the wrong idea). 

While he’s been here, he’s done a few things that have made me uncomfortable. He sends me sexual memes while I’m at work (like dirty humour memes, about being horny and stuff), he has also commented on my body and looks, saying he thinks I’m beautiful and that I have “great tits and ass and small waist” and that I shouldn’t be insecure. He also has on multiple occasions offered to massage my shoulders before bed (which I always decline), he even once said I could just take off the top half of my dress while he massages me since my clothes would be in the way (I also said no to this). 

The worst incident though was when he brought up sex in the car after we passed an adult shop. He started talking to me about female orgasms and how it’s not normalised but should be. I shut that conversation down real fast and told him he could walk home if he didn’t stop now. 

I told my boyfriend all this, and he suggested I talk to my mum about it and kick the guy out, and tell him he needs to find somewhere else to stay. I don’t want to be rude, and I’m pretty sure Christian has a learning disability as well (also Norwegians tend to be more open sexually I’ve heard). WIBTA for doing this? I guess I just feel bad kicking him out after he came all this way to visit (it’s over 15 hours away by plane), but I also feel like I need to set stronger boundaries with him. ",0.09
"AITA for excluding my sisters daughter from our gender reveal Hi everyone! 

A little background: My husband and I struggled with infertility for years, had multiple miscarriages, and decided to go down the ivf route. As we were going through our first round of ivf, my younger sister got pregnant.

Since she’s had her baby 4 months ago, she’s been pretty insufferable. 10 to 15 messages and videos every day to our family chat about her baby (the rest of the family usually just use this chat to check on each other so a couple of posts here and there). Random video calls throughout the day so we can see her baby. 

There were also so many messages and comments while she was pregnant and we were still struggling with fertility about how she gave the family the first grand daughter and the first baby in a while. I do love my niece, I ask about her every day, I talk to her via video chat and have sent gifts but the nonstop attention seeking really gets overwhelming.

Well, I’m 21 weeks now and we decided on an online zoom gender reveal since we have family all across the country. We sent the date and time to our families. She texted me to ask us to move it since it conflicts with her 4 month olds sleep schedule so it would make it hard for her baby to attend. Tbh, I don’t want her baby there since I’m worried that she’ll make the entire call about her baby.

So I told her that we couldn’t change the time and that she shouldn’t change her daughter’s sleep schedule for something that’ll only last a few minutes. My sister can still attend while the baby is sleeping. She now thinks I’m an asshole. She won’t tell me that directly but she’s complained to my other sister about it. AITA for what I said/did?

I should note that my sister has a history of shifting the attention to herself a lot. For example, I rarely post to the family chat but if I do my husband and I have a running bet as to how long it’ll take her to ignore what I posted and spam the chat of unrelated pictures of herself. My sister has a lot of wonderful qualities and I love her but her attention seeking is just something that really irks me and I really just want this 10 to 15 min event about me, my husband and our future baby.

Quick edit about the gender reveal: the zoom call will consist of the family choosing a blue or pink balloon that they blow. If it’s not the sex of the baby, it deflates. We thought it would be simple, mess-free way of making it a bit more interactive. Afterwards, we wrote them a thank you card with the baby’s name written in it.",0.15
"AITA for ""lying"" about my food allergy? Let me explain...

I (M, late 30s) have an allergy to fin fish that is non-deadly but serious and uncomfortable. My allergy is not in question. I have been allergic to fish since I was a toddler. My partner (also M, also late 30s) loves fin fish. He could eat it every day if he could. In some cases, I CAN apparently eat fin fish -- specifically, canned tuna. I don't know why or how. Don't ask. The canning process probable changes... something. Who knows. My partner knows about my fin fish allergy and my ability to eat canned tuna. Everyone in our shared lives know about my fin fish allergy and my ability to eat canned tuna. My fin fish allergy and my ability to eat canned tuna is common knowledge and a fact of life.

A few weeks ago we eat at a restaurant that we've eaten at before. The server advises that one of the items which I order -- which I've had versions of before at different restaurants -- ""has anchovies in it."" Some non-deadly allergy sufferers will understand here: sometimes you brush this warning off at restaurants because you know the server and the restaurant say these things merely to cover their asses so that the onus is back on you, the patron. I decided to brush off the warning, as I've had the same dish at different restaurants before without any noticeable reaction. (Maybe my allergy to anchovies is similar to my allergy to tuna, in some way). We order the food. I eat it. It's good. No problem.

Last week, my partner and I are at his place making a delicious tomato-based pasta sauce. I let the sauce simmer for about 20 minutes and excuse myself from the kitchen to help out with some housework. During this time, my partner apparently covertly emptied a whole small tin of anchovies into the sauce without telling me to test his theory that my allergy, specifically to anchovies, wasn't real. He only revealed this tonight over a conversation with friends. VERY, VERY luckily, I did not have a noticeable reaction. During this conversation with our friends, he took particular glee in proving how 'my allergy was wrong' (paraphrased). And by ""glee"", I mean sing-songy voice, childish dancing around the table, and fishing out the emptied tin out of the recycling bin outside and showing it to me to prove his point.

So, he did something I did not consent to that could have resulted in an allergic reaction, however major or minor. I felt violated. I felt that he broke my trust. I felt hurt. When our friends left, I told him this and his response was that ""I lied to him"" about my allergy when I told the server at that restaurant a few weeks ago that I had a fin fish allergy. And by doing so, I was in the wrong. Apparently I'M the bad guy, which feels like a major deflection of wrongdoing, if you ask me.

The fact that he didn't understand that his actions hurt me and made me felt violated is bonkers to me. He got angry at me and I left for the night.

I'm trying to make sense of all of this. AITA in all of this?

"AITA For Expecting My Parents To Not Let My Brother In? All adults involved are in their 30's, except my parents who are in their 60's. My daughter is 3.

My brother is a very complicated man, but ultimately has spent many years now using drugs/alcohol and taking advantage of my parents to do so. He has stolen from them, gaslit them, and controlled them. He lived with them until very recently after losing his job to a DUI. My parents grew up in very difficult circumstances, so have vowed to never let any of their children go without, which of course I have benefited from too and am very grateful for (as is our older brother), but we've never taken advantage like our other brother. He has had therapy and support (paid for by me and my parents) but still acts the way he does.

After years of also being lied to, being shouted at and called awful things, and a particularly bad incident when he was drunk in charge of my child and committed some other crimes, I told him I wasn't interested in a relationship with him until he was better. My parents were supportive of this, and me and my partner were clear we did not want my brother around our child without us present. We told my brother this as well.

My parents look after our daughter (3) once a week. Today, for the third time, I found my brother there. I've been told he was there to collect something, but he was sat with a drink while my daughter played. My daughter has also said he was at the park with them.

I'm furious and considering getting alternative childcare as I don't know if I can trust my parents any more. My husband supports this and, if we really budget, we could possibly afford it. But this would cause major drama in my family and I don't know if my relationship with my parents would recover.

Alas he took the door right off the hinges with a screwdriver. When he realized it was harder than he anticipated he asked me to put it back on. Now he’s never respected my career path and essentially has told me that all I do is scoop shit out of pipes and that it’s a dead end job. I told him if he wants my time and knowledge, it comes at cost.

"AITA for telling my friend what bothered me about the way she treated me? My friend asked me if my fiance and I wanted to go to Dave & Buster's and I replied no because I'm tight on money. She accepts my refusal and instead, we agreed to hang at her place to play on the switch and board games.

We arrive at her place and for four hours waiting around, instead of playing any boardgames, anything on switch or doing anything together, my friend is busy doing her own thing (cooking, taking a shower, and doing her make up) and basically leaves my fiance and me to watch her kids. Her kids were screaming nonstop, jumping on us, hitting us, and after a while, it got annoying. We told them to stop and to behave well but they did not listen. And my friends never said anything about what to do if they misbehave. 

She suddenly springs on me that we are going to a party at Dave and busters that she set up. I said no to her before so I was confused at the moment and didn't know how to react. She doesn't stop insisting I do my make up and hair so I do it.

My fiance and I were caught off guard by the whole situation and were texting each other if we should go but we decided to be nice and not be party poopers and rude, even though we felt she disrespected our boundaries and time. We did kindly communicate to her we would like to do things together like our agreed plan.

So we go to Dave and busters and it's raining. We were not dressed for the storm because we didn't know we were going outside for a long period. We got completely soaked and if we knew he were going out, we would have dressed appropriately. 

At the bar, my friend doesn't have enough money to pay for everyone so basically, she forced me to pay half the check for a party we didn't agree to go to. She didn't give us any other options and no one else had money. I didn't want police to be called for a small thing so we paid for half which was 53 dollars more than I thought I was spending that day.

The next day I told her ""I had fun but in the future, I would appreciate being told in advance about going out to a party so that I can properly prepare."" She says ""I did tell you ahead of time"" and I told her ""I never agreed and you need to tell me plans ahead of time instead of changing the plans last minute and dismissing my no.""

She says I didn't speak up, gaslit her, lied, and don't take responsibility, and I told her I feel she is doing all that. I felt completely coerced and forced into situations and like I had no option to refuse in the moment without complications and problems every step of the way for me. And yes, I did very clearly tell her no from the start about going there at all. She explodes on me, ends the friendship of 20 years. She said harsh words and then blocked me.

Ok my friend is pregnant, am really not happy about it, she’s super young, already have a kid they both don’t have money and form what I see he wants the kids and big family and she’s emotionally dependent so she dose it even tough she doesn’t want kid (not saying she’s a bad mom or she doesn’t like her kids just that I don’t think if he wasn’t in the picture she would ever be a mom) BUT THAT NONE OF MY BUSINESS and I don’t want her to know what I think, it her life it her decision and I might not agree but it doesn’t matter what I think it not my life and I have no say in it 

All that said here where the problem lies I propose to her 2 different trip (before knowing she was knock up) first one 10h ride 1 week camping at pennsic a mideval reenactment event, it happening on the 1 week of August and she’s supposed to get the baby out early July, SHE STILL WANT TO COME, I don’t want a baby screaming at 6 am in a tent next to me I want to have fun and drink and sleep well thanks you very much I don’t want a new born or a vagina healing mother around me, and that selfish but 10h of car with a new born, then a week of camping FOR A NEW BORN… it like mega unsafe… I would have never suggested it if I knew she was prego 

Second trip is camping in forest, it better this one cuz it less car and it would be like 4 days not 8 but again you don’t want to do forest camping with a new born, she still want to go so am like ok maybe before you get the baby out like in early June but you don’t want to be 8 MONTHS PREGO IN THE FOREST and pregnant people freak me the fuck out what if she has a early birth are we are like 3h away from any hospital I don’t want to deliver a baby 

I suggested that we picnic instead with one of my other kid ridden friend so the kids can play together (not the new born the oldest) so we do something and thier son gets a new friend but she insisting on the camping and I don’t really know what to do

"WIBTA if I dont ""refund"" our neighbors' cat? I'd like to start with the fact that me and this neighbor dont get along, mainly because I think they're irresponsible pet owners. They have so many animals that are never fed properly.

Anyways long story short, one of our neighbors' cat (that are always outside) snuck into our backyard where our big dogs are and got killed. I think the reason it went into our backyard was because it saw me feeding our dogs. 

Our neighbor made a fuss with our other neighbors talking about how we're so irresponsible and ""how could your dogs do this to my cats, do they not have a heart?"" and now she's asking for a ""refund"" (her words not mine) for the cat.  I refused and told them its their responsibility and now they're calling our dogs ""demons"" because their own dogs get along with the cats but ours hate the cats. (main reason has to be because our dog used to be a guard dog for a food factory and his job is to hunt down rats that tries to get in the building.

My mother (currently on vacation) wants me to pay, with her money, them just to avoid conflict but I personally feel like I shouldn't have to pay for it since their cat isn't my responsibility, but at the same time I feel guilty since I feed those cats too whenever I can but this is just ridiculous, so AITA for refusing?",0.4
"AITA for being upset about my best friend sleeping with the mother of my child? I (30m) had a child when I was 18 to a girl who wasn’t my partner(29f). At the time of his conception and early after his birth I was pretty heavily involved with party drugs and the whole rave scene. So my relationship with his mother has been very similar, we have always been in touch but through both of our faults the contact has been infrequent.

I have always had contact with his mother, we are usually friendly but the is some underlying hatred between us, she blames me for being absent but I blame us both for it. 

Through all this my friend (30m) has helped me through it, while I was dealing with my addictions and subsequent depression. 

Late in 2023 he approached me and made me aware that the mother of my child was trying to contact him, I had already explained how this had made me feel uncomfortable and I had expressed my discomfort in it.

"AITA expensive bachelorette I am getting married in a few months. I had been looking at locations for my bachelorette for a few weeks before deciding on Portugal (I live in a colder place so wanted some sun).

Before booking or deciding something final, we told everyone what the price range would be for flights + hotel. Everyone agreed and we continued with booking the flights. When we were posting the options for the hotels, 1 friend messaged me privately expressing concerns that the trip is getting more expensive everytime we have to book something, and asking if we can book something less fancy.
I assured her that it would still be within the original budget (lower end of the range), but I would ask the other girls if they would mind something less fancy or further away. I also offered to pay a part of her share since I really want her there and I do not want her to spend more money than she is comfortable with. She did not want me to pay for her.

I asked the girls and the majority really wanted a specific hotel (this is what I wanted as well). So I told her that the majority didn't want to change and I did not find any cheaper similar alternatives. I asked if she found a hotel we could send the group, and that I would still pay a part for her if she feels uncomfortable with the budget. I just want everyone to feel comfortable with the trip and enjoy themselves.

She pretty rudely answered to do what I want and she would just pay what she owes.

I feel like I tried all options to make sure everyone is content, but I know she's not happy with this decision at all. I don't want this to come between us. I don't know what else I can do.

AITA?

EDIT
I justed wanted to clear some things up.

- I did not pressure anyone into this destination trip. I asked all the girls separately if they were comfortable traveling for my bachelorette. Everyone agreed, if anyone had said no, I wouldn't have started planning a destination trip. The friend in question even proposed Spain, which is around the same distance/cost as Portugal for us (Portugal is 3 hours by plane).
I also proposed a place by car, but she also wanted some place sunny, so that's how we decided on Portugal.
- We also started planning 1,5 years ago, I asked then if they could take 2 vacation days (we are going from Friday until Monday) and they all agreed. We only started booking a few weeks ago because of personal reasons. So before booking, I asked again if everyone was still comfortable with traveling and the proposed budget.
- We did not discuss the cost 1,5 years ago, but when I started research a few months ago, plane tickets and hotels came to about 300-350 euro. I asked if everyone was comfortable, and only then booked the flights. So everyone was aware that the budget was specifically for plane and hotel. I would never just book everything and expect everyone to pay up.
- I'm also not a party animal at all. I don't even drink. I justed wanted a trip where we could relax and enjoy the sun. Everyone is aware of this. So there will be no extravagant fees during the trip. Just some food and drinks (I even proposed to cook in the hotel/house so we can cut on costs).

I hope this clears some things up.

"AITA for leaving my friend behind when he was completely out of his mind on spice? Okay, this is an old story I was to my girlfriend the other day and we disagree about who the asshole was. So, to settle our score, I’m appealing to the crowd.   
  
  
In 2011(I was 16 at the time), I was meeting up with 2 friends, Jim and Fred. We met at Jim’s girlfriend’s house, Kim, and she had a friend with her named Gab. Kim lived in a neighborhood that was adjacent to a park. It was fall so it got dark early enough that we all had planned to sneak out of the house and walk over to the park to smoke weed. Now, at this time, something I knew as ‘spice’ was new and getting popular. Mostly because smoke shops and gas stations would sell it over the counter to practically anyone. To us at the time it was just ‘legal weed’. Fred was a bit of a wild card and was known to enjoy his vices in excess. Fred was excited because he had gotten his hands on a package of what I remember being called ‘Dr. Feel Good’. I had my weed with me and had brought along a steamroller. It’s essentially a waterless bong and could deliver some potent hits. So, we made our way over to the park.

 It must have been 9pm and we knew we had the park to ourselves, so we settled into a picnic table at a pavilion. Gab, Jim, Kim and I were just chatting and catching up while Fred quickly pulled out his spice and immediately packed my steamroller with it. I remember he starting pulling a hit on the piece, completely filling the chamber of the steamroller, and inhaling it. He exhaled and started to take another massive hit. Then, somebody shouted that a car was coming. We saw headlights coming up the only road into the park, heading directly towards the pavilion. I remember everyone frantically grabbing their stuff and running towards the tree line. We didn’t get far from where we were when I realized Fred was not running with us.

 The rest of the group kept running when I crouched down in the darkness and turned back to see where Fred was. He was face down at the picnic table. The car had parked and I could see someone left the car and was trying to talk to Fred. Fred started incoherently yelling at the top of his lungs. I could only make out a few words like ‘leave me alone’ and ‘where am I’. I stayed there in the darkness of the field just watching, trying to feel things out. It wasn’t more than 5 minutes when a cop car and an ambulance arrived. They took him away and I waited a bit before I went back to the table. To my horror, the picnic table was covered in vomit and I could see smear marks where Fred seemed to have been trying to swim through it.

Fred was taken to the hospital. He ended up being fine but my girlfriend tells me that I was a dick for leaving him. In my mind, Fred was incapacitated and there was nothing I could have done short of picking him up over my shoulder. She thinks I should have gone back and explained the situation and I should have gone with my friend to the hospital as to not leave him alone and scared when he came to. So.... AITA?? ",0.2
"AITA for calling my dad an AH and threatening to cut him off for his comment to my little sister? I’m 23F. My dad has fat shamed me my whole life. His words used to hurt me a lot as a kid and a teenage girl, and they never once encouraged me to lose weight (ironically, they made me turn to food even more for comfort).

I have a little sister. She’s 10 years old. I don’t live at home anymore, so I don’t know if my dad has ever mentioned weight to her unless he was making a comment about me in front of her.

I was visiting for a bit (I only regularly visit for my little sister, if it wasn’t for her I’d never go to that house ever again lmao) and we were watching a movie together. My sister was sitting in between my dad and I on the sofa. A little bit into the movie, while we were eating some small snacks, he randomly put his hand on my sister’s thigh and said some stupid sh*t, along the lines of, “see that jiggle? you need to start watching what you eat, sweetheart.”

I wanted to throw something at him. I was so unbelievably mad. It’s one thing for him to say shit like that to Me, a grown adult who is used to his comments and jabs and has formed somewhat of a force field against them in all the years he’s done this to me. But to my little sister? A 10 year old girl???

My little sister didn’t say anything, but I could see by the look on her face that she felt awful and uncomfortable. It made me wonder if he has said things like this to her in my absence. I know that feeling all too well, and it’s 10x worse when you’re a little kid with little to no concept of weight and fatness and diet culture. Some of my core childhood memories are his weight-related comments to me. All I could think was “how dare he say that to her? how dare he try to plant these insecurities in her at such a young age? how dare he do to her what he did to me?”

I waited until later when we were alone and my little sister was upstairs in her room and I just blew up at my dad, called him an asshole and a piece of shit for his little comment to my sister, told him he should be ashamed of himself for trying to destroy my sister’s self esteem and self worth the way he destroyed mine. I told him that the only reason I haven’t completely cut him off is because of my little sister, but now I will not hesitate to cut him off and instead resort to spending time with my sister outside of his home, without seeing him ever.

He called me disrespectful, a disgrace, a “poor excuse for a daughter who dares to speak to her father in this way” etc etc etc but I was too angry to care at that moment. I just left to go back to my own apartment.

It’s been a day and a half. I’ve been bombarded with messages from my mother, aunts and cousins etc all telling me that dad informed them of what happened and that I should really apologise for how awful I was. I’d appreciate outside opinions. Did I overreact? Was my reaction warranted or over the top? Was there a better way to address it and AITA here.",0.11
AITA for being butthurt about my gf's new tattoo I (29M) and my GF(30) has been dating for a bit over a year now. She has a tattoo of her BD's name(in hebrew) on her pelvic area which was ok yea I get it we all make stupid mistakes. So when we first started dating she said she'll get it covered next time when she has the time and money. Fast forward to today she booked an appointment to finish her sleeves. Which ofc pretty expensive. She really loved it and happy about it. But I on the other hand just don't seem to be happy about it. I love seeing her happy but I couldn't get with this one. I tried to throw subtle jokes about her getting the name covered instead but it all fell on deaf ears or an eye roll cause in her defense she barely sees it anymore and forgets it's there. But I do. Everytime. AITA for lowkey holding a grudge about her not prioritizing a simple cover up over an expensive sleeve piece? I never told her to get it covered asap or soon. Cause I know money is tough rn and plus she is immuno compromised so getting a tattoo alone is scary. She is an avid fan of AITA so if you see this I love you and I'm just ranting.,0.62
"AITA for being upset at my friend Before I actually talk about what happened, this subreddit won't allow the mention of certain stuff because apparently that stuff is way to sensitive for people. If you want to know more to decide for yourself if I am the a-hole, message me to know what exactly happened. Now, onto the actually story, which is going to be as best censored as possible.

There was this one girl at school I liked, and I needed advice on how to get close to her, so I went to one of my friends who's an expert at relationship stuff. When he found out who this girl was, he informed me she was a senior. I'm a freshman. I am strictly against seniors and freshman dating, which made me miserable knowing I couldn't be with this girl. Last week, I was at a youth center here in town and decided to talk to one of my friends who works there. After explaining that I wanted to remove myself from everything, she fold me it's not funny to joke a out that, even though I wasn't joking. I was so upset I walked away and didn't say another word. I then had an emotional conversation with someone who actually understood what I was going through.

Now come in the part where I feel like I'm overreacting. Since the pandemic, I've felt with depression and anxiety, and a whole lot of issues. Lately I've had to deal with loneliness and trust issues. Oh, and not to mention that I'm autistic, which definitely contributes to my daily issues with dealing with people who hate autistic people. But anyways, I felt devastated having my emotions dismissed as unfunny jokes. However, there's this little voice that tells me others suffer more so I don't matter, that I'm overreacting and that I'm an attention whore. So with all of this in mind, I feel like I'm overreacting and turning a small issue into a big deal. AITA?",0.55
"AITA for flying 2000 miles to see my dad and then going somewhere else 2023 was the worst year of my life. So I (F21) was returning home after 2 years away. Instead of heading straight home I thought I’d land somewhere near my dad (M63) and visit him as I hadn’t seen him in over 5 years. He agreed that I would fly into the closest airport. And he would come pick me up. I was flying spirit so the closest airport was an hour away from him. 
I checked in periodically to make sure that was still the plan. 
Meer hours before I fly out he messages me “how are you going to get here” confused I reply “you were picking me up from the airport” and he says “I don’t feel like it”. 
After I have a minute to relax I reply “I cannot change my flight now. If you do not get me from the airport I will be stuck as I do not have the money to get an Uber there right now.” He replies “ok” 
I get on my flight. Land a few hours later and sit in the airport. I messaged my father saying “I am here I’ve landed” he replies “cool. You figure out how to get here?” 
Instead of losing my shit in an airport I call my mom explain the situation to her and she and her best friend and drive 4 hours to get me. And I don’t tell my dad. 
Days later my dad calls me and says that he was looking forward to seeing me and how rude it is to say I’m going to do something and then not do it. To get someone’s hopes up. It’s been a couple weeks and he barely talks to me now ignoring my calls and messages.",0.08
"WIBTA for selling a watch my dad gifted me for Christmas? This will be my first post on AITA. I (24 F) was gifted a watch from my dad for Christmas that belonged to my step-mom, so I guess you could say it's been passed down. This isn't just some old dusty watch though, Its a high end luxury watch that is worth a pretty penny. The problem is that I don't wear watches. I never have in my 24 years alive. I appreciate the sentiment, but it really has no value to me and I want to resell it...

I want to start school in April and I'm very committed to paying it myself. If I resold this watch, the money would go towards that and the rest in savings. I'm just worried because my dad would expect me to be wearing the watch to dinner and such, but like like I said I just never wear watches. WIBTA if I resold this watch to help me with school?

EDIT: My step-mother is very much still alive. I didn’t include more about her, but me and her have had a strained and abusive relationship since she came into the picture when I was 2. I’m pretty sure she didn’t want the watch anymore because dad gave her a brand new one, and so it got gifted to me.

"AITA for telling my friend (and roommate) that if she doesn't have time to clean the house and pick up after herself, maybe she shouldn't be doing so many activities. Context: So I have been living with my roommate, let's call her A, for nearly five years. While we've had your typical roomie disputes, all in all, I've loved living with her. They are my best friends, and our mission is to treat each other like family.   
  
Now, I've always carried the bulk of the household chores because I WFH and have a generally relaxed job where I can get up and do things while working. Plus, I LOVE to cook and clean.  However, at times, it can feel like I'm a parent picking up after my kid. A isn't comfortable cooking - that's fine; I love cooking and sharing food. What bothers me is having to pick up all of her crap out of the common rooms. I've had several meetings with her over the last few years about how I understand that we have different levels of cleaning, but I would appreciate it if she could, at the very least, keep the common areas clean. It's not like I'm going to go into her room and demand she clean up, but at the very least, the couch should be clear, and I should have space on the dining table to eat a meal.  Anytime I've brought this up, she's always agreed to do better, and things got better for a few months until I had to bring it up again.   
  
I noticed it was time to bring up the discussion again because things had started to become extremely messy around the house. However, A came to me a few days ago and said she hasn't been able to do her share household chores because she's ""too busy."" For some added context, she is currently in graduate school while also working a part-time job, and she also volunteers at a local theater group to help direct some of their shows. Her schedule is absolutely packed. I honestly don't know how she has the time even to breathe.   
  
After discussing this issue in more detail with her, I learned that it stems mostly from her aversion to doing the dishes. For whatever reason, that task is just too much for her. I understand a bit; our house doesn't have a dishwasher, so we must handwash dishes daily. (The dishes really aren't a big deal; they take maybe 15 minutes, but I can understand having an aversion to them.) I told her that it was just not really fair for me to cook for her, clean up after her, and essentially be her live-in maid and that I expected if she wasn't going to do the dishes a couple of times a week that, she should at least take on a bit extra of any other chores.   
  
She agreed to take on other chores to make up for it, but I still have doubts. So I told her, ""If you don't have time to do 10 minutes of chores every day, maybe you shouldn't be doing so many activities."" She didn't really have a response to me, so we both agreed that we were feeling frustrated and decided to circle back on this conversation after a few days.   
  
At this point, I'm at a loss for what to do. I sincerely doubt that she's truly going to get better because she doesn't give herself enough time in the day to do the most basic chores.",0.02
"WIBTA for not paying my house sitters? Throwaway so it’s not linked to my main. 

I went back to my parents house to handle some family affairs for a month and had a nice couple, we’ll call them B and A, watch my house and plants. I live in a cold climate so I explained to B and A that the house needs to be lived in and heat turned on regularly (tiny home with a pellet stove as only heat source) in order for it not to freeze. I’m on well water so I can’t leave the faucet running as others do to prevent freezing. 

The agreement was that they would stay in the house and were given full access to everything, including my new  car to drive. About a quarter of the way through my trip I get a message that they had just gotten back to the house and that the water won’t turn on- pipes were frozen. Come to find out that they hadn’t actually been staying at the house so the heat hadn’t been on for who knows how many days. Of course multiple pipes had burst- I am still waiting to find out the extent of the damage but have already purchased one expensive replacement part.  

A week later, the car ‘dies’. I am told that the battery died from the cold and it needs a new one. A new car with a new battery… I have never had a problem with the car battery in cold weather, including colder temps than what they saw while I was gone. Not being able to troubleshoot anything from afar, I bought a new battery.  

My plants are ruined. I had about 40 houseplants that I have had for years, all frozen and dead. Not a huge monetary loss there, but a sentimental one for sure. 

I am really upset to have trusted these people with my home only to return to this devastation, not to mention the added stress while I was away.

"AITA for calling CPS on my mom? 
Hi, I’m 19 F who is in the process of making a CPS investigation against my mom because she has not had my younger sister, 17 F, in school for about two years now since I left for college.

I was having a discussion with my youngest sister, 13 F, who was complaining that she was missing a lot of school due to my mom making up random reasons not to take her every day. According to the last time we talked, my mom didn’t take my sister to school for a few days because “she annoyed her and didn’t want to be in the same car”. 

It was at this moment that I asked about how my 17 Y/O sister’s school journey was going and thats when my youngest sister told me she had not been in school for almost 2 years!

I had my suspicions my sister was not in school because she would never want to talk about school and sometimes when I’d visit home, she’d be there no matter what day of the week or time. My mom previously put her in public school but because she did most of her middle school years online during COVID, my mom “put her back” online in the middle of the school year. I don’t think she has completed any classes and earned credit.

When I heard about this, I immediately contacted my oldest sister, 30 F, who confirmed that she had not been in school. I was extremely upset so my sister joked, “You’re not going to call CPS, are you?” and I told her I might as well.

Within 20 minutes, her boyfriend and other family members texting me and telling me “I know better than to put white people in family business” (We’re African-American) and my 17 YO sister, who again had been out of school, texted me saying to stay out of her business.

In the midst of this, my youngest sister (13) was berated by my oldest (30) for telling me what’s been going on and my mom has blocked me and cried to multiple family members about how I was being evil and didn’t know what’s been going on behind the scenes since I left. I understand my mom may be going through a tough time but I feel that as a parent and as an adult period, she would want her child to be in school. And for all of the adults to know about this and not have done anything is super frustrating. Am I really the asshole?",0.05
"AITA for refusing to cook for my adult daughter because she is too picky and doesn't appreciate my cooking? I (53M) love to cook. There will be days where I slave away in the kitchen all day to make a big meal, and I will do it happily. My wife (50F) can cook when I'm not around but honestly I can't think of any time when she has made anything because I always want to do it, and that's fine by me as long as I feel appreciated for it. 

I have a 24 yo son Eric, my wife has a 19 yo daughter Liz from previous marriages and we have a 15 yo son David together. Eric lives with us for now to save up money while he works but still pays rent. He will eat literally anything with the exception of hating blue cheese. David likes pretty much everything but is allergic to eggs. I can work around these constraints pretty easily when I cook. 

Liz is a different story. She has always been kind of picky with the foods she dislikes but it has gotten way worse. She went to college for a semester and then dropped out so now she is living at home, and while she was away, she developed some terrible pickiness. she has had stints of being a vegan, being vegetarian, being grain-free, pasta-free, oil-free, etc. but she isn't consistent about it. I try to help meet her needs but on any given day, she has something new to complain about with a food I want to cook. Sometimes she and I will debate for hours about what to make with me basically saying tell me what you want for dinner that will work for you and I will cook it, so long as it meets the other kids' restrictions, and she is so unhelpful with this.

Two nights ago, I cooked a dish that Liz told me looked good in a book. We all sat down for dinner and everybody loved it except Liz. She complained that she didn't realize there were peanuts in the recipe, and peanuts are so unhealthy for us so she doesn't think she can eat it and can I make her something else. I was fed up and told her ""no, you can eat this or you will eat nothing. I am done having to deal with your pickiness and criticism of my cooking. I will no longer be taking any of your feedback on what you want for dinner and will be cooking what everybody else wants. You can either eat that or cook yourself something else."" She started crying and said that I take the other kids' restrictions on what to eat so why can't I do the same for her. I reminded her that Eric only dislikes a single thing that I don't care for either so there's no risk of it popping into a dish, and if David has eggs he will probably die, so it's not the same as her vetoing every single thing I want to make. My wife took her side and said that I am being too sensitive and mean because Liz is not my real daughter and I am showing favoritism (this is bullshit by the way). I told my wife that she can cook Liz meals if she wants (as if) but I'm not going out of my way to meet her needs. AITA?",0.09
"WIBTA if I asked the cinema for a refund when someone next to me had a medical emergency? Title says most of it but I'll explain more below. First things first let me be very clear that ***I do NOT blame the woman for having a medical emergency and I don't blame the cinema for how they handled it!***

Sorry for the very lengthy title but basically, I was at the cinema with a friend and, about 20 minutes in, a middle-aged woman a few seats over from me on my right began to not feel very well. I could tell this because she was holding a hand on her chest and seemed to be struggling to breathe. The 20-something girl she was with went to get a staff member. The staff member tried to be as quiet as possible as to not disturb anyone else in the room but was still audible and, as we could still hear her (the staff member) for the 15-20 minutes she was there, it made the movie much harder to focus on. There was also an emotional scene in the movie which I just couldn't feel anything for because there was too much going on next to me. After about 20 minutes, the staff member, and the girl, helped the middle-aged woman out of the room (and presumably to a first aid room or somewhere whilst they waited for an ambulance).

I did not ask for a refund. I did not ask them to quieten down (because that would not only be asshole behaviour; that'd just be vile and I would never do that!). I ended up just doing my best to block them out and focus, and then left after it ended without complaining.

I was just curious though: if I did ask for a refund, would I be the asshole?

**Hear me out:** to reiterate, I don't blame the woman or the cinema. They tried to be quiet and with medical emergencies that's really not anyone's fault. With that said, my viewing experience of the movie was definitely interrupted and it ruined a chunk of the movie for me, including a few important scenes.

"AITA for being “controlling” I put controlling in quotes due to not know how to title this and I’m sort of sitting on the fence with this.

My partner has a friend she’s known about a year or two longer than I’ve known her. Overall he seems like a nice guy however he makes me uncomfortable. Before her and I got together they used to flirt with each other yet she classes him to be like a sibling to her? Within the first month of us dating I watched her sit on his lap and when I have mentioned this to her she said “ we had only been together a month” acting as if the timeframe matters? I feel as if, if I were letting a woman be really touchy with me and sitting on me that she wouldn’t have been happy with this at all? Her mum also would make strange comments about how her and him should date and have children get married ect which also made me uncomfortable due to the fact she made these comments in front of me and if I’m honest I’m not entirely sure if they were jokes or not. She has also stated that she would never block him due to the fact that I wouldn’t actually be with her if it wasn’t for him basically claiming he had saved her? She said she would leave me for him anytime basically saying he was more important to her than I was or ever will be. I was wondering if I was the asshole because I did basically ask her to block him because of how uncomfortable it makes me. And she called me controlling. If you agree that I am the asshole, would you be able to explain why?",0.8
"AITA for planning an inclusive family dinner to celebrate sibling's birthday Throwaway as they lurk around here. Also made it gender neutral to give more anonymity.

My sibling's (S1) birthday was two weeks away and I thought it would be a great idea to bring our whole family together to celebrate. Our whole family includes my partner and I, my other sibling (S2) and their partner and kids, cousins and their kids and our parents. I choose a restaurant that S1 and I have been to and have enjoyed, that it also meets some dietary restrictions that S2 and our cousin's kids' have, and overall it's a new restaurant that I thought everyone would enjoy.

When planning I asked S1 what they wanted to do. At that time, S1 was very busy with work and when I suggested this restaurant, they merely brushed it off but did not say no. Okay. So I made a reservation, added it to our family calendar and it was all set. 

Throughout the two weeks, we reminded S1 that we will be celebrating their bday at this restaurant. S1 even asked why it's on the calendar. We provided the same response and S1 didn't object. 

The day before the dinner, S1 abruptly cancel everything. Didn't even want to change venues. Just nothing. S1 messaged me privately saying ""why the f*** are we going here"".

Again, I reiterated the above: good food, family hasn't tried it and think they will enjoy it and the diet restrictions. 

S1 response to me:
- In choosing the restaurant, I didn't consider where they wanted to go.

- It was not what they wanted. The restaurant was decent but would never have picked it. Mentioned their friends would have chosen better.

- My attempt to accommodate everyone was meant to make others enjoyable rather than them. 

- Other restaurants can accommodate diets and is not a good reason to chose one specifically for it. Said they won't fall for this excuse.

- Felt their opinion was ignored and that they should be allowed to pick the place.

This isn't the first time something like this has happened; it was a common occurrence throughout our lives. I thought this time was different. 

I assumed I was being thoughtful and helping S1 plan since they were busy, all the while thinking about our family.

S1 didn't object at all up until now. In fact, S1 previously said they would recommend the restaurant and thought it's a nice place for dates. 

Now S1 is blaming me for ruining their birthday. AITA?

"AITA For Expecting Reimbursement After Fronting Shopping Costs for In-Laws? My wife and I were in a long-distance marriage temporarily, and she visited me in November. During her visit, we spent a whole day acting as personal shoppers for her sister and brother-in-law, who were in a different country 5,000 miles away. Since I was the only one with a local currency card, I ended up paying approximately $500 for their shopping, expecting to be reimbursed later.

I've always believed in the importance of promptly repaying someone who buys something for you, as it's a matter of financial etiquette. It's been 2 months, and I haven't seen the money returned to me. My wife used part of it as credit to settle expenses her sister financed during her recent visit to her home country, and she intends to transfer the remaining $250 to me once the exchange rate is more favorable.

While I earn over $100,000 and the amount isn't a huge issue financially, it's the principle that matters to me. I expected her sister and brother-in-law, who are high earners, to display the same level of financial etiquette I've practiced in the past. This situation has made me feel taken advantage of, and I've grown distant from my wife and her family as a result.

Additionally, I'm considering whether I'm in the wrong for keeping our finances separate, even though I earn more and have higher expenses. Is it essential to have complete financial transparency in a marriage? This situation has been bothering me to the point where it's affecting my sleep and my desire to communicate with my wife and her family. AITA for feeling this way?""

"AITA for not defending my husband? Hello. To keep the story short, I was chatting at work with a colleague and she noticed some scratches on my wrist. 
I told her it's from my cat - she is very nice and loving, she likes to climb on furniture and sometimes I help her down by letting her jump on my back when she is done exploring. this time, i decided for whatever reason to reach my arms out (like a baby) and she jumped on my hand and slipped, scratching my wrist - my colleague said that she heard from me that my cat is never aggresive and asked if I am sure about it. After I told her it is really my cat who scratched me, she said okay and we continued chatting. 
Next day, the HR called me to the office and empathically explained different ways of dealing with domestic violence. I told the HR this is not the case, but she said that sometimes women feel shame and guilt and don't want to admit. I told her again this is not the case and then I was let go back to my desk.
After getting home I told my husband about this situation and that I appreciate my colleague's concern even though it was really nothing of what she might have imagined. He kept asking me what did I say to the HR and was disappointed that I only said ""this is not the case"". He said that by not elaborating on our relationship I might have given the impression that I am indeed in a domestic violence situation and that I was too afraid of speaking up. 
He then asked me if I noticed my colleagues looking differently at me since this whole thing, and I admitted that they seem to give long glances at me now that he mentioned it, though I might be wrong. He told me this is serious and I should clear things up at work. I feel like this is unnecessary and I don't worry myself much about my colleagues, but he says this makes him feel uneasy.

"AITA for letting the electricity get turned off My husband and I just got married. I've been trying to discuss finances with him for months and he just says we should pay our own bills and he'll do what he can for the household. This usually leaves me with the bulk. Last month was our 1st month discussing finances and putting a plan in place. We did it successfully. We were supposed to discuss February's finances 2 weeks ago. He keeps putting me off while paying his bills but not the household. Our money is very tight and he has a problem combining finances and tackling them together. He pays his bills and ""does what he can"" for our household and zero regard for my bills. I believe we should take care of each other and have a plan so neither of us suffer. In any case all of our household bills are due and he won't even talk about it.

"AITA ? My boss supports freeloaders So at my job there are about 40 employees.  At lunchbreak we get delivered food, but you have to sign up for it, and pay.  It's very cheap and its a nice meal.  We even get to choose from a menu so everyone can have a meal that suits their tastes.

Anyway, some of the workers choose not to partake in this meal program, a small minority, and thats all good.  So the workplace gets maybe about 30-35 meals delivered each workday.  So far so good.

At any given workday, there might be one or two workers, who have ordered and paid for a meal, that are absent for whatever reason.  Now is where the problem arises, the leftover meals. 

Is it fair that a worker who never pays for this meal service, comes into the cafeteria and looks at the list of workers and what they ordered and just grabs a meal of one of the absentees? Every day!?

I mentioned this to my boss and he was apalled that I would rather want the food to go to waste than somebody eating it, even if they didnt pay for it.  What the hell do I care what happens to the food?  I think its unfair that Im paying for a meal while a co-worker doesnt.  You dont pay for the service you get no service is my opinion.

"AITA for offering to get me (20 M) and my boyfriend (17 M) drunk all the time when I turn 21? Note: Title isn’t an error, both of us are men. 

Me and my boyfriend were talking in my room at 2 AM. I thought my sister was fast asleep downstairs (mom doesn’t live here, dad was on a business trip). My dad sleeps upstairs so if I knew he was up, I wouldn’t have felt comfortable talking about it.

Turns out my sister was up, and went to get her laundry (which is upstairs) and she overheard us talking and decided to eavesdrop.

Basically me and my boyfriend were pumped about the idea of me offering us alcohol and getting drunk, and my sister knocked on the door and said “what the hell” and lectured me off about how I shouldn’t offer my younger boyfriend alcohol and I said it’s none of her business and she said it’s illegal and if something happens I could go to jail, and either way he shouldn’t be drinking underage, and I shouldn’t be encouraging it or something.

I told her to fuck off, and she said she would tell my parents and I said she has no proof and they won’t believe her. And that we simply won’t talk about it again when we are in any place where she could be around. We argued for a bit about it.

"AITA for telling my sister to shut the fuck up about how my uncle feels about his wife (our aunt) My sister (26F) and I (23M) are pretty close with our uncle, he lives in the states, while we are in canada. We dont see him that often but we have a good relationship.

About 10 years ago, his wife developed some sort of psychosis, bipolar disorder, and severe depression. I am still not really sure what it is exactly because the family and my uncle dont like to talk about it. She has always been a bit odd, and really shy.

I had seen it firsthand one time when I visited when I was like 14 or 15. One day I was over at his place and my uncle was sitting reading a book, and my aunt was looking out the window and just started crying. He asked her what was wrong and she said that there were 2 birds sitting on a tree and one of them left.

He asked her why that bothered her and she literally just exploded, screaming and wailing saying that one day he will leave her and she started jumping up and down and not even speaking english at that point, it was terrifying.

My uncle came to visit us this week. Apparently shes doing a lot better now (I say that relatively compared to what Ive seen).

I had a deep conversation with my uncle and my sister, he went into a little more depth about his relationship, and then he confided in us that he honestly does not love her anymore, he says he feels like he wasted his life trying to ""fix"" her because she has always been kind of messed up. He says he stays with her because he doesnt know where she would go or what she would do.

I respect his honesty, and I respect that he cares enough to stay by her knowing that she'd probably go into full blown insanity if he did decide to abandon her.

He told me to be wary of trying to stay in a relationship where you are constantly trying to fix or improve things, etc.

My sister scoffed at him saying these things saying he made his choices and this is the consequences of his actions. She then said that a relationship is supposed to be about working past issues and flaws blah blah blah.

I told her to chill out and she said his life is not a tale of tragedy, its a tale of consequences.

I told her to shut the fuck up because it doesnt fucking matter, the point is hes being honest with us and hes being vunerable.

"AITA for not cooking while babysitting? My brother (M33) and his wife (F31) work for the same company and had to go on a 5 day business trip. Their babysitter cot covid, so they asked me (M26) to babysit their son (M7). I babysat my nephew before like when he was freshly born and they wanted to go on a date night so I agreed. They dropped him off at my apartment and told me to text/call them if I had questions or something happened. Then they left.
At first I was a bit overwhelmed and scared that I would do something wrong, but my nephew was really low maintenance. He likes reading so I downloaded some books for him on my IPad. Iʼm not good at cooking and I donʼt cook for myself, I either eat takeout, make myself a salad or a sandwich. I also donʼt know what kids like to eat, so whenever my nephew was hungry, I made him a sandwich. I offered to share my takeout with him, but I always order spicy indian food and he doesnʼt like it so he just ate a sandwich. I offered multiple sandwich toppings like cheese, cream cheese, peanut butter, etc. so itʼs not like I made him eat the same sandwich over and over again. 

Last friday my brother and his wife came to pick up my nephew. When they asked him if he liked staying with his uncle, he said it was “cool, except for the food” then he told them that I always made him sandwiches for breakfast, lunch and dinner. They pulled me aside and asked me if it was true, when I said yes, they got mad and acted like I neglected their child. Itʼs important to mention that they did NOT ask me to cook, they didnʼt give me a list with his favorite meals either and just assumed that I would cook a fresh meal every day. Since then my brother has been ignoring me. We usually text at least once a day, but nothing. I called him today and he was still annoyed and mad at me. He called me selfish and irresponsible too. I get that cooking would have been better, but itʼs not like I didn’t feed my nephew. I provided him with food and he was never hungry. Do yʼall think Iʼm the asshole or not?",0.85
"AITA?? I wont let my son meet his dying great grandma AITA?
My sons a baby lets start there. Hes 4 months old. My inlaws have met him they came over to our home a few times to meet him. I have no issue with family meeting him. Familys family. I however dont like my inlaws. They speak english very well but they make it a habit to not speak to me and never speak english at all when im around. I personally find that rude because i have asked them first to teach me, they wont. So ive asked them to speak english a little more when im around.. yea no they just dont like me is what ive gathered. I dont like them but thats my sons family. And im sure he will learn Gujrati as he grows up.

Well my boyfriends grandma is 80 years old and just came from India & wants to meet my son. I love that they love my son. I want her to meet him. But i will not go to their home and theres many reasons why:
1. Its a 2 hour drive
2. Their house is HOT. 76°
3. They are expecting us to co-sleep with our 4 month old son (he sleeps in his crib, too tall for a bassinet)
4. My boyfriends sister is LOUD. She yells to speak & when i would stay there while i was pregnant she would wake me up from yelling (shes 21)
5. Our lease is up in less than a month & havent found the apartment we want to sign a lease to yet, the only time we get to look at apartments is on Saturdays (3 more Saturdays left if u include this one they want us to come)
6. She's not on life support shes just 80 & getting old as dust
7. They can come here
8. I personally will be miserable out of my mind

They ""need"" us to visit before March because they are leaving to Australia for vacation. My lease ends March 1st and we have yet to lock down a place. My bf (28m) works monday-friday so we can only look at places saturdays because leasing offices are closed on sundays.

They can invest $200 for a crib & turn their AC at a reasonable temperature. Those are the 2 factors that are non negotiable for us. My sons life is not worth risking over meeting someone he wont remember, in sorry but its true.

On Sat I picked up my cousin and his gf from their Airbnb. They are from the south and never skied before. I live an hour from one of the best ski resorts in the US and I’m a pretty good skier so I invited them to come skiing. They had been on bunny hills the previous year but otherwise no other experience. I didn’t check that they had helmets. I told them to go to a ski rental place where it’s cheaper than at the resort to get skis, poles, boots, ski pants and a helmet. 

My bf came in his car and we got to the ski resort and there I noticed they didn’t have ski pants and a helmet. I told them they would be miserable without ski pants and they were also missing a helmet. The ski rental place on the slopes had a helmet but no ski pants. His gf wanted to wear leggings skiing which I told them would be a terrible idea but they ignored me and told me they didn’t want to wear helmet either. I told them I wasn’t going to be taking them without a helmet and they argued it was their choice. Turns out they wanted to take photos and thought helmets made them look dorky. They also before coming here said they were scared that skiing was dangerous and I had to assure them we wouldn’t be doing anything dangerous. So how can they be worried for their safety but refuse to wear a helmet?! 

I told them to stay at the resort and rent out some snowshoes or cx skiing as there was also some other things to do and my bf and I would be skiing. They argued with me for nearly an hour that I couldn’t control what they did and they paid for the rentals so they should be allowed to ski.

The relationship lasted 3 years and it was a lot of pushing me to do things that only she wanted to do. Like, giving my first kiss was so awkward and pushed.

My best friend at the time became super close to my ex and I couldn't tell him what happened, I just told my psychologist and nobody else.

"AITA for eating the food my FIL served me and “ruining” my boyfriend and I’s holiday.   
Background info: I (M 41) am a white American, and my boyfriend (M 38) is Moroccan and half black. His parents took a dislike to me the moment we met. We’ve been together for two years, and he lives in America. The incident in question took place a few days ago. This is only my second time meeting his parents. His mother has been relatively quiet, but it’s obvious she feels the same as his father, who is on an all out warpath.   
  
They think that I’m a typical, useless, American party boy and not good enough for their son, who is an all around goodie-two-shoes. They are wealthy government employees who think that they’re contributing a lot to the world. Unlike me. Now, it is important to note that I am also wealthy, self made, and high ranking in my career. So I am not attempting to get on any gravy train. My boyfriend and I are staying at their home in Morocco.   
  
The four of us sat down for dinner, cooked by their private chef. Everybody got a bowl of some moroccan food, that smelled really good. I noticed that mine looked paler than the others and didn’t have as much of a smell. I didn’t comment at first, but then his father outright said, as if he was doing me a favor, that he told the chef to put a portion for me aside before she added ANY of the seasoning, because he thought that “my palate wouldn’t handle the spice well”. 

I have no issues with spicy food. I could tell that my boyfriend was already uncomfortable, and he told his father that I could eat what they’re eating. I managed to keep my cool, despite being really pissed off and told him in no uncertain terms that I could handle spicy food. Next thing, he took my food and went back to the kitchen. When he returned, my food was a shade darker than everyone else’s.   
  
I realized after the first bite that it wasn’t just spicy. It was inedible. My boyfriend noticed my reaction and told his father off before telling me to stop eating it. But I didn’t. I ate the damn food. And I have never in my life eaten anything like it. There must have been an entire bottle of hell in it. The pain. But I persevered, much to my boyfriends protests. His father simply watched. I was sweating buckets, felt sick, almost had an asthma attack (Another reason that my boyfriend was angry with me, because I put myself at risk) but I ate the whole bowl. Then I left the table victorious, but dying a death.   
  
Fast forward, I’ve been in bed for three days, still feel messed up, may not survive. My boyfriend says I should have been the bigger person and that there were no winners, that eating the whole bowl was as childish as his father was for serving it, and harmed only me. He’s been taking care of me, but he’s also blaming me.   
  
I don’t think I was the asshole, even if the last three days of our vacation have gone down the drain.   
  
TLDR: My boyfriends father served me inedible food to be petty, so I ate it to be petty and derailed me and my boyfriends vacation plans. And I wouldn’t change a thing. AITA?",0.5
"AITA For telling my sister i think she should stop her from going into a relationship with my friend after leaving her husband, because she is rebounding and will regret it. I updated this one and deleted my other post. 

Short story even shorter.   


Sister left her kind of abusive husband, he was great until he got drunk, and would then be a terrible husband. After 8 years she left him with their two kids.

&#x200B;

She has started to date one of my pretty close friends, a week after they broke up and i guess is rebounding hard. I have rebounded myself, and regret it, and would wish one of my freinds would have told me. 

&#x200B;

I want to tell her that she is rebounding, and that i think she should stop it, since i think it will be very awkward for me, since it is my friend and i find it uncomfortable. For god sakes it is my sister and my godsons mom...

&#x200B;

She asked me if i was OK with them seeing each other, and initially said yes, but after my own girlfriend told me that my sister is probably rebounding, i feel like i need to stop it, since my friend only want sex (he told me he wants nothing serious with my sister) and i feel that he by that way is taken advantage of my sisters recent breakup.

&#x200B;

As i also wrote, i said it was OK yesterday when she called and told me, but i want to protect my sister from making a bad decision. My sister is 6 years older than my buddy....

"AITA for telling my mom she can’t date my bf’s dad My boyfriend (30M) and I (25F) have been together for about 2.5 years. We have a great relationship and fully intend on getting married in the future. 

My mother has been divorced for around 3 years. It was very messy and long and drawn out so she didn’t even consider meeting other men until somewhat recently. She joined a couple dating apps trying to meet people and get comfortable in the dating scene again. I was and am fully supportive of this. She wasted a lot of years with a man who didn’t make her happy so I hope she can find someone who does. 

She’s previously mentioned being jealous of my relationship as my boyfriend really does seem like the perfect partner in a lot of ways. 

I don’t know what popped in her head but she recently asked to meet my boyfriend’s father (also divorced and currently single). I wasn’t super fond of the idea since it felt strange.

I tried to gently press and inquire the real reason why and she told me that clearly he did a great job raising my boyfriend so he must be a great guy as well. Knowing this was her reason I immediately said no. My boyfriend’s father isn’t on the table for her to date as she gets back in the dating pool. That’s WEIRD. She tried to justify saying she wouldn’t force anything, just wanted to see if anything would happen organically or maybe even “just have a fun few nights”. Not sure if she was implying just casual dates or sex but I didn’t want to know the answer. 

I explained that I feel like this is selfish and could open the door to complicate my relationship and open a whole can of worms I didn’t want to deal with. She said even if the best case scenario happened and they fell in love and got married, it wouldn’t matter since my boyfriend and I still wouldn’t be blood relatives so it would be fine and not incest. I disagreed that it’s still weird. 

This turned into an argument as she was saying I wasn’t being nice and I should want her to be happy and set her up with a stand-up guy. I blurted out I believed she needed therapy before she dated anyone seriously since she has issues she needs to resolve due to trauma from my dad. 

As retaliation I guess, she tried to tell me my boyfriend and I aren’t even that serious so “it’s not like he’d even be in the picture for much longer” if things did work out with her and his dad.

My siblings have said I was being an asshole for telling my mom she needs therapy and she’s right and it wouldn’t be incest. Some of my friends said I took it too seriously and she probably just wanted to “rebound” a little bit and do it with someone who might feel a bit more familiar like a “friend of a friend” type of situation and it probably wouldn’t go anywhere and I was being mean when she’s in a sensitive state. Despite that, I still feel like the whole thing is weird and don’t think I was an asshole for saying no.

So, AITA? Did I take her too seriously and be mean about it?",0.4
"AITA for telling my boyfriend about a trip I booked after I booked it I am divorced and have children from that marriage. I have been with my boyfriend for several years and we live together and went on a trip last year so he could meet my family that lives very far away. 

I booked a trip last week to visit my sister and niece who will be turning a year old while we are there. I only got tickets for myself and my kids and I got a super good price so I was very excited. I let my boyfriend know after everything was booked and he got upset that I had booked the tickets without telling him (I think it was because I didn’t invite him). We will be staying with my sister in her very small apartment with very limited sleeping spots. For the trip last year my boyfriend dragged his feet about getting his passport, getting the time off of work, and sitting with me so we could buy the plane tickets. He also hates flying and was very uncomfortable and said he wanted to book better seats (more expensive) for future trips.

My parents planned a trip for the oldest two grandkids (3/5) and did not tell anyone about it, this trip was to Disneyland for a few days. When my parents finally told me about the trip the reasoning was the other 2 kids were too young and would not remember the trip. The trip is finally coming up in the coming weeks and I had forgotten about it until I saw a facebook post so I told my wife about the trip, When my wife found out she was and still is agitated she has cut all contact with them blocked them all and said that it is not fair to our kid and regardless of age she feels they are playing favorites because a 3yo will not remember the vacation either and she thinks it is an excuse they are using to not bring all the grandkids.

My wife feels my parents are wrong for not taking all the kids. She feels if you take one of them you take all of them or do not go, my parents feel they are doing nothing wrong. I have stayed neutral as I can see both sides, but my wife feels I should be defending my family and my son as she feels this is not okay. AITA for staying neutral or should I be defending them?

"WIBTA for calling the animal control? background: the people below me moved in about a year ago, they have a small dog which is extremely noisy. the particular breed they have is known for frequent barking. the city we live in has a noise ordinance specifically stating nuisance dogs are a violation of said ordinance. after multiple texts to the owners of said dog and multiple calls to the building manager resulted in an escalation of the barking, i contacted animal control. they sent an officer out to establish a case. i just so happened to be coming out of the elevator when the officer arrived and my building manager pointed me out to him as the one who called, despite my call being an anonymous tip. the people below me then texted me and threatened to call the police the next time they heard my child make a sound in retaliation for my call. for a while, things were peaceful and the dog was no longer barking several times a day or for prolonged periods. i should note that i have adhd and autism so sounds cause me to go into sensory overload quickly/easily. in the past few days, however, the barking has started up again and i am considering calling animal control for a second time.

edit: i only called animal control once the barking became a daily occurrence AND my building manager refused to talk to the tenants. also, i read the city noise ordinance several times to make sure i was correct BEFORE i called. i’m sorry for not making that clear initially",0.18
"AITA for not helping my mom with her YouTube channel since she drove me to the hospital? A few years ago, I developed a disease. I'm not dying but it has to be managed. Last weekend, I had to go to the hospotal for a exam where they had to put me under sedative, and so, I needed someone to drive me home. My mom volunteered since she's not working right now.

About my mom, she's a hard working women who loves me very much. But she has a lot of doubt about herself and it comes out in weird ways. She recently had to close her shop for various reason and is now enoying her time off. (She work hard for many years so it's deserved.) 

But she always has projects and her latest one is to start a YouTube Channel about the squirls coming on out door step. She hasn't started the channel but she asked if I wanted to do a little animation intro for it. (I'm a freelance animator). I wasn't too keen on it since it be unpaid and I need the money right now.

As she was driving me back from my exam (Which went well btw !) I started thinking about her Channel idea. My mom is not the most creative type and she is not chonically on YouTube like I am. So I thought I could help her out a bit juste by giving her advice. And so I spoke :

""Hey Mom ! I don't think I can do any animation for your channel right now since I'm concentrading on paying contracts but-""

She cuts me.

""I took a whole day to drive you around today and I'm not asking for money.""

I was baffled. I was just about to offer her advice and she says THAT ?! I got mad. She explained that I was making her project feel unimportant since she couldn't pay me. That in a family you just help each other. She also brought the fact that she helpt me move (Yeah. 2 years ago) and that I need to help out too. 

I tried to tell her that helping me move and driving me TO THE HOSPITAL is not the same as asking me to work for free but she wouldn't hear it. I started crying. I really try not to make a big deal out of my health because I don't want to be that kind of person, but I AM SICK. And I will be for the rest of my life. Of course I am grateful for all the help and support I got from my family but I don't want it to be a transanctional thing ! I didn't have FUN at the hospital ! 

My mom left it at me being emotional after the exam and that we had a misunderstanding and we're good now because I didn't press further. But I am not satisfied with that. I want her to understand that she can't use my illness to guilt me. And this is bound to happen again so I need her to find the words to make her understand.

"AITA for telling my wife she can do all the housework by herself if she wants to set a good example for our kids? My wife (35f) and I (37m) have been together for 6 years and have two kids together (4m). We met when she was a college student in my country. We hit it off, moved in together and started our family.

Last year, we moved to my wife's country in South America because she wanted to be closer to her parents who are old. I was reluctant because I had good career in my country (80.000 euros salary per year) and I didn't think I would earn as much in her country. However, because my company found it difficult to replace me, they offered me a 2 year contract to work remotely at the same salary.

This is a very good deal because cost of living and salaries are very low in my wife's country so we are actually rich here. I decided to use some of the money I'm earning to hire domestic help to do all the cleaning and cooking in the house. The helper's salary is very low so we can easily afford it. I don't like doing housework but we had to do it ourselves in my country because help was very expensive. 

My wife is opposing this decision. She grew up poor so she had to do all the housework at home and thinks we should be doing the housework ourselves without any outside help so that our kids learn to be responsible and don't think this work is beneath them. I don't agree with her logic. Because of this helper, I can earn more money for the family and spend time with the children instead of working some nonsense job for pittance. Our children can also observe the helper and see how to do different work in the house if they need to learn.

My wife is still arguing with me and is saying we are not setting good example for the kids. I told her she can do all the work by herself if that is her main concern. I already work nightshift in my job because of time difference and I don't want to waste valuable time with my family doing extra work when we can pay someone else to do it for us for cheap. She is acting grumpy and her side of the family are calling me a lazy good for nothing for not listening to her. AITA?",0.5

"AITA for trying to force my vegan daughter to eat meat? I (42F) have been in a bit of a dilemma lately with my daughter (16F). About three years ago, she decided to go vegan after doing some research and watching some documentaries about animal cruelty and the environmental impacts of meat consumption. Initially, I supported her decision because I believed in the importance of making informed choices and respecting her beliefs.

However, lately, I've been increasingly concerned about her health. She's lost a significant amount of weight, and she looks very frail. Her energy levels have plummeted, and she's been having trouble concentrating at school. When I asked her about it, she admitted that she's been feeling weak and dizzy quite often.

Last week, after yet another conversation about her health, I told her that if she didn't start incorporating some animal products into her diet, I would stop supporting her financially. I even went as far as to cook her favorite dishes, including meat, hoping that she would eat them and start feeling better.

She was furious with me and accused me of not respecting her beliefs and trying to force her to betray her principles. She stormed off to her room and hasn't spoken to me since.

I understand that my daughter's veganism is important to her, and I don't want to undermine her values. But as her mother, I also feel responsible for ensuring that she's healthy and thriving. I feel stuck between supporting her beliefs and ensuring her well-being.",0.91
"WIBTA for preferring one niece above all my niblings? Sorry I couldn’t think of a better title but here’s a brief context. I (M38) have 3 older sisters Sara (F42), Lyla (F45) and Laura (F48), due to age differences we were not very close while growing up, nowadays we’re not best friends but aren’t hostile towards each other. All my sisters have kids (Sara has 2, Lyla has 3 and Laura has 3) but for simplicity’s sake we will only name Diane (F17) she is the middle daughter of Lyla.  
  
When I was a kid a was very overweight, which of course was the center of the pranks and name calling I received from my sisters, I won’t victimize myself, I was also horrible to them I didn’t resent them for it.  
  
Now to the problem Diane stands out from the niblings because she is the only one with weight problems. She isn’t as overweight as I was but it’s very noticeable, since I’m still working on losing weight, I empathize with her a lot.  
  
Diane get’s a lot of abuse because of her weight and of course we stop it when we see it and have talked to the other niblings to stop this behavior, but it keeps happening behind our backs, anyway this has happened for years by now.  
  
On our new year family gathering we have a tradition of exchanging letters, basically just wishing everyone good things for the new year, however one of Laura’s son gave Diane a joke letter saying something a long the lines of: “hope this year you lose weight rather than gain it”, clearly she was hurt but didn’t say anything, they scolded Laura’s son but by then some people had laughed and it felt more like a slap on the wrist to save face than an actual scolding.  
  
This infuriated me and Diane will turn 18 soon and I have some money saved up, so I figured I’d go all the way and give her a car and a vacation for her and her best friend. In the interest of honesty, I’m doing this out of spite for the resto of the niblings who I´d only gift some money and a car for their birthdates.

I’m not picky about phones, I don’t necessarily care about getting new models. I’ve been pretty satisfied with my iphone 8 plus and haven’t had any desires to upgrade.
But, recently I started noticing the zflip 5 and holy shit do I want it 
I’m aware of the issues people have with it, but its something new and interesting i wanted to try regardless 


I had full intention of purchasing it myself but I’m broke as hell so I’d need to do a payment plan of some sort
Since my phone is under my dad’s plan I asked if he would be willing to help me order it through verizon and obviously I would make the payments on it 


Something to note about my dad, while we dont always get along, he can be a very sweet guy, and he LOVES buying things for people 


Upon hearing this he initially told me no, but then said that he would just buy me an iphone 12 instead since the zflip is expensive as hell


I tried to explain to him that I intended to make payments and if that wasnt okay then i would be able to find one on ebay since i dont care about getting anything brand new 


He proceeded to tell me the zflip sucks and that i dont actually want it 


Over the next couple of weeks i kept showing him listings of used ones to get his opinion on them, basically making it really clear that that was the phone I wanted and that I intended to purchase it myself, albeit with his help at first if he would provide it 


Today he surprised me by giving me an iphone 12 


Of course I said thank you and accepted it but I’m in my room currently and I’m embarrassed to admit I’m pissed 


Of course I appreciate him getting me a new phone, its a wonderful gesture. But, I still really want to try to zflip and now I’m upset I’ll have to wait to to get one even longer than I already would have

"AITA for grounding my daughter for lying?   
My husband (45M) and I (47F) have 2 children, Madison (13F) and Boyet (11M). Both of our kids were born in and lived in the Philippines until we moved to the U.S. last summer. My husband and I are both white, my parents moved from the U.S. to the Philippines for work when I was 5, and I lived there ever since and I got my citizenship in 2008. My husband came for college, which is where we met.  
  
Madison and Boyet have always been very different, Boyet is a social butterfly, he had many friends from school and basketball and loved the Philippines, he was born with a more traditionally “white” American name, but as a toddler asked to be called Boyet and has always been known as that by friends and we are currently looking into an official name change. Madison is much more introverted and never embraced her surroundings, she was never bullied but she didn’t really like growing up there.   
  
Both of our kids are fluent in Tagalog, English and Italian. They used Tagalog and English with peers, and learned Italian from my husband’s Italian-American family.  
  
My kids now go to a private middle school in the U.S. The school is demographically plurality Asian-American and they’re learning Mandarin.  
  
Boyet has adjusted well to his new school and quickly made friends through sports and school.  
  
Madison also has made some new friends, but at a slower pace.   
  
My husband and I went to a Lunar New Year festival last weekend where a lot of the students and parents from their school were there.  
  
My husband and I were introducing ourselves to some parents and one of them asked if we missed Mississippi. We were really confused as neither of us have been there. Then, another set of parents asked us if it was hard moving from the South. We told them we weren’t from there.  
  
One of the dads told us that Madison told her daughter and other kids we were from Mississippi and even had a Southern accent. Madison was with us and quickly told us she needed to use the bathroom after he mentioned that.  
  
We asked what was going on, and found everything out. Madison had fabricated an entire story about how we were from Mississippi and left because of a tornado. She told people Boyet was adopted from the Philippines and said she only spoke English. She would go as far as mocking the things Boyet did, as well as pretending she didn’t know about other students' cultures when she did, as we have had vacations to multiple Asian countries throughout our kids' lives.   
  
When we got home, Madison argued with us, saying she just wanted to be viewed as a “normal American kid”, and that there was nothing wrong with that.  
  
We felt like she needed to be punished for her remarks about Boyet and the other kids at her school, and told her she was grounded for a week. She has said this is unfair and we “can’t force her to like different cultures”, and that a week is “ridiculous” for “a few white lies” AITA?",0.88

She LOST it and started yelling at me and saying that I said the wrong thing, I crossed a line, she had to walk away because she couldn’t be around me.

"AITA for not wanting to be recorded while I'm home alone? So I (20F) am currently living with my family in the US, my mom (50F) and my dad (47M), while I commute to college. So this all happened when my parents were out for a two week vacation, and I was home along watching our dogs, specifically a 2-3 month old puppy who couldn't be left alone for the night yet.

My dad has kept cameras in the house for a couple years now, which have used in order to check up on mainly the dogs and house while they were out. So because of this they are placed looking at couches and hallways, along with a couple around the outside of the house, pretty normal camera stuff.

So because the puppy couldn't be left alone, I was sleeping out on the couch in our living room while they were on vacation (My room wasn't puppy proof). I usually sleep without a bra or shirt on, and since there is a camera facing the living room couch/where I was sleeping, I just flipped it around so that it couldn't see me. The type of cameras that they are they can move 360 degrees, so if there was some reason they wanted to look at it, my parents could move the camera back around, but I'd have a warning before they do.

So anyways it's been a couple days into my parents trip with everything going well enough. That night though, I woke up late at night and had to go to the bathroom. After checking to make sure the dogs were okay, I start walking down the hall to go to the bathroom. Before I get to it though, I notice that a small light on the camera facing the hall turned on. Realizing that it just recorded my almost naked self, I duck back into the living room and threw on some clothing before heading back to the hall. After some testing to make sure, I realize that the motion sensor for the camera is definitely on, and there is definitely a video of my chest being sent to my dad's phone. Until that moment, I had never noticed or been told that the cameras were on a motion detecting function, and honestly I didn't even know they had that function until then.

After deciding that I was more uncomfortable about the video existing than having to talk with my dad about it, I texted him in the morning about the cameras and what happened, along with asking him if he could please turn off the motion detecting function because I am very uncomfortable with it. His response was that he wasn't going to turn off the function until I ""gave back"" the living room camera, and that he only turned it on because he couldn't see through the living room camera while I had it turned around. I responded that I wasn't comfortable with either being able to be recorded while I sleep, or while I don't know, so could he please just turn them off. His answer was still no, and he stayed strong on that until they got home.

She got annoyed at me for not dealing with it and pretty much told me off for making a big deal out of nothing, and then she dropped the bunny in the diaper trash can. Honestly I think it's really sad but maybe it's not my business, AITA for not doing it like she asked?",0.03
"AITA for calling my coworker hot? So I (F17) have a job I’ve been working at for a couple months. It’s my first job and I really enjoy it. I have been fortunate to have some great coworkers who I get along with really well. One of these coworkers we will call D(M20) now I have a giant crush on D, he is my type and he is a super chill dude and I really enjoy the times I get to work with him. Of course I would never pursue him because he is older than me and I’m not yet 18. Now another coworker of mine we will call T(F20) she is dating D. Now all of my other coworkers we don’t really like T because she is often rude and not the greatest at her job and often when I’m in the room with her I hear her talk bad about D to our other coworkers. 

Now into the story, I am in a groupchat with about 5 of my coworkers who I’m closer with(my job kinda requires the coworkers to atleast get a bit close just for things to function well) and one day they added S(F40?) now one Saturday night(we r closed on weekends) we are up chatting all of us and I brought up D, I asked how old he was and mentioned I found him attractive. (Nothing sexual, I just said he was my type) this started a short conversation that was mainly jokes and silly comments, between mainly Me, S, and A(F22) about us finding D attractive. Me and A were really just saying he was cute- while S was making strange comments about wanting to touch him inappropriately. At the time we all just kinda laughed it off because we all knew S as a strange funny woman. 

Flash forward to Monday, When I get to work I find out from another coworker that S told T (D’s girlfriend) about the conversation and showed her the text chats. This enraged T who went to our boss and reported Me and A (not S. Which I think is weird since she made the worst comments) for sexual harassment. I only found this out for sure because I ended up getting called into the office of my work and scolded by my boss saying that it was inappropriate, even though I only made like one sorta strange joke and it wasn’t even sexual, and that he could go to HR or the police for sexual harassment.
(I t’s important to note I’ve been told from someone I work with who talks to D more than I do, that he really doesn’t care. I know for a fact it was T who reported it ) 
My boss pointed out it’s extra uncomfortable because I am a minor and he is not but I don’t see an issue in that regard since minors being attracted to adults is pretty normal and it’s not like I am actively pursuing him. 
When I was going into the office there was some people in there already including T and when she left so I could be alone with the boss I saw a smirk on her face as she closed the door. Like she took pleasure in the fact I was too be in trouble.

Anyway now things are tense at work and I’m just wondering am I (and A) wrong and actually guilty of sexual harassment? Or is this just a jealous girlfriend getting more mad than needed over some silly joke texts.",0.9
"WIBTA if I confronted my dad for commenting on my sister’s eating habits? TW: possible ED discussion?

I (18M) have a sister (15F) who is a basketball player during the fall and winter months. She’s a very good player and absolutely loves the sport and I’m very proud of her. My dad (48M) is also proud.

About a year and a half ago we got into a fight when my sister told me that our dad was commenting and saying that she doesn’t eat enough food and she’s going to get sick or not build muscle or endurance, etc etc. For the record, she eats enough food. She eats until she doesn’t want to eat anymore, which is human instinct, good stuff. She’s not overweight or underweight, maybe on the thinner side but my family is naturally built like that and she’s by all means a healthy weight for her height and age. 

After that fight, we agreed that he would no longer speak on how much she was eating because it was clearly upsetting her and her eating habits. He took this begrudgingly, for the record. All was well. 

Today my dad cooked us food and made her a plate of food. He put a ton of food on her plate, like even more than I would eat as a grown man. I went upstairs to study and apparently he yelled at her when she wasn’t able to finish the plate and this made my sister feel very bad about herself. 

I’m pissed because we’ve had this conversation before. I was under the assumption that it was the role of the parent to promote a positive relationship with food. Should I talk to him and my mom again like last time? WIBTA?",0.08

AITA for asking my ml to stop harassing me? So I 29 F have been married to Joey 37 M foe about 10 years. When he first introduced me to the family his mother didn't like me. When Joey wasn't paying attention she would make comments on my hair telling me how I shouldn't be cutting it like that because it will make me grow grey hairs faster and that will make me ugly. One day she straight up told me that she wished I never met her son and that she will make sure I never get any money from their will. They are not wealthy and neither is my husband. I am the bread winner in our house and sometimes need to give them money to help pay for groceries. They have never payed us back for anything and we never asked them too. Then I found out I was pregnant with twins. And that's when she blew up about how I was a dirty whore and not good enough for her son. My husband yelled at her for this and we left them at the restaurant with the bill. After that ML has been leaving messages asking why I was making her son hate her. And what has she ever done to me to make me act this way. I told her it's because she has been a bitch and I will not let her influence my babies. After that she told everyone on both sides that I have been keeping everything from her and gaslighting her. And on the Facebook post I told her to stop harassing me and making stuff up because hating me won't make you younger. My family and his has contacted me saying what I did was wrong and that I should have brought it up to her in person. But my husband is on my side because he loves me and hates how his mother us acting. But now I'm rethinking my decision and if I am the asshole or if I should apologize. Please help me decide.,0.24
"AITA for not eating the food my mom bought? Genuinely wondering if I’m actually some narcissist going crazy here. 

I (23F) live at home, and when I came back from work, my mom (who usually cooks dinner for me) asked what I wanted to eat today. I kinda shrugged and said I wasn’t too hungry, but my mom came up with the idea that she’d pick up pizza on the way home from her errands with my dad. I didn’t protest it much. 

While my parents were on the way home from their errands, my mom called me to place the order for pick up on UberEats (using her credit card she left for me). Again, I let her know I wasn’t too hungry and that I’d only have a piece or two - so I asked her if she still wanted me to place the order. She said to do so anyways, as she hasn’t eaten all day so she’d have some pizza, and so would my dad, and that if there’s any leftover she’ll just split it with my dad to take to work tomorrow. 

When they arrive home, I only take 1 piece of pizza which BAFFLES my mom. She’s asking me why I’m not eating more, and grilling me to eat more - but I explain again that I don’t have much of an appetite because I have a stomach ache. She then proceeds to take one of the pizza boxes and shove it in my face while I’m trying to continue my work, which starts annoying me, so I say no thank you once again and just proceed to keep working. 

Anyways, my dad tells my mom to have more pizza, but she refuses and says she’s too full (mind you, after 2 pieces). Before she leaves, my mom makes sure to throw in a “you’ve hurt my feelings today, you didn’t even eat the pizza I bought for YOU”. 

Genuinely wondering here, AITA here? What was I supposed to do, eat the pizza and make my stomach ache worse? I had already told my mom that I wasn’t feeling the pizza, but she decided to order anyways. Also, why am I being nagged at 23 years old? I’m very thankful my mom cares enough to make me dinner, but she does this quite often and will take it personally if I don’t eat. I also don’t have any health issues, and am perfectly healthy for my age. Wtf man…

EDIT: I mention the thing about my mom eating pieces because I find it hypocritical that she doesn’t deem it an issue when she eats only 2 pieces, while suddenly it’s the end of the world if I eat 1 piece. These were small size pizzas mind you, so the slices were quite small too.",0.07
"AITA for getting mad over my brothers baby’s name? We’ll call the baby name David.

A couple years ago, I was severely struggling with my mental health-depression, specifically. It got to the point that I decided to check myself into a mental hospital.

There was this kid I knew in school- named David. It’s not his fault my mental health was shit, but he certainly didn’t help. He was constantly bulling me, and spreading lies, and it caused my mental health to get worse. 

Again, it's not his fault. But i do associate him and his name with the absolute worst part of my life. My brother knows this, and knows the full details of what David did. Yet, he still is naming his kid David.

"AITA For breaking it off because a SO had never filled a tax return I (26M) had been talking to significant other (24F) for about a month. One day the conversation came up that I was trying to get my tax return (US) for this year done. When I mentioned this to her, she made the comment that she had never done her taxes before. When I asked if she meant that she pays someone to do them for her, she said no, and that she had just had never made enough money to do them before. She didn’t say that she’s never had job, but I would assume that means she’s never had a significant job. Additionally I can confirm that as of right now she does not have a job.

After this conversation I really stuck with this remark and lost attraction to her for mostly from just this conversation. For context, she lives in a nice house alone, with animals, and has no money struggles.  She told me she won a substantial lawsuit a while back which I assume is where the easy living is coming from.

I’ve paid taxes since I started working at 16, and I really am starting to hit stride in my career so I just cannot fathom a way that someone who has never paid taxes would be a complementing partner to me when they’ve never done this task that everyone almost everyone has done by 24.

"AITA because My predominantly white school won’t allow me (17 M) to wear a durag as an African American So I (17M) am black and recently got my hair twisted which is something I’ve wanted for a long time. Of course it’s still in its baby stage so my hairs looking a little rough and I still need to get the sides and back twisted but I’m letting it grow out so I’m not looking my best right now. Luckily the person who did my hair gave me a durag to protect not only from judgement but to keep the hair from frizzing and help lock in moisture. Before wearing it to school I decided to check the student handbook, and any rules/policies I could find for my school about head coverings. The only things mentioned were hats and defined as “fashion items” which my durag is not. It serves to protect my $250 hair until it sets and is easier to take care of. So I decided I would wear it. The first few days it was no problem but these days were also out of dress code days. My school consists of almost entire white kids and I can count the POC on one hand including myself. I got called into the office and was told to remove it around day 4. I explained my hair was expensive and the durag was protecting it and the dean stated and I quote “It may not be a hat by definition but it is a hat in my book.” I tried my hardest to explain but they all stood firm. I would understand if it were just for fun or was actually a hat but its purpose is to protect my hair and the definition of durag and hat and very different. I feel as though I’m not getting the representation I deserve and that having a bunch of white adults decide whether or not I can wear something to protect my hair and is a large part of my culture is unfair. I don’t know if I’m overreacting or not but I really don’t want to ruin my hair and as I said it is looking rough right now. What do yall think?

"AITA for refusing to pay for my half of car purchase when I already used it for 7 months? My car [female, 33] got totalled back in summer in a flood. My boyfriend's [26] family got a new car and were going to sell their old car. The vehicle has over 100,000 miles with no known issues at the time. It is an suv and my bf and I decided to go half on the purchase (2k total), so we each have to pay 1k, and then split everything down the middle (maintaince, repairs, insurance) and be co owners. Title would be under his name. The goal was for us to put it up on turo and make some passive income. Since my car got totalled, we decided I would drive this car and cover the insurance in the mean time and put turo on hold until I found my new car.

Fast forward 7 months, the car has an issue. Engine light is on, it has oil evaporating problems plus possible catalytic converter issues. Essentially, he says he doesn't think the car can be put on turo, so I have basically committed to paying 1k on a car that we won't be able to use for business purposes. I have been looking for the exact same car that was totalled, and have found one (took 7 months to find the right car), and it was always the point for me to drive the suv  just until I found a new one to buy. I told my boyfriend that I do not want to go through with the purchase since he is saying he can't afford to split costs of fixing the car. It has engine issues and would cost thousands of dollars (more than what we are paying the parents) to fix. He also says we can't sell the car with the issues it has. I'm really not interested in owning a car if we aren't going to repair the issues it has.

 His parents are saying we now have to buy it since ive driven it 7 months. He has paid $500 and has to make monthly payments on it now.

 Am I the asshole for wanting to back out of this verbal purchase agreement we had? I trusted his judgement when He said it would be a good investment even though it had over 100k miles. But if we can't fix it because he can't afford to cover half of the cost for repairs, and If we can't rent out the car on turo to make extra income, I don't have a reason for wanting to be a co-owner. 

I'm now looking to buy a new car in the next week. I can't help feel it's shitty he's being made to finish paying for this car by his family when it's a car with expensive issues. The issues did only start after we already had the car. The family did not know or sell it like that on purpose. The engine light came on maybe 4 months after I started using it. My bf also says he wants to keep this car because he feels his current car is on its last breath, so he wants this one as a back up in the future.

Am I the asshole if I don't pay up the 1k I committed to paying after diving the car for 7 months?


UPDATE: There were several elements to this agreement. 
1) We split all expenses evenly (this includes maintenance and repair.
2) That  it go up on Turo.
3) That we are co-owners. 

My bf works At a car shop. He knows what the problem is. He does not want to repair the vehicle because it is too costly, so he is backing out of going half on repairs on a vehicle we both ""own"". Also he is backing out of putting it up on Turo. Am I still the asshole when he is backing out on a portion of the agreement??",0.98
"AITA for fighting with my parents because they refused to pay for my collage tuition despite having the means to do so? Hey Reddit, got a real family conundrum and need your take on it. So, I'm a 20-year-old guy (20M) who recently had a major blowout with my mom (45F) and dad (50M) about them refusing to pitch in for my college tuition, even though they've got the cash.  
  
Here's the backstory: My parents were all about education when I was growing up. They pushed me hard to get good grades, cheered me on to pursue a college degree, and I managed to snag a spot at a good school. Now that the tuition bills are landing in my mailbox, they hit me with the bombshell that they won't be helping out financially.  
  
I confronted them, and things got wild. I argued that, as their kid, it's pretty reasonable to expect some support, especially when they were the ones rooting for me to go to college in the first place. They can cover the costs, but they're choosing not to.  
  
Their comeback was all about teaching me to be independent and handle my own expenses. I get the importance of financial independence, but it feels like they're doing a 180 on their previous pep talks.  
  
Things got heated, and I might've let a few choice words slip in the heat of the moment, but nothing went too far. I'm still left feeling confused and hurt about their flip-flop on their support of my education.  
  
So, Reddit, am I the asshole for expecting my parents to put their money where their encouragement used to be, or should I just roll with their newfound stance on financial independence? Feeling torn and wondering if I went too far. Let me know what you think.",0.7
"AITA for crying myself to sleep, alone, after he said “I do nothing for him and I’m just a burden?” So we’ve been dating for 7 years. He mentioned wanting to marry but I always state he is too reckless with his financials. Until he gets it together, I can’t see myself legally blending my life with his. 

We have discussed the possibility of breaking up recently, as we’ve been arguing a lot about EVERYTHING! A lot of it largely stems from me shutting down when I get emotional and he says very hurtful things when he gets wound up. The major thing we argue about is, of course, financials. 

Lately, he’s been more and more wound up since he’s been working a second job (I work 3 part-time jobs). Because I have flexible hours, I typically clean dishes, take care of our cat, vacuum and all the other household chores since he’s at work 6a-2p. I work periodically throughout the day. 

Tonight, I worked 6 hours (7a-2p). I got home, ate lunch and started cleaning. I knew tonight was going to be a longer night for him as he was working both jobs. I greeted him when he got home. We were both in great spirits and played/joked our kitten’s antics. AND that’s when it happens: another argument. 

He mentioned he needed help with taking care of the family dog (the dog is sickly, which means staying home all day especially with our cat in the same living space.),…but only gave me a 2-day notice. Granted, I have more flexibility scheduling-wise, but I still have deadlines to complete. Admittedly frustrated, I said “I don’t think I can do it, I’m working a ton of my shifts these next couple of days.”

He looked at me and snapped. He said “I don’t see why you can’t do it. I already told my family it was okay. You have to do it, there’s no other option.” Flabbergasted, I responded “You didn’t give me enough notice. I’m working an TON and  can’t afford to be home all day to dog-sit on such short notice. I feel like you’re taking me for granted that I have a different schedule than you.” Mind you: he has the ability to leave work at any time due to his familial relations with his boss. So, in my view, there were other options. 

He responded “Don’t worry. I won’t ask you for anything anymore. You don’t do anything here, anyway. You’re just a burden to me.”

I was so shocked, I couldn’t even respond. Granted, he says hurtful things when wound up but this hurt deep. Dumbfounded, I walked into the bedroom and closed the door. Then took a shower and cried. I’m now laying on my bed crying as I type this, while my BF is in the next room watching tv. He hasn’t spoken to me since and I’m too hurt to initiate any conversation right now.

"AITA for canceling my ex boyfriend’s plane ticket? Before I begin, me (23F) and my boyfriend (29M) have had a VERY rocky relationship. If you check my post history,
we have both had our share of wrong doings to each other and decided that it’s best if we call things off. 

So anyways, a few weeks ago my ex requested I book a vacation for him and his friends. He said that him and his friends will tip me / pay me for my services. I spent soooo much time searching for a hotel, looking for cheap flights, and making an itinerary for them. The whole process was super stressful also because there was a slight issue with my bank account. On the night I booked the hotel, I stayed up till around 4 AM trying to resolve it because I didn’t want to disappoint him and his friends. Anyways, after everything was booked I emailed my boyfriend and his friends e tickets and hotel confirmations. A few days later, me and my boyfriend got into a huge fight because he forgot our monthsary (FOR THE SECOND TIME IN A ROW!!!). 

Side note: I know that to some people monthsaries aren’t a thing, but where I live (Philippines) it’s a common thing for couples to set out one day out of the month to celebrate each other just as a way to keep the romance alive. 

I was very upset and told him I can’t be with him anymore because I didn’t feel loved and valued. I asked him to pay me for the trip like he told me he would. He said he won’t pay me at all because I want to end things with him. I told him he should pay regardless of our relationship status. He still refused. I texted him, “fine. I’ll just cancel your ticket then.” He proceeded to tell me, “Go ahead and cancel it”. And that is exactly what I did. I canceled his ticket, but kept his friend’s. It was non-refundable. A part of me feels so bad and I think I’m the asshole because he lost money (8K PHP), and I broke his trust, and booking a new ticket right now would be almost twice as much as it was before because the vacation is in a few days (14k PHP). However, if he had an ounce of respect for me, he would have kept his words, right? My ex is very emotional and has anger issues. A lot of times he allows his anger to control his actions. Even him and his friends admit that he has anger issues. 

Side note: This is not the first time my boyfriend has said he will do something and then he refuses. Last year he promised he would help with my grandmother’s funeral just out of the goodness of his heart, and he didn’t give me a dime. 

There have been many other instances as well where he breaks his promises. I was just completely sick of it at this point. So….AITA???",0.31
"AITA for telling my wife how to spend her inheritance? My (32M) wife's (31F) father recently passed away, leaving behind assets worth nearly a million dollars, which we were very surprised by. He worked in middle to upper-middle management of several small companies, and was known for being personally frugal but generous to those around him, especially after his wife passed a few years earlier. My wife, as an only child, is the sole beneficiary of his estate and he did not leave any instructions for how this inheritance should be used.

This would be a lifechanging amount of money for us. We are relatively lucky in that we are both college graduates and have good, stable jobs each making about $50k a year. However, with this amount of money we could buy a house and eliminate our biggest expense which is rent each month. We could finally upgrade our aging car to an electric vehicle, which we have wanted to do for ages partly for environmental reasons, partly also because electricity is cheaper than gas where we are so it would actually save us money long term. We have a small amount of student debt that we were going to pay off soon anyway, but we could pay it off immediately. We could start a college fund for our children. And even though I am under no illusions of never having to work again, it would allow us to pull back on the hours and do more of what we enjoy, spend time together, travel and see the world etc.

It seems like when my wife learned of this windfall, she immediately assumed we were going to donate it to charity. We have always supported charitable causes we care about and I don't object to donating a portion. However she seemed surprised that I wanted to use it for ourselves. Her reasoning is that no one needs or should have this amount of money all at once. We didn't earn it and didn't even know it was there; we were getting along perfectly fine before, and we would still be perfectly fine without it. Sure, it could make our lives more comfortable, but the right charities could leverage this amount of money to change thousands of people's lives.

It turned into a nasty argument. I told her since we are married I thought I should have some say in a major financial decision like this, especially since it has implications for both of us. She said the money was left to her, so she should be able to decide what to do with her inheritance. AITA?

ETA: I should clarify my FIL actually passed away late last year and we have only recently gotten the information about the inheritance due to bureaucratic delays

ETA #2: My FIL supported various charities throughout his life so it's not unreasonable to believe that he would have wanted some significant proportion of his estate to go to charity. I understand he had planned to draw up a more detailed will with nonbinding suggestions (still to be administered at his daughter's discretion), but passed before he was able to do that.

We are starting to plan out our future together (living arrangements, family, marriage, etc.) and almost all is well. Throughout our relationship he has made one off comments about wanting to reconnect with his biological father, we’ll call him Eric. 

A little background on Eric: Three years ago he was arrested for two counts of abuse of a corpse and is a habitual offender for smaller misdemeanors and felonies. I will not go into to further details of the case as it was a big commotion at the time and is easily identifiable.
My boyfriend has had no contact with Eric since he was very young and has no memory of him. Wyatt’s mother has made it clear she’s wants nothing to do with Eric but has left it up to him to decide if he wants to reach out to him. 

Recently, Eric has been released on parole and has reached out to Wyatt (via Eric’s mother/ Wyatt’s grandmother). I have been insisting that Wyatt not respond to his father. I do not feel comfortable with having someone like that associated with me and future children. However, Wyatt is starting to become more and more upset with me over this disagreement.

"AITA for wanting to kick my bf out of the house? For context: I (23 F), have been in a relationship for 2 and a half years with my boyfriend (27 M), and we have been living together for 6 months. He is an artist, has no diploma and has always been struggling with money. I have a degree, a stable job and make decent money. Since the beginning of our relationship, I stated that having a comfortable life and enough money was very important for me. Prior to living together, he was living by himself in a small city and I was a student in a bigger city quite far away. I later found a job in the big city and he agreed to move in with me, since as an artist he can work from wherever. Because he was really broke, he promised to find a job to pay for his part of the rent/cost of living. I told him he could come live with me and not pay rent for 5 months, so it would be easier to find a job in the city. The landlord is a friend of mine and agreed to keep the rent the same amount I was paying for myself alone previously but for a bigger place to move in with my boyfriend for 5 months. After 5 months the rent was being increased. My boyfriend agreed during these 5 months to share the cost of living (food, water, electricity, internet), which he actually did not, because after moving in with me he realised he was more broke than he thought. He has now found a job and has been working at this job for 3 months. Despite getting his salary, he did not offer to share the rent or the other costs. At the beginning of the current (6th) month, the rent was risen to the agreed amount after the first 5 months, and he still has not told me anything about paying his share. Apart from that he is a very nice, smart and thoughtful guy, and we have a lot of interests in common. But I feel like he doesn't behave like an adult. He is not capable of managing his money (he made many useless purchases recently, from decoration items for himself to weed, but didn't pay rent or groceries), does not want to drive (I have to drive us around). On top of that he doesn't do any kind of physical exercise and has a rather unhealthy lifestyle, whereas I try to better myself and be healthy. I do love him but I feel like he doesn't want to take responsibilty and behave like an adult. I feel done with this and think about kicking him out. Aita?",0.06
"AITA for telling my friend to never contact me again I 18f told one of my closest friends 19m to f*ck off and never contact me again after he told me “ You are beautiful, but that said your body is your body and I shouldn't have told you that it doesn't need to be changed” out of the blue a few days ago. For context I am extremely insecure and have been since before I met him 3 years ago and he has always said “your perfect the way you are and don’t need to change for anyone” or something similar and this felt really weird to me. I read the text as “You are good enough to I regret telling you you shouldn’t change and think you should” and asked him if that was how he meant it to come across, he said “That is exactly how I meant it” so I told him to go f*ck himself and never contact me again. Our friend group is now decided and my phone has been blowing up with messages from our mutual friend and some people I have never met calling me the a$$hole for how I handled the situation, so AITA?",0.53
"AITA for supporting San Francisco 49ers This is for the Americans. I am from England and have supported football (soccer) from a very young age. I support a team called Leeds united, recently they have been sold to San Francisco 49ers thanks to them my team have more money to spend. One day I decided to watch highlights of them. I didn’t know if they were good or bad, I didn’t even know any rules fouls and stuff. I just watched them because I love Leeds. Anyway, I started to get more invested in them and began to watch full  matchers/games instead of highlights. So now they’re in the Super Bowl and I was watching some edits on instagram of them playing at uni and a guy from American saw what I was watching and said something along the lines of glory hunter and that I’m a girl who doesn’t understand sports especially (American) football and that I just find the players fit. I’ve liked sports since I was 8 at that age I never thought hmmm that guys fit I was just enjoying the fact I could swear at football matches and celebrating when we scored. So aita for watching an American sport.

Ps he knew I liked football (soccer) and never said anything until he saw me watch American football.

"AITA for asking gifts on my birthday? I, 25F, and my mother are having disagreements over my birthday that's coming up in a few days. She wanted me to throw a party in the house because it's tradition to celebrate parties on your birthdays with relatives invited. This year, I told her I didn't want any party and would rather have a birthday dinner/ lunch with family instead. My mother insisted we have to, and I said fine but I better have gifts on my birthday. I say this because every time there's a birthday party in whoever's house it is, the host would shoulder ALL the food and drinks, plus the cleaning afterward; the guests essentially just come over to eat and greet you happy birthday. And I honestly don't like that because I think they should at least maybe bring gifts or food to share since nothing is cheap in this worsening economy. It helps take off the burden on the celebrant's shoulders as well.  


This is where my mom and I are disagreeing. She said that I could say but I shouldn't expect gifts. I told her I can just chat in the relatives gc about bringing gifts to the party. My criteria are simple : 1.) Money no less than $1 or essentials like face masks/alcohol/hygiene supplies. 2.) help with cleanup after.   


My mother disagree, especially on the cleanup part, saying I'm asking for too much but I beg to differ. We've been fighting over this and quite frankly I rather not throw one at all. This feels so silly and blown out of proportion but idk, it's been upsetting me. So, AITA for putting my foot down and asking for gifts? ",0.47
"AITA for being “ungrateful” for my housemates birthday gift? To give a bit of background and context, I (27F) have lived with my housemate (32F) for a few years. For her birthdays I have always felt bad as she doesn’t have a lot of family in town so I always make extra effort for her birthday. Last year for her birthday I had literally just gotten out of day surgery when I went directly to the store and spent well over $200 AUD and ran through the door before she got home from work to surprise her and the year before that my grandfather (the man who RAISED ME) had died two days prior to her birthday but i still made the effort to decorate the house and buy her some great gifts and shout her dinner as well as play a game of her choice. Recently in the last few months her boyfriend moved in which is great for me as I’ve lost my job and needed the cheaper rent but it’s been worse in other ways. Now this year for my birthday I heard nothing prior to my birthday to give me any indication that she even remembered my birthday which she would usually do. Usually she will ask what I had planned or if I was going to be around but the last few weeks she barely even looks at me let alone asked if I wanted anything for my birthday. So I informed them I would be going over to my mother’s house the night prior to my birthday but would return the night of my birthday. Now due to circumstances I ended up staying an extra day and a half and didn’t get home until a day  after my birthday. In this time I didn’t even receive a text from my housemate to wish me a happy birthday or anything and when I got home only her boyfriend was home. He didn’t wish me a happy birthday or anything either and simply said. “Housemate got you a cake” and showed me a half eaten half squashed cake that says it cost her $4.50AUD (she earns a decent income and isn’t struggling for cash)  and when she finally did get home she said nothing. Maybe I’m over reacting but I was genuinely hurt. I don’t expect hundreds of dollars being spent on me but a little more effort would have been nice. I told some friends and they said I should be grateful she even thought to buy me a cake but I really can’t help but feel like it was pathetic. Even if she had just gotten me the cake who the hell gives someone a half eaten cake? I don’t know even if I should bring up how much it hurt me but I just wanted to know AITA?",0.36
AITA For letting my 9 year old bake my mom’s birthday cake which didn’t look perfect for her party? AITA I usually bake my mom her birthday cake but my 9 year old son has been really interested in baking lately so I thought it would be nice if he helped. I ended up letting him do most of it since he was doing a good job. The cake wasn’t quite how I make it but he did a good job. I thought my mom would find it sweet and be forgiving but after the party she told me she was really disappointed and had been looking forward to me making it for her. She said it looked she wanted her party to look a certain way and the cake ruined that.,0.75
"AITA for being upset that my two closest friends are bailing on my 18th birthday to go to a concert without me? throwaway account because my friends follow my other one. 

so i (17F) have two best friends, both 16. we have all been best friends since we were around 12 years old. my 18th birthday is this year and since we live in england this is THE birthday as thats the drinking age ect. my birthday is on a friday and i was planning on doing something with my friends after school. to be fair to them, we didnt have any plans set in stone but honestly i think its pretty safe to assume that your best friend will want to do something for her 18th birthday. 

one of my friends (i'll call him alex) has recently got into a band that is going on tour around the uk this year. he mentioned yesterday that he would like to go to the tour but was unsure because he didnt have anyone to go with him. i said that i would go if i knew the music but i dont, and so dont want to spend my money. he never mentioned that the concert is on my birthday. 

later in the day he messaged on our groupchat (with me, alex and our other best friend katy). he asked if anyone would like to go with him, still not mentioning the date. katy said the same thing as me; that she would go but she doesnt know their music well enough.

then today, alex came up to me and was so excited because he got the tickets. i asked who he was going with since he wasnt sure and he said katy. i was confused because katy said that she didnt know the music. alex said ""oh i just made her a playlist to listen to so she can learn the songs"".

this already was upsetting to me because my two best friends are going to a concert without me. me and katy were in the exact same situation and alex easily could have sent me the playlist as well and we all could've gone together.

then alex said, a bit guiltily but still excited, ""the only thing is, its on your birthday"". i was very upset but i didnt say anything because im not sure if im being irrational and jealous for no reason? 

alex lightheartedly apologised but said it was the only day they could go, which isnt true as the band is playing multiple days around that same time, its just slightly more convenient for them to go on my birthday because of travel. 

they will be back late and so im worried they will be too tired to do anything on the following saturday as well.

"AITA- today I cursed out a service worker So it’s early about 6:00 am and I’m picked up after already being late for work because my alarm went off. My ride service comes and picks me up we casually greet each other, we then proceed to take off nothing new right? My job is about a 35 minute drive away more or less but usually more because of the traffic on 695 at this time. 

So when he took off he never put in his seat belt… so it starts beeping and beeping and it wasn’t one of those cars where it reminds you and then stops, it just reminds you the entire time until you do it. Now I’m a tall guy about 6’6 so I’m sitting shotgun as soon as we took off I clicked my belt when I heard the beeping, he didn’t not so not wanting to be rude I gave him more then enough time that I thought was even reasonable. 

I mean I didn’t even say anything to the guy for 5 minutes!! Then I simply say “he brother your seat belt isn’t on, wouldn’t wanna get a ticket haha” he looks me dead in the face and says “I can’t put it on while I am driving” so I bottle my emotions cause I’ve still got like a 28 minute ride left at this point the entire time ding….ding….ding….ding… 

But finally we arrive and as I’m getting out I tell him “from now on where you seat belt bud you don’t want people leaving silly reviews” and he says “this is my car it doesn’t bothe” and before he even finished that sentence like word vomit “THEN YOUR A PSYCHOTIC PIECE OF FUCKING SHIT PISS OFF YOU PRICK FUCKING CUNT, CUNT!!!” The second cunt he was already driving off I rightfully lost my drink that was in the cup holder but fuck that drink and that guy.

Edit:I’m going to add this simply because sometimes tone plays into context. When he said “this is my car it doesn’t bother” it was very much in an aggressive demeanor. It was snapped at me. Not trying to talk my way into him being The asshole personally I more or less think ESH. ",0.82
"AITA for refusing to eat a restaurant because nobody their spoke our country's language? I'm from Hungary, I only want to speak Hungarian in Hungary. If you live in Hungary and refuse to learn Hungarian and can't communicate with us, you're an asshole and should be deported. Tourists or people here for short times get a pass. FFS its not that hard to learn the basics of a language, I speak Afrikaans, Tok Pisin, Turkish, and Slovak because I lived in those countries. No I don't speak it amazingly well but I spoke it to a point where I didn't inconvenience anyone and could do all my life tasks in them. It pisses me off when I order something on ubereats and its some Indian or Arab or whatever who can't even say some basic shit like ""your food is here I'm waiting outside the gate"" in Hungarian. I have only had 3 Hungarian speaking taxi drivers in the past few years, whenever I order uber or something its always some asshole from Belarus, Georgia or Ukraine who asks me to speak to him in Russian. WTF THIS SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED. 

I was with my girlfriend and she wanted to try some Turkish restaurant so we go in and I say ""hi a table for 2 please"" in Hungarian and the guy responded back with ""No speak Magyar"", my girlfriend tried to say it in English and he still didn't understand. I haven't used Turkish in 6 years but I remembered enough to say ""does nobody here speak Hungarian?"" and he responded back in Turkish ""most of our clients are other Turks, sorry we don't really speak Hungarian here its a hard language"". I responded back ""I speak your language, is it too much to ask that you speak mine when you live in my country?"" He responds back with ""I don't have to learn any language, would you like to get seated?""

My girlfriend is confused and asked whats going on and I told her we're leaving we walk out and she asks what happened and I explained and told her I don't trust them to not spit in our food or whatever. She says she liked hearing me speak Turkish and it was really romantic (WTF?? how?) and that she is really dissapointed. She always likes hearing me speak foreign languages, I hate them. I only learn foreign languages out of politeness, respect and it being useful, hell I wouldn't even bother knowing English if 80% of the interent wasn't in English. 

We got into a massive argument because she said that restaurant supposedly has really good food and I shouldn't be so harsh on them because Hungarian is a hard language bla bla bla. She doesn't speak English (hungarian schools especially in poorer areas outside of budapest are outdated and often have old teachers who taught Russian and German during communism which was more useful) so she wouldn't really be able to go to this restaurant without me. We argued for a while but she then decided we could go to some Persian restaurant and the waiters did speak Hungarian so I respect them. In the end she was satisfied but still annoyed about the turkish shit.

"WIBTA if I reported my roommate’s girlfriend to the leasing office as an unauthorized tenant? Hi!! So I live with my bf and his roommate & his gf & their dog & my cat (all in our younger 20s). I am on the lease, my bf is on the lease, the roommate is on the lease, she and the dog are not. My roommate moved her in no announcement and she’s an actual mess. I wish I could insert photos of how disgusting the kitchen is because neither of them clean. Prior to her moving in, he did clean somewhat, but now he expects her to clean, which she doesn’t. The dog isnt potty trained and they just clean it up without any cleaner. Additionally, the dog has no boundaries and forces my cat to stay cooped up in my bedroom. Additionally they have broken my air fryer, ripped up the floor board, the dog rips up the doors, etc. I could go on and on and on… We intend on moving out, but our lease isn’t up yet (& who has the money to break a lease in this economy) & we have discussed nicely with them on NUMEROUS occasions; well, my bf has bc I would be an Ahole haha.

"AITA For not being able to hang out with my best friend? So it has been a year now since me and this guy became friends and he had become a super cool dude around me. Every day we hung out the beginning of the year on VC until 6am playing games together and he would eventually make me want to buy a VR headset and I had a blast hanging out with him. But unfortunately he never wanted to hangout with me in person only during VC. He would always say no or that he is busy which made me a little upset but I kept that to myself because he worked a lot.

"AITA for having a chronic illness? I Female (33), have a condition called Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria, my main trigger being heat, I have made some posts in the past to give other people advice and perspective on the condition.

 I had a big flare up of my condition that caused me to be hospitalized. None of my usual medications or methods of control were working anymore, I couldn't work consistently and eventually had to resign from my job of six years. 

I had to get a new immunologist to try various medications and means, on therapy was so heinous that for about four months I was bedridden with intense pains, migraines, and nosebleeds (something I never had in my life before and was quite scary.)

Strap in, this is where it's gonna get a little long in the tooth. Not long after my flare up, my husband had a bad fall that caused a dangerous compression of his C6 and C7 in his neck. Why this matters is because he was one of two of my mother's employees for a business I won't go into details so that they do remain anonymous as possible.

So, my husband can no longer work, he went to several doctors before surgery became our only option. Here's where it gets really icky sticky, he's from Canada. We spoke to my Mother and Father about his immigration status, which they said they would handle through a lawyer for us since my Father employs many immigrants and helps them get their status in order.

They did not do anything that they promised.

My Mother is fully aware and has admitted to me that she wishes she had picked the right lawyer, etc. What she refuses to acknowledge now is that she essentially made both my husband and the other employee work WAYYYY under the average pay for the kind of job they do. We didn't think much of it.

The total underpayment of my husband ALONE was 250,000 dollars. That's. A lot.

Early December I flew to Canada to both be with my husband and to get officially married there, then start various immigration forms and processes before I came back in late January(26th).

Yesterday I was up and doing my normal things I do. Cleaning the kitchen, sweeping floors, etc. Getting everything ready to make dinner for that night. (Which is to note even though I am not working yet I do ALL the cooking and cleaning, because I feel like that's the least I can do for the household for now.)

I don't know why it stung me specifically today but when she muttered the words ""You need to get a job, I can't keep subsidizing everyone"" really just. Upset me. I have placed quite a few applications online and am currently in the waiting phase to hear back. To make things even weirder or worse or   


I'm not even sure, I had a great job offer from the local Courthouse that I was very interested in before my trip, I told my Mother and she completely discouraged me. Told me not to do it, that I don't need a job.

"AITA for not wanting to invite my stepdaughter to my daughter's birthday? My (f27) husband (m36) was previously married and has an 11 year old girl ""Mary"". We got married and now we have a girl who's soon to turn 7 and a boy who's 4, I'm also pregnant

He has custody over the girl on weekends and shared holidays, she lives with her mom (who's a very unpleasant woman btw). The girl has some behaviour issues, I've talked about this with my husband who also sees it, she usually refuses to listen to us when we tell her what to do (like do your homework, you need to tidy up your bedroom, etc). It hasn't been so much as to be a big problem or worry until recently.

About a month (or so) ago, my husband and I were inside with our toddler, we were trying to get him to nap since he was fussy and I wasn't feeling well, so we asked both girls to play outside together with their toys. A while later we hear crying and our daughter comes in, she tells us that her sister was being mean with her, Mary says she wasn't.

So we talked to both girls and my daughter said that her sister wanted to play with her Barbie, but my daughter didn't want to because she was making an outfit with play doo. Mary said that she'll ruin the doll and my daughter said that she won't and she'll get new dolls on her birthday anyway, so Mary said that she'll ruin her because she's stupid. They had a fight. 

I have absolutely no reason to not believe my daughter, she's always good and doesn't pick up fights with anyone. However, Mary does. I told her that it was unacceptable to do something like that to her sister, she told me that I'm not her mom and I can't tell her what to do, my husband and I tried to tell her why what she had done was wrong, she got angry and said that she hated me, she also attempted to hit my stomach. 

My husband was very angry too at the time, so he made her pick up her stuff and drove her back to her mother's house since I didn't want her here anymore. Her mom, as always, said that it was my fault and her daughter had probably not done anything. 

I asked my husband to talk to his ex so they could find a solution for the girl, so she'll behave better. I asked him if he could go see her at her mom's house for a couple weeks because I honestly didn't feel right having her at our home with what she did. He agreed, so she hasn't been coming home these last few weeks. 

However, in two weeks our daughter turns 7, we've been planning a party for her. I sent the invitations for her classmates. My husband told me to write one for Mary so he could give it to her this weekend. I told him that I wasn't planning on inviting her, she's a literal bully, I won't have another child bully my daughter or my son. He told me I was being ridiculous. We got into an argument. He told me she's just a child too and my hormones and protective instincts are messing with me. Also that he'll get Mary to apologize to our daughter and me and that should be the end of it, I don't agree at all, I think that she definitely needs some help because she has gone too far this time.",0.92

I’m a 28 yr old (f) and had moved home 2 years ago due to a change of job.
 Before I moved home I lived 30 minutes away and used to drive home every evening to see to the animals. My mother used to insist I’d stay at home until she was tired and then I could leave. This used to be at 10.30 at night and I used to get to bed at 12 (dinner/shower/clean house) every night and up at 7.30 for work. I worked 6 days a week with one day off. 
My parents always knock me and tell people I can’t look after myself and  that I need them to function.

"AITA for humiliating my(32M) cousin(25M) in front of our family after he lied to me and did not spend the money i gave him to pay off debts? I gave my cousin about 60K in total over the course of one year to pay off his rent, rent and utility.

He has always been an impulse buyer and couldn't manage his money well, so i decided to give him a second chance by helping him out.

Last month when i visited him, i came across several letters of warnings from Utility and the debts he was supposed to pay off and it was at this point that i suspected he was using the money for something else.

I demanded answers from him and it turns out he was spending my money on video games, fast food, but what pissed me off the most was how he wasted the majority of it on some E-prostitutes on OnlyFans. I can understand and forgive him for wasting a bit on his favorite games or buying himself something to eat once in a while, but not bankrolling some random women on the internet like all the other virgin losers on the website, starved for attention and sexual gratification they will never get.

I grilled him after that and pretty much yelled my lungs out just for how stupid he is. I get he has self esteem issues and difficulties dating, but at the very least hire a prostitute, at least they give you the attention and sex you want and they are much cheaper. 

Normally, being a family member, i usually restrain myself from lashing out or talking about him. But after finding out he lied to me and wasted my money like that, i decided to tell my entire family about it and some of his friends, letting his mom/my aunt know her son is a liar and a failure.

I didn't have contact with him ever since but from what i know, it seems that what i said must have shattered him. My own Dad approached me about it again not long ago, calling me mean and cruel and i should apologize to my cousin, because we are family.

Now when i think bad about it, i might have gone a little too far, but i just couldn't wrap my head around why he was wasting most of my money on strangers on the internet over nothing? What did he hope to gain from it? 

I think that i must be so harsh to him so he learns his lesson. He is not the only one. Many guys are like that these days.

Our Grandpa(R.I.P) was a WW2 vet. What would he think if he were alive today? If he and the others ever knew at the time how the US will end up, im sure they would've let the Nazis win cause i sure as hell, as someone who served the Army, am starting to think that we should've never won WW2. The shit that happens today is just an insult to their memories.

Does shaming him like that make me the asshole? Was it too much? If so, how am i supposed to handle that situation next time?

"WIBTA for going to Miami without my (23f) boyfriend (24m) for Spring Break? My boyfriend and I have been together for 5 years. We were long distance for about 2.5 years of our relationship because he moved away for school. He has since moved back to our home country (England). I am planning a girl trip with my best friend (Marissa) to go to Miami for spring break. We are going for 3 days. This is the first time I am flying by myself so I think this would be a good chance for me to learn.

My boyfriend has some mixed feelings about me going. He claims he is “okay” with me going, but it’s obvious otherwise. He is scared that there will be a bunch of guys trying to hit on me and he is scared of how it will look to others that he is “letting” his gf go to Miami for spring break. 

I had a conversation with him about his concerns, as I found it unfair since he left to a foreign country for school and I trusted him. Not only that, but he has travelled SEVERAL times by himself (before he met me + coming back to England for holidays) whereas I have only travelled with him. He was adamant that it is not that he doesn’t trust *ME*, it is he doesn’t trust *men* in Miami and the fact that I am going with only one girl. Additionally, he has some concern regarding my friend Marissa, as she is single and was once quite wild and “promiscuous” when we were in year 11 to university. 

I can understand his hesitation regarding the trip because I know how the scene can be, but I don’t think it’s fair that I can’t go because he’s unsure of POSSIBLE men there. I wanted to ask because maybe I am the asshole here since I am in a relationship? WIBTA for going to Miami without my boyfriend for Spring Break?",0.44
"AITA for going into the wrong changing room? I am 17 (FTM) in high school. My choir has a show going on that requires dressing rooms. I talked to my director about getting my own dressing room because I did not want the people in the boys one or girls one to feel uncomfortable with me in there. She was super sweet and got me one. 

During rehearsal the other day, my phone was on low battery and I was asking around if anyone had a charger. A buddy of mine who is a cis man said he had one in the dressing room. As we walked over there, he literally said “You’ll probably be fine, I don’t think anyone will care. I don’t.” Which is funny because he’s literally a real conservative TPUSA guy- but he still respects me. 

So I went into the boys dressing room for 30 seconds or so, and he handed me the charger but it wasn’t compatible with my phone. So I said it was alright, then I talked to one of my other guy friends for a short time in there about the show schedule, and as soon as i left another friend of mine came out of there and told me how Porter (fake name) was pissed and uncomfortable that I was in there.

And I totally get that. It was wrong for me to go in there no matter what my gender is, because it simply was not my dressing room. The next day my director made some announcements and emphasized staying in our own dressing rooms, and Porter loudly went “THANK YOU!” as she said it. So I assume he said something.

The next day I talked to him in private and said how it was totally wrong for me to go in there, but i’d appreciate if you talked to me personally. I told him that I assumed he talked to the director and that if he had a problem with me to let me know. Because if he wanted me to leave he couldve told me and I would’ve done so. He was just like “Yeah totally I’ll talk to you next time.” I walked away feeling good and better.

So I thought we were good to an extent. But even though I talked to him privately and apologized, he still goes on to complain about me the next day. For talking to him. Saying stuff like, “Can you believe she said that to me? She shouldn’t have gone in here in the first place.” as well as other offhand comments to others about my dressing room saying, “She doesn’t even look like a boy.”

"AITA for leaving GFs apartment? I[32M] came to my GF's[30F] apartment after going to the gym. We exchanged hugs and talked a little. Clearly she was a little annoyed but she wasn't engaging so I felt like she probably wanted to just chill, unwind and cuddle. 

I tried to kiss her to which she said she felt disgusting so didn't want a kiss since she had just finished boxing. She seemed like she wasn't in the best of moods so I just showered and popped in the bed and put on one of the sitcoms we've been watching, Abbot Elementary.

After she's done with her shower, we're watching the show. She's not as engaged but still talking. I proceed to say something to her, she waits 10 seconds to look over at me and say 'what'd you say?' then I say nevermind. She prys asking what I said, and I just said nevermind. Then the exact same thing happens again and I told her that I'd be leaving after this episode.

We exchanged texts this morning, I had apologized for leaving earlier than I normally do. I had told her I left because I felt like she wasn't engaging to the point of blatantly ignoring me, and that I would have preferred that I had communicated that I was upset. She said she had wanted me to stay but when I left, did not communicate that she wanted me to stay.

"AITAH for missing Valentine’s Day? So I’ve been in a relationship with this girl for about 6 months and this is about to be our first Valentine’s Day. She’s upset at me because I planned a trip to go snowboarding with my brother and will miss Valentine’s Day with her.

Basically, my brother offered to fly me out to go snowboarding with him and his wife that day because the mountain they are going to is offering a crazy good deal. I jumped on the opportunity and when I told my girlfriend, she got upset. I haven’t seen my brother in a while and I thought this would be a good opportunity to go see him. I knew she wouldn’t be able to make it because she will have to work on those days.

I offered to make it up to her and celebrate another day but she seems to be upset that I didn’t at least talk to her before making those plans. Apparently she had already made dinner plans for the both of us that night. Again, I haven’t seen my brother in about 4 months and I thought this would be a great opportunity.

"AITA for telling my friend that we are not in the same boat? Hi!

I 26f have a friend Sarah 27f, Sarah has one kid (3m) and she got divorced from her husband about one year ago. I also have a kid (2f), her dad is not in her life, does not pay child support and has never met her. We were in a relationship but he choose to leave when I fell pregnant.

So it has always been just me and my daughter, it has not been easy, being a single mom has been hard but I love my daughter more than anything and my daughter has always been fed and has had everything.

Sarah’s ex husband is still very much present in their life, he pays child support while they have 50/50 custody (he does not have it court ordered). Sarah and him have a great relationship and co-parent wonderfully. 

My problem is just that she often comes to me and talks about how hard it is to be a single mom, to do it all on our own, that “you get it, right?”. While I do understand that she is alone half of the time, cooking dinner alone, putting him to sleep and getting him ready alone in the morning all by herself is hard, especially when you are used to having a partner. I also think that her struggles are very much real, but they are not the same as mine. I know I chose this life knowing what I got myself into, and yes of course I am jealous of her, I would say I am jealous of everyone who has two present parents for their kid.

When we got together this Wednesday it was her week without her son, she started talking about how she feels frustrated because she never has any money left to treat herself. She finished the sentence with something like how that is just how it is to be a single mom and that it is great to have a friend who can relate to her struggles. Sarah makes more than me, and with child support I know that she has an income that is about 1,500$ higher than mine. I told her that I understand that her life has changed drastically, but that our situations is very different. I said this because I frankly got tired of her saying stuff like how I can relate, how i must now what it is like for her and how she constantly compares her situation to mine. I have always let her vent about her feelings but when she said this, while also still being able to afford housekeeping and getting her lashes done etc it rubbed me wrong because there have been times I had to go hungry for days.

She asked me if I meant that she has it easier than me, and I told her that it is not a competition but that our situation can’t be compared due to them being so different. She said fine and started talking about other stuff, however after this she has not texted me once nor has she answered my text I sent this past weekend. I am starting to feel like maybe I was unjustified in what I said, because she usually texts me everyday and responds to my texts.",0.01
"AITA For Saying I Don’t Follow Teens On Social Media? So I (22f) got a new job last year and I’ve been loving it so far, but every job has its drawbacks, and for me it’s that I work with a lot of 16-18 year olds. They’re fine, I don’t dislike them, but I also don’t really have much in common with or relate to them. I’m friendly with them at work, but I’ve had to gently shut down attempts from them to hang outside of work because 1) I honestly don’t do much outside of work in the first place and have been spending these colder days inside, 2) I don’t see myself having and am not interested in having anything but a professional relationship with these girls. Again, they’re fine, but there’s a huge maturity difference, and I don’t think we’d get along much. I also don’t have the same tolerance for drama and boy problems that I used to when I was their age, and all they ever talk about around/to me is drama and boy problems.

Anyway, this particular incident started because I started following a different coworker (32m) after he asked if I have a certain social media. We have been getting to know each other and have a lot more in common, and I felt comfortable with having this out-of-work connection with him, so we followed each other. I feel like I should clarify now that there’s not some weird ulterior motive from either of us in being friends outside of work, as I’m a lesbian and he’s gay. Anyway, his page is public, which mine is private, so anyone who sees his page can see his followers/post comments/etc., and a girl from work named Ava (18f) saw a comment I left on one of his posts (I’m guessing? She could’ve looked at his follow list too I guess) and requested to follow me. I declined the follow request and went about my day. 

Two days later we were on shift at the same time and she approached me during my break and asked if I’d seen her follow request. I didn’t want to deal with an awkward convo (my mistake, I should’ve taken care of this then and there) and I said that I hadn’t. She was like “oh okay well I sent one” and left. I was hoping she would just forget about it, but a couple more days later, yesterday, she came up to me and asked why I hadn’t accepted her request. I told her that I don’t use social media much (which is the truth) and that she’s not really missing anything, and she got upset and asked why I would follow Jake (the coworker mentioned earlier) but not her. I told her that I just don’t follow teens on social media. She got mad and tried to argue with me, and I told her that it’s not that deep. She almost called me something, but she didn’t and just left. A couple of the other teen girls have been side-eyeing me and being short with me since, and I feel like maybe I was an asshole here but I also don’t think that I did anything wrong? AITA?",0.27
"AITA for requiring my daughter to answer questions before she gets access to college money? So my wife and I have 2 daughters one of which is in college and the other is a junior in highschool and starting to look at schools. We have a college fund for each of our daughters and I have always told them that before they get access they need to be able to explain 3 things to me and their mother

1) what degree they want and what career path they plan to use it in.
2) what that career path is likely to pay/ how likely you are to ""make it"" in that field
3) what the lifestyle at that income level looks like.

We are fine with whatever choice they make I just want to ensure that if they want to be a teacher they dont expect to make 200K, or if they say they are okay with 60K a year they don't expect that to pay for a yearly vacation to Europe or anything like that.

I am also aware that life happens and plans can change but I believe you should atleast have a plan that you can change rather than just vague notions. With our oldest everything went fine she answered the questions, got access to the fund and is earning her degree. 

Our younger daughter however, has no clue as to a plan. This came up when she is looking at colleges and was asking specifics about how much is in her fund. I told her but reminded her about the questions which she did not like because she said she didn't know what she wanted to do. I told her that's fine, work for some time, get some experience and see if you find what you want to do. And if the next step isn't higher education then we can talk about accessing the money for another purpose as long as you can answer the three questions. 

She currently thinks I am an AH because I ""gave her sister money but is refusing to do the same for her"". She is wearing on my wife who is also starting to question the fairness of the situation. I don't think we are being unreasonable but would be interested for perspective from people not as directly involved. AITA?",0.27
"AITA: Future Mother In Law Am I the asshole because my mother in law keeps overriding decisions that my fiance and I make together? 

My fiancee and I are getting married. She offered to help cover the cost of the wedding and we politely declined as we are very well of financially and wanted to do this ourselves. We discussed and all were in agreement that him and I would be covering the wedding. She wanted to do a family dinner beforehand and cover the cost. We were fine with this and asked if it could be split between the two families so that everyone could feel they had given something. This was agreed upon. 

Fast forward, I was talking to my fiancee and found out that a few weeks ago his mom had sent him an absurd amount of money (more than a few thousand dollars). She claims that this money was to cover the dinner as well as his ENTIRE family's dinner cost at the wedding. I am pissed. It is more than double what the cost of the entire dinner before hand and the cost of his family at the wedding. It's absurd. 

She is going to be at the dinner the night before, and we were fine with her paying / splitting with the other side of the family. Sending beforehand was completely unnecessary. We were covering the cost of the wedding, and yet now she wants to pay for their entire family's food and beverage cost at the actual wedding. It's the complete opposite of what we had discussed. It feels intentionally sneaky as well as she just sent the money and is trying to say it's to cover items which could NEVER add up to that amount on top of costs she is not supposed to be covering.

I don't want to be ungrateful, it's an incredibly kind thing to want to help but at the same time it's not what was discussed and agreed upon. It feels intentionally sneaky. She could have just given a gift of money if it really meant that much to her. I just don't understand why it is being done in a way that completely overrides everyone except her. I am pissed at my fiancee also because he hadn't told me until it came up in conversation while making the dinner reservation. 

We've had these discussions about his mother over stepping before. For example, earlier this year she came up to visit. We had just bought a house and planted our first garden. While I was working from home she went outside and harvested all of the vegetables. It might sound stupid but I wanted that to be for my fiancee and I. It was our first garden, something we talked about for a long time and it was our first harvest. I wanted it to be special. Instead, in the middle of the work day I found out that we wouldn't have that because she took it upon herself to go do. Him and I are supposed to be a unit. We make decisions together. If she wanted to cover more we could have had another discussion but I feel like I was completely cut out of this. His mom just sent the money so he didn't know it was going to happen but he lied by omission for weeks and he broke previous promises in regards to how we deal with his mother. ",0.75
"AITA for declining a bachelorette party after previously accepting? TL;DR: I declined my invitation for a bachelorette party that I was previously invited to when I found out that I wasn’t invited to the wedding and the expense of the event, and MOH is upset.

Throwaway for anonymity. 

Back in December 2023, I was told by my friend (let’s call her FB) that her bachelorette weekend would be coming up in April 2024 and to save the date. I was delighted: of course I would love to go and celebrate you!

A couple weeks later, FB reached out to me privately to let me know that she and her fiancé have decided to “elope” with a small wedding with 40 guests and 5 bridesmaids. Due to capacity limitations, I was booted from the guest list, however my presence at the bachelorette party is still desired if I am comfortable with it. At first I didn’t see an issue and said that I would still like to be involved. 

MOH sent a text shortly after that with the dollar amount per person and due date of the payment (one month from then). Split between 11 people, the total is $315 and does not include meals, parking, and other expenses. 

Info: I was a bridesmaid in MOH’s wedding in December 2023, and participated in all the events including bachelorette party and shower. These were weekend getaways and all involved several activities and outfits. We also had to purchase two dresses for the wedding, plus various accessories and gifts. 

At first I was okay with attending FB’s bachelorette staycation, but after receiving the dollar amount, I do not feel comfortable attending an event that celebrates a wedding that I am not invited to. This is not an elopement in what an elopement usually is. This is just a small wedding. In my opinion, small wedding should mean small celebration. I can afford the $315, but it’s the principle of the thing. I am being asked to contribute financially to an event, bring a gift, and adhere to a “dress code” that celebrates a wedding I’m no longer invited to.

Two days after the balance notification was announced by MOH, I contacted FB to let her know that I would need to decline the event. FB was understanding. The event is two months from now in April 2024, which gives plenty of time to make adjustments. 

MOH, however, sent me a very long and condescending text about how me declining now leaves everyone on the hook for my share of the cost. She went on to say that having more people on the trip makes the trip more affordable for everyone, and although she’s glad that it benefits me not to go, this is leaving everyone high and dry for my share of the trip.

"AITA for scolding a strangers kid For context, I was at my gym a few weeks ago and after my workout and shower, sat down to use the provided hair dryer and straightener.

I was working away when a little boy ran in (could not be more than two-three years old) and started going at the hair dryer, turning it on and blowing the hot air in his face. I looked around for his mom but could not see her. I then leant over took the hair dryer out of his hands and switched it off, in case he hurt himself and told him that it was dangerous to do that. He then grabbed it again and tried to do the same thing to which I checked for his mom and attempted to turn it back off.

While this was happening, his mom came back in the room and asked ""what the hell I was doing"". I explained that I was concerned that he would hurt himself while she was gone. She said ""hes only joking around"" and picked up her kid and walked off quickly.

"AITA For making my daughter delete her TikTok and Instagram account with over 400k followers? Hi reddit, I'm a single dad to 2 kids 19M and 15F. 

I don't know how to handle most things and alot of my time is spent working, I do try my best to keep my kids safe, but knowing I can keep them feed, put a roof over their head, and make sure they focus in school is more than enough for me. 

I recently had a falling out with my daughter who is 15 years old, for months now I knew she used TikTok, so does my son. However a few weeks back some of her videos went 'viral' and caused her to be in the limelight. It was over silly dance videos, and her making skits. She would occasionally go live on this platform and people would engage with her live videos. Attached to her TikTok page is her instagram, where people would follow her. Her TikTok page went from a few hundred to hundreds  thousands of followers during a 5-6 week period. 

I didn't realize the dangers of this platform and how it gave predators access towards children, until I seen the comments section in the video, or the lives where they would constantly ask her to do things that seems innocent, but were outright gross. Or the constant unwarranted messages from people. 

It seems like most of the people engaging in these activities were above the age of 18, most in their late 20's to early 30's some even 40s.

I had to go through my daughter's phone, her instagram and text. It wasn't because I didnt trust her but having this many eyes on you makes you a target, I dont know if I was being paranoid but her instagram dms were filled with grown men trying to hit on her or sending unwarranted pictures. 

It's not like they didnt know she was 15, it says so on both her profiles, but it opened the doorway to predators to access my daughter. 

I made her delete the instagram account as well as the TikTok account because it attracted too much attention, it was also attached to her real name, and locations that could easily be looked up. I wanted her to be safe. 

I'm not sure if I made the right choice here, at 15 I just want her to focus on school but she thinks im ruining her chances at being something in life and taking away her social life by doing this because it was one the best things to happen to her. 

I feel like this is one of those moments where I have to be a tough parent, I sat down and explained to her the dangers of getting this big and how scary the world really is, especially when you're easily able to be found online. 

I thought she would understand from my point of view as a father but she thinks that I dont trust her to be safe, but its not that, it's that I dont trust a bunch of strangers on the internet. 

AITA for making my daughter delete her TikTok account?

"AITA for refusing to give my adult SO an ultimatum to behave like an adult? Me (34f) and my ex bf (34m) broke up because he had a small, secret cocaine habit that spiraled completely out of control into a full-blown cocaine addiction.  

About a month after we first got together, we were at a birthday party and a mutual acquaintance offered him a bump, he asked me if it was OK if he did it. I looked him in the eye and with complete seriousness I told him that I, personally, did not do cocaine but that I wasn't going to tell him what he could and couldn't do at parties. I also said, I don't care what you do, I care how you treat me when you're doing it. Just still be my loving boyfriend and it doesn't matter. 

I'm not in the habit of telling people what they can and cannot do with their bodies.

Then things got tricky. Over the next year, every 2-3 months, we'd get in a huge fight because he would go out somewhere, blow coke, and disappear completely for 12-16 hours. I'm not the type of partner who requires periodic check-ins, I had asked the first time this happened that he just text me when he was home for the night, no matter how late, that way when I woke up the next morning I'd see it and know he was okay (we lived about 2 hours apart) and not have to worry that something had happened to him while he was out partying. It never happened. Every time we fought he would find a way to say something along the lines of, ""well, I won't need to do it when we live together because I'll have you every night and won't need to do this to entertain myself"" which I always countered with, ""you're out of your mind if you think we'll be moving in together if you continue to treat me like this.""

I always made it clear to him that the level of disrespect he had for me when he was high on cocaine (once let me drunkenly fall asleep by myself at a bar until closing after I said I wanted to go home at midnight because the bartender gave him coke and he forgot I existed / another time abandoned me to a pack of middle-aged men who were complete strangers because he refused to answer any of my phone calls / he once forced me to walk home alone in the middle of the night from a bar because he forgot me and couldn't be bothered to respond to my messages/calls - just a few examples) was unacceptable, and that I loved him but I loved myself more and I would not hesitate to walk away if he didn't learn to treat me right 100% of the time and not just decide I didn't matter whenever he felt like doing drugs.

Long story short, we broke up when nothing changed (surprise, surprise).

Now, I was recently speaking to a very close mutual friend of mine and my ex's who knows all of the details. She said I should have given him an ultimatum the very first time: me or the coke. But my opinion is that we are adults and I am nobody's mother and I shouldn't have to tell my partners how to act - I want the knowledge that their actions hurt me to be sufficient for them to change. So - AITA for not giving him an ultimatum and ""forcing"" him to make big boy decisions?

"WIBTA if I scold people for walking across my property? Regardless of how it might seem from the title, I’m not a crotchety old man but actually just a (31F) with a small but nagging issue. I genuinely can’t tell if I’m getting myself riled up for no reason, and family/friends seem to be split on the matter. 


A few years ago, my partner and I bought a house on a corner lot - the road in front of our house is a fairly busy main street, while the side road is a neighborhood of about 20 homes. Our property is just over a half acre and the house sits right in the middle of it, so there’s a good amount of yard surrounding the actual building. 


My issue, however trivial, is that people are constantly cutting the corner between the main street and the side street and walking diagonally across my property - often with dogs, with strollers, or on bikes. They’re not just cutting the last ten feet or so, either - they cut in where my property starts (150ish feet from the corner). Some of them get so close that they actually are within arms reach of the house itself. I work from home and find myself getting jump-scared on a fairly regular basis by people suddenly right next to my windows. I know none of these people, for clarity. 


I’ve mentioned this to family and friends and have brought up the notion that I’d like to ask these people to mind the corner. I’m getting some pushback from family and friends, who say it’s a dangerous main road and cutting across my yard is safer for the babies and dogs that are regularly escorted on my property. This is true - the main road is technically an exit off the highway, and the further you walk toward the corner, the closer you get to the highway. People are usually going 45-50mph on this stretch of road. 


My rebuttal is that they’re taking leisure walks along the main street anyway, when there are dozens of nearby parks/hiking trails/etc. (not to mention the neighborhood roads, which are quiet) so walking an extra 80-150 feet of “danger” seems like a non-issue. However, I’m also nervous about being a scrooge in general. Even though I don’t know these neighbors, I don’t want to get a reputation for being an AH about something as “small” as this. 


A few things to note:

- I can’t install a fence along either street due to town ordinances

- I don’t care *much* about my yard, but I do pay to have it maintained in the summer months and the stroller/bike wheels often leave marks, plus people don’t always pick up after their dogs

- There are a few large holes in my yard from uprooted shrubs and I’m nervous about folks twisting their ankles or otherwise harming themselves on my property


So Reddit, WIBTA for actually scolding these trespassers? I’d try to do so as kindly as possible (and am honestly kind of nervous about doing it at all because I hate confrontation). Bonus points for any suggestions for the least AH way to go about it :-)",0.2
"WIBTA for making my husband miss the birth of our child by refusing to allow MIL to watch our daughter? My husband(31) and I(27F) are expecting our second child in about 6 weeks. Children are not allowed in the room when giving birth so we arranged for our daughters(1F, Mia) godmother to watch her and essentially be on call for a few weeks. Mia’s godmother had something come up and unfortunately had to back out of the arrangement leaving us without childcare.


When Mia was born my husband and I agreed that we wouldn’t allow others to watch her until she can talk. I had a pretty terrible upbringing and can be a bit overprotective but she has only been watched by someone who wasn’t us for an hour. That was her grandpa who we trust, watching her from the other end of Costco while we shopped. We would allow her godmother to watch her but she also works and has kids so there hasn’t been an opportunity. 


We do not trust my MIL. My husband and I agreed years ago she would never watch our kids. She’s an alcoholic and abused my husband as a kid. She has never been alone with Mia and I don’t ever want her to be. I don’t think she would neglect her or abuse her but I don’t trust her at the end of the day so I am not going to leave my flesh and blood in her care. When our godmother cancelled I told my husband I think he will just have to stay with Mia and I will call them to come meet our baby once I’ve given birth. The hospital is a four minute drive from our house. 


He’s now very upset and asked if his mom can watch Mia as he doesn’t want me to be alone and doesn’t want to miss the birth. I told him no I don’t want her watching our daughter as we’d agreed she never would. He says it’s a one time thing, it’ll probably be for less than 12 hours and never again. I think it’s a slippery slope and she hasn’t become a more trustworthy person just because we need her help all of the sudden. He’s very upset and asking me to reconsider. 


Hiring a stranger to watch her is not something we are currently considering so he told me MIL is his only option. My family lives far away as does FIL. WIBTA if i refuse to let MIL watch Mia resulting in my husband missing the birth of our second child?",0.71
"AITA for getting more money than my little sister? Frankly, I'm not sure what is going on.
I (18f) have been getting £800 every fortnight from my mother for the past say 6 months. 
£600 of that is owed to my granny.
The rest is used to buy random things when people need it (I make sure to get myself a thing or two)

The reason for this money is for proof of income for a house-buying process

My sister is 2 years younger than me and is angry that I am getting this money, she gets £50 every fortnight.
She and her boyfriend (who is another 2 years younger, and who lives with us) are saying that I am favoured by both our mother and granny because I get more money.

She also brought up the fact I got a bird and a hamster when I was younger and she didn't, saying how that's another form of favouritism.
I think I was in single digits when I got those animals (a dumb decision really).

But now I don't know what to do, I wasn't getting she money she was getting at 16.
Does she have a right to be annoyed?

I know this situation is really a classic sibling thing, but she is giving hell to our mother and granny about it as well.",0.46
"AITA for being upset and hurt at how my SO reacted to me wanting to cut his hair? Okay, this is prolly silly. But here's the context: I love cutting hair, especially my SOs. For me it's a special intimate thing to do for him, but everytime I ask him if he wants his hair cut or when he mentions that he needs me to cut his hair he postpones it constantly. I mean, it's his hair so he gets to, but he already agreed to letting me cut his hair at that moment. It happens so often that when he wanted to put it off again this time I got really annoyed and said I wouldn't cut his hair ever again because I'm constantly getting told to leave it for later again. So I put the hair clippers away and he took it out again and shaved all his hair off. Now he's asking me if I'm happy now, obviously I'm not because it feels like he did it to spite me. Either way, I guess we can fight over stupid things. Now we're both sulking and I'd just like to know AITA?",0.93
"AITA for kicking out my Cousin's friends and ""ruining"" her party? My Grandfather has been diagnosed with Cancer. My uncle (dad's brother), my aunt, and my cousins, Amy(18f) and Bruno(12m) have shifted to my grandparents' house for six months to take care of him and to keep my Grandma company, after which, it is my parents' turn to do so. I (17m) live away from my hometown for my studies. In fact, A and I have lived together for one year after which she decided to go back to our hometown. 

Now, my Grandfather's condition has worsened and our parents decided to take him to a faraway hospital in the city. Meanwhile, I decided to head to my hometown to relax for a while since my assignments are already done and our teachers are busy with an upcoming school fest so, no classes are going on. This was supposed to be a surprise for my cousins and I was quite excited since our cousins Catherine(14f) and Dylan(14m) have also moved to our Grandparents' house with their mother, our aunt, who has moved there to take care of Amy and Bruno.

After arriving in my hometown, I went straight to my Grandparents' house with my luggage since I would be living there, as my mother has accompanied my uncle and aunt and my father is on a business trip.

As I arrived there, I could sense that something was going on, something was not right. I knocked loudly and Catherine opened the door for me. I hugged her and entered the house, and BOY was I surprised, there were 8-9 (18-20) teenagers drinking alcohol in the living room, there was another couple fiercely making out on the sofa, another group was gambling. I was horrified, I asked where Amy was and found out that she was out shopping for the party with her boyfriend(20m).I asked my cousins to go upstairs immediately and was told that some couples had gone upstairs, due to which they were were not allowed to go there. That was the last straw.

This is where I might have been an asshole, I immediately took photos of all that was going on downstairs and then asked Amy's friends to move their party elsewhere or all of their photos would be duly forwarded to their parents, most of them were quite co-operative and left the premises after calling me a plethora of names. A few of them remained but I chased them away by blasting hideously harsh metal music on the home audio system at the full volume. After this, I grabbed the keys to the upstairs bedrooms and knocked loudly on each of them. I gave the couples some grace time before I started unlocking every room and kicking the couples out of the house.

Ten minutes later, Amy barged into the house along with her boyfriend and they began swearing at me, she demanded an explanation and I just stood there, emotionless. After her little outburst, I told her to clean the house before our aunt came home. 
She has been hostile with me ever since.

"AITA for not seeing my sick father because his complaining is pissing me off? So background info. My father has always been a 
hypochondriac AND an attention whore. Stubs his toe and spends the next two days limping and moaning every time he takes a step kind of guy. So when he started coughing heavily a few months ago, nobody believed that there was a problem (heavy smoker 40yrs). But, as it turns out, he has stage IV lung cancer.

He had 4 rounds of very intense chemo so far. To say he handled them well is an understatement. The man living as if there's nothing wrong with him. His hair is still there, he's able to drive, walk, he literally goes out with his buddies EVERY SINGLE DAY.  I'm aware of how difficult it can be to handle (my friend is a breast cancer survivor). And we're all SUPER GRATEFUL that he's handling it so well.

My father, however, is absolutely using his condition to the extreme. Whenever anyone calls him, he just CANNOT WAIT to talk about how sick he is and that he doesn't have much longer. He is being EXHAUSTING to be around. I used to come and see him every day, but as time goes on, I started dreading it.

Every time I come and see him, he asks me if I'm going to feel bad once he's dead. Then tells me that I should probably prepare because it's inevitable and will happen soon. Any time I ask him how he's been, he'll just say ""I'm dying OP, how can I be"" (meanwhile he'd just returned home from a night out). If I tell him that he seems a bit better, he says ""That's just an act, I have never felt worse but I'm keeping it to myself"". But the straw that broke the camel's back, for me, was a few days ago. He had a headache a day after his last chemo. I told him it's probably a side effect from chemo, and he said that he had chemo before too yet this never happened and that it must mean that he's dying. I said that he's been extremely lucky with the lack of side effects since most people suffer so much more. He said that he suffers too, but ""doesn't want to burden us with it"". At this point I was already annoyed and just told him to get some rest, and he said ""Oh I'll be resting, very soon, forever... in the ground.""

This just pissed me off so much. I said nothing and just left the house and haven't been back since. Haven't even texted him. My brother said that dad keeps asking about me and saying that his own daughter doesn't care that he's dying. Brother thinks that I'm an asshole and that I should come visit and just deal with his comments.

On one hand, I get it. The man is possibly dying and it can't be easy to face your mortality and I understand that people have a very hard time dealing with this diagnosis. But on the other hand, WHY keep intentionally upsetting your kids every time they come to see you? Why keep complaining, guilt tripping everyone who doesn't ask how you feel, and emotionally punishing those who do? ESPECIALLY since your treatment has been going SO WELL.

I somewhat get it but it's exhausting.

"AITA for lying to my coworker?   
**Throwaway account, just in case.**

  
**I (33F) recently joined an office with three other women, but I don’t quite feel like I fit in (the other three are very close friends, and though they have invited me out a few times, we never quite clicked).** 

**The biggest problem is that I find them very entitled, which brings us to the story. Despite several warnings from our admin, they often leave dirty dishes in the staff room and expect janitorial staff to clean up after them. Every time they get a reminder, they complain about having to wash their own dishes given that “there is someone else to do that.”** 

**Yesterday, it was one coworker’s birthday, and after serving us all cake they left their dishes piled up on the meeting table. I immediately washed and returned mine, but they kept putting it off, saying they would do it later.** 

**At the end of the day, as we were leaving, one coworker, Hana, hid the dirty dishes in a filing cabinet so that “janitorial staff wouldn’t tattle to admin.” They were still there the next day, and I was quite grossed out at the thought of the ants and bugs that would be attracted to the frosting covered plates.** 

**This is where I might be the AH . Instead of just ignoring the problem or waiting for them to deal with it, I lied and said admin had told me they noticed the dishes were missing (they are communal use) and if they didn’t return them, cleaned, they would be barred from using the staff room. Hana immediately dealt with it, while huffing under her breath.** 

**Now I feel like I may have blown things out of proportion and acted petty, while possibly alienating my coworkers. AITA?**

"AITA for not wanting to celebrate my friends after they didn’t show up for me So I got married last year. I invited 7 girls to my bachelorette. 

For my bach I wanted to do a spa day. Informed everyone they could buy a pass to use the pools if a service wasn’t within their price range and indicated I really just wanted a facial and a peaceful girls night. 

3 were busy
1 told me she could attend
2 told me they couldn’t come 
1 told me she might make it and would let me know

The one who told me she might make it and would let me know ended up telling me she would not be there. 

But before she told me that she wouldn’t make it to my Bach, her partner invited me to her birthday party via a Facebook group. Then he uninvited me the next day and she reached out to tell me she wouldn’t make it, and her partner then re - invited me to the Facebook group for her birthday party. 

Now this is where I get upset. 

The 2 who told me they couldn’t come didn’t give any indication as to why. 

Then I get a text from the one who was having her birthday party on my Bach day and she tells me the other 2 are going to her party and if I wanted to go to her party after the spa then I was more than welcome. 

Obvs this upset & hurt me. And I did NOT attend. 

They barely spoke to me until my wedding day and then basically avoided me on my wedding to the point where we have no photos together but all 3 took photos together and with their partners. 

Their partners are friends with my hubs and all showed up for his Bach while none of the girls showed up for me. 

Its been about 7 or so months now and I just can’t get passed it. I barely talk to them. 

And one of them just got her degree and wants us to celebrate with her….her partner wants us to sign a card of congratulations and I just have no desire.

"AITA for selling my car without telling my family? Alright so I (F21) have always had a love for cars and when I was in high school my parents got me a nice car, it was a Hyundai Tiburan. I enjoyed that car and it was nice but also wasn't something that I wanted to keep as my forever car. Now when they did the title it was put as I'm the primary owner and my mother was the co-owner with the title saying ""and/or"". Well I had that car for a decent amount of time and never really changed the title over as it never had any issues to change it over to just me.

Well recently I decided that I wanted to get closer to my dream car and so I decided to sell my car and with the money I bought an 07 mustang with it along with some other money that I had saved up. It all went as planned and I got a car that I love. Now throughout this process I didn't really tell my family because I figured that it didn't really matter as I'm an adult and can do adult things. Well when I went over to my parent's house the other day to show them my ""new"" car they got mad at me. It led us having an argument about how both of mine and my mom's names were on the title with me arguing that it was legal since it had ""and/or"" not just ""and"". My mom then told me that she would've been fine with it if I didn't get a sports/muscle car. This argument went on for a little bit with neither of us really giving in to the other side.

"AITA for saying that the phone works both way? I got a girl pregnant when I was 20 and while I never wanted kids I have tried to be present. My daughter mainly lives with her mom and stays at my place sometimes.

So I got a message from my daughters mom telling me that she would appreciate if I actually reached out to our daughter instead of her having to reach out to me. I told her that our daughter maybe texts me once a month so it is not like our daughter really reaches out to me. She told me that it was pointless to even have a serious conversation with me.

Later that day my daughter also texted me telling me that she loves me and would be happy if I texted her more. I told her that I loved her too but that the phone works both ways and that our relationship is not only my responsibility.

My daughters mom texted me asking “what the fuck is wrong with you, who even tells their own kid that the phone works both ways?” and I have not replied.

Frankly I don’t feel like an asshole but it is obvious that she thinks so, to me it feels like I have always provided and been there. I have showed up to our daughter dance competitions, I have always sent my child support and have never told her no to sleeping here.

"AITA for staying at a concert while my friend sat outside To start off I (18 F) have a best friend of 5 years T (18 M) and I had invited him to come to a concert this past Saturday that I had an extra ticket to and it was non refundable, he agreed to it when I had asked him a few days prior and we arranged a train since the venue is a ways away. We got to the concert about an hour and a half early to get a spot in line since I told him I wanted to be in the pit upfront near the stage to mosh (General Admission). Before we even got inside he had complained of a headache and not feeling well due to the strong smells of smoke and bud so we had gotten some food and water and I thought all was well and we went in to go find a spot near the stage. As the venue continued to fill up it started getting more crowded and louder so we put our earplugs in and we’re waiting for the opening band. We talked through our notes app since we had earplugs in and he told me he didn’t like all of the people so close to him and the strong smells that come at concerts normally and his girlfriend told him she didn’t want him to mosh and he wanted to go up to the 3rd floor where it was less crowded. At first I was disappointed and slightly annoyed because I didn’t want to be alone and it was my first time moshing but I reluctantly let him go upstairs while I stayed down there and continued for the concert to start because I really wanted to get the full rock concert experience. 

Here’s where I might be the asshole, after he left I jokingly said to a group of mutual friends in a group chat “man T’s a loser, his gf won’t let him mosh” and for context with me and T’s friendship it’s not unusual for us to call each other names and jokingly insult each other. 15 minute after the show started T told me he really didn’t feel good and went to go sit outside and drink water while on the phone with his girlfriend and I continued on enjoying the concert. A couple times he texted me that he felt second hand high from all the strong smells in the air and at one point couldn’t make it up the stairs so I gave him money and told him to go grab some food outside the concert at the restaurant we ate previously at because the concert hadn’t ended yet(no re-entry). Eventually when there was around 30 minutes left of the concert (it was only around 4 hours) I went to go find him and we went to a restaurant to eat food and we had a good conversation during the meal as well as on our way to the train station. The next day I don’t hear much from him and Monday rolls around and he still hasn’t said anything to my texts when I try to confront him about the whole situation since his girlfriend came yelling at me that morning saying that I was pressuring him to stay in a stressful environment and left him alone the entire concert and that I made an insulting joke “deliberately” in a place where he couldn’t see it  now I’m wondering if Im the AH for staying and making that joke and not going to find him during the concert to check up on him?",0.07
"AITA for not saving money like my gf and not sharing her goals? I(28M) and my gf(28F) have been together for just over a year. She is very frugal and into personal finance, I am not. She own her own home which we share and I pay rent to her. I don’t have a problem with this as the rent is lower than I would be paying elsewhere and she is ok with my 2 cats. The problem is she wants me to adopt her views and I don’t see it. She sees money as security and so she hordes it. She does spend on fun things, she really likes escape rooms, hiking, traveling and the like but even then she only does them when she can get them discounted or she finds way to save on them. We went to Colorado to hike because her friend owns a place there and so we got to go nearly for free but otherwise she would wait or insist we camp in a national park. I personally don’t like sleeping in a tent at all and would be ok with spending more on a hotel. She also travelled Europe but stayed in sketchy hostels to save money. I don’t travel as much but if I did I would be ok with spending more to actually enjoy myself. 

To me money comes and goes and I have student loans and a few thousand in credit card but that can easily be paid off. She always insists that having debt is bad and I should be working every second of my life to pay it off. But I don’t, I don’t care as long as I can make my payments. She boasts she paid her loans off a year after leaving school but that’s because she went to a much cheaper school (and turned down her dream school to go to this cheaper school) and got a much higher paying job out of college than most. And I’m sure she penny pinched as much as she could to pay it off. I don’t really enjoy her type of living and I’m ok with not having as much savings but she gets nervous as soon as her saving account is below 20k. She transferred a lot to her investments from her savings and then had to pay her property tax and then was nervous for a week under her savings was replenished from her paycheck. I had a few hundred in savings after paying my car insurance and she found out and was very angry that I let it get that low. I don’t really have a problem with it but she thought it was so irresponsible. I’m pretty sure most people live like me, I don’t spend a ton but I’m ok with having less savings but she can’t seem to fathom it.",0.38
"AITA for talking to my friend’s stalker? I will be using fake names and There’s a lot of people involved here, so please bear with me.

Both me and Anne are in high school, we have been friends ever since we were babies. So me and Anne are really, really close: we hung out a lot and her family knows me. When we got to year 11, she had other closer friends which I don’t mind at all, I have my own friends that I don’t share with her. 

One thing you need to know about Anne is that she’s really introverted and prefers to be friends with girls than boys. me on the other hand had a balance of boys and girls, both who know each other and are close friends.

Anne is a very pretty girl and it’s no surprise any guy would fall for her. Anne recently had an unpleasant encounter with Dan, who tried to initiate a relationship with her despite her lack of interest. She told me he was creepy and ugly, but because I didn't know Dan personally, I decided against making negative comments about his character or appearance.

I was a “I have no enemies” type of gal.

Eventually Dan started to follow Anne around (I don’t know the full story so I’m going with Anne’s words) and asking if he can get her WhatsApp. She said no but he kept insisting. Anne eventually rejected Dan harshly so she wouldn’t have to deal with him. it was BAD. And so he stopped, I haven’t heard anything else from Anne.

Fast-forward to a few months later, my friend Andrew was sitting next to Dan. Dan and Andrew were pretty chill and I had no one to talk to so we three chatted about our day. Dan knew my friend, Randall. Randall and I are friends too. There was nothing going on and I didn’t really wanna judge Dan for the past things because it doesn’t affect me.

when I got home, Anne texted me and was panicking about how I was talking to Dan and called him a stalker guy throughout the conversation. I do see where she’s coming from and she said if I was gonna be friends with him. I thought of him as a friend of a friend because frankly, “everyone who’s a friend of Randall is a friend of mine.” Even Dan felt a regret in his decisions which I find very respectable. Sometimes people put the blame on the other party instead of taking accountability.

When I said that, she said that “it’s not ok to make someone uncomfortable especially opposite sex” which I agree and stood by her point. But what was hypocritical is that she hangs out with one of the girls that make me uncomfortable but I never really minded it because it’s her life. And also it’s confusing because she’s uncomfortable with every guy in the school.

Now, she told me that if I talked to stalker guy, she would drop me. I never understood why someone had to drop a 12 year friendship over a wrong turn of events. But she just chalked it down to making sure he doesn’t follow me on instagram. Ofcourse I don’t see Dan as my friend because I knew him for 2 days.

"AITA for humiliating my bully brother? Long story short my older brother (29M) has made my (27F) like hell since we were kids. I’ve honestly lost count of how many times he humiliated me or treated me horribly. Once he moved away I was so relieved and knew I could move on with my life and only have to see him at some family events. My parents would tell him to stop but mostly just ignored it.
   That all changed when he moved back to our hometown and decided to go back to treating me the way he had our entire lives. I don’t know why he hates me. Anyway a couple of years ago I met a wonderful man (26M) and his family who have become like a second family to me. His siblings (32F, 28M and 23F) have become like real siblings to me. And his parents are so kind and treat me amazingly.
    My partner and I recently got married a month ago and even though I didn’t want to invite my brother I was talked into it by my family so I did. His family knows about my relationship with him and don’t like him at all either. Well the wedding was amazing and I was able to avoid him mostly but as the wedding went on he got very wasted. He got so drunk that we didn’t think he could make it back to his place so my brother in law drove him back to our home. 
   The next morning before my husband and I got ready to go on our honeymoon I went to wake him up and tell him to leave. When I walked into the spare room he was passed out completely naked. Only his butt was exposed and I’ll admit I started to laugh pretty hard. I went to get my husband and he saw and took out his phone and took a picture(I know it’s wrong to take a picture of someone like that but he is so horrible so I didn’t feel bad) after I tried to wake him up he rolled over and we saw everything and my husband took another picture. Eventually he woke up to our laughing and freaked out yelling horrible names at both of us. I should mention that there wasn’t much to see his penis was incredibly small which I think explains a lot. I tried to stop him from running out of the room naked but he didn’t listen and ran into my husbands entire family having breakfast. 
   Needless to say everyone got a good laugh at his expense and I’m not going to lie I did too. He ran out to his car and left and I haven’t heard from him yet. My husband did show the pics he took but I made him send them to me and delete them. I told my brother I won’t show anyone and I’ve talked to the family to keep things a secret. But I told him he needs to treat me with respect and bullying is over and if he can’t follow those rules that I can’t control what they tell people and where those pics end up. I feel bad for the situation but I also feel like he caused it himself and deserves it. Maybe I should get rid of the pics? Idk

"AITA for telling another dad that his kids are weird because they're homeschooled? We had this family move across the street who coincidentally has boys the same age as mine -14, 10, and 6. Unfortunately the kids are homeschooled so my kids wouldn't be able to find them into the social fold.

I arranged a playdate last weekend for the 14yos to hangout and my son was clearly uncomfortable with the other kid. The other kid said he wasn't allowed to play video games or anything that wasn't organic. Now I'm a pretty involved dad but even that was odd. Basically this kid wanted to teach my son about his trumpet and  talk about Legos. It was like watching my 14yo try to play with a 10yo.

After a few hours, the other kid left and my son quickly went to his friend's house. I saw this kid's dad and he asked me if everything was good between the boys. I said I assumed so. He said his son asked if he wanted to hangout on Superbowl Sunday and my son said no as he was having friends over. He asked if he could come over and my son said no.

I asked my son and he said the other kid was weird and made him feel uncomfortable. Fair enough. I went back to the dad and asked if his kids have friends outside the family. He asked why and I said they're not social. I'm not trying to be mean but they don't know how to interact with other kids. 

He said they were mature for their age. I said, dude, you comb your 14yo son's hair. Like I can't force my kid to be friends with your kid because he's so unlike other boys his age. He said ""are you saying my son is weird because he's homeschooled?""

I said, yeah. I'm not a perfect dad and neither are my kids. I'm just saying your son is glib on what other kids his age like. He can hangout with my 10yo if he likes.

I planned a small day trip to the city outskirts, picked a decent restaurant, etc. I also got him a small inexpensive but personal gift, and felt a little bad when I realised he didn't get me anything. For me, 'low-key' meant that we don't go all out - but it never meant that we don't do anything for each other at all. Even a flower or a little note would've been nice, imo. He was nothing but sweet all day, but I just couldn't let go of the thought that he didn't feel the need to make the day special for me :/",0.98
"AITA for being incredibly insulted that my 12 year old niece and brother-in-law are attending my niece's softball game instead of coming to my wedding? I (33M) am getting married this spring to my fiance (31F). We're having a cultural ceremony with family only in a few months. All of our family has had about a year's notice on the exact date for planning purposes. I just found out from my older sister that their family decided to have her oldest daughter (my 12 year old niece) and my brother-in-law attend her softball game that day instead of our cultural ceremonies. As an aside, she regularly has softball games throughout the year. There was no apology and no discussion, my sister just relayed to me that this was a ""difficult decision"" and that they were trying to ""do their best"". She told me that at least she and her other two children would be representing her family at the wedding. I was honestly so shocked and offended in the moment that I didn't know what to say.",0.78
"AITA If My (22F) Boyfriend (24M) Told Me to Work More I’m (22F) a senior in college getting my Biochem degree and my boyfriend (24M) graduated with his Psychology degree w an Art minor last Fall. Our rent is usually 680ish, and is rising to $800. I wanted to move because I can’t afford the rent here anymore and he told me to just work more hours.

I tried to explain to him that with my lab work and research+ 17 hours in classes and 3 labs(which count for 0 credits), I legitimately will fail if I work more. My GPA is already in the toilet, and I currently work 22-25 hours a week.

He told me that I should “just stop buying things then.” The last thing I bought for myself other than food was a printer, almost 9 months ago, and two bras and a pair of Sketchers. 

He then went on to explain how he understood how hard it is and he still worked 25 hours a week while getting his degree. I don’t want to put him down, but I sincerely doubt he had to put as much time and effort into getting his degree that I do for mine. Him telling me to just “deal with it” essentially is severely hurting our relationship. 

I really don’t understand why we couldn’t move somewhere cheaper, and I know if I move out by myself our relationship would end. He said he didn’t want to go through the hassle of moving everything to another apartment, and that our friend already resigned the lease here so he has to too. He also got some of his other friends to replace our old roommates. I understand sticking to your friends, but I also made a list of apartments for him to look at FOUR MONTHS AGO. BEFORE anyone had signed here. I looked for apartments that were cheaper for ALL OF US!

"AITA for getting my engagement ring from someone who said I’m sorry for missing our coffee date? Hi all M34 with a gf31, looking to get an engagement ring for my gf who is aware of what is going to happen but it’s discussed just the final ring is a surprise have had a fall out because the person I am sorting out the ring with is an ex colleague who said “I’m sorry I missed our coffee date”, which was around meeting up to discuss her family’s jewelry business sorting me out ‘mates rates’ on getting the ring. 

This all kicked off because in the morning for the first time in our relationship I hid my phone while checking a WhatsApp from my ex collegues brother (runs their family jewelry biz) as he said he would send me rough ideas on pricing in the evening. 

I don’t check WhatsApp’s in the evening as I live in the UAE where people use WhatsApp interchangeably between business and personal communication, and I do not want to see anything from work while I am at home as it’ll get me thinking about work, something which I focus on from around 715 in the morning till 6ish pm. 

I had a strange feeling that that would be the one day that my gf would check my phone when I woke up so I took it to the kitchen while I made breakfast. This caused a days worth of WhatsApp drama while both of us were at work. I told her why I took my phone and why I hid it when asked as I had information. About the ring on my phone etc. 

I acknowledge this is not usually behavior within our relationship but also jovially tried to shut it down. We went out for a couple post work beers for a chat it seemed sorted and a line as an apparent bluff came from my gf about see you at 530 for a chat at chick point I said you’ve seen my phone that is bs, the only thing I think you could of kicked off about was because my ex colleague said I’m sorry I missed our coffee date. 

For reference my ex col is a female, way younger than me, has briefly met my gf and is of a different nationality that is heavily focused on marrying within her nationality. 

I was looking for mates rates, feel like I was being overly honest in the scenario and had the come back from my gf of “your dead to me” which was the booze talking .. I think! 

Anyway we both always joke about putting an argument up on here so I am looking for feedback if it’s me or her.

"AITA for buying my uncle a phone he can’t use? In late September 2023, my boyfriend & I travelled to Canada (i don’t live very far from the border)

My boyfriend had the intention of purchasing new iPhones from Canada to get the SIM card slot, which would make it much easier to get access in foreign countries. I told my family in our family group chat and told them all the pros and my uncle who’s been wanting an iPhone was interested anyway. I didn’t force or encourage anyone buy anything.

I hadn’t realized not all carriers whitelist and blacklist phones, but he had T-Mobile which whitelists Canadian iPhone IMEIs.

He was super excited for it when we delivered it to him but he admitted that he wouldn’t open it until closer to Christmas. Okay, that shouldn’t have been an issue. Little did we know, he switched from T-Mobile to Spectrum around the same time as opening it. But Spectrum has blacklisted his new phone. He can’t use it and I feel super bad but I didn’t know this would be the case.

I don’t think I’m in the wrong since I didn’t know he would switch carriers or force him into purchasing it. We were trying to be helpful by buying a sim tray phone there.

"AITA for punishing my son for refusing to answer a question? In our household, we have a very firm rule that eating must be done in the kitchen.  This helps ensure that our living room remains clean.  Since we have carpet, not hardwood floors or tile, it would be a major undertaking to get the stains out if an entire plate of food or a drink were ever spilled on it.  My 6-year-old son (we'll call him Eric) has been testing my wife and I's boundaries on this lately, though, and it resulted in a meltdown last night.

Eric doesn't understand the rule because he has extremely low self-awareness.  He thinks that he eats cleanly enough, but the reality is that he often leaves a mess because he's not paying attention to what he's doing.  Well, I was finishing up a show I was watching in the living room, and I told my wife that I would come get dinner afterwards.  She was serving Eric a plateful of food (it was spaghetti night), and he came into the family room because I was sitting there.  This was pretty stupid, in my opinion, because I didn't even have a plate of food, but in he came anyway.  Well, surprise surprise, he lost his footing, and he spilled pasta and red sauce all over our carpeting.  When I saw what he had done, I was understandably furious at him, but instead of telling him what he'd done wrong and what to do in the future, I decided it would be better to have him fess up to it by asking him a series of tough questions.

When we'd gotten the food off the floor, I sat him down at the table and asked ""What is the rule that I have repeated about where to eat?""  He was looking down and said ""In the kitchen.""  I said ""And where did you just bring your food?""  At this point, he knew where this was going, and he got defensive, offering excuse after excuse for why he was allowed to violate the rule this time.  I kept repeating the question over and over again and completely ignored his excuses.  It soon became apparent to him that he wasn't going to manipulate me and that I would ask the question as many times as it took to get an answer out of him.  He turned red and started to tear up, but he still wouldn't answer the question.  I did what any parent would do.  I put him in timeout and said that when he was ready to answer the question, he could come out of his room.  At this point, he was having a full-scale meltdown, and I knew that if I could get him to eventually respond to me, he wouldn't throw up excuses the next time he decided to act like a little nitwit.

Well, after an hour in his room, I came back and calmly asked if he was ready to answer the question that he had so rudely ignored multiple times.  He tried apologizing, but I told him that I would only accept his apology after he answered my question.  He got really angry at this point and started throwing things, and this morning before school he still wasn't ready to answer the question.  My wife is telling me to let it go, but I think she is weak.  I just don't understand why my son is being so stubborn.  AITA?",0.9
"AITA for pushing my girlfriend to achieve her goals? My girlfriend (24f) and I (24m) have been together for 7 years. We've lived together for nearly 2 years now after graduating college and both work full time. In our 7 years together, we've only been ""on a break"" or ""broken up"" for a week due to reasons not related to this post. I only say this to say the last 7 years has been incredibly smooth and has had very few fights, arguments, or even disagreements. I love her dearly and would like to propose to her some time this year.

With that being said, there is one argument/discussion/whatever you want to call it, that comes every so often. And it goes like so. She will make comments to me like,

""I don't like the way I look, I want to lose weight.""

Or,

"" I want to get rid of some of my things, the clutter is stressing me out.""

And so on. So, being the problem solver that I am, offer advice on how she could accomplish these things. I've offered to help her go through her things and help decide on what she really wanted to keep and what to get rid of. I've mentioned the ""10 second rule"" (might just be something I made up but it works for me) where if you look at something for 10 seconds and can't think of a reason to keep it then you probably don't need it.

On the subject of weight loss, I've done as much as creating a week long workout plan that would achieve her goals slowly without it being too extreme or strenuous, and as little as suggesting doing 100 squats throughout the course of the day, or walking X amount of miles a week. Little things that could make her more active without dedicating a large chunk of time out of her day. I'm no fitness expert but I've been working on losing weight and gaining some muscle myself over the past three years, so I know what has and hasn't worked for me.

She hears my advice, even agrees that she thinks it will help. Days go by, she might try some of the things I suggest for a week or so, then totally stop. After a couple weeks I might ask ""How's your cleanup going?"" Or ""You get your squats/miles in this week?"" Just asking how it's going, and she sounds like I've reminded her that she has to do something she doesn't want to do. I'll drop it altogether eventually until she complains or makes the same comments weeks/months later and the cycle starts again.

I've made it very clear to her many times that this is not me putting an expectation on her, but me simply trying to help her reach her own goals that she says she wants to achieve. On several occasions, I've said. ""If you want my advice I'm glad to give it, but if you don't please say so and I will leave you to it."" And she always says she wants and appreciates my advice, but then a week to a month later, will disregard it again. It's incredibly frustrating to watch someone you care so much about live in a self destructive cycle like this. The longer it goes on, the more I wonder if I'm in the wrong or overstepping.",0.26
"WIBTA if I told my mom she can get my student loan payments from my brother? I (41F) am the youngest of 3 and the only one to go straight to college after HS. I didn't get much in the way of financial aid so both I and my parents took out student loans to pay for my degree. At the time I made a verbal agreement with my mom that when I got out of school and had a good job I'd take over payments on her parent-plus loans. Well, between multiple financial crises and stagnant wages it's taken me almost 2 decades to finally achieve financial stability. last summer I landed my dream job and my mom has started dropping hints that I should pay her back the loans.

My brother and his wife got divorced a few years ago, they had 3 kids. Their oldest is married and doing well. The middle kid worked hard and is putting herself through community college with no help her parents. But their youngest has basically been abandoned by my bro and his ex (both having moved on to knew spouses and families) and is depressed and failing high school because of the neglect. My partner and I love our nieces dearly and want them to succeed. So we've offered to help the middle kid pay for university which she'll be starting in the fall, and we're looking at the possibility of moving the youngest in with us for the rest of high school. 

So WIBTA if I told my mom that I'm paying it forward to her son's kids and if she wants to be paid back for my student loans she can get the money from him? 

**Important context:** My parents were always super lenient on my brother. He'd mess up over and over but get nothing but hand holding. For example when he vandalized his middle school my parents made a deal with the school to get him out of suspension. When he shot out a window with a pellet gun my parents paid for window and talked the owner into not pressing charges. He got a scolding for his C- grades but I was threatened with having my activities and car taken away if my grades slipped below A-. Even today my mom makes excuses for my brother's shitty parenting and tries to blame everything on his ex. Her parenting of him is a big part of why he sucks at being a parent himself.

My mom does not need the money. She's financially stable at the moment, and she's paid off the loan in question. That being said she's horrible with money, recently retired and bought a house that's both too expensive and too big for her. I fully expect her to run out of retirement funds at which time I'll likely be supporting her. If I pay back the loans now she'll spend it rather than save. Which means regardless of my paying her back now I'll be paying for her life later.

"AITA for getting my son out of the house ? AITA for my toddler son getting sick?

"AITA for how I responded when I thought my partner was lying So I have been seeing my ex again. We ended our 4yr relationship a couple years ago because of his cheating. After a couple years, we both matured and done a lot of different things and have decided to give our relationship a 2nd shot. 

I will say with him I feel more vulnerable everyday. I’m slowly starting to fall in love with him again, which is good, but falling in love again also scares me because of how it ended up before. We are also nearing the anniversary of when we broke up (which happened to be Valentine’s Day, that was the day I found out) so my nerves have been all over the place. This is also the first year I planned on celebrating valentines day since we broke up.

Now to the issue. Today I left class at 5:20, he leaves class at 5pm. He texted me a couple minutes after 5 saying he just got out. I called him around 5:25 and he was already home. We were talking and planning on going out to eat and to smoke some MJ after we eat. I asked him when do you want to go the dispensary to get MJ. He said he already got it. That took me by surprise because I know he was home all morning until he went to class and when he got out of class, I thought he went straight home from what I was told . It’s also fair to say the dispo is 20 min from his school and his house 15 min from the dispo so in my head I’m doing all the calculations on how he managed to drive from school to the dispo to home in less then 30 min. I questioned him calmly, saying it’s no way he could of went to the dispo after school if he got out at 5. He then blew up at me and said I nitpick at everything he says and always assumes hes lying. I got upset at how quickly he got mad at my question so I hung up the phone. I texted him that blowing up like that is red flag behavior when it was a simple question. If he’s telling the truth, why are you mad when I ask? I did then imply that he’s hiding something if he wants to blow up like that.

He then texted me a picture of some Valentine’s Day presents saying he had left school early to surprise me to ask me to be his valentine but I ruined it by trying to accuse him of stuff. Now I feel bad I ruined the surprise but I instantly could tell he was lying to me and that’s what irritated me, so am I really the AH?",0.5
"AITA for skipping my friends snaps? My friend works at an early childcare centre and will often (almost everyday) snapchat me videos of the kids playing with her and doing her planned activities. (Sometimes it will be like 10 videos through out the day). I told her that I skip those snapchats because why would I want to watch videos of random kids playing that I've never met? 

She got really upset and said that I should care because some of those kids come from abusive households and therefore I should care about them. I never said I don't care about the wellbeing of the children but what does me watching snapchats of them do?... it does nothing.

"AITA for ""being rude"" to a classmate and refusing to share my notes? I (23f) am in my second year of college and after midterms, we started a new semester with new teachers on subjects that are rumored to be very hard by previous students from my same major. 

There is a specific subject which is confirmed by students to be one of the hardest ones to pass in the whole degree, so I decided to start paying extra attention to this class, taking notes, doing extracurriculars, etc. just because it turns out that it is a really hard subject. 

Anyways, we have a group chat formed by students from my same year and we don't know each other very well, I have my group of friends but there are many people whom I only know by name there. We generally use the group chat to ask for general information and stuff.

Yesterday I got a text from a girl I only knew by name, I didn't have her number saved but I usually see her at a café in campus skipping class, and I have never seen her attend any of my same classes. She basically asked me if I could share my notes from that specific class. I said that I've been working my ass off to get these notes and that I don't know her like that in order for her to be asking me out of nowhere. She offered to pay and I still said no because it would basically mean that I would be still working my ass off only for her to do nothing and still get the notes. 

She basically called me rude and an asshole, and I doubled down by saying that if she wants to pass she has to put in the work herself. I am by no means a competitive person and have no problem sharing my notes with my friends or people I know, but this just seemed out of the blue.

"AITA for having screen time on my kid’s phone? (43F) and my husband (45M) have a son (15m) and this applies to him. I was washing his clothes yesterday and found 2 vapes. He said one is his and one is his friends. Husband and I grounded him for 2 weeks. Said grounding would start the next day so he could still take his girlfriend to dinner for her birthday. Grounding consists of no hanging out with friends on school nights, no tv or xbox (just the ones in the downstairs living room which he is the only one in the house that uses the space and he still has access to the main living room tv) bedroom tv only from 9-10 pm as he likes to fall asleep to it and limited phone use, no social media or games, he can still call, text, and use school related apps. And we would talk about tv time for week two depending on how week one goes. 

He said we are being too harsh and he’s almost 16 so he shouldn’t have screen time restrictions anyway since no other kids his age have it. Which I kind of agree with to a point but we have it on there because when he had free reign, he got in legal trouble for things he was doing with his phone, the police were involved, it was a whole thing. I felt like I had failed as a parent at that point, and he went on lockdown he was 13. I have loosened up for a while but last summer he started hanging out with a different crowd of kids and was sneaking out, stealing from us. There was an incident a couple months ago and the neighbors called the police, and he went juvenile detention for the night. He is in counseling, but he doesn’t take it seriously, as he doesn’t think he has a problem, I’m the problem for being too strict according to him. I just don’t know what to do.   


I feel like I’m being pretty lenient, given his past but now I’m not sure. I do know his code to look at his phone, but I haven’t snooped since his legal issue. I know most kids don’t have screen time and it’s mostly for little kids which might make MTA but he has a past. AITA for still having screen time on his phone?",0.42
"AITA for not grabbing my ski boots? AITA for not grabbing my ski boots?
This feels really dumb, but this is making me really upset and I need unbiased perspective. So, I (25f) live with my boyfriend (27m) of 4.5 years. We live near a ski mountain and decided to take off school/work respectively this week to do a day trip to ski on Wednesday. 

The day before leaving (yesterday), I got all of my stuff together. I take out my ski bag from the closet in his office and bring it to our bedroom for the morning, but I leave my ski boots with his ski boots and ski bag on the floor of his office. My boots were directly next to his, touching them.

So morning comes, I wake up early to take our dogs for an hour walk, he does some work, I make breakfast, fill our water bottles, he packs the car, his friend comes over, and we are ready to go. I give our dogs a treat, grab my ski bag, see my skis and poles in the (already packed) trunk, and we go.

He has always been the one to load the car when we do things - he likes to do it his way and I am fine letting him. It benefits me.

An hour into the 1.5 hour drive I jokingly ask if he grabbed my boots. Turns out, he didn’t. I can’t believe what I’m hearing. How is this possible? I put them in your pile last night? You grabbed everything that belongs to you and leave my shoes behind? Why? I would obviously need them!

I had to pay for rentals, they sucked, I only skied one run because my legs really hurt from the boots, and it’s just been a bummer.

He is insistent this is not his fault and that I take responsibility for not checking with him before we left that he put them in the car.

My stance is he loaded my skis and poles without telling me, and all of his stuff from his pile (which my boots were next to, touching his boots!!). I agree that I should have checked before we left, but I left it with his things to be brought to the car. Why would he just leave it behind? I would never just leave one item behind and hope he remembers? 

I think my upset is stemming from feeling like he abandoned me and left me to fend for myself, and it is him being a bad partner. And that’s where my brain goes. What else would you just leave behind and risk me losing out on? Where is the line drawn for him in terms of “responsibility” for me and my items/experiences, because it’s obviously not the same as where my line is.

We’re not married but we are probably getting engaged this year. We talk about the future and our relationship often. We also both WFH so are together constantly. I need to feel like he has my back. If I approach this topic seriously he’ll hear me out, but it’s confusing me he thinks I’m SO WRONG to think it’s his fault my boots didn’t make it in the car. But I also recognize I should have checked. But they were in the pile!!!
Tell me Reddit. AITA?

"AITA for saying I won’t go on family vacations unless my boyfriend does? I (f24) and my boyfriend (M26) are high school sweet hearts and have been together 8 years. Because of college, covid and then life events, we have not been able to move in with each other yet. We plan to be moved into an apartment by late spring or early summer. (If your wondering why we aren’t engaged, I said I didn’t want to till we move in together since we both still live with our families).

Through the years, I have gone on one family trip with his family but they have invited me multiple times on their trips which I was unable to go to due to work or timing. My family on the other hand have been on many trips but not once have I been able to invite him. Some of these trips are just a few hours upstate for a week so not far or expensive. I’ve tried asking my mom why we don’t invite him before and she just says it would mess up the dynamic of just the core 4 of us. That I wouldn’t spend time with my sister, who calls my boyfriend her brother because he has been there since she started middle school and they love each other. 

My parents are currently planning a big trip to possibly Italy. I have said multiple times that if I am moved in with my bf, then he has to come along or else I won’t go. She doesn’t seem to understand my reasoning at all behind this. I have told her that while he knows they both love him, my bf feels left out.

I grew up as a white upper middle class girl who didn’t have to worry much about money. He grew up with parents that immigrated from the Philippines and both worked constantly. While my mom had a similar childhood to his, she can’t seem to see how this looks classist and rude from my perspective. I understand a big trip like going out of the states, they wouldn’t invite him on but he’s not invited ever. If he had been invited before on trips then I wouldn’t be making a fuss but it’s the fact that he never has and I don’t know if my family ever will invite him. AITA?",0.74
"AITA FB marketplace negotiation Context: Seller $90 Hi hat stand (part of a drum set to hold cymbals) 

Has two poor quality pictures with the top no visible.

Me: Hi, would you be open to $40? Does it have the stand felts still?

Him: I don't know what stand felts are,  I wouldn't take an insult offer like  that

FYI has been a professional full-time musician for 45 years and I've never heard of a stand felt.

Me: Congrats man. You could have A) included the top of the stand in the pic or B) just googled what a cymbal stand felt is to figure it out instead of getting insulted. I'll just get a brand new iron cobra stand for $100. Good luck (I attached an image of a cymbal felt)

"AITA for discussing a fight with my gf with a shared friend? Gonna try and keep this super short because I'd really like some opinions here.

Me (they/them) and my gf (she/her) both have  a mutual best friend. We all met as friends so nobody's third wheeling, we all hang out together and individually, and we have been friends for years. Mentioning this to avoid any weird comments abt how ""these situations can never work when there's three people!""

A while ago, me and my gf had a pretty massive fight. It really hurt us both, and although we're good now we kinda just agreed to disagree. I confided in our mutual friend about it and I sorta assumed she'd do the same since although no hurtful words were exchanged, we were both very hurt.

Skip a week later, our mutual friend kinda casually brings up that fight since it was relevant to the conversation. My gf's mood very suddenly changes and she stops talking, which she usually does when she's upset (with me or in general). Once our friend leaves, she asks ""why did you tell [friend] about our fight?"" to which I tell her what I mentioned above (hurt, confiding, assumed she'd do the same).

She got really mad about it, told me it would ruin her friendship with him and her social reputation. I was confused at first, even asking her why she didn't talk to him also. She then said she would never do that to me, and that my ""higher social status"" meant that if I ""talked badly about her"" then ""everyone would turn against her"" 
She also said she ""already thought [friend] was acting off"" and told me to stop doing this. This upset me, because I thought if anything I should confide in someone who knew her personally and who wouldn't turn against her or judge her. I told her I wasn't gonna stop talking about my feelings, and she got mad. We talked it out, but she stands by her point. 

I personally believe she reacted this way because she's a very paranoid person due to trauma and because she has BPD. She was only recently diagnosed, so she isn't always self aware of things like splits or other common BPD behaviours. I obviously didn't say that, because I didn't want her to feel even more invalidated. I wanted to ask people's opinions before starting this conversation back up, and if I should really not be having these discussions with shared close friends or if this is another one of those ""set boundaries with BPD'ers"" thing

"AITA for taking a minute to realize my fiancé is talking? 
 

Sometimes when my fiancé and I are sitting in the room or car together but doing our own thing he will start talking and I will not notice. It will take a sentences/ few seconds for me to take notice that he is talking. I usually miss the first part of what he is saying and say “what did you say?” He gets really annoyed when this happens.

 I apologize and feel bad but I just don’t know how to stop. I’m not doing it intentionally. I get focused on what I’m doing. Just apologizing isn’t usually enough. He gets in an annoyed mood and refuses to tell me what he said. I got tired of battles over this issue doI asked if he can get say my name and get my attention before he starts talking out of the blue and that I think getting hyper focused on what I’m doing (reading, getting tasks done, ect.) is an ADHD thing. 

He says he shouldn’t have to get my attention and that if it’s an ADHD thing I need to be medicated. But nothing else about my ADHD bothers me (or him) and I have taken meds before and I didn’t like the way they made me feel. He is very upset and insistent that i’m being unreasonable.

"AITA refusing to donate to my old friend for his mission trip at church? One of my old friends from college reached out  to me after about 6 months or so without talking. Nothing bad just life I guess. We both graduated and went our separate ways in life. Since then he got involved with mission trips at church and in the past I was donating to his trips. My financial situation since then has worsened a bit, but could still probably donate if I wanted to. Part of me just feels like now he just reaches out periodically but can sense his motives are all about getting funding for his trips. I cut off from donating now and he keeps on reaching out every so months to talk about his mission and stuff and is nice but it’s hard for me to want to resume donating since I feel like that’s the only reason he’s reaching out to me. 

In summary am I the asshole for cutting it off and saying not donating to his church and helping kids in Africa anymore?  Just feel more used for my money than our old friendship.",0.07
"AITA if I(28M) told my mom(49F) I wasn't sure about inviting her and her new family to the wedding due to past? My dad passed away when I was 5 years old. It shouldn't come as a surprise that I was really close with my mother after him passing away. We were each other's close friend. My mom rarely went on dates (even though I asked her to), so it was just me and  her.

After high school I was working at my security job while living at home. One day I come home to my mom being involved with a guy(let's call him Jack)  that seemed to be around my age. I ""officially"" met him a week later. He was revealed to be 22 (I was 21 at the time) and apparently him and my mom were in a year long relationship already. They were in the same MBA program. 

My mom and I were just practically roommates after that.  She seemed too distant for the past year which seemed to make sense why but our relationship even further deteriorated. I'll admit I was overly reliant on my mother emotionally and financially, but both of them seemed to treat me like a hindrance that they needed to overcome. My mom would barely make any time with me even though I lived with her. Jack seemed to look down on me due to my profession and  the fact I was living with my mom. 

The wedding happened a year later. I only went out of respect for my mom even though Jack and his loved ones treated me like a pariah. I moved out a month after their honeymoon. I rented a room with my mom helping with expenses here and there. My got pregnant at 44 years old with twins. I tried as often as I could but Jack watched me like a hawk. I overheard them talking about ""doing things right this time"".

I wanted to talk about how I feel about Jack with my mother.  It was bad idea  because she dismissed how I felt and said she would always side with him due to him being her husband. After that argument, we didn't talk about for 5 weeks. I got a call about how she misses me and hoped I would get over it. I decided to distance myself from my mom and improve my life. This time, my mother was the one calling once a week to talk to me. I was short but cordial. I rarely called but only on occasions. I eventually went back to school and got a degree in computer science. I landed a nice well paying job two years ago. 

A week ago, I proposed to my fiance. My mother asked if she could come visit us with her family. I said yes. She seemed super excited for me and asked me about when and were is the wedding. I told her it was in Hawaii. She joked about never going to a  wedding before with tikis. I decided to be upfront with her by wasn't I'm not sure if I am going to invite her and her family. She was in shock and asked why. I told  her it would be a happy day for me and I don't want her and her family to come as I still have issues with them and they would be a constant reminder of that. She said ""okay"" and they sobbed in a way that I have never seen before. Jack found her crying and got her out of there with the kids.

"AITA for picking my college friend’s wedding over my childhood friend’s wedding Bridesmaid for 2 weddings on the same day

So I am a bridesmaid for 2 weddings. One is local (Dallas, TX) and the other is destination in Miami, FL. They both are on the same day. 

To simplify things, I am calling the girls Dallas and Miami. 

Dallas is a childhood friend. We were also college roommates for a year. We don’t see each other as often but when we do, it’s just like old times. So many memories. Dallas is also one of the sweetest people in my life. 

Miami is a college friend (different friend group than Dallas). We grew closer after college. Miami actually plans my birthday every year. Our friend group is 6 girls and we are so close. Like all girl friend groups, there is drama, but we always remain best friends. We all hang out all the time. All of my girlfriends from college are also bridesmaids for Miami. My husband is friends with their boyfriends/husbands, so he prefers this wedding by a mile. 

Miami told me her wedding date first at a group dinner but did not put a deposit. I inform Dallas the next day, who then tells me she was planning for the same day. There isn’t much overlap in the weddings as far as mutual friends; however, me and another girl are bridesmaids for both. 

After hearing this, Dallas tried to pick the week before Miamis wedding, but it ended up getting booked. So her only option was the same day as Miami (according to her). Dallas then put the deposit first. She then informed me and my other friend since we’re invited to both weddings as bridesmaids. My other friend tells her immediately she’s going to Miami’s wedding because they’re childhood friends. 

So after that, Dallas is hoping I go to her wedding because my other friend already picked Miami’s wedding. Also since Dallas and I are childhood friends. 

I tell her over phone that it was not easy, but I have to go to Miami’s wedding because she asked first. 

Dallas is furious at me. To the point where she doesn’t want to be friends anymore. Am I an asshole? She says she put the deposit first. Miami should change her wedding date. She can’t just call that date without a deposit. 

I understand her frustration. 2 bridesmaids not coming. I said I will make it up to her if I’m still invited to anything wedding related. But she is so mad at me. Did I do the morally right decision? 

I would have major FOMO if I missed Miamis wedding. All my friends are there and she asked me first. But Miami wouldn’t end the friendship if I choose Dallas.",0.11
"AITA My boyfriend has broke two of my tv’s… I want him to replace one! My boyfriend(35) and I(20) have been together for a year and a few months… since we have been together he has broken several things around my house due to argerness in a heated argument OR he makes a true accident. For reference of one of the situations he got mad at me for me for ft a guy NEWLY INTO THE RELATIONSHIP( not even 6 months of us being together) so we went back to MY house and I was going to talk to him, and this is the 1st experience i had with him breaking anything of mine. I wouldn’t tell him who the guy was and so after almost an hour of arguing he broke my tv. A tv my dad gifted me for christmas a few months before, the tv is almost $500…. I asked him to replace the tv after the argument and he refuses still to this day, and has always said “you were the one cheating so i’ll never pay or replace it, you lost that tv yourself”…. ok so i tried to chalk that up and after about 2-3 months of not having a tv in my bedroom due to simply seeing if he would came to conclusion…. ummm “I broke her tv, I replace it”!!!! that’s what i’ve always been taught even at a very young age. BUT NO. so…. I REPLACED IT! ok fast forward to now and TODAY he broke another tv…. THE ONE I REPLACED… $500. I am so so sick. As for this situation the tv has not been able to be put on the wall yet so it’s sitting on a long dresser style type table. fits perfect and is still beautiful where it is at and let’s not mention i have ocd, so what i’m about to say not only irks me but messes with me. When he is laying down while i’m asleep or gone to work in the mornings he will put the dresser out to an angle and have the tv slanted to where one tiny corner is suppose to hold the tv up…”55 inches lol. so i’ve told him time and time again… you can see the tv from the bed how it is but you are trying to get the perfect view…. “can you just hang it up or ill have my dad come do it”…. ok nope. let’s also add into the mix i have a 8 month old pitbull in the house and he knows he follows us in the bedroom a lot especially once i get off work. well today i walk into the bedroom less than 5 seconds the tv is coming crashing down slams into the floor…. idk if i shook the floor while walking or if my pup hit the dresser BUT HE HAD THE STUPID THING SLANTED AND OUTz visual:walk thru bedroom door, bed in middle pushed against the wall,night stand to right of bed and then the wall close to the nightstand is the tv… why the heck put it exactly in the way of the walkway…THE TV IS FULLY DAMAGED. so yea regardless to say its the dogs fault and he’s not replacing it and hasn’t said anything about it..what do i do at this point and he owes me almost 5,000 and has broke more than just that. idk what to do anymore.",0.39
"AITA for my partner setting a boundary with my siblings Today I was supposed to get dinner with my three siblings at 6:30, after I got off work. I currently live part time with my partner due to being in a medium distance relationship(we have been with each other for a little over a year). I had just gotten to my partner’s place around 5 when one of my siblings called and said “hey we’re going to come over and hang out there before dinner and we should carpool” 

I was under the impression we were going to drive separately and because i was at my partner’s I was uncomfortable how they stated they were going to come over instead of asking. For more context I come from an open door policy family and my partner does not. I had told them they needed to ask and was uncomfortable bringing it up to my partner because they have stated before how they need boundaries when it comes to my siblings because I don’t know how to set them. My siblings don’t like to hear the answer no.

 When I did bring the conversation to my parter they had said “ if they wold have asked I would have said yes but I don’t want them to think they can come over unannounced whenever they want” This is when events took a turn for the worse. I knew they were not going to like that answer. They had responded back with “ That’s weird” “ They shouldn’t be apart of our family if that’s how they are going to be” “ I don’t understand why that is an issue you are our sibling” I tried to explain to them that not everyone has an open door policy and that the apartment is my partners not mine. They continued to state they were confused and keep saying my partner is weird and shouldn’t be in the family if that’s the way it’s going to be. One of my siblings even stated they don’t want me around because I’m with my partner. 

I’m at a loss. Should I have stood up to my partner or did my siblings overreact to a situation that should have been handled differently? I am definitely the emotional one when it comes to my siblings and they know that. My partner has been nothing but nice to them the handful of times they have been around them and my siblings know how great my partner is to me, I’m confused by how this situation escalated so quickly.",0.1
"AITA for not putting away my sister's calzone that her cat ate? Petty situation that turned into a massive blow-up incoming...

My (25F) sister (26F) and I live together and have two cats, one is each of ours. They're both scroungers, and will go after any sort of food that's left out if it's got meat or cheese on it. We don't let them eat people food intentionally, but they're incessant about trying to get ahold of any scraps they can. The main issue with this is that her cat's digestive system cannot handle anything outside of his cat food.

He doesn't throw up; he has massive cat blowouts. He's a longhaired cat, so when he gets diarrhea, it's from the base of his tail down to his feet, and it's a nightmare to bathe him. So as a result, we try very hard to keep him away from people food to avoid it happening.

This is where the issue comes in. My sister brought home a calzone, offered for me to try some, and had it in its box on the kitchen counter. I tried a bite, but didn't take any more. We then left for a basketball game. The box remained on the counter for the three hours we were gone, and it was untouched by the cats.

We come home, I go to my room and stay there. She goes to her room, changes, and then leaves the apartment to go work out. She's gone for another hour, and then comes home.

She starts yelling at me from the kitchen that I left the calzone out, and the cats knocked the box over and ate some of it. It's my fault because she told me I could have it, and since I ate a bite of it before we left it became my responsibility.

I was immediately on the defensive because A) I didn't bring it home and it wasn't mine, B) It was left on the counter before we went to the game and they hadn't touched it then, and C) She saw it out on the counter before she went to the gym. 

To me, it feels like it's BOTH our faults because we left the box out. I could've put it away, but didn't think about it because it wasn't mine, and we don't have any rule in the apartment about taking a piece = becomes the taker's property. 

But she didn't listen, and was very clear that it was my fault for leaving it out. 

So I need to know, AITA? It got so weirdly angry and we were both yelling at each other, and I don't understand how the whole thing falls onto my shoulders. I feel like I'm going a little nuts and would like to know what others think.

"AITA for Saying a Woman should Keep her Legs Closed? 
I (24F) was catching up with my friend (25F) after a long time. She recently moved to a different city and was telling me about her love life. She hooked up with a guy and was semi-seriously dating him. The part about that story is that the guy she’s dating has a fucked up family life. He was raised by his aunt because the mother is basically a raging train wreck. Like she has 5 baby daddies including this guy’s father and is single and cannot financially support her other children. Also, not to add insult to the injury but none of the baby daddies are involved in their kid’s life and two of them are straight up criminals. Wow. 

I was narrating this story to my sister and I was just joking and having fun and said that I hope she (guy’s mom) keeps her legs fucking closed forever - like forever. Look, I believe I wasn’t being sexist - this was probably a jab at someone who cannot bother to practice safe sex or stay alone until they can figure things out - btw this woman is also an addict now as per my friend’s story. 

If taken out of context, my statement can be misconstrued as being judgemental and slut shaming but it was on the same level as telling a guy to keep it in his pants if he cannot wear a condom. My sister completely blew up over that and I initially didn’t think she was being serious and I told her she was overreacting to my harmless comment which was made rather privately

"AITA for not wanting to use heavy whipping cream that my girlfriend drank out of? I've been dating this girl for the better part of a year now, and in almost every aspect she is significantly more hygenic and cleanly than I am, this much I can admit.

But the ONE thing we cannot seem to agree on is that it is an ultimate taboo to drink any kind of dairy/milk from the container. She thinks this is fine.

Today I bought heavy whipping cream as a recipe we were making called for it. Before we measured any out she went to take a sip. I got upset immediately because I was in the midst of trying to explain that I had the plan of making the rest of it into whipped cream, and she got defensive saying that it would be fine to still use for whipped cream.

I think that is disgusting, the human mouth is laden with bacteria and milk/cream is the perfect medium for them to propagate instantly, even in as little as 12 hours I think that the cream or anything we make with it —that is not cooked with heat— will not be food safe. She thinks it will be fine.

"AITA for spending more time with my sick ex than my gf? This is a throwaway account as my real one contains my face and identifying info!

We'll call my ex-girlfriend Steph. Steph (24F) and I (25M) dated from junior year of college to senior year. Even though we ended things we agreed to stay friends as we have known each other since high school. 

In high school she was diagnosed with really bad thyroid cancer, though she managed to beat it and was in remission by the time we were college sophomores. Skip to late last year, the cancer came back harder than ever. She has been hospitalized ever since and having to go through numerous rounds of aggressive chemo. Often she is extremely tired and in pain as just needs somebody there with her and as she has a small circle of friends and parents in a different state, I usually am that person.

"AITA for telling my Roommates to stop scream laughing in the kitchen? I work night shift, and have been working night shift since July. As such, I sleep from morning to evening. On a good day, I sleep from 7-5, but usually I get 12-7 or worse because daylight in my room and my room is the one right next to the front door, and therefore next to the street. I am already a very light sleeper so this struggle is very real.

In the time between August-December, this wasn't an issue. My roommates would often keep to their rooms, or hang out in the common basement area, where their noise was contained and quiet. Come January, and two of my roommates have decided to forego this trend.

One roommate, let's just call her Abigail, who constantly has her BF over even though it breaks the lease, is constantly hanging out in the foyer just outside my room, and SHOUTS ACROSS THE HOUSE. Either upstairs, or down the hall. She also laughs extremely loudly and jokes around with her BF in that area of the house. I *know* she's not going anywhere because she'll go downstairs, hang about, go to the kitchen for 1 minute, go back to the foyer and hang about more, before going back upstairs.

My other roommate, let's call her Jessica, scream laughs in the kitchen all the time now too. I normally would be fine with this sudden behaviour if they weren't doing other bad roommate things.

Abigail and Jessica are constantly leaving their dishes in the sink for days at a time, with it piled up so high that no one else can do their dishes. Abigail leaves her pots/pans on the stove for convenience, and then proceeded to get mad at our other roommate, who I'll call Ulysses, for telling them she had to move it. Both Abigail and Jessica smoke weed and because we live in Canada, it's cold, so they don't want to smoke outside. Instead, they smoke in the kitchen, with the door open, causing the wind to blow their smoke into the house, which makes me wake up from the smell. They also got mad at me when I told them to stop doing that, and opening all the windows which causes the house to freeze.

So let's go back to the noise issue. I texted the group and, not wanting to call anyone specific out, said ""To whoever is laughing super loud in the kitchen, reminder that I work nights. And when you do it in the evening, reminder that some people have morning classes."" I wasn't sure which of the four roommates it was, though I was pretty sure I could guess.

Jessica DM'd me and her text boiled down to ""I pay to be here so I'm in my rights. I never complained about you, so you shouldn't complain about me. I'm moving out in 3 months, so just cope until I'm gone.""

I, tired of her BS, said ""You knew you were doing this, and kept being a problem. If you at least have your conversations downstairs, I'll stop doing what annoys you.""

She then replies ""I pay to be here, so again I'm not tip-toeing. You're the only one complaining."" I bring up Ulysses gets attacked whenever she complains, and she blocks me. AITA here? Should I just put up with her until April?",0.07
"WIBTA if I sold my extra Eras Tour ticket? TLDR: bought a €200+ for an acquaintance, but they haven’t paid me back yet. Thinking of re-selling and getting my money back (plus an extra). 

ETA: I’m not planning on selling it for 2k. I’d sell for a little more than what I paid, as I’m not trying to take advantage of the situation.

So last year I was looking for someone to go to the Taylor Swift concert with me, and an acquaintance said they would be happy to join. I kept them informed as I was trying to get tickets from anywhere in Europe. It took me a couple tries, but I managed to get 3 tickets in the end. The third was for someone else who is no longer going to go, but that’s ok as my boyfriend can join me instead. Each ticket was over 200€ which means I paid close to 700€ upfront. 

However, I have asked this acquaintance to pay me already as I had unforeseen expenses right after I got the tickets. They said they won’t pay until they have the tickets in hand (which, thanks to the company, is impossible as the tickets will only be available 10 days before the concert directly on my phone). I said it’s fair at first, but I did not know that was the case when I got the tickets. I thought they would pay me back directly. 

Anyway, I asked a couple times when I needed money, and I get angry whenever I think of that because I’d like my money back and how do I know I trust them if they don’t trust me?

We already got plane tickets to the country where we’re seeing the concert. But then I saw how much my tickets are worth online, and I was thinking of selling one and just going with my boyfriend. Or, if my acquaintance pays, I go with them and my boyfriend just goes sightseeing that day. 

However, I am getting increasingly frustrated with this acquaintance, to the point where I don’t even want to go with them anymore. And I have mental health issues and would like to have my boyfriend there to help me in the crowd and also to share that moment with.

paying me and I need the money, someone offered me 2k for that ticket online so like byeeee”?

"AITA for not wanting to attend my grandfather’s funeral? Reposting cause I hit the character limit

My mother is pressuring me for not going to my grandpa’s funeral. She admitted that she mostly wants me there to support her because she lost her father. She asked me how I expect to get close to my family if I miss events like this, but that’s not a fair argument because it’s never on purpose. I usually can’t afford to go. Besides, she moved away from the family 30 years ago when she married my father. Being in this area is all I know. 

I feel completely detached from my family most times. I grew up hundreds of miles away from them. Most of my family only checks up on me by asking my mom “How is greedy_raccoon doing?”. Rarely talking to me or texting me. I’ve tried to reach out to initiate contact with some relatives, but it’s usually pretty one-sided, so I stopped trying. I’m also autistic, so that doesn’t help me feel comfortable and like I’m part of the group. 

 I’m working full-time and going to school full-time. I already feel as though I’m at my limit with obligations. The thought of being around my massive family always gives me panic attacks before trips due to my social anxiety/phobia.

 I’m also moving back in with my mother this weekend because my roommate and I can’t afford the rent at my apartment anymore. And now this funeral is next weekend. On top of all this, paying for traveling expenses right now would completely wipe me out financially. It just seems so wasteful to pay to do all this when I can’t even afford rent and have moving expenses to cover.

the problem started when my ex asked to join us as well. I told her that she is not in the guest list that my daughter has made so therefore she is not invited but she insisted on coming with her son. I told her then I won't pay for their meals and she agreed.

the day of the birthday we went to the restaurant. my ex took one look at the menu and became visibly stressed. she said that she knew it would be expensive but not THIS expensive. she told me that she doesn't have this much money with her and this is way over her budget. I told her that this is not my problem and I'm still not paying. she ordered a glass of water for herself and a soda for her son and didn't say anything for the rest of night.

however later she called me and started yelling at me calling me a bunch of names for letting her son watch us eat",0.69
"WIBTA for canceling a work celebration after I feel people acted rudely I work for an organisation where most of the team are remote. Next week, eight of us will be in our London office for a morning event that has taken a lot of effort to organise. I decided to arrange dinner for us after work to celebrate the event. I asked everyone if they'd like to come, what food preferences, researched restaurants near us in London, and put a deposit down for a reservation. One person, let's call them Kate, later decided they would prefer to go out for lunch, but I had another meeting at the time they suggested. However, I put it to the group anyway and politely explained I personally wouldn't be able to go out at that time. I sort expected everyone would still decide to go after work so I could come - after all, I was the one who organised it. Instead, everyone agreed we should change the reservation to since that was the time Kate prefered. It means I've essentially been disinvited from the event I had organised and paid a deposit for. I'm thinking of telling them how rude that is and canceling the reservation - would I be the asshole? Or am I just being sensitive here?",0.12
"AITA for continuing to talk to someone? Basically, I matched with this girl on Tinder a while back and we got to the point where she gave me her snap. When we switched over to snap, she didn't really message me anymore on Tinder and so I left her alone on that app. Every once in a while, she'll post something on her story and I would react to it most of the time, and if it was ever a selfie I would give her a compliment like calling her pretty.

Anyways fast forward to today, I reacted to her story where she went out with some friends and I said something like she was pretty. Later she posted on her story that she hates posting on snap because creeps message her and that they all need to learn to stfu. I then reacted and said ""lol is this in reference to me? If so I'm sorry"". She opened the message, and then at the same time posted on her story again ""yall really need to learn to stfu"".

I felt sick to my stomach. And eventually she messaged me back saying I am a “very strange man.” I don’t see the point though, she matched with me, she gave me her Snapchat, and she kept me on there. Of course if I’m matched on Tinder and given a snap, I will use it. This seems like it’s her fault, but I don’t know if I’m to blame at all. AITA?",0.01
"AITA for ignoring my friend due to her low-effort birthday gift? I (24F) gifted my friend (23F) concert tickets to see Drake last year that we went to see together. This year, she treated me to a birthday dinner with us two and helped me take my photos using her phone and lighting equipment at this pretty spot she found. While choosing a restaurant, she asked about my favorite spot, and not having one, I felt pressured to pick from a list she provided, one of them being her favorite restaurant, this Brazilian steakhouse. I’m very Picky about food and really only eat chicken tenders and fries, & I thought she knew this. I was significantly late (3 hours) due to makeup issues, leading us to miss our first reservation and it became too late for a walk-in. We found another nice restaurant, but the food still wasn't much to my liking. It felt like a low-effort celebration compared to the thoughtful gift I gave her last year. I thanked her for the night but haven't spoken much since. AITA for ignoring her since that night?",0.97
"AITA for taking my son to see a speech therapist? AITA? Throwaway because my wife is on here sometimes.

Let me preface this by saying that I love and respect my (34M) wife (32F). She is a great partner and mother to our son (6M) and I’m worried that this situation is going to make her leave me. 

When I was in my twenties, I studied in Australia for a year (I am from the US). While I was there I met a fantastic woman who would later move back home with me and become my wife. 

My wife, let’s call her Amy, has a fairly strong accent. It’s not something that bothers me, but equally it’s not something I’m attracted to. She gets insecure about it sometimes because people comment on it a lot, but I always reassure her that I don’t mind. 

Amy works part-time and she is at home with our son more than I am. I don’t mind working full time to support my family, but Amy definitely ends up spending more time with him. Unfortunately because of this, our son has developed an accent that is a combination of a normal American accent, and his mother’s Australian accent. It’s not that I have a problem with it, but I’m worried it will negatively affect him if it’s the first thing people notice about him for the rest of his life.

A couple of times I have corrected his pronunciation of basic words like ‘tomato’, and Amy has taken offence to this before. Recently I decided that the problem was getting out of hand, and I organised to see a speech therapist. Because I was worried about offending Amy, I didn’t tell her about this. I told her we were spending time together doing father and son bonding activities and she thought this was great.

Well, a few weeks into our appointments my son accidentally let it slip to his mom that we had been seeing a speech therapist. Amy was furious with me and told me she needs a few days away from me to think. I told her she was overreacting but she was too upset to think straight and I’ve been spending the last couple of nights at a friend’s house. 

I honestly do think she is overreacting. Maybe I should have told her that our son’s accent was bothering me before I took him to a speech therapist but I know she would have been upset and said no. All I want is for my son to be able to communicate clearly, and now I’m worried I could actually lose my family over this.

"AITA for letting my niece give her sister a wedgie? My sister and her husband both have work trips (going to be gone for a few weeks) and they asked me to keep an eye on their daughters, they're 16 and 17. They basically want me to check in on them and come over every other day, make sure the house didn't burn down or they're not throwing a rave in the house. 

The 17 year old was mocking the 16 year old for wearing ""bikini style briefs"" and saying she should wear sexy thongs, they were being playful and whatever. Well the 17 year old kept giving the 16 year old wedgies and the 16 year old asked her to stop, at one point her underwear ripped. 

I told the 17 year old she needs to stop and she said ok. Well an hour later she does it again so I told her she needs to let her sister give her a wedgie so she knows what it feels like. She said no so I said she wouldn't get the next week's allowance. The 16 year old then gives her a wedgie so bad that the underwear rips and she pulls it over her head. She's now really angry saying those were expensive victoria's secrets and whatever. I told her if she gives her sister a wedgie, we'll be giving her one.

"AITA for calling my boyfriend sexist My boyfriend (26M) and I (27F) were talking about whether he feels like his friend who recently got a project car will now put it in more effort to hang out with him since he clearly wants help fixing it. ** Boyfriend is a mechanic **. His friend works night shift so they don’t hang out as much anymore. He said he wouldn’t feel like he’s using him or anything and went on to compare what I apparently like to do when I hang out with friends which to sum it up he said: talk about our feelings, shopping, go out to dinner. Where he would prefer to hang out in the garage fixing a car with friends than go out to dinner, which is completely fine. My issue was with the “Hang out and talk about your feelings” remark. I called him out on it and expressed that it came off kind of sexist. He claims that he was joking but I’m not 100% buying it. I told him I felt he was making assumptions on what I do when I hang out with friends, basically stereotyping. He claims he is only going off of what he has seen when I hang out with friends at home or going out to eat. AITA for calling him sexist or was that a reach?

Edit: My bf only said he was joking after 
 I expressed how it came off to me. He did not say this in a joking manner. Please take the tone into account. I don’t know why he was even comparing the two of us tbh. I was only trying to make conversation regarding him and his friend possibly hanging out more. I am not someone who coordinates shopping as an activity to hang out with friends. He knows this or so I thought.

"AITA for asking for time from my boyfriend My boyfriend was promoted and transferred to another site. We've been in a relationship for 4 years; we broke up 3 years ago but got back together. I'm happy for him and supportive of everything he wants to do, but truth be told, I felt sad when he moved sites. We don't see each other as often as before, although he consistently greets me good morning and updates me when he's on his way home from work because he knows I like it. However, we argue more often because he's too busy to plan our dates, and I'm always the one making the effort to see each other. 

When I bring up my concerns to him, I end up being portrayed as the bad one, and it becomes all about him. I feel sad because even on weekends, he needs to work. I understand that his job is his livelihood since he's the sole provider for his child, but I feel like I'm begging for his time.


 Three weeks ago, we argued because we hadn't seen each other for a month, so I suggested I shift my schedule to be with him. I stayed at his place for a week, and before he drove me home on Sunday afternoon, I asked if he could drop me off on Monday instead because I missed him. He got angry, saying he was already short on time and needed to log in to work early Monday morning, and he still had to drop me off. He even said that even if we're not together, he still feels like he can't move freely because I check his Facebook. 


Just to provide context, he gave me his Facebook password because a girl used to ride with him home, and at first, it was okay, but I was surprised when I checked his phone, and their entire conversation was deleted. That's when it started, and it got worse when he didn't know how it got deleted, so I couldn't believe him. He offered to give me his Facebook password to prove he wasn't cheating because he was cheated on by his ex, which is why he wouldn't do that to me. 


But when we argued three weeks ago, he changed his Facebook password because he said he couldn't function properly, and I allowed him. I also agreed to let him drop me off that day. Before I got out of the car, I told him I promised to understand him as long as I could, but I hope there will come a time when it's my turn. I messaged him that I'll give him space now and he can reach out to me when he's ready to talk. 


My boyfriend has an avoidant attachment style; he was cheated on and left by his ex, who was his first love, and they have a child together. I feel like he's like this because he's protecting himself from getting hurt. I love him so much, but I'm struggling. Until now, he hasn't talked to me. Am I the asshole for asking for time from my boyfriend?",0.55
"AITAH for worrying about my future with my boyfriend. I (24f) am really struggling to get past some issues with my boyfriend (28m) 

We’ve been together for 3 years and have had a few issues along the road with our relationship but have always worked things out and moved past them. 

He’s a really lovely guy, and takes good care of me and respects my feelings. The chemistry between us is great and he has a lot of characteristics that I’d seek in a relationship. 

However, he’s recently got a new job which is full on and for the past month has seen and talked me a lot less then previously. Now I’m really happy for him that he’s got this job which he loves, and I understand it’s more demanding then his previous job, but it feels like he now has no time or space for me in his life. We hardly speak during the day at all and I see him twice a week for a few hours. Where as I. Used to see him most days and he’d always talk to me on his breaks and when he got home.

I feel like a dick for feeling a bit hurt that I’m no longer a priority in his life and that he doesn’t have time to spend with me or talk to me,  when I know he’s trying to build a good career for himself? 

When we’ve discussed this problem he just says he really tries his best for me but can’t offer me any more than he already is and doesn’t see things changing at all.

I do really love him and care about him but I genuinely am worried that I’m being left behind and it hurts. Am I the asshole for feeling like this?",0.29
"AITA for telling my father that my little sister was trans a couple of years before she told him? My father is a redneck asshole. MAGAt hat and everything. He is also a great husband, father, and grandfather. 

My sister confided in me years ago about being trans and she was afraid of telling our father. 

I kept her secret for years. I got married and had kids and I still kept the secret. 

Until after the COVID lockdowns. I sat my dad down and told him that I had some news that might upset him and I needed him to remain calm. I then told him that if he wanted me and my family in his life he needed to get used to the fact that he had two daughters and a son. Not two sons and a daughter. I threatened him with something he holds dear. Me and my kids. I told him that he needed to keep it to himself. He needed to get educated about what it meant. I provided some literature and a contact with a support group for parents of trans kids. I said if he treated Chris badly or anything I would know and I would not have someone like that near my family. 

He took me at my word. He knows that I am as stubborn as he is. So for two years now he has been getting used to the idea and he didn't screw up. And he actually learned. He read the information I gave him. He went to the support group. He became friends with a couple who had a child that was bullied and ""passed away"". I think that scared the shit out of him. 

At Thanksgiving Chris came home from university with four friends. I think she was prepared for the worst. She sat down and told our dad. 

My dad told her that he loved them no matter what. And that the most important thing was that they know that he was on their corner and only wanted them to have a great and happy life. 

Chris was flabbergasted. She was ready for a screaming and maybe even physical altercation. She was not ready for unqualified support. 

Last week she found out that I had warned him in advance. She is pissed at me for taking it away from her. I think I needed to prepare my father for a situation he never considered. His brother is the exact same as him and he disowned my bi cousin. My dad actually called his nephew and invited him over for Christmas. And he told my uncle that he was welcome to come but if he started shit he was going out the door horizontally. 

My uncle didn't come. But my cousin wept when he saw the older generation hadn't abandoned him. 

I wasn't gossiping when I told my dad. I was trying to make sure Chris was okay. 

My dad will never be voting Democrat but I laughed when I heard him saying he can't vote for the party he always has because of their restrictions on people's personal freedoms. So that's a start I guess.

"AITA for hating the fact that my boyfriend has to hide our relationship I (18f) and my boyfriend who just turned(21m) have been together for almost a year now (also I'm turning 19 in a month and his 21st b-day was yesterday so only 2 year age gap). In may I would have known him for a year, he started coming over to my house around September -October of 2023 and now practically lives here and comes over all the time. The reason he comes over and I never go to his house is because his mother doesn't know about me, nore do any of his siblings. Because of his mothers dedication to her religion she doesn't believe in dating before marriage. I was a little thrown off at the beginning because I asked him ""so what I'm just gonna be your girlfriend secretly"" and he said ""it had to be that way."" I accepted but for Christmas I bought her flowers, he had to give them to her and told her ""it's from someone special."" Yesterday I was his 21st birthday that I spent a month planning, (his mom hasn't celebrated his birthday in years) so I did bought ballons, wrapped his gifts put ballons hanging from the ceiling, got him a fancy cake. He was so happy, but when he sent it to his mom he said ""my friends did this for me"" not ""my girlfriend or girl."" His pregnant cat also gave birth on this day and he said I'm gonna bring you over with his other friend and introduce you to the kittens and only claim me to his mom as a ""friend."" Yesterday I had a a few mental breakdowns about this even though it was his birthday.... I'm only 18, I'm not gonna marry him till I'm older so his moms just not gonna know about me for years. It makes me have a pit in my stomach. Maybe I'm being selfish but I've never had to hide a year long relationship from my family. It's a religious thing I understand, but how are we ever gonna do certain things if we can be together.

"AITA: for demanding my dad’s ashes be returned to me and not buried with his dad? My dad died when I was around 20. Fast forward 10 years or so, his dad died. I found out after my dad died that his dad had kept some of my dad ashes and requested they be buried with him. I was adamant that I am returned his ashes as he wanted to be spread at sea. My aunt has them and doesn’t want to go against her father’s wishes. She was willing to split them, but I feel very aversive to this. 

I am upset that they weren’t spread entirely at the funeral (as he had requested), and that if they weren’t spread, that they weren’t given to me (his only kid) in the first place. It feels like him not being spread is going against his wishes, regardless of his dads wishes. His dad wasn’t supportive of him, and despite my attempts, did not want a relationship with me which only adds to my resistance.",0.48
"AITA for wanting to live with my gf instead of my brother because of our constant arguing? I (M27) live with my brother (M27). We get along ok for the most part but we argue almost all the damn time. 

This morning, I ran the dishwasher after breakfast and I texted him (he was still asleep which is why I didn’t ask him directly) to unload the dishwasher sometime today as it was his turn to. About an hour later, instead of him saying “sure dude, I can do that.”  He attacks me saying “did you rinse the sink out? Did take the trash out? Did you run the disposal?”

Honestly, no I didn’t do those things. I was in a rush this  morning trying to get to the office. I get that it’s a bit annoying. 

I said “no I’m sorry, I was in a rush. I’ll try to work on those things in the future.” He then berates me saying I never do anything I ask him to, that he always does everything, that not doing such a simple task is ridiculous. It went on and on and on. Constant messages and voice notes about how I’m a such a terrible roommate. 

Should I be better at the chores? Yes, I admit that fully. 100%. 

But I absolutely can’t stand the constant arguing we do. He physically can not be a mature adult and respond appropriately. He always has to attack me and say what I didn’t do instead of provide a mature response like the one I mentioned above. 

Because of this constant arguing (we even argue over the fucking kitchen at times), would I be an asshole if I decide to move in with my girlfriend when our lease ends next year? We’ve been dating almost 2 years, we get along great. 

The thing is, my brother doesn’t make enough to live on his own where we live. He’ll have to find another roommate. But is that really my problem? I mentally can’t stand the constant arguing we do. All. The. Time. I can’t ask him to do one single chore without getting back talk. I’m at my wits end.

"AITA for telling my boyfriend he didn’t put any effort into my birthday? Yesterday was my birthday (22f) and I feel like my boyfriend (24m) aside from ordering me presents, didn’t put any effort into my birthday. First, let me preface this by saying we’ve been together 3 years, and I have always went above and beyond for his birthday, making sure he felt special from the time from when he woke up to the time he went to bed. My birthday was on a Wednesday this year, and I work M-F now so I was at work (he was off), he had said a few days/week earlier that since my birthday is on a weekday, we will celebrate my birthday and our anniversary (1 week after my bday) on Saturday. 

Tuesday night he asked if I wanted to open some of my presents early (they just arrived) and he gave them to me straight out of the amazon box. Wednesday, my birthday, i woke up and thought maybe he would have left a card or something but there was nothing. Got to work went about my day (7-3) and I received a happy birthday text from him around 11:30. I got home and I guess I had assumed he would have had something planned but again when i got home there wasn’t anything special. He got me a piece of cake and some chocolate strawberries from Publix. The other half of gifts from amazon came, about 4pm now, and again he gave them to me straight out of the box. I thanked him again of course, and some time later I  asked what we were going to do for dinner. (Not in a disrespectful way at all genuinely was wondering what we were going to do because I assumed we would order take out or something.) And he said something like “No why we don’t really need to do that”.

Tbh I was really upset after that. Yes, 100% I am grateful and thanked him for the gifts. But I’m upset because I really would have appreciated something more thoughtful like idk a card or a note or something in the morning or maybe if he had wrapped the presents or ordered them sooner or something. It just sucks because yeah he did say we would “celebrate” on Saturday but damn it was really disappointing that yesterday was just another day. I don’t need a 5 course meal or anything but at least having something planned would have been nice. When I brought it up I feel like he was upset because he thought I was being ungrateful. He kept saying it’s not his fault he couldn’t do anything else because he woke up late, which again proved my whole point, it doesn’t take that much effort to at least think of a plan a few days before. Like ughhhh 😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫 ended up spending the rest of the evening upset and just going back and forth trying to get him to understand where I’m coming from and feeling like I wasn’t getting anywhere.

"AITA for refusing to fight with my boyfriend? I (43F) have been dating my boyfriend, Alan (41M) for 6 mos.  I'm also currently 3.5 mos pregnant.  Prior to meeting Alan I hadn't dated in 4 years.  I was previously married and my husband was abusive.  It took a long time to heal.  But when I met Alan he made me want to date again.  Overall, Alan is extremely charming.  However, his one downfall is that he can be verbally abusive.  He will scream and yell and ask you the same thing incessantly hoping for the response he wants and when he doesn't like your answer he becomes verbally abusive and when I ask him to please stop yelling at me he ignores my pleas.  I will try to walk away to avoid the verbal attack but he will follow me around the house and accuse me of being avoidant and not wanting to face reality regarding the situation at hand.  I calmly point out that I have already answered his question, he just didn't like my answer.  It's usually at this point he kicks me out and tells me to leave.  I've noticed this happens roughly every six weeks.  I don't like to fight and due to my history of late term miscarriages I try to remain stress free as much as possible.  I also suffer from POT syndrome which can be triggered by stress.  It can cause me to become dizzy or lightheaded and even pass out.  Which the other day while he was screaming at me I became dizzy and tripped over his dog gate and step stool trying to get away from his incessant screaming and ended up falling flat on my stomach.  He always apologizes an hour later and says he over reacted.  I've asked him to seek therapy but he doesn't feel he needs it and if I say anything about his behavior he accuses me of comparing him to my ex.  His behavior is a red flag for me but I also worry that maybe due to past experience that I'm being overly sensitive.  The other thing that bothers me is the fact that 98% of his friends are female because he says he doesn't get along with men.  While there's nothing wrong with having friends of the opposite sex he is constantly talking to other women and one in particular he will drop everything at the drop of the hat if she calls or texts him.  This girl is 19 and though he says they are just friends he also ""confides"" in her a lot and made a point to tell me repeatedly last night that of he starts to have feelings for her or any of the women he confides in he'll break up with me rather than cheating.

"AITA for pushing my boyfriend to resolve an argument we had? I (25f) and my boyfriend (26m), have been arguing a lot since he left to go back to his job working on a cruise ship. The relationship is quite new, only been together a few months. We have a lot of misunderstandings that honestly could be resolved if we both weren't so quick tempered and took the time to ask the right questions. 

The problem with him working on the cruise ship is that we don't have enough time to text a lot or video chat because he's basically always working since he has to bascially live where he works and is always busy. 

We recently got into an argument because he told me that he doesn't want me commenting under his Facebook posts anymore because ""my friends don't know about him so it's the same for his friends not knowing about me"". I have repeatedly told him before that I've told my friends about his existence in my life and that we are in a relationship. I got upset and asked why they couldn't know about me and deleted all my likes and comments from his posts before he could answer. He got angry and told me that he can't deal with the situation right now and to leave him alone. It's important to know that if not now (during his work hours) then there won't be any other time because where he is with the cruise ship is 4 hours behind the time of the country I live in, so when he's off work I'm usually asleep. 

I kept pushing for him to talk to me about it and give me a reason why his friends can't know about us and then eventually he broke up with me. That was Monday and yesterday we got back together. He told me that he can't focus on work and think about our issues at the same time as it would affect his work performance but I only pushed for an answer because there would be no other time to talk about it.

"AITA for telling my dad I’m not going to neglect my family the way he did ours? My (35M) dad (65M) always claimed to be family oriented, but by that he meant his siblings. Which is good. I have 2 brothers and a sister and I’ll help them out, be there for them, etc. But my dad always took it to the next level. They always took priority. He spent many nights with them instead of us, and no we were not invited. My mom pretty much raised us our own. He missed a lot of events. The most egregious was when my sister, then only 6 years old, had major surgery and needed a lot of help recovering. My uncle decided around that time that he wanted to paint his entire house and asked my dad and other uncle to help. Instead of helping my mom, his wife, with their daughter, he did that and was barely home. 

My mom and dad often argued about this, at length. My siblings and I would express disappointment that these things took priority over us. He should hang out with extended family one on on but wished he were with us more. He told us to stop being selfish. 

I will say, when he was around, he did stress the importance of myself and my siblings getting along. He said when he and our mom were gone, we’d be all we had. In turn, we are all very close. But I do think a large part of that is we spent a lot of time raising each other alongside our mom.

Myself, one of my brothers and my sister agreed we didn’t want to be the same when we had families. My other brother, the youngest, didn’t really agree. This has lead to some issues.

I’m now married with 3 kids myself, including a newborn. My youngest brother and his wife are doing major repairs on the house. To save money, they’re doing the lion’s share themselves. But they expect that to also extend to myself and my other siblings. My sister offered to watch their kids when needed but said she couldn’t help much outside that. My older brother could help more as his kids are out of the house. I said I’d help when I can but my priority is my wife.

My younger brother recently asked me to spend the weekend helping him with repairs. It would be a lot of work, about 12 hour days. I said I could help a few hours one day but my wife is recovering from a c-section and we have the deal that I look after our older 2 (1 & 3). I have to return to work soon so I want to help her as much as I can. We have a mother’s helper when I go back to work, but for now, I’m all she has. My brother got mad and said this needs to get done and he can’t put it off. I said this is all I can offer.

He called our dad, who then called me and said I should help. When I explained my wife had no other help and couldn’t do it alone for 2 days. He said my siblings need to come first because we’re all we have. I said that’s not true. We each have families and we can’t always prioritize family. He kept arguing and I said I am not going to be him, abandoning his wife for days on end and neglecting his family. He called me an ungrateful brat. My mom says she agrees with what I’m doing but I should’ve just stuck to I wasn’t helping.

"AITA for telling a concerned friend to stfu or leave? I’m friends with Gina and Belle. We’re all in our late twenties and have been friends since college.

We all always had similar values and used to joke around about never being stay at home moms and having our own jobs and being independent. 

Now, we all got good jobs. But Belle also got married and has 3 kids. We always supported her and I’ve even babysat the kids on several occasions. I love those little guys. Gina is more awkward around them, but she adores them too. 

Belle used to work full time as a teacher until she was hurt badly by one of her students. She decided to quit and is now a stay at home mom. I could see that she was traumatized and it was best for her. Gina was more worried but I told her that situations change and Belle is a lot happier now. 

Sometimes, Gina and I will go to Belle’s house and hang out with her. Sadly, Belle is still recovering and finds it difficult to go outside some days. She usually only likes being around her children and her husband. So whenever we hang out, her children are always present (unless they’re at school). 

We decided to make cookies (Belle loves them) but one of her kids asked if we could make brownies instead. Belle said sure and I followed her lead. Gina got annoyed and said we should make cookies because we’re doing this for Belle and not her kids. I said we’ll do whatever Belle wants. She then quietly made a comment “yeah well Belle has no real identity anymore so I don’t think SHE wants anything.” 

I told her to knock it off but she got upset and said that this is what we were afraid of and it hurts to see one of her best friends lose herself for her kids and husband. I told her that this isn’t about us and she needs to stfu or leave. Gina looked as if she had more to say but left after calling me a bitch. I just told Belle that she had an emergency. It’s been a few days and Gina told me to fuck off the last time I texted her. AITA?",0.03
"AITA for getting uncomfortable from my mom going out on dates? Let me give a quick background - My mom(49f) raised me as a single mom, she got Divorced when she was in her mid 20s and due to circumstances or what, Idk she never considered getting Remarried and she never dated also. I don't have other siblings. She works as a primary school teacher. 

Now, as I've started dating. Few months ago my GF asked me about my mom's emotional/Life in general(GF is also close to my mom, like in good taking terms). She suggested me that we should talk/encourage my mom to start living, having fun, Dating again as she is pretty young and she has given up on her love life/dating etc for decades now!
As a son, honestly I've never thought about it and never talked to mom also regarding her personal life, dating etc. I agreed with my GF. 

It was awkward af for me honestly, but my GF handled the discussion and surprisingly my mom was very Frank and casual with my GF and she just went with whatever my GF was saying! GF pumped up my mom to spend money on herself, makup, clothes etc. going out. She took my mom to saloon, helped her to sign up on few dating apps(To this point I was like neutral) But now that it's few months that mom's dating. It's kinda getting awkward and uncomfortable for me and I don't even know why I am having these feelings. 

(I live adjacent to mom's apartment in a rented condo with my GF) and maybe it's because I've never seen my mom with another man in my whole life, never considered that she is also an adult, can have her own romantic relationships. Idk what..but  now I see her going out, different dudes pick her up on weekends, Mom goes out for complete nights on many days(spend night with her boyfriend) GF also encourage her, they both talk a lot about mom's dating life(I stay out mostly) Mom also created her Instagram(again my GF is behind it) and she keeps on posting pics with her dates, night out parties! Mom's kinda changed completely and it's very uncomfortable for me. I know I should be happy for her, but I am not somehow.",0.44
"AITA for refusing to cancel my plans to attend Jake's party? Jake, a 26-year-old friend of mine, recently approached me with an air of excitement, announcing that he's throwing a party to celebrate his recent job promotion. He's been through a rough patch lately, grappling with setbacks and uncertainties, so I can empathize with his eagerness to commemorate this significant milestone in his life. However, his persistent insistence that I cancel my own plans to attend his party has left me feeling deeply conflicted and somewhat perturbed.

You see, I had meticulously planned and made prior commitments to spend quality time with my family during that same weekend. Our schedules are typically packed with various commitments and obligations, leaving little room for us to come together and simply enjoy each other's company. This dedicated family time is not just a luxury but a necessity in nurturing our relationships, strengthening our bonds, and creating enduring memories that sustain us through life's trials and tribulations.

Cancelling these plans, which have been meticulously arranged and eagerly anticipated by my family, would not only disappoint them but also undermine the significant effort I've made to prioritize and safeguard our relationships. It's not merely about attending a party or maintaining a social obligation; it's about honoring the commitments I've made to the people who matter most in my life – my wife and children.

When I explained this to Jake, hoping he would understand and respect my perspective, his demeanor shifted from excitement to frustration. He became increasingly pushy, almost insistent, in his demand that I prioritize his celebration over my family time. He argued that as a close friend, I should be willing to make sacrifices for him, regardless of the implications for my own personal priorities and commitments.

Despite my repeated attempts to reason with him, gently but firmly explaining the importance of my family commitments and the limitations they impose on my availability, Jake remained steadfast in his stance. He seemed unwilling or unable to comprehend the gravity of my situation, dismissing my concerns as inconsequential compared to his desire for my presence at his party.

Feeling pressured and torn between my loyalty to my friend and my unwavering commitment to my family's well-being, I found myself grappling with a profound sense of moral and emotional conflict. In the end, after much deliberation and soul-searching, I stood firm in my decision to honor my prior commitments and uphold the sanctity of my family relationships.

However, now I'm left questioning whether I made the right choice. Am I being selfish for prioritizing my family over my friend's celebration, or was it reasonable to maintain my plans despite Jake's relentless pushiness? Please help me understand if I'm in the wrong here.",0.09
"AITA for not wanting to purchase flowers for my brother-in-laws funeral? My (51M) partner's (50F) younger brother (44M) passed away from severe organ failure due to alcohol abuse.  He was cremated and his memorial service is being held a few weeks out.   We were told he wanted money donated to a animal shelter he volunteered at - which we did, in his name.   

We were then asked if we wanted flowers at his service to call a local florist that is handling the delivery.   We did NOT want to purchase flowers, due to our previous donation and the belief they are a waste of money.   My partner's mother (73F) said she wants each kids to have flowers from each of his siblings at the front of her church next to his urn (which there are five siblings, including my wife) and if we couldn't afford the flowers, she would pay for them.  She is also having all the siblings go up to sing ""Amazing Grace"" as a group.  

He was his mom and she is grieving.  

The minimum flower for this event is $100, and we can afford to pay for it, - which I think it is just throwing away cash for something we are looking at for an hour. My partner feels the same way - however, she compromised and got three house plants, which can be a nice memorial for him, for the $100 - it's her money, mother, and brother for the sake of family harmony.

"WIBTA if I buy my brother's gf high heels? I'll keep it short, me and my brother (20 we are twins) are planning a secret birthday party for our mom's 50th birthday and I happen to see some really pretty heels while I was online shopping for her, I got her a handbag and something else however it's Valentine's Day soon and my bro asked me what should he give her and I was like perfume? Nope, Jewellery? Nah it may go bad plus budget is tight at the moment and then I said what about heels? He said nah she doesn't want to and I'm like oh noo she is the type to like these ones which I came across and he said nah she doesn't wear heels much and I'm like I'll ask her (btw she will be 19 and us 21 this year) so I did asked her on telegram cuz I don't have whatsapp at the moment or anything else other than reddit and my bro told me that she deleted it and I was like okay I will send you the ss and you send it to her and ask her if she likes them he did and well he never gave me a straight answer

So here is the thing. I didn't had my phone with me when I was ordering a custom made cake for mom and I was using his phone and used the WhatsApp cuz he told me he is okay with it and I was looking about to look for her text on WhatsApp but I was about to ask him cuz privacy right? And then I was like maybe I should go to Amazon first so that I can help him find a cute back up gift but when I unlocked his phone asking to look at Amazon he gave me and the WhatsApp was on after unlocking it, I saw her name on top of the chats and see replied to a pic with ""Wow"" I didn't opened the text because privacy so I just closed the app and now I'm thinking my bro might be insecure 
He is around 5'5, I'm 5'3 and she is like 5'6 or 5'7 I'm not sure but she is taller so what I'm assuming is that she liked the heels but my bro doesn't want her to have it??? Idk tbh but like I do want to gift her something really cute on her birthday which is in a few months and I was thinking about the heels
Oh and I did asked him if she replied after I saw a glimpse of the text and he said nah she said to tell her no cuz she looks to tall on it. I guess I will just ask her when she will help us with mom's surprise birthday party but still I'm a bit confused

"AITA for wanting to leave in-laws' family gathering early to play in my sports league? I've always played and enjoyed basketball. However, between work, wife, toddlers, and other duties, I limit myself to maximum \~2.5 hours of pick-up games on Friday and 1 hr (or close to 2 hrs if commute is factored in) on Sunday for league games at the local community center.

And it's not even every Sunday: a league season runs like 7 games (so 7 weeks), and then we're off for 2-4 weeks depending on the month, until the next season.

If there's something important that conflicts with the above, I've always given up my Friday, because they're just pick-up games. However, Sunday's league games are higher stakes, and I pay a not-insignificant amount to be in it, so if I can help it, I'd rather not miss any games.

But if it comes to it, and something really important is scheduled in advance (wedding, funeral, kids birthdays, etc), I'd begrudgingly give it up and notify my team to find another substitute for that game.

On Tuesday, my wife tells me that we're going to her family's cultural-holiday get-together on Sunday. She knows all about my league schedule, and there has been some minor conflicts in the past in regards to it.

A bit of background: my wife *hates* driving, while I don't mind it, so I've always driven us everywhere. This also includes driving her to things for which I have no interest, but do it to support her, i.e., driving her an hour each way to see her recovering aunt (whom I barely know) at the hospital.

While I like her family (and from what I can tell, they seem to like me as well), I'm not exactly close with any of them, due to distance (they all live between 1-2 hours away), lack of shared interests, and some language barriers. Her family in the area is also significantly larger than mine.

So back to my wife: she says we're going to her family's cultural-holiday gathering on Sunday for the whole day. It's a **1.5 hour drive** there each way. I ask if I can sit this one out because we're doing really well this season, and I really want to play.

She gives me a hard no, reiterates that she hates driving, and says this cultural holiday is important to her and her family. I respond: ""Ok, no problem, what if we leave early, or if I alone leave early at 5:30pm to make the game at 7:00pm, drive back out at 8:00pm and pick you guys up by 9:30pm?"" I figure me being there at least 5 hours is enough.

My wife becomes angry now: ""Why can't you just give up ONE Sunday to spend time with your family?! Will we ALWAYS have to work around YOUR Sunday games?""

I tell her that she literally just sprung this on me, and that I've given up Sundays in the past for her family events. And it's not like we *never* see them: we had a multi-day vacation in late August with them, another gathering in late September, then early November with her brother and mom.

Also, I don't care for this cultural holiday at all - I don't even celebrate it with my side of the family.

"AITAH for taking a job at my old apartment complex against my wife’s wishes? So I, 27m have been out of work for a year or so due to health issues, I’m finally able to work again and have been job hunting for awhile with no luck. I stumbled across an ad for a maintenance person for my old apartment complex, I applied and have been asked to set up an interview. I told my wife 38f this morning I set up the interview and she’s pissed because my ex still lives in the complex. (My best friend lives in the complex so he confirmed she’s still there). However. It’s a job that’ll help us for now until I can find something better. I have no feeling towards this ex as it’s been years since we were together and she had cheated multiple multiple times, I can see why my wife might be a little upset but again, it’s a job for now and it’ll help us significantly with our finances. She told me I’m not “allowed to go to the interview or accept this job”. Would I be an asshole if I went and accepted the job if offered it?",0.14
"AITA for getting upset about something that happened 2 years ago? 2 years ago, I was in a friend group with my (now ex) best friend (Steph). At a party, I felt left out, so I left early and told Steph that I was leaving first. 

  The week after the party, I realized Steph was avoiding me, yet when I asked her, she wouldn't say what was wrong. When we sat down one-on-one, she finally told me that she thinks I am self-centered and only talk about myself, to which I accepted and apologized, yet she was still avoiding me.

  After a hangout that I didn't go to, one of our friends (Jared) texted me to talk for them. He claimed that whatever issues we were having was all my fault, and I should re-apologize, because she didn't feel I 'truly meant' my previous ones. I told Jared that I had apologized to her multiple times, and every time they claimed we were okay.

  Jared said, once, our friends had been daring him to call his crush and tell her that he missed her. He said he felt pressured, but did it anyways. When he hung up, he felt embarrassed and locked himself in the bathroom and cried. The group then apologized for pushing him too hard, to which he eventually was able to return to the game of truth or dare. His take was that all our friends care, but it was us individuals who make things a big deal ourselves. I told him that they were clearly pressuring him and that it wasn't his fault he felt the way he did, but he was set on believing it's his own fault.

  It's been 2 years since the incident. Last week, Jared brought up the incident again. He said that I had attachment issues and that I lacked empathy for people. I got kinda upset at that statement especially after he told me that that was just what others were saying, and that he just sees me as another friend. I honestly wonder why Jared keeps getting in this situation when it's actually kinda not his business. I eventually learnt to accept that she isn't obligated to forgive me, and I've already forgiven her, even though she has never once said sorry to me either when I confronted her.

 I feel like Jared is being a fake friend for acting like he's trying to solve the issues between us, but actually wants to put me down by pointing out the issues she says I have without telling me how (e.g. in what way do I lack empathy?) and not telling me how I can fix it as a real friend would. I also think it's weird how he says I'm his friend yet he doesn't back me up when people are talking bad about me despite knowing me personally. This incident (with Steph) has taken a big toll on my mental health and confidence, and I've been feeling better after many sessions of healing , but him recently bringing this back made me feel upset and doubt myself again.

"AITA for how I've dealt with presents so far? Hi everyone, this is my first reddit post ever as I only discovered this while searching online for tips for my current situation. I've read all the guidelines and so I hope my post is OK.

&#x200B;

For as long as I can remember, I've always loved thinking, preparing, getting/making/buying and wrapping presents. I always put a lot of thought into said presents and I've always thought that's how it was supposed to be. Now, let's make this clear: I only ever give gifts to my parents and sibling, all three of which I live with. We're all adults (I'm the youngest and I'm already 30). It's nothing cultural, it's just the way my family works.

&#x200B;

About a couple of weeks ago, me and my sibling were talking about how neither of us thought our mother had prepared a nice valentine's present for my dad. Then the discussion somehow steered into gifts, in general. I expressed how I've always felt and thought about thinking of presents and stuff. I said I felt that, when people give you a gift voucher, money or something of that sort it means they haven't put enough thought into it or just didn't want to bother. I also said that I felt that presents represent your relationship to another person and are a great way to show you know them well and care about them.

&#x200B;

Before I'm questioned: yes, I know sometimes you don't have the time to prepare nice gifts, but considering it's only three times a year that you have to gift something (we do Xmas, birthdays and anniversaries only) and you know when it's going to be, you can think ahead and save time.

&#x200B;

At that point, my sibling casually said that view made me an asshole because putting that much effort into ""normal presents"" put a lot of pressure onto the recepients, making them feel like they had to reciprocate. ""Normal presents"" was used with regards to birthday and Xmas presents, not ""random"" presents. That was never my intention and my family has always known that I gift because I enjoy doing so and not because I expect reciprocity.

&#x200B;

I've always been told I'm ""hard to get presents for"" because I'm ""hard to make happy"", but I disagree. I have a huge lot of hobbies and interests so widely diverse that I'm often told I'm a cameleon. I enjoy so many things that it's not even about a budget: I'm a witch, you could get me a stone you found on the ground or a small reused bottle filled with river water, it's free and I'd still love the thought put into the present. But instead, I'm told to write ""open letters to Santa"" year round so they know what to get me.

&#x200B;

At that time, I stood there, unable to say anything, but I've been thinking about it ever since. Maybe my sibling was complaining about my ""being hard to get presents for"" despite this, as in retaliating or something? But... What if I am, indeed, an asshole and my family has always perceived me as such? I don't know what to think anymore. So reddit, please, tell me: AITA for how I've dealt with presents up until now?",0.71
"AITA for wanting my bf to go to the doctor Me (24f) and my bf (26m) have been together for 3,5 years. Our relationship is going really well - besides a few arguments, which are more than normal in a relationship - and we really do love each other. He also has been a big support for me since I was diagnosed with a chronic, incurable illness which results in many different symptoms such as extreme fatigue, depression, paresthesia etc.
Recently, my bf has been experiencing some discomforts/ changes: yellow night sweat, nightly binge eating, digestive problems and had one incident where after severe headache he didn't see on one eye. I am no doctor but my father has diabetes, and those changes have been reminding me of symptoms my father has. I am not claiming there there necessarily has to be something wrong, but I just want him to get it checked out. If it indeed is an illness, he will know and be able to deal with; if not, even better. If everything is alright, I would like him to eat a bit more healthier as to not risk his health (we have healthy eating habits and regulary enjoy snacks).
He however refuses to get it checked out by a GP. This has become a big point for arguments as I just want him to be okay and healthy, especially since I am sick. He always counters my wish with the accusation that I am hypochondriac: something he knows I refuse to be called. Due to my chronic illness as well as my endometriosis I have no other option than to go to doctors regularly. One important reason for me looking after my health also is him; I want to live with him healthily as long as possible, I want us to be able to enjoy life. And if going to the doctor every now and then will help me at least approach this wish, then I will gladly do it. And the same thing I am asking of him. I told him that him not wanting to get it checked out is not only unfair to his own body and health, but also to me. Our argument went so far that I gave him an ultimatum: go to the doctor or break up with me (not my proudest moment). 

I am just worried for him but he doesn't seem to understand. Am I the asshole?",0.23
"AITA for telling my husband he’s not being nice but cruel Hi everyone, I need some outside perspective here. 

So my husband and I had been looking to go on a short vacation to Key West. After some research we realized that it was way outside our price range as we are both students and $300 a night for a hotel is not really achievable. 

Today during lunch he comes to me and says he is thinking we should go to Key West and invite his mom so she can relax and we can spend like a day or two. 

Automatically I got pretty annoyed, because on many occasions when we come up with the plans there is always a reason why we can’t follow through or we should delay it but if his mother is involved it’s an automatic yes. 

So I pointed this out to him and he said he was just trying to do something nice for everyone. I said it’s not nice but cruel b/c he knows I’ve always wanted to go and only when it involves his mom is it a good idea.

"AITA for not wanting to send back an expensive gift from a friend at my boyfriend’s request? I’ve been in a relationship for almost a year with someone I love dearly. He’s wonderful in so many ways, he’s kind, loving, great with my kids, and does so much to help me. The only downside to him is that he has a very old school, conservative train of thought about male friends. He doesn’t like it and doesn’t understand it. It has caused some issues between us in the past because I have (or had) tons of male friends (as well as female). 

Anyway, an old friend of mine, who suffers from significant mental illness, and who also happens to be very very wealthy (worth 100mil+), sent me a birthday gift this year, a Prada bag, just to say thank you for being a good friend and being there for him in his lows. The gesture was incredibly kind, but my boyfriend feels that this friend is trying to sneak into my life and have a relationship with me.

I wholeheartedly disagree, I don’t think that those are his intentions at all, but I’m not sure who is right, nor what I should do with the bag.

"AITA for telling my teenage nephew that I take drugs and live a good life? I (35m) have had a good relationship with my nephew (16nb) who we can call Kyle. Our families have been close so we see them monthly. 

According to my SIL, Kyle has gotten in with a not so great crowd this year. Drinking, drug use, partying, and skipping school. SIL ex is also not helping the situation at all and almost encourages it. 

This last weekend Kyle told me privately they are thinking about dropping out of school after this year. They want to work and go live life. Basically said they want to hang out with friends, drink, and do drugs all the time. I let them talk and listened to their whole thought process for dropping out. It was a typical bad teenager idea but I let it go on.

Now to my response that my SIL did not appreciate. I told Kyle all that stuff sounds fun but not as a HS drop out. That I also tried those things in HS but never become a constant in my life until I was an adult. Kyle was confused and asked if I did drugs. I said yes I mostly smoke/take edibles every day. They were surprised because I am well put together, generally successful, and have a family. Kyle didn’t realize that many adults did. 

I continued with what I thought would be a good lesson for Kyle. I explained that through HS and early adult life I worked hard. That stuff was not apart of my life until I felt comfortable in adulthood. I may have done stuff occasionally but it was very minor. 

Now that I started again it has been awesome. I get to do things while under the influence I could not as a teenager. Eat at really nice restaurants, see concerts, shows, travel, and other things. And that when I did this stuff as a teenager it really sucked compared to now. That I wish I never even bother with the stuff back then. I have a friend who never finished HS and has a tough life. Though we occasionally hangout they aren’t able to do most of the things my other friends do while high. Like golfing, eating out, taking weekend trips, concerts, and what not. 

Then I explained to Kyle if they were to drop out now they would never have the chance to really enjoy that stuff the way I do. They would be stuck going to house parties or in crappy places with crappy people. We talked about 20 mins and I felt like helped them rethink dropping out. 

SIL came to me upset last night. Basically saying I shouldn’t have told Kyle I did those things. That I shouldve lied and said those things aren’t apart of my life. It made me think a little and wasn’t sure if the way I went about it was okay.

"AITA for refusing to pay my friend back? My friend Oliver (M 28) goes into the city once a week for work. Last week he asked if I (F 26) wanted him to pick me up anything from the asian supermarket while he was there, as I don't go often.   
I ask Oliver to pick me up rice cakes if it wasn't too much trouble. We have a detailed conversation about which type I want (the long ones, like the ones typically used for tteobokki), and I send him a reference photo.

When we next saw each other, Oliver hands me the product and the receipt, so I can pay him back. I say ""Yay! Thank yo- Oh."" He responds with ""Is that the wrong type?"" I say ""Yeah, I already have a big pack of these in the kitchen. I don't want to sound ungrateful though, I still appreciate you looking for me."" I wait for him to say something, but instead he got very quiet and then changed the topic of conversation. No apology, no offer to return the product. Nothing. 

He was very standoffish for the rest of the evening after that.  


It's been a week since and I haven't paid him back. I feel bad because he went to the effort of getting the rice cakes for me, but I also feel rubbed the wrong way because he didn't apologize. He knows money is really tight currently, and while $4 might not be a lot for some people, it's a lot for me right now, for an item I probably won't even use.

I haven't brought the topic up again because it can be very difficult talking to him about these types of things due to his standoffish-ness. I also don't want to sound ungrateful. I wish he didn't make these types of situations so tense and uncomfortable, this type of thing happens a lot.

"AITA for not making my daughter apologize to the woman who spoke to her like a baby? I have a daughter, Katie who is 6 years old. She is a very smart and straightforward little girl. People are often surprised over what comes out of her mouth. We do talk about filtering but as she’s 6, she’s not always best at it. I admit I didn’t use a lot of baby talk when she was younger and do speak to her as I would an adult.

Katie has a babysitter, Lauren, who watches her some afternoons if I’m not off by the time Katie is done with school. One night, I had to work late. Lauren’s mom, Julie, stopped by at one point to drop something off. Now, I wasn’t there, but by Lauren’s own admission , her mom can be a lot. The following is a recount from Lauren and Katie has confirmed it when I discussed it with her privately. 

Julie began gushing about how cute Katie is and began baby talking her, using cutesy words, pronouncing things with w’s, etc. Lauren was cooking dinner for herself and Katie. Julie’s mom turned to Katie and asked “Are you ready for your nummies?” Katie got a weird look on her face and asked “Why are you talking to me like that? Are you stupid or something?” Julie got offended and Lauren told Katie to apologize. Katie said no and told Lauren to stop talking like a baby. Julie left not long after.

When Lauren relayed the story, I said maybe Katie shouldn’t have been so candid but Julie shouldn’t have talked to her like an infant. Lauren said she just wants Katie to apologize to her mom. I said Julie should apologize to Katie for treating her like a baby.

I did talk to Katie about being more polite. She seemed to be receptive.

When I told my mom about the whole situation, she was appalled. She said Julie was probably just trying to be nice and didn’t realize how mature Katie is. She said Katie should absolutely apologize.

"AITA for not letting my sister stay with me at my hotel after I invited her and paid for her flight? I often accompany my mom to see family in South America. I know I never ever to stay with family again. Since my first visit I have always booked myself a hotel close, but not too close, to whoever my mom is staying with. 

I love exploring with my extended family. They all love showing me all the cool stuff most tourists don't get to see. I pay for everything. I make low six figures which isn't bad for a single guy and the average monthly wage down there is literally what I earn in a day. Last time I was there I took them to a cathedral underground that used to be a salt mine. It is a day trip. I took ten people including myself and my mom. For the day, including meals and transportation cost me what I would spend by myself in Vegas for a day.

When we were little my parents would make me sleep in the basement on a shitty pull out couch. My sister had to share her room too but she was in a cradle still so she didn't have strangers in her bed and touching her stuff. By the time my sister had a proper bed my parents had a guest room. Mine. I was away at university and worked away from home in the summer to pay. 

I hate doing that to some poor kid. And, if I'm being honest, I want comfort. I don't want to sleep on a foam, not memory foam, mattress on the floor. 

So my sister has taken a year off between high school and college and she wanted to come. My mom said that the family would love to see her since most of them have never met her. My sister was born here twelve years after we moved. I'm 16 years older. 

My mom asked me if I could help with the cost. I said no problem and asked my sister if she wanted her own room or if I should get a room with two beds. 

She said she had no problem staying with relatives. She's not a stuck up prick like me. Strange attitude 
for someone who is dependent on me for this vacation. Whatever. Cool. I booked a suite with a king size bed for myself. 

Two days into a twenty five day stay my sister wants to come stay with me. She had found that the joys of family bonding are not as good as a hotel with an excellent bar and pool. And no scorpions. I told her that I didn't want her family to think she was a stuck up prick like me so no. She actually screamed at me and wanted me to either get her a hotel room, let her stay in mine, or change her ticket to go home. My answers were no, hell no, and pay for it yourself. 

My sister was unbearable according to my mom. She actively avoided me and skipped out of some cool outings because I was paying. 

My mom said that if my sister ever goes down again it might be best for her to stay in a hotel. I laughed since that is what she gives me shit for. 

My sister is telling everyone that I'm an asshole for staying at a resort, hardly, and forcing her and my mom to put people out of their rooms.

"AITA telling a guy ""The streets there, you can go sleep in it"" after they bitched about sharing a bed with me and then made him sleep on the floor My sister (24f) and I (24m) live together, we are pretty social people and run in the same friend group so we normally have a lot of our friends at our house whenever we can. This particular night we were having a ""girls night"" (I'm one of them gays™, so of course I'm invited to every girls night). 

One of the girls (24f) ended up bringing her brother (20m) because she was going to be driving him somewhere in the morning. It works out since instead of a dining room and living room we have 2 living rooms at each end of the house so we could have our privacy and he can do he's own thing.

At the end of the night we worked out the sleeping arrangements. We have a couch in each living room so 2 of the girls claimed those like they usually do, one of the girls shared with my sister and one was going to share with me. We got a blow up mattress out for the brother. Apparently that wasn't good enough since he has a bad back and wanted a bed instead. The girl sharing with me being the sweetheart she is offered up her spot in my bed and she'd sleep on the mattress. 

He did not like that idea and started bitching about how he's not going to share a bed with a gay guy and ""what if he tries something"" (oh sweetie you flatter yourself, definitely not my type). He suggested he share with my sister and that was a BIG no from her so he had more of a bitch about how bad he's back is and Yada Yada Yada, eventually I just opened up the front door and said ""the streets there, you can go sleep in it instead"". He ended up sleeping on the floor because I took the blow up mattress away. (Me and my sister personally think he was fishing to share a bed with her)

"AITA for telling my mother in law to start feeding him and brush his teeth? My mother in law watches my son M-F and he loves her but I am constantly always calling to see if he has ate or brushed his teeth and it’s always the same thing “I’m gonna brush them rn” or “he doesn’t want to eat”. So today I was kind irritated and just stopped beating around the bush and finally told her something. At first I asked if he brushed his teeth and she said yes and he said no right away. I talked to her and she said yes again and then asked him again and paused and said yes. Honestly I felt she was lying so I FaceTimed them and asked him again, he looked at his grandma every time I asked about brushing his teeth so I know she was lying and didn’t brush them. After that I told her about how everyday my son gets home and is always hungry, don’t get me wrong I don’t mind feeding my son but he should already have something in his belly when I pick him up. I know he is toddler and doesn’t like eating all the time but it’s also her responsibility to handle that if I’m not there. Both my wife and I pay her so it’s not like shes doing it for free. I’ve told my wife to talk to her about this since it’ll be easier since it’s her mom but she never does, so today I finally told her all that and how she needs to start feeding him and brushing his teeth. I feel like an asshole cause I know my fave expressions weren’t pleasant but I mean why would they be, she lies about brushing his teeth. It’s not that she doesn’t feed him but she really won’t make him eat even if he hasn’t ate all day. Am I the asshole?

"AITA for telling my parents the truth after I stayed over at my boyfriend's place? My parents don’t know that I have been s\*xually active for a while, because they’re very, very strict and protective. To the point where I was never allowed to have sleepovers, I’m not allowed to drink/go to parties/etc. We’re close, and as a general rule, we don’t lie to each other about anything, but I do omit some private things.  
  
I’m not a virgin, and my boyfriend wasn’t my first. My boyfriend is very outgoing and forward (I am not), and whenever he is at my place, we have to leave the door open. I stayed the night at his place for the first time the other week, and my parents were worried he would try something. They think I’m too young and want to protect me from making mistakes. It doesn’t help that my boyfriend is so forward and let’s say sexually liberal.   
  
My parents talked to his parents about making sure we’d sleep in separate rooms and that nothing would happen, but his parents are way more relaxed about these things, so they just went to bed like any other night. Obviously, my boyfriend snuck into the guest room with me and we ended up having sex (not for the first time). I wanted to, and I don’t think my parents have the right to forbid it (Though I don’t want to disrespect them either). I tried to tell my boyfriend we shouldn’t at first but I admittedly didn’t mean it and told him to stay immediately when he offered to leave.  
  
When I was back home, my parents asked if his parents did what they’d discussed and made sure we stayed in separate rooms. They obviously didn’t, and if my parents hadn’t asked directly, I would have never said anything, but again, I don’t lie to them. I never have and I don’t want to. I told them no, so they asked if anything happened, and I told them yes.   
  
They were livid. They are blaming my boyfriend and his parents (but especially my boyfriend) and went to their house to confront them. My boyfriend is angry at me now that I told them, because I got him in big trouble with both our parents and everyone is angry at him. I keep telling my parents that it was very much a mutual decision, but they still blame him, and want me to not be around him for a while. They’d never force me, I’m free to spend time with whoever I want, but they’ve expressed their wishes clearly.   
  
My boyfriend is still angry, even though I’ve apologised and tried to explain that I just don’t lie to my parents, but he still thinks that in this case, I should have, because we both knew what would happen if they found out, and that he’d have to bear the brunt of it.

"AITAH? Who is wrong, neighbor kept pkg., wants favor, I refused, SO thinks I am wrong for refusal bc replacement was sent to me, I am out no $. I ordered a jacket.  I got a notification of delivery and the pic was of my neighbors house and front door. They kept the jacket.  

Back story:    This neighbor and I had a problem several years ago over her dogs getting loose and chasing my chickens and growling at me.  I told her the next time the dogs were loose, I’m was going to shoot them I f they came onto my property, it is fenced but dogs manage to find weak spots, or just jump the fence.  I have two donkeys, a dog  and some chickens for eggs.  County dog catcher could never catch the dogs loose when he came by and could not show up when the dogs were loose.  Of course this pissed her off, it would me too but I kept my dog inside my fence.  

Now on to the present and the conflict: The package arrived but was delivered to the house next door, simple mistake.  I waited two days for them to put the package near my gate or post box.  They didn’t.  I called the shipping company and was told they would send a driver to retrieve the package and redeliver it.  They did not.  I called the store and told them the story and they sent me another jacket.  So, I am not without my new jacket but my neighbor got one for free, yes she probably can wear it.  We just had one of those carports installed on our driveway last week and this neighbor asked my SO where we purchased it and the approx price range.  He came in to ask me and I smiled and said that I wouldn’t share the info unless the misdelivered pkg was discussed.  My SO said I was being an AH and holding a grudge.  Yes I am.  I asked him why he had a problem with my attitude and he said I wasn’t out anything so I shouldn’t be holding a grudge.  Is said that I was/am entitled to hold a grudge bc they kept a pkg that was misdelivered and could have just dropped it off.  You ask why didn’t I go over there to get it, they have dogs, remember?  You can’t get to the door to knock without going in with the dogs.  I do not know their number to call them.

"AITA for not wanting to invite my fiance's brother's in-laws to the our wedding? My (26M) fiance (26F) are getting married in Nov (=D) and there is always drama with a wedding LOL. She has a very large family and her parents take up A LOT of the guest list (with no contribution). My family is much smaller (with contribution) and is very lax with whatever we do. Her family not so much.   


In their mind we should invite everyone we have basically ever met; and we should invite anyone and anybody they ask us to. The argument that arose was inviting her brother's in-laws to our wedding. I have 3 married siblings, and none of their in-laws were invited to our wedding or any of the other weddings previously. It was the first thing I really wanted to put my foot down on because I want some control over my own wedding.

Her and I do not particularly like her brother's in laws to start with, plus we don't know them that well. Her parents insisted on them being our family and they were necessary to invite. We disagreed as we have no association to that family, that's her brother's family sure but not mine. This stirred up a pretty big fight with her parents, with a lot of mean things said and threats of not coming to the wedding.

&#x200B;

I felt like this was ridiculous because it was an equal playing field, neither side had in-laws invited. I never even heard of inviting in-laws to be frank. I was furious with the conversation, with her parents saying things like ""it's OUR wedding"" and ""its OUR list we get to decide"". I kept my composure to them for the most part but it has really eaten away at me, and I'm not sure if I'm being selfish for drawing the line and should just give in or stand my ground?

"AITA For spending a gift card on myself and not my family This one isn’t so serious but will settle something between my husband (M37) and I (F37) 

We recently moved and we needed a new rug for our living room. I wanted something that would last and good rugs aren’t cheap so I comparison shopped for a long time to find something that was quality but also not outrageously expensive. 

I  found one I liked at a local store and my husband and I went to see  it in person. He also liked it also and was ready to pay for it right then and there, but I knew a lot of other retailers sold this brand of rug so I told him to hold off and I would look online to see if I could find one on sale. 

I didn’t find the same rug on sale anywhere but I did find a department store that was giving loyalty members a gift card worth 10% of their total purchase. 

I bought the rug and the gift card was added to my account- the total value of the gift card was ~$80; and I used it to buy some shoes. 

I told my husband about it and he thinks I should’ve use the gift card on something for the house since we paid for the rug from our joint bank account. I think I was justified spending it on myself since it was my legwork that found the gift card and if it was up to him there would be no gift card.

However, a cat was hanging around my street, and I thought she was a stray. The poor little girl had matted greasy fur, loads of fleas, a bloated stomach (worms and/or pregnancy) and she demolished the food I put out. I felt so sorry for her. Eventually I trapped her and called in a cat charity. She wasn't microchipped.

The charity put out a missing cat notice, and a few hours later, someone contacted them to claim the cat as theirs. And they live very close by. So actually, this cat isn't a stray, she's in bad condition because she's neglected. The cat charity representative was disgusted, but legally there was nothing they could do. 

I called vets and reported the animal neglect, but nothing was done. Eventually I kept on feeding the cat, made her a bed in my shed, and occassionally bathed and flea combed her. And the result was astonishing. This cat has a new healthy coat, is affectionate, and has actually bonded with my two cats. I love her like she's mine.

My husband thinks I'm an asshole though because I'm trying to steal someone else's pet, and because we have enough cats already.

"AITA for finally standing up for myself and asking for some respect from my SIL? Context: I (F) have been with my BF for 6 years. We began dating my senior year of high school and we are both from a relatively small town.

Idek where to start but here goes.
When my BF first showed interest in me I was hesitant due to the long relationship I knew he had been in for most of his teenage years. He assured me they were done after he found out she had cheated on him multiple times with multiple men. At this point they had been broken up 6+ months and I felt it was okay to show him I was interested too.
Throughout the first two years of our relationship, the ex GF would stalk our house, drive erratically when she spotted our vehicles on the road, flip us off out the car window or at public outings, and mean mug/flip off MY family including my parents and kid siblings. For two years we dealt with this weight of “but what if the ex GF is there” or if we saw her vehicle at a restaurant we would go somewhere completely different to avoid the commotion. 
At some point we learned that my BF’s sister was still in pretty consistent contact with her and I had a one on one conversation about it with her. I told her how I felt and she explained that she is not going to pick sides (between cheating ex GF and her brother) or treat her any different. At the time I was young and impressionable and just agreed that it is what it is.
At some point my SIL told me that she had intentions of going to the ex GF baby shower. Eventually I saw the photos on FB of the baby shower and it hurt to see that and their continued friendship lingered in the back of my mind. To the point that I began to distance myself from her. I quit reaching out, continuing to try and not let it bother me. 
Fast forward to about 4 months ago, my SIL told me, to my face, that she has baby sat for the ex GF and continued to talk about her and the baby. I engaged in the conversation but after leaving I did not speak to her again. This broke me, It made me feel like I wasn’t and never would be good enough for her to accept as her brother’s GF.
My last straw was my BF’s sister posting an old picture of the ex GF with my boyfriend’s nephew. It could’ve easily been cropped and it felt intentional.
At some point we were having a one on one conversation and I thought it was a better time than any to let her know how I’ve been feeling. I thought it would be a relative easy ask. I’m not asking her to quit being her friends, I just told her I don’t want to see it, I don’t want to hear it, I. Do. Not. Care. 
She blew up, told me I can’t choose her friends and it wouldn’t be a problem from now on. What she meant by that was, she blocked me on social media so that “I don’t have to see it”.

"WIBTA if I decided to get petty about proceeds for a potential home sale? Background:  My parents are Chinese and have always told me that family shouldn't count what they owe each other monetarily and should help each other out when needed.

About 9 years ago, a year after I started work, my parents encouraged/pushed me to own instead of rent. I made a good income, more than them, but didn't have a lot saved yet. I found an apartment in a more affordable area, which I thought would at least help me save money. They gave $50k and I put $15k down payment for the mortgage, and Dad and I were joint tenants with right of survivorship, although I made all mortgage payments for 4+ years.

About 5 years ago I moved states for work, and my parents pushed hard to rent out the apartment instead of selling it. Wife and I had spent a decent amount improving the place and would have preferred to sell, but we were occupied with the move and decided to not fight about it. The plan was to let Dad collect rent and manage the apartment (he ended up doing very little of that mostly because he didn't have to) while I occasionally handled communications with the tenant, and he would take over mortgage payments.

I could have let him handle monthly association fees (almost 1/3 of the mortgage payments) but because by then I earned much more than him and I thought he was in too much debt, I volunteered to keep paying, trying to be a good Chinese son and not let my parents be poor while I lived well. This way the rent earned him money, rather than being slightly less than mortgage + fees.  
  
Fast forward to yesterday, I have been arranging to sell the apartment because I moved again and need more cash to buy a home in this market. I was talking to my dad about splitting proceeds after paying off the remaining mortgage. I offered to give him 1/3 of the proceeds after taxes and fees, which would give him about a 100% profit on his initial $50k payment (I was willing to overlook the fact that he made money on the home afterwards).

He has no other mortgage or debt, but he immediately proposes that whatever we make, we should deduct taxes, give him his initial down payment back, then split 50-50. I saw red and was so angry I could barely speak. Trying not to flip out, I told him that's not fair because I paid a lot more, but he argued that I got to live there for 4 years (ignoring completely the monthly fee payments I made to help them since I left, which made sure he made money).  I told him that if that's how he wants it, I will calculate every amount we each spent and divide proceeds based on that (I outspent him at least 3-1 even accounting for me saving from having to pay rent).

I feel betrayed for what I've already spent to help my parents, and for Dad ignoring the principles about family and money they raised me on. WIBTA if I tabulated every penny spent by each of us on the apartment and demand that I get my portion accordingly?

"AITA for cooking the ""wrong"" pasta and not leaping into action to correct it? My sister's situationship recently got upgraded to the real deal and she insisted that it was time for me to meet her girlfriend & her (gf's) daughter, who is 11 and autistic with high support needs. Over the course of several conversations this plan morphed into them all coming over to my place for dinner.

Sis let me know in advance that the daughter ""pretty much only eats spaghetti with butter (no pepper) and uncrustables,"" which was fine. The grown-ups could have pasta primavera and she could have her own bowl of buttered noodles. Idk why but when my sister said spaghetti, I thought she meant pasta in general, so I made dinner with bowties that I had on hand.

Her mom asks if I have any spaghetti and I'm like uh...I have fettuccine that is still in a box in dry form?

They have 50/50 custody over their kid (2) and he just got dropped off today at the peak of my sickness and the beginning of my fiancé’s, I work night shift and got home at 7:30am and the kid was dropped off by his other parent at 10am and my fiancé spends maybe 30 minutes in the living room with me and their kid then goes and lays down leaving me, tired and sick to watch after the very energetic child. He eventually misses his parent and starts screaming for them so they open the bedroom door and let the kid in. I follow behind and fiancé asks me if I’m okay with going to get us all some food so I do.
Well, as I’m pulling out of the restaurant I hit a bump in the road and my check engine light turns on so that just added even more stress to my body. I get home and ask them to help me with getting the food and they are very unhappy about then ask me why I’m so upset, I explain about my check engine light and they don’t seem to care, they should though cause that’s our only car, and I guess I care more since it’s in my name and it’s my first ever car, but like, they don’t even drive so I’m constantly giving up my sleep to take them to and from work and watch the kid while they’re at work. But that’s not a big deal. He typically minds me well and I love this kid as if they were my blood. 
Skip forward a couple of hours we all take a nap but the kid wakes up crying and is inconsolable and my fiancé opens TikTok and I’m stuck trying to console this child who wants his parent. With all the stress of being scared of throwing up, the kid crying, being sick in general, being tired, and my car I start crying a little bit and my fiance notices and just rolls they’re eyes before turning they’re attention back to TikTok. 
Well. I finally get him to calm down then he drops a toy down the side of the bed and no one can get it without moving the whole bed so I tell him that I can’t get it and he throws another toy at my face. I don’t know what to do. I’m so stressed and I just want to cry but I can’t. My fiance is of no help, so am I the asshole for being upset with them?

"AITA for expecting both my roommates to equally split rent with me? I (24F) and my friend Amy (23F) moved in together last year to get out of our respective mothers' homes.  We were both single at the time, now I have a bf who only comes over sometimes and she got back with her ex (23M) who now makes a significant income.  Her bf has moved into her bedroom with her.  He has been buying all of their groceries and toiletries, also getting her hair done and taking her on trips often, so I know paying rent wouldn't be an issue for him.

I recently asked Amy if she expected me to pay the full $400 half of rent, and she seemed confused and said yes.  I kind of expected at this point that our rent would be split 3 ways, and told her so.  Apparently her bf has been paying her portion of the rent.

This is where I could see myself coming across as a stingy AH, but I basically told her that she HAS a job and actually gets paid more than me.  I don't understand why I'm paying half the rent, her bf pays half, and she pays nothing.  It would make more sense to me if we split it 3 ways, it would only be about $260 for each of us, which I don't think is unreasonable between 3 people with full time jobs getting paid at least $17/hr.

She just walked away from me without saying anything and hasn't been talking to me.  I paid the $400 half of rent.  The only time she has spoken to me was when she texted me at work saying her and her bf have applied for other apartments.

Was I actually unreasonable for expecting her and her bf to pay split rent with me?  Obviously I was fine with the $400 half before he moved in, but I assumed it was just natural for everyone living here to pay their fair portion of rent.  I'm kind of happy they're leaving so I can potentially move my bf in, but I don't want our relationship ruined over me being cheap or something.",0.38
"AITA for expecting more than flowers for my birthday? It was my 26th bday 2 days ago. My bf got me flowers the day before. On the day of my b-day, I expected a present. 

He got payed so I know he has the money. 

I pay the rent, the bills and most of the groceries (I have a 3-4x bigger salary). When he rans out of money, I cover for everything. We try to do 50/50 around the house, but in the last two months it’s more like 80/20 from my side. 

He had a really stressful period at work, he was thinking about quitting but I think the only reason he didn’t is because I told him he has to start bringing more money into the relationship if he won’t do 50 or more percent of chores.  

Well, for 2 days I have been pretty down because I “only” got flowers. But since I pay for almost everything, I expected more. I know it is lame, but somehow feels like a HUGE disrespect.

"AITA for not staying out of a rumour revolving around my best friend and his gf Me (17f) and my best friend (17m) have been friends for about 2 years and long story short, I found out that there were rumours about his gf using him or something and decided to tell him because I thought that that’s the right thing to do as a friend. He asked whether he could tell her and I said sure but asked him not to mention my name since I am extremely socially anxious and fear that I would be confronted if word got out that I told him. He told me that he won’t tell her that it was me who told him and not to worry. However, he didn’t actually respect my wishes and told her. I found out because I receive a text from her 20 minutes later telling me that he told her about what I said and that the rumours are fake. I got really pissed because I specifically told him not to mention me and he went ahead and did after telling me that he wouldn’t. So I texted him telling him that he shouldn’t say shit if he isn’t going to keep his word. He said that he and his gf are one person and ofc he will tell her, and that if I'm getting mad then I should stay out of it. i did tell him that i'm not mad because of that but rather the fact that he lied to me. He didn't respond to me after that, today I found out that he removed me from instagram and has most likely blocked me.

"AITA for refusing to help my step-grandmother? My step-dad(who I’ve always considered my real dad) called me a few minutes ago to ask if I would go with his mom to the store to get dog food since I live with her currently. I said no because I’m tired of being taken advantage of by her and not having basic respect. He’s upset because I don’t want to help her, especially since I live here rent free. Well, so does my step brother, who’s the golden child that never has to do anything. She’s paid for all his things when he’s not working, and even when he is. He’s never paid rent, while I had to, and they try to use all my food stamps. I can’t work because of a disability, so my food stamps are my only income. Meanwhile he’s been working for awhile now, and still refuses to pay for anything himself. I’ve even gotten bitched at for eating food I payed for because it was “theirs”, or not washing their dishes. I’ve had to resort to hiding food and lying about my food stamps amount just to be able to eat. I do appreciate that I’ve been here rent free, but I don’t think that constitutes being upset that I don’t want to go to the store with her, especially since it’s difficult physically. Why can’t my step-brother go? Why do I have to constantly put my physical and mental wellbeing on the line for people who have stolen from me and constantly disrespect me?

As my landlord hasn’t bothered to make an effort with these naturally I keep asking if he has any update or idea on when he might bother. I became a father three weeks ago and because of this I currently have a strange sleep wake schedule.

"AITA I want to sleep in the same room as my boyfriend in my parents house. I (20F) have been dating my boyfriend (21M) Michael for a year and a couple months now. I live in a dorm at college which my parents partially pay for. My boyfriend sleeps over about 3-6 times a week and my parents know this. Michael met my family several times and they like him a lot and trust him to be kind and loving to me always.  
But when he comes to my parents house where I partially still live for 2-3 months a year, he has to sleep on the couch in the basement while I sleep on a full bed upstairs. If we are alone in my bedroom together, my father will passive aggressively walk by and open the door. This december i left the country to live abroad. The last time I saw him was Christmas, and he had to sleep on the same couch in the basement. I wouldn't see him for 7 months and it broke my heart.  
A big reason I want to sleep next to him is because I want time alone with him. I live in a small house in nyc and there is no privacy except the bedrooms. Because my family is so uncomfortable with PDA and sometimes I am, I do not like the feeling of someone else being in the room.   
Even though no one has said it, I believe no one wants us to sleep NEXT to each other because they are afraid we will have sex in their house.  
My boyfriends father said one time, ""if you are going to fornicate in my house please do not do it when I am home"", which is a given as that is mortifying and that was the end of that. I personally think my parents should have done that, but i think the fact that I am a girl, have siblings and that my parents are catholic and probably don't want to acknowledge I have sex makes a big difference.  
Frankly, I am also just getting too old for this shit. I live in europe with my own money, language, job and school and its insane to me that i can leave the continents and  go to bars and clubs but I have to keep the door open if I am in the room alone with my serious boyfriend.  
My parents say we can sleep in the same bed when we are married, but also advise that I should not get married until I am 30. There are so many contradictions and even they know because they will smile or try to end the conversation.  
They say ""my house, my rules"".  
But my parents are so reluctant to talk about this, that recently we have been thinking that it is not worth the drive for him if my family will be there the whole time.   
In conclusion, I rather talk it out and i know it will be an uncomfortable situation for my parents, but I want them to trust me and understand where I am coming from. I don't even think they'll sit down to talk about it and now I am so upset about it I don't think I can do it without crying. Should I facilitate a conversation or is it not worth it and I should give up?  
Thanks for reading this i know it was long. There is a lot more to this and I may come off different than I mean to because of the word limit, but i can respond to comments to elaborate.

"AITA For not wanting to take my (12F) child to deliver girl scout cookies to her dad's work? My daughter's dad is very uninvolved.  He lives around an hour away, but only picks her up for visits 2-3 times a year.  

He wants me to drive her an hour to his work to deliver cookies to his coworkers and boss.  The only day she would be able to do it would be presidents day because of the business's schedule. So she would literally just see him for a few minutes then we would leave. But it would be the only time she gets to see him from Christmas until summer.

"AITA for telling an American he should have called an ambulance? I was talking to my cousin who lives in Florida about an incident at his work. One of his coworkers passed out at work and when he regained consciousness he was pale, sweaty and shaking, had chest pain, and wasnt speaking right. My cousin helped the assistant manager at his work carry the coworker to the assistant manager’s car and the assistant manager drove the coworker to the hospital. 

When my cousin told me that my first reaction was something like “holy shit why wouldn’t you call an ambulance?” My cousin was really taken aback and got really angry at me for suggesting that. He said his coworker doesn’t make much money and wouldn’t have been able to afford an ambulance. I’m not American so it didn’t really occur to me that people have to pay for ambulances there. This is the part where I think I might have been the asshole. I asked why he and his manager would gamble with someone’s life like that when they were so obviously seriously ill. My cousin told me I didn’t get it because I live in a “socialist hellhole” and now hasn’t spoken to me for a few days. 

Turns out the coworker had a heart attack but luckily survived. I’ve sent my cousin a text saying that it must have been really scary and that I’m sorry I didn’t ask how he was doing first.

"AITA for feeling insulted about a friends guitar commission? I make guitars as a hobby; I dont do it often but I really enjoy it. I am a high school student (18F) and my friend, we’ll call him Philip (18M) had reached out to me in class about making a guitar for him. 

I agreed, because I was good friends and I needed the money. 

He ends up giving me an insanely complimented design (which I had agreed upon because it was doable) All except for the pick guard, which he wanted to cover half of the body, entirely made from scratch. I told him I could do everything except the pick guard, and asked if he could maybe change the design. The reason I cant is because I just do woodworking and painting, I usually recycle old scrap parts for the electronic build. 

He ends up sending me links to the pick guard material in bulk, and says it can be done with my tools. I explained again, and he didn’t update me after that. However I had told him I actively planning and getting the supplies for the rest of the guitar. 

The next day, he comes up to me in class. He then proceeds to exclaim to me that he had asked another friend to build the guitar for him instead, without telling me first. Then proceeds to say how much this person knows about guitars and how cool he is.

I just felt very disrespected, since guitars and guitar making a special interest of mine. I understand I couldn’t do exactly what he wanted but I feel as if I should have been told first.

"WIBTA / AITA for not giving my sister the money I paid for her Christmas gift? UPDATE: I sent her the money, lol

I don’t know how to handle this situation in a delicate manner and could also use some outside thoughts on etiquette here.

I (21F) got my sister (18F) two things for Christmas and a third thing for her birthday (a few days after Christmas). I purchased all of these things off the wishlist she sent our entire family at the start of the holiday season. On this wishlist, you can “reserve” items so others know if the gift has already been purchased, and the list maker can *also* see the reservations at the click of a button.

I am pretty proactive when it comes to getting my Christmas shopping done, so I purchased everything in late October-early November. Sometime after I purchased her gift, however, she removed one of the gifts I got her and replaced it with the same item in a different style. I did not see this change as I already had done all my shopping, and when Christmas day rolled around, she opened my gift & loved it. A bit later, she opens a gift from my other sister (23F), and it’s the same gift in the new style.

Immediately, she realizes she has two of the same thing and says she prefers the one my older sister got. She turns to me and goes, “you can return it, though, right?” 

I was pretty hurt hearing that. I got a bit teary eyed but hid that I was upset and tried not to be too offended that she wanted me to return the gift I got her.

In my mind, she could return that gift and keep the other one I got her, end of story. I sent her the information for the return, and that was the last I heard from her. 

Now, a month later, she’s reached out to ask if the money from the return came through (I hadn’t checked, really) and if I could Venmo it to her so she can get something else she wants.

The situation rubs me the wrong way because I reserved the item in advance on a list she sent us to get her gifts from, then took it off the list without bothering to look and see if it had already been purchased. I feel like she should just keep the other gift I got her, plus the gift I gave her for her birthday, and call it a day. WIBTA to not send her the money? How do I even communicate this in a text without getting into a fight?

Context into our relationship (a likely *unnecessary* blurb for those interested, feel free to skip):

She’s a teen, and most of the time, somewhat mean to me (as teens tend to be). We have moments where we can laugh and hang out, but the past couple of years, she always has an attitude—there’s *always* a problem, no matter what I do.

Her and my other sister often leave me out of the plans they make & get each other really lavish gifts (iPads, AirPods) while telling me the “limit” for their birthday gifts to me is $25. Needless to say, I don’t feel really enthusiastic at the idea of being bullied into buying her another gift (which is what it often feels like with her), but I don’t want to be the bad guy and make things worse.",0.25

My family somehow saw the post and a family conference was called. My dad joining by phone and My aunt in my room with me. I refused to Do the conference until my Nan went home.

My husband had twisted his ankle the day before so he asked me to walk out to the car to grab some Tylenol for him. Not a problem, he'd happily do the same for me. On my way to the car, in the parking lot was a little boy, I'm guessing about 18 months old wandering around on his own and crying. I saw a few other families out there and asked them if this is their child and they each said no. I ended up grabbing the crying toddler and taking him inside with me. By luck, the kid's parents were at the front desk asking someone to help them find the little boy. The dad saw me first and ran over to take the child and started thanking me for making sure the little one was safe and bringing him back inside.

They met about a year ago and seemed to get on well. After a while my Gf's brother decided he was in love with my sister. He has autism so he can be very intense with his emotions, and was telling my sister that he wanted to marry and that they were soulmates and so on. My sister hadn't had a boyfriend before, and so I think she took a liking to the attention. Either way me and my GF were not comfortable with this relationship as it just felt weird, and was making us panic as to whether one would upset the other. So, I calmly asked my sister to please just consider mine and my girlfriends relationship before getting into something with her brother because he is very intense. She was upset but agreed, I didn't say she couldn't, I said she could do what she wanted but respectfully asked if she wouldn't. The two of them played the whole 'we are being really noble for their relationship' card, and made us look terrible. The intense stuff started as predicted, her brother would tell literally everyone about his love for my sister, including me, and how he will be marrying her. He started calling my sister early in the morning saying he wanted 'to dissappear' and how no one will ever love her as much as him. This freaked her out, and she went crying to me and my mum about it. So, we told her to cut off all contact, and then move on. All was fine for a few months, until I recently found out they had secretly been seeing eachother behind our backs, despite my sister getting upset to me and my GF about how lonely she was. I was upset that she lied, and once again warned her of the dangers of this relationship. Anyway, I got annoyed about the lies then moved on. Suddenly tonight, my girlfriend sends me a message saying that my sister and her brother have been 'making out'. I said I didn't want to hear about this, and it made me angry that I had been told. I said I was angry my sister had been lying saying she was lonely and hadn't been seeing him, plus talking about how noble they both were for giving up their 'relationship'. I also don't particularly wanna hear about my sister making out with people, but maybe that's just me. My gf then told me to stop getting angry, and I asked her to stop talking about the scenario so we could all just move on. My gf continued to talk about it, until I said 'please stop'.

"AITA For Saying My SIL Should Return Engagement Ring? Today my brother, SIL, husband, and I were talking and the subject of whether an engagement ring should be returned if an engagement gets terminated came up. 

She said that she would absolutely not return the ring. I said that in my case, I would return it because my engagement ring is a family heirloom that is about 200 years old. 

I’m not entirely sure where it went south but things took a really bad turn when I said I was pretty sure the ring giver can sue a receiver for their ring back if the relationship ends before marriage. She said that’s wrong because a ring is a gift. I said it’s a conditional gift. 

This led to her taking off her ring and trying to hand it back to my brother (they’re already married) and saying that she doesn’t want it if it’s a conditional gift. She also said she didn’t even want to get married in the first place and only did it to make him happy and get a ring. Things got extremely awkward after that and my brother seemed hurt.

"AITA for not allowing my mother in law to take one daughter on a trip without the other? My mother in law and I have had a bit of a rocky relationship. We have had our ups and downs, but I try my best to get along for the sake of my husband and our kids. My husband and I have two daughters ages six and four and a half. Let's call the six year old ""Holly"" and the four year old ""Ava""

 My main issue with her has been that she very obviously favors Holly, despite playing coy about. She has also been too overly involved with her. I've only recently spoken out about it and my husband has too. I used to be quiet about it just to get along, but I feel like it could be bad for Ava's self esteem.

She says she'd like to take Holly, then continues with ""Ava isn't the best at staying out over night. That's the only reason I wouldn't take Ava, so please don't get the wrong idea"" This isn't even true. Ava is perfectly fine sleeping away from home, if she's with someone she knows well.

Holly is already excited and Ava says ""not fair"" and looks upset. I say to MIL ""Holly isn't going without Ava!""

"AITA For wanting my girlfriend to send occasional texts when out with friends? I (M 39) have been dating my girlfriend (F 38) for about twelve years - live together, happy, etc. 

One issue we have always had is that no matter if we are at home, watching a movie, or talking, she is constantly on her phone. Reading articles, texting people, whatever - we have talked about putting phones away during us time, but it never happens. Kind of already over it.

What bothers me is that when she goes out with her friends or out of town with them for girls trips, she barely texts me anything at all. Sometimes not even a goodnight to let me know she is back at the hotel safe.

It wouldn’t bother me so much if she wasn’t constantly on the phone when she is home with me - like if she can do that, I don’t see why she can’t send a simple goodnight so I know she made it home safe.

We talked about it a few times, and she thinks I’m just being a jerk about it.

"AITA for not sharing with bf's family? We are very in love, and I'm very happy in our relationship,  but had a fight and I wanted to get judgements on it.

I am white and he is not. Despite growing up in America,  he is very cultural in a way I wasn't expecting. A huge thing in his culture is respect for you, your family, and the people around you. I met his family and it went really well, but the last time I was over with his family I decided to order myself food. I ate it in front of them and no one said anything.

Later bf pulled me aside and told me I was being disrespectful. He said you don't go to someones house, order food, and eat it in front of them without asking if they want any or sharing any of your food. I was taken aback. I said I never even thought of sharing, my family would have 0 issue if he came to our house and ordered food and didn't offer them some. 

He said it was fine, but next time I should ask if they want something. Sharing is big in his family, etc, etc. 

It happened again. I just forgot because it never occurred to me that I needed to share. 

There was a cake for sale and I ended up picking it up before going to his moms house. I ate it there and forgot to offer any to his family.

He noticed and when no one was around he said I already told you, it's rude to eat food at someones house and not offer them any of it.

At this point I was annoyed. I said there was nothing rude about it. He needed to relax. It's not a big deal at all, and I want to eat the whole cake. I bought it for myself.

He said it shows a lack of respect for the people around you. If you want to eat a cake by yourself, eat it at home by yourself. Don't come here and do it in front of my family. They offer you all the food they have and you can't even share a piece of cake with them.

I said if your family judges me over something that silly, they're ridiculous. It's my cake and I bought it. I don't have to share it with them if I don't want to. It's not my culture. 

It turned into a big fight and he ended up shading my family. He said my family was the issue and they don't have respect for their guests and raised me the same way.

He said this because when he first met my extended family, they decided to play a prank on him with water guns. I thought it was funny, he did not. He found it disrespectful, and my family ended up apologizing. It was a little hazing, and they did it to every boyfriend I had before.

I said that it was a silly joke that he was taking way too much offense to, even bringing it up now. He said no, it shows how different we grew up. ""If I did that, my family would be embarrassed/ashamed. They greet our guests and do their best to make them feel welcomed.""

I said our family was more open-minded and relaxed and I didn't appreciate him saying our way of existing is wrong and his is right. I feel he should be more accepting that families and cultures are different and stop trying to change me. If I bought a cake, I can eat the whole cake.

AITA here? Or is he?

"AITA because I don’t want my (ex)boyfriend to go to Vegas for the weekend for the Super Bowl? I’ve been with my (ex)boyfriend for almost 5 years, but we are actually at the end of our relationship. We actually broke up months ago, but I’ve been letting him stay at my apartment until he’s ready to leave.

He doesn’t have a place to live, doesn’t own a car, and does gig work (makes like less than $20k a year). He doesn’t pay any rent or any expenses. I buy all the groceries and pay all the bills. I also let him borrow my car to do DoorDash. He only pays his own cell phone and sometimes he pays when we go out to dinner. But he does the majority of the household chores and makes dinner a couple nights a week. 

Anyway, I was excited for the Super Bowl and was asking him where he wants to watch it or what he wants to do. All season we’ve tried to go out and watch as many 49ers games as we could together.

He tells me him and his buddy are going to go to Vegas for the weekend and watch the game there. Not actually at the stadium or anything, but just go to Vegas. I asked if I was invited and he told me no. That he wants to party and that I can’t keep up.

I think that is super disrespectful and hurtful. I feel like if he wants to have a party lifestyle, he needs to move out first. But while he’s living here taking advantage of my generosity, it’s kinda messed up to go party in Vegas and also not invite me.",0.82
"AITA for having my kids stay with my parents while I get my shit together? My wife died early last year from cancer and neither me or the kids are taking it well. She was far more of the nuturer and was much better with the kids and I'm spiralling trying to catch up... My oldest (17M) wants to drop out and run off with his girlfriend smoking weed all day.My daughter (16F)  has be constantly caught shoplifting and she's been selling her mom's old pain meds and my youngest (14M) quit football and hes sneaking older boys in and out of the house at all times of the night....and skipping school to do god knows what..

"AITA for lying about my age to a girl online? 

I, previously 12M lied about my age to my ex online situationship, 15F. 

We met awhile ago on a discord server that she owned centered around one of her interests that we both had in common. It was a really small server, it had about 30 people. But LOTS of drama would happen. I was lying to be about 14 at the time and most of the other members were around that age too, but every once in awhile an adult joined and it would cause some issues. I don’t need to go into full detail, so I’ll get to the main part. 



A couple months after the discord server died down, i got her number and we starting talking. Atp I had developed a little crush on her and started to feel bad for lying, but I really liked her so my stupid 12 yr old self kept talking to her. 


Then I could tell she was starting to get feelings for me as well, because she was saying and sending some sus things. I was starting to really like her but also debating just blocking her before things went too far (they already did go too far) 


Then things started to get a little too weird. She was always oddly sexual, whether that be jokes or weird kink. I’m not going to go into detail because we are both still infact minors, so it’d be weird. Then this one night she started to get REALLY weird. I’m not even gonna say what she said, but I can tell you that she didn’t stop when I asked her to.  The stuff she was saying made me really uncomfortable. I tried to make her stop but i got really tired of arguing with her and spilt the tea in a fit of anger.


I basically said something like “I’m 12 fuck you”. Obviously, it wasn’t her fault. She didn’t know I was 12. But to be clear, she was being really weird. Even if I was 15, she was overstepping my boundaries and making me uncomfortable. Still though, I think it’s mainly my fault. After the fact, she did call me an asshole and so, and I’m not surprised. 


I understand I really fucked up, and I’m most likely the asshole. But what I wanna know is does this make me a horrible person? Like, if I tell someone about this in 20 years, will they call me a horrible person and click the unfriend button?",0.73
"AITA for not communicating better?  My boyfriend is supportive and loving and funny, but then things get weird. I don't know if it's him or me. I believe we are both neurodivergent. He is literally the most patient and undersranding man and listen so well, but when he's mad things are different. In He claims he wants to get married and have a family. He buys me things to garden and paint and is supportive of my hobbies ..BUT

The same person who loves me has also said or done things like this to me during fights:
- ""You owe me.""
- ""You couldn't of even made me a sandwich"" (after driving erratically when almost late for work somewhere). 
- ""I went on bumble because you left"" (I was gone for TWO nights, I packed a bag and left after an argument) *I was pregnant at the time, six weeks* 
- ""You don't respect me""
-""You're ungrateful""
- ""I was going to buy you a car""
- ""Not as clean as him, messy""
""I make all the money you should clean how I want you to"" (I spent nothing of his outside of groceries and a few toiletries. 
- comments about my need to sacrifice in reference to my dogs, ""dogs don't live forever.""
-after we were fighting, I lost my phone and wallet while packing my bags. He dropped off a the airport the next day with no phone or proper ID, no debit card, but $17. I was 7 weeks pregnant. I was able to call a friend. When we talk about it he brushes it off or apologizes and says it should have never happened. It feels like it's my fault ""for leaving"" always.


Separately I have had poor communication at times and struggle with emotional regulation. I think this sets him off. I have even a mess with my own mental health and worry that I am just being immature and he is right. 

I haven't seen him since he dropped me off at the airport. He was mad because I screamed at him over the bumble and said we were done. He wants me to go back.",0.09
"AITA for thinking my Husband’s ex-wife should behave as such and get lost? Okay, long story but I’ll try to keep it short. My best friend, Brad, and I both went through breakups on the same weekend. Completely unbeknownst to the other. His wife asked for a divorce because she didn’t support his wanting to transition (MtoF). And I left my psychologically abusive ex, that Brad and his wife had told me I should leave months before. They even offered to let me and my kid move in with them. 
So, I ask if the offer is still available, and he tells me she asked for a divorce, but the offer was still available because she was moving out and he would need a roommate. But, right before I moved in, she decided she was going to stay a while longer. So it’s her, Brad, her son, me, my son, and 5 dogs; my one and their 4. 
She turns into a complete bitch and talks shit about us to any and everyone INCLUDING BRAD’s family. And none of them do anything about it. She is still involved in every aspect of the family. She even moved in across the street from Brad’s sister and is over there damn near daily. 6 months later, she is still talking shit, but secretly emailing Brad asking him to take her back and saying she regrets asking for the divorce and she thought they would get back together, but he tells her that he and I had just started dating. 1year after, we are married and she is still at it, except now, she is involving herself EVEN more into his family and randomly showing up at our house, because AND I QUOTE ONE OF HER EMAILS, “It didn’t hit me until it was too late that by asking you for a divorce, that meant that we would never get back together. I had hoped we would take a break and try dating after a year or so. But, I refuse to let you and your family go. I don’t have local family, and I have earned to stay part of their lives.”
She has turned family members against Brad, to the point where even his father, who was supportive and advocated for his transition, has recently stated that he can no longer accept it and refuses to use his preferred pronouns. And, all while I am kept at arms length and feel very much so “other than” compared to her. I know it’s a newer marriage and they don’t know me to the extent they know her, and I wouldn’t ask them to drop her like a bad habit. (Though, I like the sound of that.) They are all wrapped around her finger. I can’t get away from this woman!!
We have brought up concerns with family members, and they seemed receptive, and promised to shut her down if she insists on trash talking about me or Brad, but I’m uneasy with her always being around and showing up. They are nice people and I know she was around for 9 years, but it’s causing issues with Brad and I. 
She asked for the divorce…. Shouldn’t she be the one to step away? AITA for thinking that she should and if she refuses, the family should step in And support their brother/son, who they are supportive of face-to-face, but no one is doing actually anything to prevent her behavior.",0.3

"AITA for refusing to pay while I'm away for half a year? My close friend, Cindy, and I decided to move out together into a studio. We live in a HCOL area and our rent for the space is about $3,500 a month. Cindy and I have been splitting the rent equally, but I'm going to study abroad internationally for half a year in the Fall. 

Since I'll be gone, it makes no sense for me to pay rent. I let Cindy know ahead of time she's going to have to pay the full $3,500 rent while I'm gone.

Cindy was annoyed and thought it's unfair. She said when people agree to split rent, they need to pay their fair share regardless of them living there or not. I disagree. People should only pay if they're living there. Cindy argued I'm still a tenant, so I should be paying, especially since she still pays her fair share when she visits her hometown for a month during winter and summer.

I argued she's only gone for one month while I'll be gone for half a year. Cindy said she can't afford to pay the full rent and we both knew this already before agreeing to rent out the studio. I told her either way, no person is going to pay that much money for that long of a time when they won't be there at all.

Cindy said I'm basically causing her to lose her place and now she has to find a new space to live that's more affordable. I argued it isn't my fault and most normal people would do the same.",0.92

I get home to my Aunt(50s) who I don’t get along with sleeping on the couch. I had asked grandma if something was wrong since she was staying the night. Grandma says my daughter has been sick all night so she called my aunt to help. I asked why wasn’t I called and she said why would I call you? I have my daughter every day of the week. I only get a sitter on Thursday nights and then sometimes on Saturday just so I can go out to dinner for 2 hours. I am 100% involved in my daughter’s life.

She asked me if I'd heard from the hiring company, I wasn't sure of the protocol, if the recruiter was going to tell her she wasn't selected, so I hedged and said I hadn't heard.

When she asked again after the New Year, I admitted that yes I'd heard back, they offered the job, I accepted. After that she basically went radio silent. I texted a few more times, apologizing for not telling her right away, then after it had been a month of not hearing from her, finally sent something along the lines of ""I'll take the hint, I wish you the best, and it was great working with you."" She texted saying she was ""disappointed I didn't tell her, trying to keep her head above water at work, and dealing with personal grief"", which I understood, but thought I'd eventually hear from her.

Her birthday is the weekend of superbowl weekend and I watched them last year as promised and this year comes up and I told her I’d drive to go pick them up after they attended a birthday party that Saturday.

He doesn’t want the kids going with us and just wants it to be an us thing and says it’s inappropriate to have the kids with us and we are all drinking and talking crazy. My sister has already made plans for her birthday and is now pissed at me for it.

"AITA for (accidentally) teaching my nephew the f-word I (32F) was staying at my brother's (36M) house last week while my kitchen is renovated. He has a wife and 2 sons, Michael (9M) and Sam (4M).

On the third night of our stay, I was at the kitchen sink when Michael ran into the room behind me with his iPhone and put it camera-side up in an area that unwanted cameras ought not to be... My reaction was immediate. I yelled the F-Word and told him in no uncertain terms that he was never to do something like that again. I also grabbed the phone from his hands and, upon inspection, discovered that it was not turned on at all. He just wanted to startle me, and he sure succeeded. Despite my scolding, he did not look apologetic, but snickered and ran off. 

Here's where the family rift comes in: since the incident, Michael has been saying the f-word a lot, and his parents are pretty upset about it. Much of that anger is focused at me because apparently I taught it to him... I have asked my brother to make Michael apologize to me for his behavior, but he insists that I must first apologize to Michael for teaching him a ""grown-up"" word. Only then will he make Michael also apologize. According to my brother, the camera wasn't on, so no harm done. The real problem is my ""loose tongue"" around his son. I also feel awkward about creating drama because they were very generously hosting me in their home at the time...

I'm rather beside myself at the prospect of apologizing to a 9 year old after what he did, but my friends are split. Hoping to get some unbiased opinions. So, Reddit, AITA for teaching Michael ""the word"" and refusing to apologize?",0.23
"AITA for asking my husband to stop drinking alcohol after he wet the bed again? Husband went out last night for the first time in a few weeks as he had been sick. He woke me up a couple of hours after he got home as he had wet the bed. This is not the first time it has happened and it only ever happens after drinking alcohol.
In the past he has admitted to having an “unhealthy “ relationship with alcohol and HE chose to put some limits/boundaries in place - eg getting home by a certain time, every second drink being a water. These boundaries last a few weeks/months and then it’s back to doing whatever he wants. 
Im 36 weeks pregnant, we already have a 4 year old, and I’m fed up with all this. I asked husband to not drink until he has been checked by a doctor to see if there’s a medical reason for this happening and he flat out refused, mainly because he has an old friend/colleague coming to town next week. He also says I’m being controlling. 
So AITA?

ETA - Just for context: 1. This doesn’t happen every time he goes drinking, last time it happened was about 10 months ago. I’m more concerned about his refusal to stop drinking until he gets checked out by a doctor.
2. He didn’t expect me to clean up after him, and there’s no bloody way I would have anyway",0.14
"AITA for being rude to my boyfriend’s family? Some vital info: I (29F) speak fluent Romanian, Russian and English. My boyfriend (25M) speaks fluent Russian, some English and some Ukrainian. If it makes sense, I’m 50/50 Russian/Romanian from Moldova and my bf is Ukrainian from the Ukraine.

Small info on Eastern European history: there are 2 parts of the Ukraine, one mostly speaks Russian/Surzhik, the other mostly speaks Ukrainian. My boyfriend comes from the Russian speaking part.

As the war between Russia and Ukraine started, he and his family moved to the UK. I live in the UK for a while now and we basically met here.

He invited me to a dinner with his parents. His parents are naturally very politicised due to recent events, to the point they refuse to speak Russian, even though they speak it fluently. And they almost don’t speak English, apart from some really basic things.

Naturally, they greeted me in Ukrainian, I politely smiled, said “I don’t speak Ukrainian” and switched to Russian. They kept talking to me in Ukrainian and I didn’t really understand it apart from some words.

Here’s where I might be TA. I got tired of them trying to talk to me in a language I don’t understand and I switched to Romanian. Neither my bf nor his parents understood me and his parents asked me to repeat myself. So I did, again in Romanian. The dinner became pretty much awkward and his mom said “why won’t you switch back to Russian, you know we understand it”, so I responded back with “why don’t you switch to Russian, you know I don’t understand Ukrainian”. 

Well, the dinner didn’t go well after. I won’t get into details to not get too political, but there were some xenophobic slurs thrown at me. Let’s just say “dirty orc” was the tamest one. I stood up, excused myself in English and said that I won’t be sitting at a dinner table with people who think it’s okay to insult me for my nationality. I left the house and drove home alone. My boyfriend never ever stood up for me.

Moreover, he texted me, saying that I was rude and ungrateful and that I should’ve just swallowed it since I know the political situation. I told him that it’s not about politics, it’s about interpersonal relations and if he and his family are ready to sacrifice them for their political values, I’m not wasting my time on people who lack basic human decency.

"AITA for Sharing My Girlfriend's ""Close Friend"" Story with My ex-Boss? I'm seeking some perspective on a situation that's causing tension between my girlfriend and me. She recently won a bouquet of flowers for her outstanding performance at work, which she proudly posted to her Instagram Stories' ""Close Friends"" list. Just for context, her close friend list has only 10 people in total, as oppose to her following list of over 8k.  
Here's where the issue arises: I've made a habit of occasionally screenshotting my girlfriend's photos, something she's always been fine with. However, during a conversation with my ex-boss—whom I'm close with and who has met my girlfriend before—I briefly showed her the screenshot of the flowers to express my pride in my girlfriend's achievement. The picture contained only a bouquet of flowers, nothing too personal.  
Later, when I mentioned this to my girlfriend, she became furious, accusing me of overstepping boundaries and exposing her personal content to my boss. I tried explaining that it was just a photo of her bouquet, nothing compromising, but she insists it was meant for her select group of friends only, and I had no right to share it with anyone else. She insisted it had nothing to do with the contents of the picture but rather that I was sharing something too personal and I crossed the line. We got into an argument because I told her my intention was just to showcase that I'm proud of her for winning, but she dismissed it and scolded me as if I had exposed her nudes or something insane like that. 

  
She wants me to apologise, but I feel she is blowing it out of proposition and should chill.

  
So, am I the asshole for sharing her ""Close Friends"" story with my boss, or did I misjudge the situation?",0.83

But when I rarely ask to see his phone he says “why” “you don’t need it” “lemme watch to help” or something. One night his phone started beeping constantly and it annoyed me so I tried going through his phone to see what it was, I didn’t find the beeping it stopped after a min of turning on the phone I took that chance to go through his phone and found porn on his google photos. I knew that his acc was old so I confronted him and he said they were old, I believed him and we dropped the convo. He still won’t let me go through his phone and he keeps notifications off.

"AITA for telling my mum I won't drive her home from a night out if she's extremely drunk? I'm a relatively new driver (passed my test 3 months ago). My mum's asked me to pick her up from a night out this weekend in a nearby city which I've never driven to. This would be on a night that's supposed to have snow - another thing I have very little experience driving in. 

I told her I would give her a lift as long as she doesn't get *extremely* drunk. She's never been violent but she often becomes nonsensical and demanding; less often (although it's happened enough times), she becomes antagonistic and insulting. I can see this distracting/upsetting me while I'm driving.

Anyway, she's unhappy that I won't *unconditionally* give her a lift, even though she's acknowledged that she can be unpleasant to be around when she's wasted. She says she's not planning on getting too drunk, but from experience this is does not guarantee she'll limit herself.

"AITA for being concerned about my BF’s bonus? I need to get some outsiders perspective on this in hopes that whatever’s said can be used for me to become a better partner. 

So I (20 F) and my BF (20M) have been together for over 1.5 years. We are both full time students and also work on the side. I am self employed and he works for a small marketing company part time. He also lives at home with his parents so does not need to pay rent/ utilities rather just save and buy things for himself. 

For some context:
He was waitering at a high-end restaurant and made “friends” with his soon-to-be boss who offered him a job. This friends to employee relationship is something his dad and I have both warned him to be cautious about as going from being taken for drinks at luxury bars to being a contacted employee is a big difference, he acknowledged it and said he would be mindful. 

Fast-forward he expressed how he knows he’s being underpaid for the work he was doing (the company work for high end clients) and he was getting an interns wage whilst he was the only other employee at the time. The position was supposed to be a few hours a week but his hours went up (due to work demand) and his grades at Uni have suffered. Whilst we’ve tried to have conversations about his I usually get shut down or told I don’t understand that this is the “real world”. 

Over the past summer as he took on a full time roll and was only allocated a week of time off. On the rare occasion we did see each other there would be calls from his boss whilst we were on dates and even calling him into work on his days off when he was visiting my hometown and not expensing the train ticket into work.

Despite the salary issue his boss likes to give him expensive gifts. For his birthday I bought him a rather expensive (for me) gift from his fav designer and his boss bought him something from the same designer but 5X the price. I will admit this did make me jealous as it felt like mine was dismissed by him because of the price tag. 

So onto what happened:

Yesterday my boyfriend told me his boss has offered to by him flights to Tokyo as a “Bonus” for all the hard work he did in 2023/2024. My Bf his this from me for over a month as he said he “didn’t know how I would react” as I’ve expressed to him multiple times how I feel the relationship does cross some professional boundaries, especially considering we both think he is unfairly paid. We did get into an argument about because I was upset he hid it from me and concerned about this gesture as my bf has only mentioned wanting to go in passing once. Don’t get me wrong it would be an amazing trip but it’s not like a life long dream for him. Seeing as it’s only the flights it still would be an expensive trip for him which he told me he would “figure out”. 
We left it at if he wants to go then I’m happy for him but I can’t shake the feeling that it seems inappropriate given all the past instances. I 
want to be supportive him so AITA for expressing my concerns?",0.07

They had a pretty seamless transition from what I witnessed and the kids warmed up to Tasha quickly.

Tasha and Nick added to more sons to the family and all has looked good.

Three weeks ago Tasha confided in me that she was struggling with ""some stuff"" related to the older three children. I asked her what she was struggling with and she said she always assumed she would be equal to Nick and Emma in the kids eyes by now. She said even though the kids love her, she feels second best. She confessed to having a hard time with Emma still being frequently mentioned and missed. She clarified that she does not want the kids to forget Emma and would never claim they are only her kids. But after knowing them for 7 years and being such a big part of raising them, she did think it would look a little more like a traditional nuclear family. She left almost immediately after saying this and I had wondered if I should say something but she was in a hurry to get home. I then decided she maybe just needed to say it out loud and that might be the end of it.

Then on Sunday she confided in me again and it was almost word for word the same at the start. I asked her where this had all come from. She said it was related to something my grandson wrote about ""mom"" and how he didn't get to grow up with his mom and not having a mom made him sad but he was lucky he had a nice stepmom who wasn't mean like other stepparents. She told me it really brought the point home to her that she's second best and that she will always lose out to the kids memories of their mom and she hadn't expected it after so many years, especially with my grandson. 

She told me she can't find a way to be happy with her role of second best and she wonders if that's how it will be in another 10 years. I told her that she very likely will, because you cannot compete with a loving parent and Emma was an amazing mother. I told her it doesn't mean she's not an amazing stepmother. But that is what she is to the older three; their stepmother. I told her she may have let her hopes get away from her a bit, which is understandable, but she needs to understand that the kids will always love and miss their mom and wish they had her back. I told her that is not an insult to her. But it's the family she married into.

Tasha went from sad to annoyed in an instant. She asked me where my compassion had gone and did I not realize I had just made things worse for her.

"AITA For telling my MIL she fucked all her kids up? I (23F) had my son four months ago.

My mom and my husbands mom are polar opposites in every way, but especially in child rearing. They hate each other. Both parenting methods are fine, but just from viewing their kids, I will be following my moms method.

To the issue at hand.

I do not bedshare with my son directly, but his crib mattress is on the floor and I have a single mattress about a foot away. I can reach him and he sleeps through now. If you put him in his crib he will scream until he vomits. If I manage to get him in asleep he will only stay asleep for maybe 15-20 min.

My MIL fucking hates it. My husband agreed when he realised it made him sleep through, although he wasn't a fan at first.

I don't have an issue with our current arrangement. Whenever he is ready he will move to my mattress and we will adapt from there.

Every single time we see my MIL she's telling us we need to sleep train. I am often telling my husband to deal with her but she won't listen to a damn thing she says. 

Yesterday I lost it with her. She came over to see him and I went to put him in his sling for a nap and she gave her disapproving sigh and asked if she could put him down in his crib. I agreed. She's constantly telling us that he'll go to sleep in there with just a little work. I know he won't, but I decided to let her see for herself.

She went and put him in his crib, he started screaming, I ran to go get him but she held his door closed so I couldn't get in. She told me he needed to cry for a little bit but then he would go to sleep.

I managed to pry her off the door and grab him. I fed him to calm him down, which started off a whole other spiel from her.

In the end I turned around and told her that she doesn't get to fuck my kid up too. She was a little shocked, so I continued, and told her that she fucked up all her kids and she was and is a shitty mom. She needs to leave my kid alone and stop trying to give me parenting advice that I'm not going to follow.

She started crying and my husband ""stepped in"" and asked her to leave. He then told me I was overstepping and should have let him deal with it, she's only trying to help, etc. I responded by telling him that he never does enough and if he's going to try and defend her he can leave too. He didn't leave straight away, but did go at some point in the next hour.

I left to the bedroom so baby could sleep and I could call my mom. She came over, with my sister, and we had a good evening. They insisted I was well within my rights as his mom to say what I said. However I am aware that they hate my MIL and may not be the most nuanced.

My husband told our friends who are pretty evenly split, but I know that this also plays into their personal parenting opinions too. 

So I come here for true (hopefully unbiased) judgement. I'm at a loss with the whole situation. 

AITA?

(ETA; Had to edit my post down for size, sorry is theres any missing info - happy to answer in the the comments!)

Edit - My husband is home, we've talked, all is okay with us. Haven't yet decided how to deal with his mom.

Also, info - Cosleeping decreases the risks of SIDS. Bed sharing increases the risk of suffocation, but suffocation is not SIDS. Cosleeping and bed sharing are not the same thing. Cosleeping is your child in your room (what I am doing). Bed sharing is your child in your bed (which we will do when he can physically get himself out of his bed and into mine, if he ever wants to).

My son is fine medically also. I did not ask for medical or parenting advice.

"AITA for making fun of a child's insecurity? 

So i 16f have a friend also 16f called emma and emma has a younger sister called Lilly who is 12 we all go the same school

Ever since me and emma were young Emma's parents showed clear favouritism towards lilly and recently theyve been forcing her to take lilly with her everytime we go out and i wouldn't mind this except that lilly has the worst attitude known to man this girl will bully everything about you from looks to personality and never stop making comments about you 

I used to ignore it because emma asked me to but the last time we went out she started making comments about my appearance really loudly in a restaurant and i just snapped and started commenting about every little thing i know she insecure about and she ran home in tears 


The next day at school emma stopped talking to me because i was ""bullying her baby sister"" i know for a fact her parents yelled at her for this and i want to apologise to her but not to lilly

AITAH for not wanting to pay my boyfriend’s parking ticket? My boyfriend picked me up from the train station when I suggested we get a takeaway coffee. He parked in a spot that was meant for residence permit holders and told me to keep an eye for a parking attendant while he quickly runs to get the coffee. Long story short the parking attendant gave us a ticket. On one hand I feel like it’s my fault because he went to get the coffee for me. But also he shouldn’t have left me in the car as I don’t drive and it was an illegal spot. Should I pay for the ticket or is it right to split it?,0.4
"AITA for watching the Drake leak? I (29 F) am a huge Drake fan. Me and my boyfriend (31 M) actually saw him in concert together last year. When I kept hearing about the leak, I was curious and wanted to see for myself so I watched it and moved on with my life. While on the phone with my boyfriend, he asked me if I had heard about the leak. I said yes. Then he asked me if I watched it. Again, I casually said yes. Bad idea. He was very disappointed to hear this and kept asking me if I was serious and why I would look at it. I told him that he knows I like Drake and I was curious, like everyone else. He didn’t want to talk much after that so we got off the phone and called it a night. I figured he just needed some time and he would get over it. The next day I call him around lunch time and we have a regular conversation. Eventually he brings it up again and I can tell he’s still upset about it. He tells me that I was being disrespectful by throwing it in his face and it was weird of me to be looking for another man’s meat. I asked him how he would have preferred me to respond to his question and he basically told me that I should have lied. He said that I need a filter when it comes to these things. He basically wants an apology and I haven’t given him one, nor do I plan to. I’m not sorry and I don’t feel bad.

"AITA for leaving home in the middle of the night? I (17F) left home two weeks ago to live with my boyfriend (18M). My parents are not physically abusive, and for the most part, they are really sweet parents. The biggest problem I have is I'm recovering from being a substance addict and they love to bring it up. It's every day that they make snide comments about my body, my friends, my hobbies, and my past. Anything and everything that can influence me to relapse. I really tried to brush it off as them caring about me, but they were the ones who gave me the substances in the first place. Regardless, I am sober now and have been for two years. I stay away from anything that could cause a backslide, and I'm much happier now.

"AITA for ""embarrassing"" my friend's nephew (31M) and GF (23F) by referring to her as ""made up""? Recently one of my friends (F54) had her birthday. I (51F) was invited over for dinner with her and her husband (65M) and to stay the night. At the time, their nephew and his GF (31M and 23F) were staying for the weekend, so they also attended the dinner. 

I came over and hugged their nephew, because I've known him for years. I did not remember meeting his GF (although I actually had the previous Christmas) and held out my hand to her. I said something like ""Hi, I don't know if we've met before"" and she said that we had. I noticed that she had her hair curled and a bit of makeup on, so I then said ""Oh okay, it's hard to recognise someone when they're made up"". People laughed, she smiled and the moment was over. She didn't shake my hand and I had to find out her name from someone else. 

During the dinner I did my best to speak to her but she was just quiet. It could just be me though, as I am the polar opposite and very loud/charismatic. During the evening I mentioned sleeping over and my nephew seemed surprised - turns out they hadn't been told by my friend that I'd be staying over. 

Time pushed on and at something like midnight, the GF got up and quietly left the room - not a big deal, might've been going to the toilet or whatever, it wasn't weird that she'd gone. But after half an hour I realised she'd gone to bed without saying goodbye. I felt a bit like ""oh...okay?"" and not long after their nephew followed suit (think he was messaging her). He did manage to say goodnight though. 

Didn't see either of them the next morning (still in bed) so I just left. Come to find out the GF had been ""embarrassed"" by me saying she was made up, and was also informed she had autism (how I could've known that ahead of time is a mystery to me). That afternoon my friend rang to say she was going to walk her dogs on a beach near my house and asked if I wanted to come along. I accepted and on our walk she said she had asked her nephew and GF but they'd said no. I think it's because of how she took my words to her. 

I know it does not matter much, that she isn't my friend and I'll likely not see her often. But I just thought it was a really weird reaction to a very benign jokey comment that wasn't meant to be nasty. I asked my friend if she'd thought it was rude and she said no but she hadn't heard it. 

I'm torn how to feel. Did I really say something that harsh? To some extent I get if she's anxious and has trouble talking to people or being particularly friendly, but then I don't want to let a disability excuse pretty rude behaviour that an adult woman should be able to regulate. I feel like a big storm is suddenly being made of nothing here, so would like to hear feedback.",0.69
"AITA for getting my housemate a warning from our landlord I think I might be the a-hole because I didn't talk to my housemate before texting our landlords.

I (28M) have been living in a houseshare since August, having found the room on SpareRoom. I get along pretty well with my housemates and try to stay out of any of the ""typical roommate/housemate"" squabbles. I am friendly with my housemates, but we're not friends and only really ever chat if we're in the kitchen at the same time.

Anyways, about 2-ish months ago, I walked into the kitchen and was chatting with one of my flatmates (late 20sM). He pulls out an e-cigarette and asks if it's okay if he smokes. I told him that the smell bothers me, so I'd rather he didn't (it's the only smell that I'm really sensitive to). He told me it doesn't smell (it does and he is a habitual gas-lighter with my other housemates), but he accepted and didn't smoke that time. \[For more context, I am a musical theatre performer, so I really avoid being around smokers in general.\]

I work till late, so get in around midnight on work days. On a number of occasions, I've walked up the stairs (our rooms are opposite each other on the first floor) and I can smell that he's been smoking inside as the smell has seeped into the hallway and it's not faint either. After a few times, I decided that the next time our landlords popped in, I would let them know.

Fast forward to last week: I walked into the bathroom one morning, soon after he was in there, and I could smell that he'd been smoking with the window shut. I could barely breath it was so strong. I opened the window and had to leave for a few minutes to let it air out. I decided that enough was enough and I just texted my landlords, who responded in my favour and gave my housemate a warning.

When I saw him this morning, it was really tense and he barely spoke to me (not that we spoke much before). I think he knows that I was the one who told the landlords and got him a warning.

Additional context: I am Canadian, he is Eastern European, and we both live in the UK. I understand that other countries have different smoking laws/regulations (i.e. in Canada, smoking, vaping, e-cigarettes, etc. are all counted as smoking under our smoking laws, but I'm not entirely sure if they are in the UK). The house was advertised as non-smoking.

AITA for not talking to him again before I texted the landlords?

Edit 1: He doesn't really have much respect for the rest of us. He's been asked by us to do other things, i.e. recycle and compost properly, and he blatantly doesn't do so (actually saying that asking him to do so is disrespectful).

Edit 2: Just to clarify, no one I've spoken to in person thinks I'm an AH, including my other housemates (they were actually happy that I said something because it's bothered them too). I just get into my head and assume that I'm an AH in any situation where I stand my ground, even minor things.",0.17
"AITA for being sleepy and falling asleep on my best friends wedding, ruining the atmosphere (as her MoH)? Yesterday I (F25) was at my best friend (F25, FN Sarah) wedding as her maid of honor, and officially ruined the atmosphere with my sleepy behaviour and falling asleep twice.

I was running on a 30 minute stressful nap of energy, so I don't remember much of what happened, but from ""testimony"" from the other brides maids and some of the guests; I displacing slow reactions, lose of concentration and body coordination, with fuzzy vision.

The ceremony went fine, with two of the brides maids helping me; my bff sister (F29, FN Nina), and my SIC (F26, FN Kara), bless their souls.

I remember the ceremony, but the after that, everything is a blurr. Apparent. Nina stayed with me throught nearly the entire reception, while Kara took up the MoH duties in the reception. Even then, accor. to them and others, cause everyone knew I was the maid of honor, guests wondered why I was looking like a zombie, just sitting on my assigned seat and doing nothing. I then aparently fell asleep and Nina woke me to the speeches, in which I fumbled mine (aparently looking and acting like I was drunk or high) and made myself and by association, Sarah and the BMs look bad. In the middle of Sarah's MILs speech, I fell asleep yet again, falling face first into my plate, ruining her speech (she took it as a personal offence, acor. to her calls). Nina then took me home and stayed over.

Now, when I woke up, Nina sugercoated what had happened, but the calls and texts informed me exactly what I had done under the reception.

Many wedding guests sent angry/hateful texts or calls, calling me horrible things. I have tried to reach Sarah and her husband, but neither is answering, but according to my some brides maids, Sarah is seething.

Most of my fellow brides maids are understanding and is defending me, as to say that the days leading up to the wedding was hectic, would be a understatement.

They assert I saved the wedding, from acting as the ""official"" wedding planner through and coordinating the rehearsal to the point that even without me, they and the personal could do everything without a hitch. They say it's understandable that I'm tired, as i had to panic find new photographers the night before the wedding because of sickness (after rehearsal), force the old to take COVID tests (negative), checking on ever guest to see their health, setting up zoom for the elderly to not take any chances and for just generally being a positive influence.

It doesn't change that i'm horrified and feel extremely guilt for ruining Sarah's special day.

"AITA for not sharing my food with family on picnic? A few days ago my grandpa requested a family picnic with all the kids and grandkids. We are not generally close to each other I see my aunts and uncles like once a year but we still agreed to do it because we will do anything for grandpa. We used to go to these kind of picnics when I was younger but we haven't gone to any for 5 years.

Some said they would rather order food from a restaurant and some wanted to have homemade meals so we just agreed that each family should bring their own meal just for themselves, no sharing. It just works best for everyone.

I volunteered to bring food for my baby sister who is 11 and also for grandpa because his cooking is awful and he doesn't like restaurant food. I asked my sister what she wants and eventhough she was very shy to say it at first she let me know that she has never had any steak or any lobster(our parents are very poor) so I decided to bring surf and turf. I also brought some fruits that are rare in my country and therefore very expensive because I knew she has never tried them before.

Well we went to picnic and it turns out that the other relatives have considerably cheaper food than us. 

One of my aunts asked me if I would give my lobster to her son and eat one of her sandwiches instead and I was like well no. I'd like to eat my own food I didn't spend so much money on my meal just to eat some crappy sandwich.

The were giving me the cold shoulder the entire day and after we left I got a text from my uncle calling me all kinds of names for ""flaunting"" my money. I reminded him that we used to do these kind of picnics when I was younger and no one seemed to care that my family and I were eating some cheap mac and cheese while the rest of them had so much better food but he still thinks I'm an asshole so here I am asking you if I really am one",0.47
"AITA for wanting to take revenge on my dad’s inappropriately young girlfriend? My dad hired a new assistant for his office, finally. His memory has really faded and he has gotten incredibly disorganized. 

She is 36, he is 69.

She has 5 kids, with 4 different men. She prides herself in her ability to take advantage of welfare/government supports. I’m all about government support but she tells all sorts of lies, manipulates landlords, case workers, etc. She poisons others to make her life easier. It’s awful. Her 3 year old daughter wasn’t talking because Heather just wasn’t talking to her! She has two sons that are maybe 8 and 9, and one is on the spectrum. She doesn’t follow through with anything the mandated behavioral therapist recommends, and she just lets the kids do whatever they want and then yells at them to be quiet. This is terrible, but she also sends one of her little boys to his dad’s house when she needs a break. The kid told her that the dad has his girlfriend sleep on the couch, and the kid sleep in the bed with him and he plays porn for the kid!! Wtf? She knows this happens and continues to send him there. 

Did I mention that Heather’s biggest passion is small beauty pageants???? My dad, who hates traveling, hates planes, hates hotel rooms, can’t stand being around kids for too long, and really is very content sitting in front of his TV watching reruns of Shark Tank- has taken Heather and her daughter to little mother/daughter pageants all over the east coast, paying for travel, lodging, etc. 

She “works” in his office Monday through Thursday but he often just has her drive around with him to keep him company and go out for lunch instead of organizing his office. This guy hasn’t filed taxes in several years and just pays the huge annual late fees- he really needs help. 

I became his medical attorney of power a few months ago (he’s had back to back heart attacks, kidneys 6x the size they’re supposed to be, major setbacks in memory, ongoing back issues). I went down to care for him after a back surgery this Fall, to find out that he changed his emergency contact to Heather and I wasn’t able to speak to anyone in the hospital to get an update or any information because of this. 

My brother is about to have a baby, and we all fear that my dad will have a stronger relationship with Heathers daughter than his own granddaughter. 

He’s opened up bank accounts for her, he overpays her, he buys $800 water filter systems for her house that is completely covered by housing authority. He also gets sucked up in her constant drama, often telling me about it as if it’s his problem. My biggest fear is that Heather is going to sue him. I’m sure she can figure someway to sue him based on her being (an under the table) employee and all the suggestive texts and handsy flirting. The kicker is that they aren’t even having sex! They kiss on the lips and are overly touchy. And they share a hotel bed when he takes her to her pageants.

I always offer to meet him halfway especially if we have the same day off. When we meet halfway I am paying tolls to get there. This week on our common day off he couldn’t make it so he came to my work and waited for me to get off so we can spend the rest of the afternoon together. I never asked him to come all the way down but he chose to since he had the time and wanted to get more time together.

"AITA for “Mocking disabled people?” I know the title looks horrendous, it’s a genuine sentence from our conversation verbatim. 

Today I was having a conversation over the phone with a lifelong friend (R) about memories from our childhood. We eventually got to the topic of her TikTok account blowing up years ago and how it was her proudest accomplishment at the time. I countered with the time I got put in the front page of the local newspaper by sitting in a wheelchair.
This happened during a parade for an Irish summer festival. We live in an extremely cultural area, Irish is commonplace etc. All the schools in the town get their own float theme, costumes etc. Ours  that year was puppets, we spent days after school painting, sculpting, sewing and gluing! We made about 20 puppets in total. One was a decrepit old lady, with sloppily applied wool hair, and an awfully long face. Being the main artist, I got priority over which puppet I wanted to carry. I chose her, partly because I felt bad that someone would actually have to hold her and partly cause she came with a wheelchair. What could be more fun than a wheelchair all to myself? Well, not myself. My best friend (G) and I were inseparable, during the parade, we took turns pushing it. 

Until I got tired just at the bottom of a hill. My skinny anaemic ass knew she couldn’t make it up, so I gave G a warning look and she shrugged towards the chair. I obliged, like most would.

Just at the top of the hill, this bald guy with a cameras eyes light up, like he’d seen something amazing. He made a beeline towards us, and snapped a few glory shots of me grinning with a puppet on my lap,  & poor sweaty little G behind me, thankful that hill was over.

Years later at 13, while recounting this story to a friend of my dad’s it clicked to me why he was laughing, and why everyone had laughed when I told them. Camera guy thought I was disabled. Haha funny. From then if it was ever brought up, I’d tell it as a quick laugh in conversation.

Same thing today only this time I didn’t receive the usual response. R thought that story was awful. That me recounting it as a joke sends a weird message, like making fun of experiences many disabled people face daily, and at the time I probably should have asked for those photos not to be used as I wasn’t actually disabled. I should have known better at 10. She said that she doesn’t know this side of me, and questioned if I seriously hadn’t realised what I had done.

I can appreciate that I was definitely wrong for joking about that, as I see how it comes off in a way that is absolutely not intended. I never want to hurt someone intentionally. I will certainly cease. However I can’t fathom how I can be to blame for those photos getting published, and how I handed it. I genuinely didn’t know there was an “it”.

"AITA for prioritizing to hangout more with my friends rather than my relatives? I was called by my parents to discuss my infrequent attendance at family gatherings. My dad expressed dissatisfaction, stating that I prioritize spending time with my friends over my cousins and other relatives, suggesting that they won't be of help in the long run. Frankly, I find this assertion rather rude, as if the sole purpose of my friendship is to gain future benefits.  
  
The truth is, I don't feel a strong connection with most of my cousins. We don't share many interests, and I'm not usually the one to initiate conversations. Engagements with them usually consist of superficial small talk, which I find unfulfilling. Being an introvert, I tend to be more reserved, especially in gatherings where most are extroverts.  
  
I feel more at ease and communicative with my friends which is why I prefer spending time with them. However, whenever I express my difficulty in connecting with my relatives and lack of conversation topics, my parents insist that I should try harder and still pressure me to attend family occasions, even when I feel uncomfortable.

"AITA for not wanting my husband's daughter at our home and causing a big family fight with his mother My husband (m35) and I (27) are married and we have a 5 year old girl and I am pregnant (first trimester)

Like six months ago my husband found out that he has a daughter (13) from a previous relationship. He knew nothing about this, he was dating a girl who was toxic and lied about BC to baby trap him, when he said that he didn't want anything with her, she said she was going to get an abortion. 

Okay right now my husband has met up with his daughter, she has also met his family/ me and our girl. The girl doesn't live with her mom, she lives with her maternal grandparents, so the other day she brought up the idea of my husband having custody over her so she could live with us. At the moment I didn't say anything, but when we were alone I told my husband that I'm not okay with that. We have our own plans and suddenly adding a 13 year old teen is going to complicate things. At first he didn't understand my side but then he agreed.

However, my MIL said that it's not appropriate for his daughter to live with her grandparents when she has her dad. She told me that I need to accept his daughter, but I said that I didn't marry a man with a child, I married a man with no children, we have our plans and logically we don't even know this girl enough to allow her at our home full time. She has been parented by other people and her mom wasn't good, we can have this conversation in a year when we know her and her family better and we have settled with our new baby.

"WIBTA for stretching my ears? I (21F) have been stretching my ears for roughly 2 years now. I started while my parents were on vacation because I knew they wouldn't like it, yes AH on my part. My dad doesn't like it but he is flexible, he also doesn't like tattoos but I have one and my mom has 3. They are not preferable to him but he respects our choices, as he does with my ears too. He just moves about his day and ignores them, which is honestly what I prefer because I don't expect him to lie about anything

The issue is my mom, who isn't really a BIG issue, I just feel bad. She will not comment on my ears, which I enjoy and prefer, 98% of the time. It's the best case scenario. However, whenever I size up (my goal size is 1/2"", I'm currently a 0g, so there are only 3 left) she will say something like, ""Uh, you sized up your ears again? Are they bigger? You know I hate it, it makes me uncomfortable, please stop."" 

Because of this, I've been wearing my current 0g plugs for about 11 months now. I know it's my body and I am an adult, but my parents do a lot for me because I still live at home while going to college full time and working 30 hours. I was supposed to move out this May, but my roommate needed a setback (no biggie) so now it's more like August. Also I am and will be supporting myself for/ through the move.

Would I be the AH if i sized up right now while she isn't home? Should I just wait until August to stretch again? Or nah because she will still comment on them? Should I just keep the size I am now and deal with it?",0.13
"AITA for moving out mid-lease to live with my boyfriend? I was living with my two closest friends and they've since cut me out of their lives, stating that I'm incredibly selfish for ""abandoning them"". 

I gave them two months notice and found a lovely replacement who they are also very close with. I also left behind my furniture so that they wouldn't be put out by my absence. I'm feeling very sad and conflicted about the situation. AITA?

EDIT: context 
I moved in with my boyfriend as I had never lived with a partner and was ready to have that experience and wanted to move on with my life. I was 27 at the time. My boyfriend was made homeless suddenly and it suited both of us to move in together then. 

They called me selfish as I chose my own desires over theirs, I put them in a position where they would have to live with somebody else and that isn't what they planned to have to do, essentially. 

I didn't break the lease as I passed it on to the next person. I'd already lived with them for two years at this point.

Another edit: 
They were very happy with the person we found to replace me. This is more about the ethics of what I did by moving. I want to start having children in two years and have been anxious to build a life with my partner so that we will be ready then. Putting that on hold for 8 months didn't feel right.",0.8
"AITA for sending my sister in hospital on ""purpose"" Before starting, this is a throwaway because my sister follows my main, English is not my first language so I make small grammar mistakes.

To start off, I(20F) wanna say my sister(34) is extremely allergic to shrimps(if the shrimp has touch anything and then my sister touches it she gets an allergic episode on her skin being red and itchy but its stop  after a while).One more thing, my sister and mom(60) don't understand the concept of ""privacy/asking for permission"" so they eat most of the times each other's or my stuff.
Yes I live with my family while I try and save up to move out in the future.(save it, I don't need to hear comments calling me a looser or move out already).

Now for the story, the other day I had made pasta with shrimps(specifically only 1 plate for me since I know noone eats it),I ate all the shrimps included and I left some leftover pasta in the counter table but I cover it on top with another plate in hope I find it later to eat it, I didn't think much of it and went on with my day(I left house for my french lessons).

When I came back I was welcomed with lots of swearing/curses by my mom because my sister ate the pasta and her episode started so she rushed her to the hospital, after a lot of fighting she calmed down and said it's my fault, thank God my sister is fine, I just don't understand how is this my fault because I have asked some of my friends and they tell me I fucked up for real.

"AITA for telling my best friend who wants to date my ex that we can’t be friends if he does so So my (29m) best friend (34m) wants to date my ex girlfriend (29f). He sat me down the other day and told me they have feelings for eachother and they want to date.

When we were together we were all part of the same friend group and when we broke up apparently they got closer. They haven’t acted on anything without telling me.

For context we were together for 10 years. It’s been almost a year since we broke up. I’ve been in a new relationship for a couple of months. 

He told me the other day and I was in shock. After thinking about it, I’ve come to the conclusion that being friends in any aspect to either of them has the serious potential of throwing off the work I’ve done on myself post break up, and messing up my current relationship. 

I explained to him how it makes me feel that he would do something like that. I told him that it feels like a betrayal. I don’t care if my ex moves on; she’s going to. But I care that my best friend is the one she’s doing it with. He’s been very logical about the situation, telling me that he’s doing nothing wrong and that I really have no say in who she dares (which is true).

Am I the asshole if I cut these people out of my life? Am I wrong to feel betrayed by my best friend? 

I have a deep love for both of these people but I feel like if they choose this path I have no room in either of their lives in any capacity.",0.33
"AITA for refusing to get rid of my cat at my grandparents house? So I (20F) recently got into an argument with my nana about having a cat. Now for context me and my family live in a house that she owns. It’s me, my fiancé, my mom, my little sister, my little brother, and my uncle and his wife live in a trailer on the property. And my grandparents live in another house they own about 15 minutes away. I got this cat from a friend that I no longer talk to anymore and had to take her sooner then planned because she was moving and couldn’t keep her for me anymore. My fiancé and I are meant to move out of my grandparents house before the end of March because I am pregnant and this was just a temporary home for us while we found a place. Before I moved the cat in I asked my nana if it was okay and she told me yes because it is temporary. And now she is taking that back. My younger brother mentioned my cat while we were out rolling skating with my family and she told me we never talked about it and that I am a big fucking liar. Now my nana is in her late 50s and she has a really bad memory which leads to arguments with a lot of people. She is also not talking to me about it and going through my mom. My mom told me I need to get this figured out and I told my mom that me and my fiancé pay rent which my nana doesn’t make you or my uncle do and she allows my brother to have a dog, my sister to have two chinchillas and even though my uncle is in a camper not technically the house he has a cat, a snake, and a lizard. And we even offered to pay 100 more on top of what we are already paying for rent. I’m not giving away my cat if we are the only ones who pay rent and still can’t have an animal that we can afford. And my nanas only reason that I have heard personally is she doesn’t want a cat in this house. I feel like this situation could be handled a lot better but I’m not sure how.",0.12
"AITA for ""outing"" my twin brother? I (17f) have a twin brother. He came out to me as gay a few months ago and i've been really supportive of him. Unfortunately we have an uncle who's homophobic and sometimes makes comments about gay people. He came round last night and we were watching tv with him and our parents. My uncle started mocking the way a gay man on tv was speaking. I hate it so much and I yelled at him ""you never know who in your family could be gay. so can you shut up being homophobic for one second"" For some reason my uncle turned to my brother and asked ""is it you that's gay?"" My brother got upset and walked out the room. I walked out too and it ended up with my parents talking to him and asking if he's gay. And he came out to them too. They support him too but he told me he wasn't ready to come out and now I feel really bad about all this. AITA? Thanks for reading. ",0.55
"AITA for not telling my sisters husband she's made concrete plans to divorce him? she's asked me not to tell him but I feel so bad for the guy, he stopped drinking, cut back significantly on the negative self talk and verbal abuse, lost weight and jumped through every other hoop she's communicated that he needs to jump through to try to make the marriage work. 

she's very bad at communicating. if she just told him that having guns (even in a locked safe) is a deal breaker for her, maybe he would get rid of them. Apparently she's afraid he might use them on himself or their kid. I don't get the sense he would ever do that but you never know, right? if she just told him that she's not cheating on him and having him spying on her at all hours using the cameras he installed is a deal breaker for her, maybe he would uninstall the cameras and things could go back to normal

"AITA for wanting to have a separate lunch table with just my friend and I? So, my friend (we’ll call them Ash) had a table in the cafeteria last semester with their partner and everything was fine. This semester I share a lunch period with Ash so they showed me the table they sat at with their partner (there was no ones else sitting with them last semester and Ash’s lunch period didn’t change). We sat down and stared talking and everything was fine for about a week.

The next Monday, I sat down at the table waiting for Ash to get there, so I could go get lunch, as tables are first come first serve. Before Ash got there, a girl that I didn’t know came up and asked if she could sit there with her friends. I decided because me and Ash wanted it to be just us 2 at the table. She left and I thought it was over… it wasn’t. 

The next day the same girl came and just sat at the table, didn’t ask this time. I politely asked her to move a few times, but she didn’t and by the time Ash came, 3 or 4 more girls had sat down. I asked again if they could move, to which they replied that we could just share the table (I had told them that I wanted it to be just me and Ash at the table by this time). Ash and I decided to just sit with the table with some of our friends (mainly Ash’s friends I didn’t know well) even though we wanted it to be just us two because lunch tables can get extremely loud. This same thing has happened for the past 2 weeks, with me going to the table, them refusing to move and my friend and I eventually moving. 

There is nothing stopping them from sitting there, no rules or assigned seating, but I feel like they are just sitting there to annoy us. There are other tables with only a few people (1-4), and they could sit there instead of coming to our table. 

I feel like I’m  in the right for wanting them to leave, but there is a little bit of me that feels like I’m the asshole here because of things that have happened in the past. So am I?",0.98
"AITA for being fed up with my mom 
I M20 have have been in the army for almost 2 years now, I have another year to serve but the place I am at grinds at every gear in my psych, I have began to feel intense pain in my abdomine and after almost 4 months of trying to figure it out I'm starting to reach the end of it, and leave the place I serve at.
Now for context I live with my mother and her husband and partner of 8 years, I don't have a connection with him, we're basically in a hey bye relation, I just can't bring myself to get to know him since while he is good hearted he's acting like an ass usually.

My mother has been seperated from the bio dad for 16 years, and I have no contact with him, now for the main part, for the majority of this health journy my mother acted as if she didn't believe me, that I was merely faking it all to buy time from the ship, I attmepted to explain it to her but it just ended up on multiple ocassions with her insulting me, saying my only problem is being fucked in the head, after a few times I was basically in a mental state of not being able to care much for her, I became emotional disconnected, she was sick the following week and before I would be much more inclide and attempting to help but now I merely left like a roomate.

She continued to talk as if nothing happened but I just kept it vague short and sharp, until one day I had to wake up after 2 hours of sleep, and ran to catch a bus, after 20 minutes she bombarded me with quetions and I just got super angry and asked her why is she interogating me, she became confused, and asked what I meant, I told her that she's going overboard with all those questions and she needs go let go and relax, she said ok, than haven't spoken to me for 2 days, aside from stuff to do.
Today she came into my room and started asking what going on with me, I told her nothing, she said something was going over me, I told her nothing was, she said another thing and I got annoyed and said she took a narretive in her mind and doesn't see what happend with me, I said she doesn't give me room to grow, (going out of the placr I'm at is worse for my future in general) I told her I need to make mistakes but doesn't let me do even that, she said that I don't understand her and that she's scared for me since I stay holed up in my room, (I just don't see a reason to go out, since I dislike being in the living area cause you have to be dead silent since her husband works from home and anything annoys him. I prefer being in my own space and leave at might for friends and stuff. She said it doesn't matter and said that ok if I want her to give me room to grow I need to follow a few terms, first is not to talk to her like I did, second is to always come to weekend dinners, third is if I get into trouble and didn't ask her for help I'm on my own.

Kind of on the fence since I still feel very apathetic,
hence I do not know if I came out as the asshole or is she being unfair pushing her ideas and conclusions on me, AITA?",0.71
"AITA asking to switch boarding after we’ve booked the trip So a few friends and I decided to rent cabins at a campsite for Labor Day weekend. One family with two kids has their own spot with grandparents, and then mine and another family decided to join them and split the cost of one cabin. At first it was just going to be me and my son, and the other family is a husband and wife and their four kids. All the kids are younger than 7, with their youngest only about a year old at the time of the trip. The cabin set up is one room with a bed for a couple in its own room, and then the living area has two sets of bunk beds and a loft that’s really only big enough for kids. When I booked it an hour ago I told the wife since it was only me and my son I didn’t mind taking a bunk bed but I was going to ask if my partner wanted to come for a day or so. He doesn’t know them all that well and I didn’t think he would want to go, but he said yes, and that he’d join for the full weekend. Now I’m worried because I want to ask if they’d mind if we took the room, given otherwise him and I would be sleeping with all five of the kids. I know it will stress him out, and also like they have four kids and we have one and he’s the oldest in the group. It’s just the thought of us trying to get their kids to stay in bed or whatever happens throughout the night with 4 kids. It only made sense to offer them the room when I would have been one person, and I wouldn’t mind so much to help with the kids. But with my partner in mind I think we should be secluded at night. We only booked it an hour ago, but I did say they could have the room. Now I’m so nervous and don’t know how to bring it up to them. Am I being unreasonable? Maybe I could offer to cover a little more than half on the cost because of it? I am so bad at confrontation and I think what I’d be asking makes sense. I’m really not trying to be rude, and I want honest feedback. How would you feel??",0.53
"AITA for not wanting to go out on valentines day. My 22M boyfriend said he wanted to take me 24F out to a fancy stake and burger house for dinner on valentines day, to which he says he is going to get dressed up for the dinner, but as we're talking he says how him dressing up is him wearing a tracksuit. I hate this idea and have expressed how I don't see a tracksuit as appropriate attire for a stake house, but he's not listening to me and keeps saying how expensive the tracksuit is has been saying that this is what he's going to wear no questions asked.

"AITA for asking my gf and grandmother to share a wheelchair? I (20m) and my gf (20f) were recently visiting my grandma (95f). My gf and grandma are both big history fanatics, and there's a historic home near my grandma's home that none of us have ever been to before, so we decided to make it a daytrip.

My gf has POTS and relies on a wheelchair to increase her mobility and independence, but is not wheelchair bound by any means. She regularly goes on walks with me around the neighborhood without the wheelchair. My grandma also uses a wheelchair when she's going to an event that requires a lot of standing and walking, as she has arthritis and has had multiple joints replaced, but doesn't own one. The site offers free wheelchairs to those who need them.

When we got to the site, my gf's wheelchair was too wide to fit through some of the doors in the house. The staff asked her to switch to one of the site's wheelchairs. She was willing, but after my grandma had taken hers, there were none left and we would have to wait for one of the loaners to return. I asked them if they were willing to take turns with the chair so that we could make our scheduled tour time. I figured since both of them have the ability to stand and walk, they could just switch off every ten minutes or so. They both agreed, so we got on the shuttle from the visitor's center to the site.

My grandma took the wheelchair first. Partway through the tour, my gf started feeling lightheaded and asked to switch. My grandma immediately got up, and my gf took the seat. A woman on the tour with us scolded her, saying she should ""let your grandma sit. You're too young to be in a wheelchair anyway."" This is a comment she's heard before, so she didn't really react and I thought it didn't bother her. Once she was steady again, she switched out with my grandma, who had the chair for the rest of the tour.

Once we were back at Grandma's house, my gf pulled me aside and called me an AH for making them share the chair. She said we could have waited for someone to bring a wheelchair back. I argued that I had spent over $40 each on tickets for this tour, and if we missed it, we would not be refunded. And though there was one rude spectator, both she and my grandma had had a good time. She agreed that she had enjoyed the trip but said that she felt humiliated when that woman commented and felt like people were staring at her the rest of the time we were there. So, AITA?",0.91
"AITA for saying no?? Senior in HS. One of the schools’s traditions is to paint a brick. Yesterday morning I submitted my request form and claimed the spot in the exact middle. Later, someone came up to me and asked me to move my brick so she could have her brick next to her friend’s. as far as I know, her design didn’t hinge on the bricks being next to each other, and tbh I thought it was kind of stupid to ask someone to move their spot when it was first come first served.

"AITA for asking my husband to take care of his sick children So, my husband and I have four children combined. I came with two, and he came with two.  It has become a burr for me, that his ex wife is consistently asking for favors/schedule changes to the custody agreement (in her favor) and he ALWAYS complies and bends over backwards to appease. (which I can totally appreciate keeping the peace but I feel this is more than that)

Recently, she had a week long trip planned out of town during her normal 'time with the kids'. She asked us first if we wanted to keep them, obviously we said yes.  When it came time for us to get them, of course my husband had to drive about an hour to meet her, because she always refuses to come to our home. 

Their legal agreement is to always meet halfway, but I feel like under extenuating circumstances/favors, the least she could do is bring them/pick them up. Her home is over an hour away and my husband consistently makes the full trip her direction.

When the littles (age 8 and 7) arrived Sunday, 8 was sick (high fever/cough). I work for a small company and have the space and privilege to bring kids with me to work if/when needed.  So both came to work with me, Monday.  (age 7 started a fever next) And Tuesday. Wednesday morning husband took them to doctor and then my mom watched them that afternoon. Thursday back to my office again. This is while I'm still being mom to our older two/taking to school/all the things...  I have to say, they are great kids, and have good 'office manors'.  But work as been insane and it is obviously an added stress/extra responsibility through the day.  That I gladly volunteered to do! I love them!

His ex text Thursday evening that she would be back Friday and off work and wanted my husband to meet her with the kids (this is on OUR scheduled weekend).  He told her that he had an early morning meeting and he could either meet her super early or it would be afternoon or evening before he could meet her.  She was perfectly fine with waiting until the kids could be delivered.  My office is about 30 minute drive for her.

I got upset when my husband refused to even ask her to come relieve me at work when she had nothing else to do that day.  I finally told him he needed to tell his boss that his kids have been sick all week, and going to work with his wife, and it was time for him to 'take a turn'.  And he did.  He missed his early morning meeting (which he misses this meeting often when it's convenient for him) and he drove the kids back to their mother like she wanted.  Am I the asshole for putting my foot down after a looonnnng week?

She says deal with it.  I say no.  I walk away and get a taxi.  Sure, it cost me money but IMO its safer.  As soon as I walk away she started blowing up my phone.  Over the last day she has been asking for gas money.  I sent a simple text that said no.  AITA here?  ",0.29
"AITA for fighting with my gf about her recent purchase/decision? She recently purchased a $30k car after only two days of proposing the idea of a new car. Her current car works just fine and she was under no pressure to find a new car asap. We are both young, living with our parents still and don’t have a lot of money (yes she spent almost all of her savings)

To add context, we have been dating for 2 years and I had been shopping for engagement rings and even had plans to ask for her father’s blessing a day after her purchase. I’m upset about a few things about her decision. 

1) I think she made an expensive mistake buying a luxury car with no real research or due diligence. (She thought of the idea on a Saturday and drove home a new car on Monday. She bought the first car she looked at)
2) I asked her to be patient, drive a few cars and weigh all of your options, to which she responded with, “Shut up, it’s my money and my decision”.
3.I have been house hunting these last 3 months. A decision I was making with my own money - and I had been including her wishes and concerns in that situation. I believe she failed in a way to give me the same respect with her car buying decision.

I am now convinced that I need to take a step back in our relationship and really try to understand what next steps are. I’m very uncomfortable knowing how comfortable she was in her ability to throw around that much money “blindly” and not listen to any of my concerns. 

She also overpaid for the car, it took me 5 minutes to find the exact same car for cheaper and 13,000 less miles on it. She ignores this and is totally ignorant to the situation.",0.42
"WIBTA for going on a bachelorette trip? I (25M) have been with my gf, (23F) for 6 months. I have a friend, (24F, Liz) who I have been best friends with for almost 10 years. We have never dated, kissed, any romantic relationship of sorts, we consider each other to be family at this point, my parents are like parents to her and vice versa. Liz does not live near me anymore because she moved a different state for her soon to be husband. She moved almost a year ago. My girlfriend, let’s call her Sara, has never liked her even before they met. 

Liz wanted to meet Sara and try to have a friendly relationship with her, however Sara stated she already has enough friends and doesn’t want any more. So now things have been very awkward when we are all together because Liz is aware of what Sara has said. 

Now, since Liz is getting married there is the bachelorette trip. And I am the maid/man of honour. Sara is not happy that the bachelorette trip will be consisted of Liz, her mother, myself, Liz’s sister and her two female friends who are in long term relationships. 

More information to add; I am not a jealous man, Sara has many guy friends that she texts and hangs out with frequently, and guys that are new friends since we have started dating, but it does pose a double standard that it’s okay for her to be doing this, but our relationship has been threatened if I go on this bachelorette trip for my best friend.

"AITAH for emailing my sister and brother in laws boss? Three months ago my husband was arrested for DV. I took that opportunity to leave him after dealing with years of this. While out on bail my ex ignored the criminal no contact multiple times even admitting to doing things like turning off the heat and turning on the AC to the lowest point in the cold winter months so the kids and I would essentially freeze via smart app. 

A little over a month ago my ex sister in law who was supportive at first started making excuses for my ex. She was our 3rd party contact and would try to get me not to report him. I even moved states to get away from him with the help of the DA’s office and a month later my ex moved to the same state which is the state we are both originally from. As the harassment from my ex continued I would call her for help and she’d tell me things like he’s going through a lot and to give him a freebee. At one point my ex whose whyte called me a racial slur, and she told me “how would my daughter feel if I sent him to jail over a word?” So I didn’t report and it continued. Eventually I had enough. I sent her a long text thanking her, but letting her know I can no longer allow this anymore and no longer needed her as a 3rd party communicator. I waited a few hours for a response before blocking her. 

Fast forward to this past week-I filed for a protection from abuse on my ex in my new state. The next day he was served and arrested for an outstanding warrant. I hadn’t spoken to my ex SIL or her husband in over a month and the any other of my ex’s family in over 3 months. But after my ex was served and arrested his brother texted me calling me petty and saying him and his wife are washing their hands of me. Filing a PFA and reliving your hardest moments is already not easy. So getting a message from his brother who’s also a police officer and mostly likely sees DV situations often was disappointing to say the least. After he sent that message he blocked me and I couldn’t respond. I screen captured the text and sent to his wife who also is an officer. Her response was snarky and deflective. After speaking with my DV advocate I reported this to the non emergency police line for a record incase it escalated. I felt like I was up against my abuser and his family and was exhausted. My local police then told my ex’s brother not to contact me again and I hoped that was the end of it. However, shortly after his wife (ex SIL) called that police officer back and lied saying I've been harassing her and contacting her and other members of the family and she will file harassment on me if I don't stop. I only contacted her AFTER her husband messaged me. My texts to her were defending myself for filing a PFA on my ex-not harassment. She was replying back and to get the last word after I blocked her again sent me a FB message. Am I the a hole for reporting this with screen shots to their departments lieutenants?",0.09
"WIBTA if I called animal protective services on a woman I cleaned for multiple months ago? I used to work as a household help for disabled people. I'd get sent to an address and do cleaning tasks for them that they weren't able to do themselves.   
  
I'll tell what happened that day: Due to a knee injury she is unable to walk far or even lift her legs properly and she's waiting on surgery. Right when the door opened, I was hit by the smell of old cat pee. She showed me around and the first note I took was of the absolute mess her home was. Yes, you could still walk to places, but there was clutter everywhere and things seemed to be present in the fives. I'm talking many cans of soup, many sponges, a whole trash bag full of cleaning cloths, three dishwashing brushes, et cetera. About two thirds of her attic are covered by one big pile of stuff (mattresses, pillows, old furniture) that her cats hide in mostly. While going through her rooms to clean, I couldn't even get into one of them because of the amount of stuff in it. I recognize hoarding when I see it and this woman's vibes told me that it was probably mental illness. 

  
The real issue is: she has two cats, one old one and one young one. The young one was in heat and was meowing for attention and the lady told me to ignore. When I was not with the lady, the cat would come up to me and I'd give her many hugs and that creature was absolutely touch starved. The poor beauty was just pushing into my hand like it's the last thing she'll ever feel. I haven't seen her older cat and I assume it's hiding in the pile of junk in the attic. 

Second issue: our nearby pond has some turtles in it and apparently, she (or her son) had caught two and kept them at their home. These turtles were kept in such a small tub that they couldn't move unless one climbed on top of the other. There was nothing in there other than water, a heap of food and their own feces. I told the woman that the turtles were in too cramped places and she got snappy and defensive, saying she'd been keeping them there for 10 years and they were fine with it. 

My mom told me that it is up to me to inform any authorities and that she is also upset. I've been stewing on this for a bit beacuse that woman clearly needs help, which is why I haven't reported her to my company. The other side of my thinking is: I wish a painful death on any animal abuser, no matter why they do it I see absolutely no excuse for you to harm an animal that is entirely at your mercy. Especially neglect because it is extremely selfish to me to take a pet for your own amusement and then not take care of it.

I can still vaguely remember her name but I have a stupidly good memory of addresses and I still know hers.

"AITA for saying “I don’t give a ____ “ Hi before I begin my story im gonna say a few things about me, im a secondary school student (7th grade to 9th) so im pretty young, im also a female if that helps this story i guess. Let me begin, I had the biggest crush on this guy since I was in primary school, one day my friend came over and she took my phone and sent him a message basically making me confess. After that we kinda became a situation-ship. While this was happening he would sometimes send me messages trying to make me jealous such as, “this girl said she likes me” , “this girl kept looking at me” and “this girl fell in love with me” obviously after a while I got tired and told him “ I don’t give a ____, I won’t get jealous not even a little bit, so stop please.” Looking back that was super harsh. He then started to ignore me. So AITA?",0.06

"AITA for assuming my partner is looking at my social media accounts 
For 10 years my partner has looked at my phone and social media accounts. 

I never looked at her phone or had any interest to.  I let her look at my phone thinking it would help lessen her insecurities. 

Lately, I found out she had been messaging other people that scans back our entire relationship and before.  Even going back to when she was with her last partner.

After finding the messages I felt pretty sorry for her. In the sense of, all of a sudden whenever her phone buzzed I would want to jump from the other side of the room to see who it was. I don't know how she hasn't had a heart attack feeling that level of anxiety the whole time. 

Either way,  I decided I didn't want her looking at my shit anymore. Which could make me the asshole. It has been a game of cat and mouse ever since.

She isn't very tech savvy, though, unfortunately a compulsive liar. Every time I would accuse her of looking she would simply say ""it's not me"". So I have had to ""prove it"" with hard evidence. Each time unveiling to her how to cover her tracks. 

At first I could see what apps she had left open and it was obvious. Then I had to start using activity logs and phone stat's. I changed the passcodes on phone, tablet, computer. 
She found an old phone and started using that. I changed the passcodes on that. She saw me use the passcode and it started all over again. 

I'm not very imaginative when it comes to passwords and was reluctant to change any. Having been open to her the whole time she knew all of them but between the logs and her insistent ""I'll never look again"" speeches, I didn't change them.

Lately, I would find messages and stories on Insta read before I had opened the notification and was going crazy as to how she was doing it.  She still would just say, ""wasn't me"" and make me out to be paranoid. 

 In the privacy settings you can see ""Where you're logged in"" for your account, but, only when it's logged in. I had to sit there refreshing it waiting for a sign-in(each time feeling more schiz) and then, sure enough, her phone popped up as signed in. 

That was the most recent time. I've finally changed passwords and logged everything out.  Then last night a story was opened and I instantly accused her. She scoffed and gawked. There is a chance I somehow opened it unknowingly and if it was the first time I would never have accused her. But... come on.  

AITA for accusing her again?
 AITA for trying to lock her out in the first place?",0.2
"AITA for refusing to change my seat even though the teacher told me several times? I’m in high school, and I have high-functioning autism spectrum disorder. I have several accommodations for myself as well as my service dog. In my Section 504 (accommodation plan), I have preferred seating where I agree with the teacher on a seat that works well for me. The teacher randomly moved me a few weeks ago to a seat that wasn’t working. There was no space for my dog to lay down, and I knew it wouldn't work with my sensory issues. She didn’t tell me about this, so instead of going to sit down, I went to the principal’s office. The principal knows about my condition as well as the accommodations I have, so she offered to talk to the teacher about my seat. The next day, I returned, and the teacher moved me to a new seat. While there was space for my dog to lay down, the seat still wouldn't work for me. Instead of going to the office, I sat down in my old spot. The teacher yelled at me, telling me I wanted a new seat, so she gave me one. I went to the new seat, and eventually, I had a meltdown. I don't see the big deal about letting me sit in my old seat since there's not anyone sitting there. Since then, I’ve spoken to five different counselors, principals, etc. She still refuses to move me back to my old seat.

"AITA for telling my half sister that she didn’t miss much when it came to knowing our father? Our father passed away a few weeks ago due to cancer.I have six siblings, two of them are half-siblings. My oldest brother was born when our father was only seventeen. A few years later, my oldest sister was born she was from a relationship that my dad had in college. Then my dad met my mother, whom he married and had five children with. There is an eighteen age difference between me and my older half-brother. I knew I had older half-siblings but never met them. I met my older half-brother first, we were invited to his wedding. The I met my older half-sister because our dad drove her to rehab. 

I’ll admit my dad wasn’t a good father. He was a narcissistic abusive alcoholic. He verbally and physically abused me, my siblings and my mom. But he did have his sweet moments, I’ll remember fishing and ice cream was my favourite things to do with my dad. But I have more negative memories than good memories of my dad sadly.

So all my siblings (excluding me because I don’t drink) all drank after the funeral. Things started taking a turn, my older half-sister started telling me and my full-siblings that we were lucky to know him. I laughed and told her she was lucky to be raised her kind step-dad (I met him and he was very kind) as her father, that she didn’t miss much. She took an offence to what I said.

After that night, things went weird. Our family GC is basically dust. Only two of my siblings are on speaking-terms with me.

"AITA for making my niece go back to a restaurant after she didn't pay tip?   
Yesterday, I (m32) took my niece, Dove (f15) and nephew, Reef (m11) to the mall after school, Reef got some Nike shoes and some gifts for the birthday of a friend on his basketball team, Dove got some clothes, we then went thrifting, and Reef got some vintage basketball jerseys. We were then planning to go to dinner, but first Reef wanted to change into one of the jerseys he got, so he changed in the bathroom of a gas station I pulled into. My wife (f32) and I are watching Dove and Reef while their parents are on a vacation together, they are the kids of my wife's sister Natalie (f34).  
  
My phone was off while we were shopping, I decided to turn it on while he was changing and saw several texts from co-workers regarding several topics. I am a teacher, and life has been abousolutely insane at my job right now, between having to file multiple CPS reports, drama among staff, and parents mad at the school board. I saw the content of some of the texts and told the kids we couldn't do dinner, as I had to deal with work-related issues, they asked if they could go without me, I was fine with that, I dropped both of them off and gave Dove the money.  
  
One thing about Reef is he is a great tipper, he always tips when getting his own food with his own money even at a place like Subway or Moe's, I've seen him do it more than once. He's such a sweetheart.   
  
Dove is kind of the opposite, she has worked in service before (as a waitress at two different local resturants, and at a movie theater) but she complains about service often, saying it's not that hard and she knows it becuse she's worked it.  
  
My wife picked them up from the resturant, as I was still busy with the work-related issues. After I finally finished, I went to check on the kids and I asked Reef how the food was and he said it was good, he then asked me if he could ask a question and he seemed concerned. He asked if it was normal to not leave a tip at a resturant, because you didn't like the waiter. He told me that Dove didn't tip, telling him she didn't like the boy who served them he was a peer of hers (same grade and school), and was a ""snitch"" who reported kids who vaped, and also commented on his ""ugly"" nails and his ""annoying gay"" voice. I asked him what the boy looked like, he told me about the painted nails and the rest of the details (orange nails, ""boy"" clothes, had short hair, wearing makeup, ect).  
  
This afternoon when picking up the kids, after I got Reef, I drove Dove to the resturant and told her she would have to apologize and give the boy a tip if he was there, the manager said he would be there shortly. Once he came in, I had my niece apologize and give him the money.  
  
My wife knew about this and was ok with it, but Dove has been crying about how we ""embarrassed"" her and is slowly making my wife think we went too far. AITA?

"AITA for not letting my girlfriend pay for lunch for me? My(19m) gf(19) and her friends are all from much richer families than I am. They have lunch at the same restaurant everyday. Not far from campus. I can only afford the cheapest dish and only once a week, so that’s how frequently I lunch with them.

Yesterday my gf told me that she can pay for me but I don’t want money to be too involved in our relationship. Obviously we give each other gifts but I don’t feel comfortable having her pay for lunch for me on a daily basis like that.

She frowned and said that she just wants to have lunch with me and that I’m ‘making things overcomplicated’ because of my ‘stupid pride.’ And that it embarrasses her having to tell her friends that her bf is eating ‘7/11 crap.’",0.04
"AITA for not appreciating my parents wanting to pay for university and disrespecting their wishes? I (F18) live in a tiny hamlet in the middle of nowhere with my adoptive parents, Darren (M59) and Susan (F60).

 I’ve sent out my uni application a month ago, 4 of my choices were relatively close, but still a pain in the ass to travel to using public transport. My 1st option is in a city that is an hour and a bit train ride away. Darren and Susan weren’t too happy about it, they wanted me to attend a uni that’s about 30 minutes away. They have said that if I choose to go there, they will pay for it rather than have me taking out a student loan, but my heart is already set.

The big brunt of the issues arises where my bio dad is concerned. I met him for the the first time 2 years ago and almost immediately felt a connection to him. My dad, Damon (M34) is the loveliest, caring and most doting man I’ve met, he was beyond happy to finally meet me and get to introduce me to his wife, Sian (F33) and his little boy, Rosie (M2). I feel at home with them, my dad’s always hugging me and giving me kisses on my forehead, they truly include me in what they’re doing, Sian has even bleached my hair platinum for me and pierced my nose. I love watching how happy Rosie is and how he’s always being held and played with. The things I lacked in my upbringing have been given to me here.

When my dad and Sian found out about my first choice of uni, they offered to let me live with them. They have an apartment in the town centre and the uni is only a twenty minute walk away. Obviously, I jumped at the offer - it’s free housing and being able to live with family members that treat me like I’m one of them. 

It’s really upset my adoptive parents though, they’ve said that I’m leaving them for someone I’ve known five minutes as well as disrespecting their wishes, and throwing the money they’ve spent on my education in their face.

They have even offered to rent me an apartment close to my first choice uni as long as I don’t just move in with another family. For the past week, they’ve been down in the dumps over it all.",0.17
"AITA for not traveling with my wife? My wife (Anna - fake name) is mad at me because I didn't go with her to see her family. 

For context, her Grandma is old and not doing well (87 years+). There has been multiple times were she has had health scares. 

Anna is EXTREMELY close with her Grandma. This means that if Anna's Grandma was close to death, we would both go visit her in a heartbeat.

One more point before I get into my story: My wife gets an idea in her head, and it isn't coming out. She likes to travel together. 99% of the time, I travel with her when she requests it.

Story: 

Anna and I just got back from a major trip with my family (expense wise). It was a very tiring trip. I am already trying to start a business that isn't going super well, and money stresses us both out (even though we have plenty compared to 95% of people our age).

After having a stressful conversation about money, Anna and I decided we weren't going anywhere after this big trip. I forgot that we had to go visit her family the next weekend. I tried to get out of it - not because I didn't want to go, but because of stress. She point blank refused and made me go. We had a fight.

I told her that after that weekend trip, I am not going anywhere else. I needed to focus on my business, and maybe get a part time job. 

Fast forward to this weekend,  and she said that she wanted to go visit her Grandma again. I told her that this really wasn't a good week, and put my foot down. Anna claimed that it was horrible I didn't want to see her Grandma, as she might not live to see next week.

Knowing there are no unusual concerns regarding her Grandma's health (aside from being frail and very old), I said that I couldn't make it work, as I needed to work.

She got very upset and said I would rather drink with my family (which is FALSE, as I never have more than two beers a month on average) then go see her dying Grandma. I even offered to drive multiple hours for a day trip tomorrow to see them both, to which she refused. 

Now, she is cancelling future trips to see my family because I am not going this weekend. 

No, I would never divorce Anna - I love her until I die, but I just want to know if I am the bad guy.

I know that it is more about Anna wanting me to be with her than her Grandma. If it was about her Grandma, she would've accepted my offer to drive down alone to meet them.

"WIBTA if I (24f) told my boyfriend (24m) he made his hairdresser uncomfortable? 
I (F24) have been dating my boyfriend (24m) for over two years, and in this time he’s never really given me the impression to think he would give anyone “weird” vibes. However, after going to a beauty school to get my hair trimmed today, I was made aware that that’s not exactly the case. For context, he’s a very talkative and friendly person, all of his jobs have been highly customer oriented so he’s used to striking up conversations, and he’s not particularly afraid of trying to get to know and befriend whoever it is that he’s spending time with whether he’s in line at Chic-fil-a, his barbers, customers, etc. basically anybody any everybody that will talk to him, he will talk to lol.

Today, however, we both went in to a beauty school for on site services- me for a trim, him to get his hair braided. I got in before him, but during my cut one of the other hairdressers in training came up to my girl and was like “that dude came in a while ago to get braids, but I don’t want to do them again. I think he’s creepy.” My heart started POUNDING YALL. My hairdresser asked her why, since they didn’t know we came in together, and she told her that the last time he was in there she was doing his braids and he was “just creepy”, because he was talking a lot and then asked the girls if a lot of men who come in get weird at all. She told her she didn’t really have an answer and that it was weird that he asked so she just laughed it off, and my hairdresser was like “I mean that’s kinda outta pocket but I don’t think it’s that bad compared to what we normally get tbh” and the other girl was like “yeah, but he just said it kinda, idk, creepy and he kept saying he felt so ‘pampered’ because there was like 3 of us hanging out kinda helping, and I just thought it was super creepy. But yea so someone else can do his braids” To which my hairdresser kinda just shrugged and changed topics but I couldn’t really stop thinking about it. 

Personally I don’t find that situation weird really, but if it was something that she remembered well enough to talk about and refuse service I’m wondering if it’s something I should bring up? I don’t want to hurt his feelings and I truly don’t think he’d ever go out of his way to make anyone feel creeped out, especially someone providing a service for him. But it’s also not really sitting right with me if there’s potential this could be happening elsewhere too, and if I should maybe bring it up to him to see if he’ll tone it down a bit and maybe he’d want to know, but part of me also kinda feels like she might’ve just felt some typa way and I don’t want to tell him that and “dim his sparkle in essence. 

So that being said, WIBTA if I brought up this situation and asked him to tone it down? Or WIBTA if I chose not to bring it up? 

TLDR; my (24f) bf (24m) made a hairdressing student uncomfortable by asking her if any dudes come in and act weird with them, which she thought was creepy of him, so WIBTA if I told him what she said?",0.4
"AITAH for using a spa gift card I had given to my MIL as a birthday present? To sum up years of problems, toxic behaviors, and manipulation, my MIL is a very bad person. DH and I are currently NC with her and she has never met our son who was born mid last year. 

Okay, so a couple years ago, my MIL calls her 3 sons and tells them she wants them to take her out for her birthday (my husband paid per always). This is funny considering she never does this for her sons, no dinners, card, nothing. Anyways, MIL had been complaining for the past several years how difficult her life is etc etc, and while the majority of it was either made up or self caused, I thought she could use time to relax. My parents, husband, and I all chip in to get her a large gift card for a really really nice spa in the area. We thought she would appreciate taking some me-time.  Mind you, she is ALWAYS complaining that nobody does anything nice for her, so I thought she would be really happy. 

Per usual, none of the other sons get her anything, so there wasn’t a designated “gift giving” time. I wait until after we finished dinner, before dessert came, and told her about her present. It was a digital gift card, so after I told her what it was, I sent her an email with the gift card. She just looks at me, seemingly annoyed, mutters “yea okay” and turns her head to talk to one of her sons. 

6 months later, I ask her if she had ever gotten her spa treatment. She says no and blows me off. 
Now it’s about 2 years later, I’m halfway through my pregnancy and dealing with major pregnancy anxiety.  My husband has recently asked him mom to be better for our soon to be son, and she hangs up on him, and that was that, we were cut out.  My friend mentions I should get a pregnancy massage, and this reminds me of MIL’s gift card. I call the spa, and no surprise, it’s never been used. 

I tell my husband and he tells me I should use it, that if his mom doesn’t appreciate what we gave her, in addition to now going NC, he wants me to use it. I decide to wait until after giving birth so that I’m not stressing out the whole time, and yet again it wasn’t used. So yes, I got a spa treatment, now almost 3 years after giving it to her, and all I had to pay out of pocket was the tip. 

Am I the asshole for using the gift card?  After everything she’s put us through, I don’t feel bad about it, and I doubt she’ll ever know since she wasn’t going to use it out of spite.",0.02

My son isn't happy because of this My (15f) daughter and her boyfriend  broke up a couple of days ago. My daughter is obviously pretty upset about it since they were going to be Valentines, and I've been comforting her about it since. 

Since my daughter told me her friends don't have valentinds either, I proposed the idea that maybe her and her friends just hang out together. I offered to take them (I know these friends really well, basically sisters to my daughter) to the mall in LA since my husband and I are going to a restaurant for Valentines Day anyway. 

FF a couple hours, and my daughter parents are ok with it, as long as they're back by 10 p.m. I trust these girls, so I'm planning on leaving my daughter with a couple hundred for shopping an Uber for her and her friends for their ride home

My son (14m) isn't happy with this. He says he thinks it isn't fair since all the years he didn't have a valentine (except this year). I didn't do that for him. I think it's different, though, because my daughter had a falling out with her bf, and plus, she's 15. All those other years my son is talking about was when there was no chance I'm sending a 12 year old to the mall with his friends. 

My husband doesn't really care about most of this, so I'm here asking for some outside perspective.


EDIT: I gave my son 180 dollars total for clothes (120) and flowers (60). They're also going on a cable car ride (60 ish) and then some other stuff I don't remember.

So she asked me why, and I said that it makes me uncomfortable being around substance to get you high so I would rather go hang out in a café or something while she does that.

"AITA for asking my friend to cover up when she comes over My (18F) friend (18F) comes over to my house on a regular basis. We’ve been close since we met each other start of year 7 and been inseparable through out highschool and going into uni. She’s the type of girl that seemingly always has a new crush every week to obsess over but it’s never affected me before and keeps our conversations entertaining. Her family is very open minded and lets her know express herself however she likes and doesn’t restrict her style. I have always loved the way she dresses and her overall aesthetic. Recently she’s been expressing how she finds my brother attractive but I haven’t encouraged it but I also haven’t stopped her for going for him. He is 3 years older than us and I just think it’s a small one sided crush that she will eventually get over.

I also need to mention I’m south asian and my parents prefer my siblings and I to dress modestly but they don’t force it upon us. Two days ago she came to my house in the tiniest mini skirt and shortest crop top - clothes she’s grown out of almost three years ago.

"AITA for locking my husband out our bedroom? I 28f have been with my husband John 26m for 4 years. We met at a party, and are very social people and love to go out. However I prefer staying home more now and go out less than John does.

John has recently joined a new friend group and they are heavy drinkers. John is a social drinker, but doesn’t drink as much as they do. Now that he has started hanging out with them he tends to match what they drink and while they can pull it off, John gets very drunk. 

When he gets back from these nights out he comes in our room to sleep and is very loud. I get irritated as I have to go to work the next day and wake up at 7 and the next day John has no hangover and no memory or waking me up. 

I have told John many times to pace himself when drinking with those friends or at least be quieter when you get back home.

John went out with that friend group last night and I told him I have an important presentation at work tomorrow, so please don’t wake me up. John agreed and went out. He called me as I was going to bed, and sent me drunk texts about how he was sorry but he had too much again, but he will stop after the next one. 

I knew he would wake me when he gets back so I locked the bedroom door. We have a guest room downstairs and I left that door open to him with the light on to that room, closing all the other doors do he would know where to go.

"WIBTA if I told my friend I’m upset for not making me a bridesmaid? I’ve (22F) been friends with this girl, Madi(21F), for 10 years. We’ve been REALLY close until the last year or so. I moved about 2 hours away and the distance did change our relationship a bit. But most of it is that Madi doesn’t communicate online very much. This doesn’t hurt my feelings, but it’s the primary reason our relationship was easier when we lived close together. 

I told her I was excited for her wedding and this is how the conversation goes:

Madi: “i really wanted to make you a bridesmaid but you live so far away i didn’t really know”

Me: “I don’t know what you mean. It’s okay if I’m not a bridesmaid, but my distance doesn’t affect that, at least for me”

Madi: “i just had a lot of factors when choosing my bridesmaids but i just kind of feel guilty for not making you one”

(This particularly upset me, it felt like she was looking for me to tell her it was fine but she wasn’t communicating that)

Me: “I’m not trying to be rude, but it feels like you’re expecting something out of me but I don’t know what. Do you want to talk about it?”

Madi: “you’ve just been my best friend forever and i don’t want you to be upset you’re not one” 

Me: “well, i am upset. But that’s okay”

"AITA Asshole for telling y girlfriend to ignore her coworker My gf(27) has started a new shift recently and she has a coworker (67F) who is driving her freaking nuts. This lady literally will call her on her days off, her lunch break, 2-3 night's a week, mid workday to constantly bitch about work. Every day I have to hear about how she wont be left alone by her coworker. Essentially I hear ""she won't leave me alone."" Tonight I finally just asked ""Why do you keep answering?"". I was told that I simply ""don't understand why it isn't so simple?"" I asked what I am missing and was told ""I am not going to have this conversation if you're going to be rude.

Am I just missing something? I could see how I am lacking context, but frankly if someone kept calling me every night I would tell them to leave me alone or to keep it during work hours, Just could use some help here.",0.12
"AITA for charging family member half the rent while my partner and I spilt the other half? A family member moved in with me 10 months ago into my 2 bed 2 bath apartment when they moved out of their parents home claiming it was toxic at the age of 20. They moved in and communicated their goals. Those goals were to save money and return to school. Our rent is $1,200 a month and my partner and I agreed to charge them $200 a month because we wanted them to focus on saving money. I referred them to my job where they would be getting paid more than their current job. Unfortunately, shortly after they moved in it was clear that they were going out a lot and not prioritizing saving or working towards their goal.

We realized they wanted to live an adult life which meant they needed adult expenses. We decided to raise their rent to $600+ utilities monthly which we believe fits fair market price because they get a room and bathroom and me and my partner share a room and bathroom. We have received push back from other family members saying it’s not fair to charge them half the rent instead of splitting the rent in equal three parts. Our philosophy is that they get half the apartment which means they pay half the rent. 

For reference we had to get a storage unit to make room for them which is $85 monthly and don’t charge them for the WiFi which is another $85 a month. AITA here?",0.13
"WIBTA if I stop my nephew from giving his gf gifts. My (34 F) nephew (14 M) has a gf (12 F) that he wants to buy valentine day gifts for. I don't mean to get involved in his relationship since they are still kids but he's been so excited telling me to buy his gf gifts for valentines day. He's paid about $100+ in gifts for her. I love his intentions but im not too thrilled with his gf's intentions. She's planning to break up maybe a few days after receiving the gifts. She had said the same thing for Christmas which he had already bought her stuff for and me knowing what her intentions were decided to pretend like some stuff wasn't going to arrive on time. She didn't break up with him after Christmas but now she says she has a crush at her school and wants to end things but won't do it before valentines. For the ones wondering how i know her intentions, i know because she is my husband's sister (yes it is a weird situation). I won't say that he's innocent because he's not, His gf thinks that he had been talking to her ex bff with other intentions and not just as friends(they became friend because of her) but she never got proof. My dilemma is if i should tell him her intentions or if i should pretend like i dont know anything and just let him spend all of that on a girl who doesn't wanna be with him but rather just wants the gifts he is getting her.

"AITA - Said I wanted to live with someone, then changed my mind right before signing lease. This one's causing me a ton of stress. I think reading people's responses will help.

In June of last year, I decided to live with a new housemate who, from the beginning, made me a little uncomfortable. Fast forward to January, we find out our landlord no longer wants to rent the home, and he is giving us 30 days nitice to vacate.

In the moment, rather than going with my gut and leaving both her and the situation, I decided to continue being her housemate, and seek out a new rental with her.

Well. We toured places, put in an application, and got a lease for a new place today. My other housemate and I have decided we will not sign it, and tell her we are all going our separate ways. To be frank, neither of us wants to live with her anymore, even for cheap rent.

I feel like a huge asshole for letting it get to the point of A: a lease almost being signed and B: 3 weeks before we must move out of our current place, before I finally pull the trigger and say ""no, I don't want to live with you anymore.""

I know this will leave her in a huge bind, as she is unemployed and allegedly has nowhere else to go. But I'm not a charity and to be honest, I do not get along with her at all. I'm angry with myself for letting it get to be this last minute before I was honest.

I haven't even told her yet, I'm going to stall on signing the lease until my other housemate is home to break the news with me. 

I can't help but feel like a huge asshole for pulling the rug out from under her 3 weeks before we have to vacate our current rental.",0.67
"AITA for not wanting to make separate dishes for my picky husband I (23F) have been married to my husband (30M) for 3 years now, and one ongoing issue in our relationship is his extremely picky eating habits. He refuses to eat most vegetables, doesn't like seafood, and generally prefers very bland and simple foods.  
As someone who loves cooking and experimenting with new recipes, it has been frustrating trying to accommodate his picky tastes. I've tried getting creative and sneaking in vegetables into his meals, but he always notices and ends up not eating it.  
Recently, I decided to take a stand and told him that I refuse to cook separate meals for him anymore. I told him that he is an adult and should be able to eat what is served. Since then, he's been getting takeout for himself or making his own meals, and has made comments about how I'm being unreasonable and making things difficult for him.My husband is of the opinion that since he's the one with the picky eating habits,  
I should be the one to cater to his preferences and cook separate meals for him. However, I feel like it's not my responsibility to enable his picky eating habits.I believe that adults should be able to eat a variety of foods and not limit themselves to just a few select items.  
I think it's important for him to learn to try new things and expand his palate, rather than always sticking to the same old foods. I've tried to gently encourage him to try new things, but he's always resistant.  
I understand that it can be difficult to change one's eating habits, but I don't think it's fair for me to always have to cater to his preferences while sacrificing my own love for cooking and trying new things.  
i believe that compromise is important in any relationship, but in this case, I feel like I've compromised enough by trying to accommodate his picky eating habits for so long.  
I don't think I'm being unreasonable by refusing to cook separate meals for my picky eater husband. I believe that it's important for him to learn to be more open-minded about food and to try new things. I hope that we can come to a resolution on this issue and find a way to compromise that works for both of us.",0.15
"AITA for not doing anything with my fiancé on Valentine’s Day? My fiancé and I have had a pretty strained relationship for the past 6 months. We have lived together for the past 3 years and have been engaged for 1 year.

Situation: We were both layed off in early 2023 and then both of us gained employment again in August 2023. By the time August rolled around, we were already at each others throats and it only got worse as we both worked from home. We fight all the time and I have made attempts to make things go back to the place we were in before all of this drama. 

These past 6 months have been rough and it feels like only I am putting in any effort anymore. I took us on trips to Disneyland and South Korea. I take her on dates and outings. I still buy her flowers every week or two. I take care of our two dogs and she doesn’t help in any way. She doesn’t cook. Doesn’t clean. Doesn’t surprise me with anything. Never took me on a date.

"AITA for getting upset he took a family trip without me? This is the first time I’m using Reddit so bare with me. Anywho, my boyfriend (23M) is currently gone on a week long trip visiting family and I wasn’t invited. He’s visiting his mom and brother to celebrate his brothers 18th birthday at a casino. I’ve lived with my boyfriend for 2 years (dated for almost 3) and we live in a different state than his family. 

The thing is my boyfriend’s brother and my boyfriend share the same exact birthday so he’s also away on his birthday. He also spent Christmas with his family (I wasn’t there) even though I spent Christmas with his family last Christmas in 2023. 

His mom claims I wasn’t invited to this trip because “she hasn’t had quality time with her sons since 2021” lol. Even though, come to find out there is no “quality time.” They’ve been hanging out with his brothers friends, spending time with other family members, had a huge birthday dinner with 30 people, etc. 

I’m upset because I’m very family oriented and really care about holidays and celebrations. I love my boyfriend and wish I could have celebrated his birthday and been with him.

I addressed my concerns to my boyfriend and he got very defensive and was defending his mom as to why I wasn’t invited. He hung up on me and that was that. Then I’m guessing he got his mom involved because she called me 5 times (I didn’t answer to any) and left me a text that read:

“My feelings are hurt. Thank you for allowing me to have this time with my son and for him to spend time with his little brother. We have not had time like this since 2021”

Keep in mind I barely know this woman even though I’ve been dating my boyfriend for years. For some reason I’ve only met her 2 times. So this was very awkward for me. I’m turning 24 soon and my boyfriend is 23 so why is his mother getting involved in our issues? 

I also haven’t met a lot of his family members and he’s met all of mine. So it hurt too that I wasn’t able to meet family that I haven’t gotten the chance to yet.

"AITA For demanding my husband allow our daughter to go on a graduation trip and prioritize her friends over visiting his family, and paying for the trip against his wishes? (Background info: My husband is named Brad, Valorie is our daughter who is in 8th grade, and Denise is Brad’s sister.)  
  
Main story: Valorie’s school hosts a New York trip for graduating 8th grade. It’s in late June but the deadline to register for the trip and pay the fee is in two weeks. The problem is the date conflicts with the out-of-state trip we take every two years to visit Denise and Brad’s parents.  
  
Brad’s argument is that Valorie’s at an age where the friendships she has now will most likely fade by the time she’s an adult, and Denise and her grandparents are family. So she’s going to regret it and realize what he’s insisting on now is the right choice.   
  
The thing is that Valorie isn’t particularly close with Denise or her grandparents on Brad’s side, and she’s told me that she doesn’t want to visit her family on Brad’s side if it means missing her graduation trip this year and it won’t be the same as if she went to New York as an adult.  
  
I argued my side with Brad and that Valorie will simply resent the trip to Brad’s family if it means missing her graduation trip, as well as that we’re all in good health and can reasonably expect that everyone will still be here when we visit again in two years.  
  
Brad is still insisting that Valorie will realize when she’s older that spending time with her family is the right choice and will be thankful for it when she’s an adult.  
  
Me and Brad are still on opposing sides and I have told him that I am going to sign off on Valorie’s graduation trip and pay the fee out of my own savings regardless of what he says. Am I in the wrong for putting my foot down and making sure our daughter gets to go on this trip against Brad’s wishes? Valorie has already missed so many experiences and didn’t even get a 5th grade graduation because of covid. She’s worked so hard this year to improve her grades to be allowed on this trip and I feel we need to make up for those lost events as much as possible.",0.12
"AITA? My neighbor lit off 3 huge bursts of fireworks at midnight tonight. I went over to their house and yelled at them. Apparently its Chinese New Year. I didn't know, but it really doesn't make much of a difference to me. We have noise regulations after 10pm. My neighbors decided to light 3 massive bursts of some of the loudest fireworks I have ever heard. It sounded like a freaking machine gun going off.

I jumped out of bed and ran out of my house. Knocked on their door and proceeded to very loudly yell at them. I had no plans for a physical altercation, but with my wife being scared, my dog going nuts and many other houses in very close proximity to my stupid neighbors, I was furious. One of the people in the house was screaming back at me and very obviously wanted to come out and fight, if he had done that he would have gotten a nice dose of mace in his face. Lucky for him, his housemate held him back.

Anyway, when I came back to my house, my wife was pissed off at me and said I was totally wrong to do what I did and I should have just called the cops. I don't think I was wrong, I think what I did was completely rational. But I would like to hear what other people think.",0.77
"AITA for not leaving my room? I dont think im the asshole but the rest of my family does.

I live in a family of 5, Me(f17), my sister J(f14), my sister H(f13) and my two parents. I got home later one day as usual because I had to study at the library. When I come home I usually sit at my pc and play games or read a book. After about 30 minutes of me playing my sister J comes into my room and asks me if I can leave my room so she can record something for school in her own room.

Now for context. My parents gave up the entire first floor (consists of 3 bedrooms) for me and my sisters, my room and J’s rooms are connected by a door but H’s room isnt though its still very close.

Anyway, I told her no since I was tired, wanted to play and didnt feel like going downstairs. I told her I’d be quiet and wear my headphones so I wont hear anything. She walked away and then my dad came about 30 minutes later and asked me to leave my room so she can record hers stuff in her room. Now H was apparently allowed to be in her room, I just wasnt. I told him no and I’d rather stay in my room and I’d be quiet, after a couple of minutes of argueing and the usual “Just be the bigger person and leave, you’re the oldest” arguement.
The reason they wanted me to leave was because “J feels awkward recording in her room with me being in mine”(mind you H is allowed to be in hers)

Then all hell broke lose. 

We got to screaming, I said I didnt get why I had to leave. My dad called me egoistic and I ended up crying more and more, he went over to me hit my arm and tried to drag me out by my hair. I was screaming for him to stop and leave me alone, to not do anything to me. My mom then came and tried to (not really) comfort me as I felt a panic attack coming in. After it was over she told me not to be surprised if my sisters didnt want to accomodate me if I needed to record something for school. I told her that when I was her age I had to record so much shit for school and the only thing I was asking was for the others to quiet down for 5 minutes. 

After they all left I relapsed after just having hit my 6 months clean mark, my dad came in shortly after and apologized for hitting my arm and calling me egoistic(he didnt apologize for pulling my hair). He said he still thinks what I did was wrong, but he didnt want dinner to become awkward later on.

I’ve told online friends about it and my therapist and they’ve all been on my side. Though I’d like to hear people on reddit if I was in the wrong or not.

Extra info: Me and my dad are both high functioning autist’s, J isnt autistic but my parents want to try for a diagnosis again after the first test showed she wasnt. I believe she isnt, since she has had a history with copying me and stuff she sees on the internet, fx: Right when I went down with stress and got some ‘benefits’ (such as going home from school early) she suddenly also went down with shit around the same time I did (around 7th grade)

"AITA for not going to brother’s wedding after my family ruined my relationship Hey everyone,

Me (22F) and my boyfriend (25M) have been together for 2 years now. We are both still in university getting our master for different areas of medicine (we met on campus). He is tall, good looking , thoughtful, smart and hardworking. I think most people would even say he’s out my league . He has never made any bad comments about me or my family and has even learned Russian to speak with them in their native language. Despite his efforts my parents and brother are still being absolute a holes to him for no reason. The ignored him, talked behind his back, never invited him for anything, show no interest in learning anything about him or his family. and just completely reject him in every way. my brother (27M) is the worst in all of this. Even though he himself doesn’t have nearly the same level of academic achievements or physical appeal. 

My boyfriend said that the feeling of not being accepted and having to walk on eggshells around my family and the tension this creates between us has made him reconsider our relationship.

I’m a 35f, my mom is a 68f who lives a 14 hour drive from us and my friend is a 34f. Two years ago when my friend had her first child, my mom sent her a baby blanket she made and a baby hat she made. That sounds lovely because it is but instead of asking for her address, my mom found the marina where they live and work via Facebook, then googled the address and sent it without even telling me about it. I thought that was extremely weird on her end to go to all those lengths without asking me. Fast forward two years and they still talk on fb, my mom sends me pictures and updates on my own friend. 
When this first started I told them both I was uncomfortable because I found it strange.

Usually attractive women and more often than not, blondes like herself. My brunette friend that I have known longer also had a child but she is close with her mom and no, she wasn’t sent a blanket.

"AITA for asking my wife if she wants me to cancel a work trip after her father died? Hello, I'm chasing some perspective after my wife got very upset with me and I am not sure if I'm an asshole.  


  
We have been married a few years, two kids 4 and 5. Yesterday morning, my wife received the unfortunate news that her father passed away suddenly in his sleep. He was close with our family and children, lived about 2 hours drive away and used to visit every few months for a couple of days. I was close with him as well and we had a great relationship. Recently he had been sick, diagnosed with lung cancer, but undergoing treatment and the prognosis was generally positive so his passing was a genuine surprise.  


  
Prior to his passing, I was scheduled to be away 2 weeknights during the coming week a few hours drive away for an annual work trip that is mandatory for all employees to strategise and plan for the year ahead.  


  
I asked my wife later in the day when she was a little more composed whether she'd prefer I cancel my pending work trip in the coming week. She immediately said, ""no, I don't want you to cancel, you should still go."" In my head, my thought was, if she isn't doing well then of course I would back out but I'll see how she is, thinking that 5 days would be enough time to gauge how she's coping and what I should do. I believe she is still intending to work herself during the time I'm away.  


  
Tonight, about 36 hours after she got the news about her father, and after we'd spent the day together being loving with each other, she approached me and said she's very disappointed that I chose work over her, that she can't rely on me to support her during her darkest times, and that she doesn't know how our marriage is going to come back from me abandoning her in a time of need. I am sympathetic to how much she is hurting right now so I said of course I'd cancel the work trip in a heartbeat if she wanted me near and that it means nothing to me compared to her but to her that is a meaningless gesture where she's had to make the decision for me and I should have just known what to do.  


  
I'd really like to hear other people's perspective about this as I do believe if the roles were reversed it wouldn't be an issue for me if she was otherwise supportive, caring and understanding. Am I the asshole for asking my wife is she'd prefer me to cancel my work trip instead of just cancelling it after her father died a few days before I was due to go away?

"AITA for accidentally having my boyfriend miss work? Now his job is up in the air. We’re currently in our 20’s and have an apartment together. My boyfriend has a nightshift position as a security guard. It was always a stress point in our relationship because I would have to wake him up everyday for work; he either has sleep apnea or is a deep sleeper and it would require multiple efforts to get him out the door to work. He got removed from that location as a security guard by his company because he was caught on video having beer with someone. The higher ups didn’t let him go, and put him at a new location. Now at the new location he likes it because he says he doesn’t have to do much, but there have been a handful of times he has been late for this shift unless I wake him up. Last night I attempted to wake him up multiple times, and he didn’t wake up, and his boss said he is going to be written up. Now tonight I told him he can rest for a bit, and I can wake him up. But since I worked all day, I ended up falling asleep. I felt so bad. He got really angry at me, and said he can’t rely on me because he can only rely on himself. I felt awful. But I told him it’s always been leading up to this and it isn’t fully my fault. He states well although I have tried to wake him up in the past, it doesn’t matter because he is talking about the fact I couldn’t wake him up today, since that’s the reason his boss removed him from the site. He says today is what matters and that this is why it’s my fault. He also says there have been times where I encouraged him to sleep, but only woke him up 10 minutes before his shift. I responded that since he believes I can’t be consistent in waking him up, I will no longer take that responsibility in the future. So now his job is up in the air until his meeting with his boss. I feel awful. And I know I shouldn’t have taken that responsibility, but I’ve never fallen asleep like that before so I just felt really bad.",0.13
"AITA for not reimbursing the last paycheck my daughter earned? Around two weeks ago, I convinced my daughter to make a 150$ payment for her credit card and to schedule it a week from then. She told me she wasn’t in a position to make a payment due at the time. Due to the fact that she doesn’t get scheduled enough at her current place of employment, she only had 5$ in her account, and she’s saving her next biweekly paycheck for something else. I told her not to worry about it and offered to put the money in her account before the scheduled payment date. I did not end up doing that because I simply forgot to and there was too much going on my end. The scheduled payment date comes and the account ended up being -145.00 negative according to her. At that point, she got upset with me for not doing what I promised. I told her  that I would put the money in the account to bring it back to what it was in the beginning. Well, a week after that, (which was Friday) her paycheck of 118 dollars comes in and her account still ended up being at a negative balance. She was very angry and essentially said that doesn’t have her own paycheck that she worked hard for and that she “wants a back.” I told her that I can’t give her the money. This is because I was unexpectedly laid off from my job three days ago, and I only have the job for the next 6 weeks. I told her I have to focus my priorities on saving the house.

His family (father, mother, sister and SO) and mine (father and mother) have decided to all meet up at ours to celebrate from Saturday to Monday.   
By then, our home will have a bed and a smaller sofa bed. Since we'll only be sleeping four, we had to find somewhere for the remaining 4 people to sleep: his father and mother booked a place for 4, and my parents one for 2, all on the same day.

Before the bookings, my SO had called his sister and told her that, depending on how things worked out, she and her SO could come and stay with us both nights and we'd lend them our bed (he later said this was a big mistake).  
After learning that their parents had accommodation for four, he told his sister it would be better if she and her SO slept with them, since our living room has no shutters (we've had a lot of expenses and don't know when we'll buy curtains), the light comes in completely, and the sofa bed is smaller than our bed. She replied that she could bring us night masks.  


At around 6pm, he received a message from her asking if she and her SO could come on Thursday evening and leave late Tuesday afternoon, and if he could pick them up and take them back to the station.  
My SO and I work during the day, he's in the office and I'm WFH, but we only have one car. He can pick them up, but not bring them back. We didn't talk about it any further, as he immediately called his parents to ask if the 4 beds were comfortable (no sofa bed or cot), which they confirmed, before telling him that his sister had taken her tickets without waiting for his answer.  


My SO was annoyed, but didn't want to cause any conflict. He asked her to go and sleep with their parents for the two originally planned nights (Saturday and Sunday), and realized that she was still set on sleeping in our bed for the remaining three nights.   
He called their parents, and his father told him that maybe it wasn't the best way to go, but that he understood that she had done it because of the ticket prices. He also asked three times if my SO had misunderstood the message about the night masks and if he was sure it wasn't humor. Finally, he said that if the atmosphere was going to be tense, we might as well not do anything and that he was ready to get in his car and drive away if the weekend went badly.   
My SO ended up sending a message to his sister to tell her that this was no way to go about things.  
So much for the facts. This isn't the first time she's done this sort of things and I'm very angry at the way his family treats my SO. I'd be inclined to refuse her accommodation, even if it meant losing her ticket money, so that she'd finally understand that not everything is owed to her, but I'm aware that this would damage my SO's relationship with his family.

"AITA for NOT deleting tinder after agreeing to be exclusive BECAUSE she was still “friends” with her abusive ex husband? Met her 5 months after her divorce (5 year marriage) and I found it weird that she started dating right away and told me A LOT about all the shitty dates she had (this guy couldn't get it up, this guy sucked on my feet, etc)

Then she started talking badly about the guy before me and how he was so bad in bed that she cried and called her ex husband afterwards. She said bad lover guy and her were still ""friends"" and texted each other still. In fact, she told me that dude invited her to watch a movie and have sex... while she was on a first date with me wtf.

At first we only talked for a month before we actually went out. During that time she talked about her ex husband and how he was abusive. She even cried when she said he told her he didn't love her anymore. I felt super uncomfortable.

Date one finally happens. It was ok (she told me she used to be anorexic). Date two happens (she tells me she used to be homeless after the divorce and did camming). We had sex...and then she mentioned her abusive ex again right after…In fact, she said she told him she was dating me and showed him my tinder profile wtf.

Then, she immediately  asked to be exclusive  but I told her I needed more time (I was unsure leaning towards no). She got mad because I joked: “ if you want me to be exclusive, you better not cheat on me with any of them 3000 guys/likes you have on tinder while I’m away haha”. She actually had 3000 likes but it was a dumb joke that I regret. She called me a day later and yelled at me on the phone for 5 hours until 5 am.  

The next week I left for a work trip and  a week in she called me to ask if I wanted it be her bf.  She was tired of me not “putting in effort” so she asked this to show she was serious about me. I was like, ok l'll give it a shot”...but didn't delete tinder because this seemed so odd to me. I thought l'd come back and give this a real go for like a month but wouldn't delete tinder until then.
She ""broke up"" with me a week and a half later because she noticed I hadn't deleted it(your location updates when you open it and I just looked at my matches I didn’t message anyone). She called me an asshole.


I feel like 50/50 on this one. I should work on my boundaries I think. We talked in total for 2 months and only 2 physical dates. Thoughts?",0.65
"WIBTA: Run/Jog/Walk Group My employer has a fitness facility for employees for free. They have group fitness classes and a good sized gym with the usual equipment. 

I’m returning to running longer races after hiatus for a few years. I’m needing to build a base of just getting my body back to running for an extended period of time. When a group exercise class called run/jog/walk started I was excited. Yay, accountability from a group! 

I’ve always run solo or with someone who was a better runner than I, so I was nervous about how the group was going to be run. Does everyone run? Jog?Walk? Or do people do their own thing? 

I talked to the organizer about inclement weather and they insisted it will be outside no matter what. I asked if we could use the numerous treadmills, so everyone could go at their own pace. Nope. 

The first session, no one shows up but me, and I really forgot cold weather gear. I run on the treadmill. Other folks join me. Organizer is huffy about it but join me eventually. Good time had by all. 

The second session, more folks join. I didn’t have sunscreen or a hat (I’m on meds that cause extreme sun sensitivity) so I run inside again. Organizer is annoyed at me but I ignore them. 

After the session, Participant A shares they run 3 miles before the group meets up so they can get their exercise needs met. Participant B, shares they weren’t happy with the pace they were walking, and wanted to speed up. Participant C and D were in their 70s and joined but stated they didn’t want to hold folks back. Organizer insisted all is well. 

Organizer confided to me later on, they were annoyed that anyone would want to go ahead of the group and it was discouraging and not inclusive. 

WIBTA if I tell Organizer that they should switch the group to indoors so that everyone can go at their own pace? Folks who are walking for company can do that, folks who want to run can do that etc. 

Additional context: Organizer is a  person who’ve shared their fitness and physical appearance struggles with me a bit. They are competitive and dealing with a stress fracture from doing too many miles too soon. They are changing careers to the fitness industry and recently was given negative feedback about their performance at this fitness facility. Their programming hasn’t been too popular. (I think the times have been bad). If this program is successful, it would give them some confidence. 

I am twice their age, not their direct supervisor, they make more than me, not their personal friend. We are the same gender but I am a WOC.

"AITA for expressing that I'm upset for not being asked if I want to go on a short trip. I (20F) have a brother (29M) who recently got a new house in a city not to far from my own with his girlfriend. he asked my parents and I if we wanted to come over and see it some time after he's settled in. we of course, agreed, but my parents decided to go on a trip when they had some time off work. I live with my parents due to some mental health issues, and my mum (56F) just told me that they were going to be leaving for this trip in a few days and that I will be watching the dog. I said that I wasn't happy she didn't even ask if I wanted to come with and just told me to look after the dog with very little warning, but she said that she wanted time with my father as they hadn't had much time together recently. I said that since we haven't gone anywhere together in around 8 years that maybe we could go together as it would only be a two day trip but she's been very stand offish since this conversation and refuses to bring it up. 
she says that I've upset her for not considering how little time my father and her have together and this would be the last holiday they have off together for a while.

I was unloading it today and she comes into the main room/kitchen and then proceeds to comment about it. I told her we have a big house with lots of rooms in it so if the noise bothers her go away. She didn’t leave the room and instead continued to tell me how I didn’t need to be so loud doing it, like, I’m just unloading a dishwasher, plates will touch, silver ware will clink, drawers will be closed. Finally I just stopped unloading it and told her that I won’t be unloading the dishwasher anymore if she’s in the house. She thinks this is childish and I’m an asshole.

AITA for not apologising to my friend? One of my close friends and I (both teens) were discussing interests a few days back and I brought up a character I liked. He decided to insult that character so I insulted a character I was well aware he likes very much(pokemon) to which he responded by abruptly ending the call and blocking me. He hasn't spoken to me in days and I was recently informed by another friend that he isn't planning to speak to me until I apologize. I have decided not to apologise this time for it isn't the first time he has started an argument and left me the one apologising.

"AITA for wanting my wife to pay me back? I (42m) have three kids that are shared with my divorced wife (43f) and we have sent our oldest son to a music and art camp for a week for the past few years and our middle child daughter if finally old enough to go and now that they are both going a e thought that the prices would just double. I don’t want to sound cocky but I make at least double my ex-wife just because of job differences so I don’t have trouble paying for my son when he goes but now that 2/3 of our children are going I want to split it I told how much I thought it would cost many months in advance so she could save if she needed to. But when I signed the kids up for camp it came out as more than expected (I think that it’s because my oldest is now in Highschool but idk) and I told my wife that and this is like 3 months before they go to camp and you actually haft to pay so she can still save up. But I told her that if she can only pay a certain amount and not cover her part of it then she can pay me back later on when she has the money. But she said that it wasn’t fair because I make more money and that I should just cover the full payment. This led to an argument but she ended up paying for her part but only with the money she saved.

"AITAH for having my friend over to my house? My (50F) and my husband (50M) have 2 teenage boys (15 and 19).  Older son away at college.  Younger son (I'll call him Jake) is home.  Kid has lots of friends, has no social issues, is a freshman in high school.  We have a pretty good relationship, as well as you can with a 15 year old boy. 

I have a friend (Kate) who also has a 15 year old son (Alex).  Kate is a single mom by choice.  Alex does not have a dad.  We met through the boys' sports when they were in first grade.  Alex has always been emotionally volatile and as he's gotten older it has gotten worse and worse.  Kate really struggles with him.  The boys are no longer friends and I do not push it at all.  I actually don't really want them to be friends.  When Alex sees my son at school, he makes antisemitic comments.  My son just ignores it.  This kid has not a single friend.  Now my friendship with Kate is not super close.  We've known each other a long time and she struggles so much that from time to time I reach out to check in.

Last night we went to dinner and then came back to our house.  We hung out with my husband for a bit and it was probably time for her to go but I'm not going to kick her out.  My son was sooo pissed off at me after she finally left that she stayed so long because he wanted to come downstairs and get something to eat and didn't want to come down when she was here.  He yelled at me about what Alex says to him every day and essentially saying because of that his mother shouldn't be at our house.  I said to him that I am not and never have forced him to be friends with Alex and that I can have whoever I want at my house that I pay for and then I went upstairs to bed.  

To make this point before it is brought up.  My son does not give a crap what this kid says to him.  He just keeps walking.  I'm not happy about what Alex is saying but I know how terribly troubled he is.  Im not excusing it either.  If he keeps it up he's going to run into his own consequences.  My son has never taken it to the principal and he's not the only one that gets yelled at.  This kid makes racist and antisemitic comments, (my son's bff is black) makes fun of kids with hearing aids, etc.  But these kids laugh it off because they just don't give a crap.  My son has never expressed being upset about it and just brushes it off.

"AITA for showing some authority to my racist SIL who threatened me? Sorry for the long post. I am really at my limit.

For context, I (F22) moved to the UK to be with my husband (M26) in early May. After struggling to get a job and afford living, my older sister in law MB (F28) offered to take us in so we can get some jobs and make some money. She lives with a trouble maker, my younger sister in law OS (F18) who is already a criminal offender for stealing and assaulting multiple people.

3 months ago we moved in to their living room with no closing door and a semi-see through curtain so no privacy. OS wasn't happy that we moved in because I set some ground rules in the house. Like knock before coming in if we have the curtain up and don't use our things without permission, very basic things. 

I was kind to her and tried to build a relationship but then she started stealing things from us when she was told not to since we can barely afford to eat with our £2k in debt credit card, started violating our privacy by bashing into our room whenever she pleased even walking in on us when we were being intimate. One day she stole my shoes so I was late to work. In return, husband put her make-up in a bag and put them in her own room (that looks like a bomb went off). After days, realising her makeup is gone she bashes into our room once again, starts looking for her makeup and upon getting mad she calls me a Turkish trash, c word, b word, and says ""Go back to your f*ing country to your f*ING family"". My older SIL MB actually witnessed this as well and said that OS would have to find a new place to stay for a few days for she had said but she never even left the house so she got no punishment for what she had done.

For a few weeks after this incident I on and off kept receiving threats from her such as ""I'm gonna beat her face in/slit her throat etc. etc."" Now i feel unsafe in my environment. When I say this to my husband he says that I'm exaggerating and that I'm stressing for no reason. 

Now when I catch her stealing again I ask her to return our things in a strict but formal manner. She asks ""Are you gonna eat this?"" Reaching to take my food in the kitchen and I say ""Yes"" in a high voice to show my authority and she's not welcome to just take it. And I get called rude by both her and my husband. Husband later on adds ""You need to treat people like how you want to be treated and by raising your voice you deserved to be treated the same way."" 

I do not understand how I deserved racism, mistreatment and disrespect when I've tried to be kind and only raised my voice once, for one word.

"AITAH for being sad on my vacation because I haven't done what I wanted I (23F) work full time 45 hours a week and haven't had a vacation in ages. I work very hard at my job and felt like I needed a break mentally so I decided to take a vacation.  

My mother and older sibling both live with me and haven't contributed anything financially in a long time. I invited them to come with me on my vacation knowing that I would have to pay for most things but I was still okay with it.  

However my whole vacation they don't want to do anything at all that I want to do. They only want to stay at the hotel and go to the beach for 20 minutes then come back. Everytime I suggest something I want to do they say no and when I complain about it they say I'm being childish.  

My vacation is almost over and I haven't done anything that I wanted. All I wanted to do was spend a couple full days at the beach or at least 3 hours. I also wanted to take a dolphin tour and they didn't wanna do that either. I would just do it myself but they get really upset and start an argument over it.

"AITA for calling a lady a bitch after she blocked business doors I work at a dog training facility. This lady was sitting on our steps waiting for the bus with her dog. I let her know she could sit on the steps to the chase bank, since those steps are never used and are right next to our steps and the bus stop. I explained to her it was cause this is a training facility and reactive dogs come in and out of our doors. 

She said this is a public street and she could stay there, she then proceeded to stand up in front of the steps and block the doors even more. I got frustrated, went to go inside and called her a bitch on my way in. 

She heard and immediately started shouting and recording me. I reiterated why she needed to move, and that she could atleast be courteous. I was shaking cause nervous. She was threatening my job. I went back and forth with her for a little before I went back inside to call my boss and tell her what happened. 

The lady emailed and said that I called her a b1tch multiple times and wouldn’t let her stand on a public street. She failed to mention she was blocking the door. I don’t think I’m an entire asshole. I shouldn’t have called her a bitch but I wasn’t wrong for it either.

It’s just a lot I’m trying to get back on my feet and I’m on a fixed income, and they get ss and they work! I feel that they should allow me to save money and focus on providing for my baby and not focus on handing it all over. I get maybe one or the other should be enough but for both and to pay the entire electric bill is a lot! Almost 300$! That’s half of my ss check, which I get bc I am deaf. I get 780, so I don’t get much. 
How am I ever supposed to move out if they don’t allow me to save? We got into a screaming match my gmother is very difficult to deal with the baby isn’t even allowed to have a bottle in her living room, she’s always yelling about something; we were arguing over how much I would be paying if I had my own place, but I don’t and if I did I would be on a plan. I know they are old and I should have respect and I do refrain on calling them names or anything like that I just try to get my point across, meanwhile she talks to me like I’m not her granddaughter it’s like I’m a person that she thinks does anything I can to get on her nerves, I have to do everything a certain way and if it’s done wrong it was on purpose in her eyes, and they feel like everyone wants to take advantage of them. I definitely don’t, they allowed my brother to live here for free before,they said bc he couldn’t help that he was just so far gone in his mind-he thought people were following him and he was paranoid of them constantly so therefore they didn’t make him pay anything!?!

Stace is a plus size(more for later), and Jake wanted to go to a park that was 25 minutes away and we'd have to go up a bit of a street hill to get there. I naturally walk fast but I walk slightly ahead if not slowly walk just because my other friends hate it when I walk ahead. I don't see why I have to always walk at their pace, especially when I cross the street. I hate it when I don't walk fast enough to get across the street yet they get mad when I don't want to inconvenience other people.

At one point, I was in the middle of the street walking and they said to slow down, but it was a yellow light, so I walked ahead and waited for them to cross the street. Once they crossed the street(walked there), Stace started gasping for air and had to sit down(From what I know, Stace doesn't have asthma, nor has she ever told me). Jake, Sam and Luke all start telling me that ""I should go apologize to Stace"" or ""This is why you can't walk ahead, sit next to her."" I didn't feel that it was fair for me, but just because I didn't want to make anything worse, I apologized, tried offering Stace water(she declined) and after 5 minutes we started walking.

Before she left to work she asked me if I could do some work for her study to help her get everything she needs to present the results at the meeting. 
Frankly I was a bit upset since I just came home today from a 24hr shift and worked 64hrs this week (she works about the same amount of hours as me) and I just planned to have a really great evening watching YouTube/Netflix and playing video games.
She than said (joking) if I'd love her very much I'd do it and I got more upset since I felt, even while she was saying this joking, I didn't have much of a choice.

She than became really upset because my reaction wasn't quite the one she was expecting and she was surprised at how ""annoyed"" I looked while she was asking me.
She than proceeded to be upset and not talking to me and being silent, even when I told her of course I would do the work. 

So now I'm doing the work feeling like it's not fair times two since I'm doing her work (which I didn't plan to spend my time on this evening) and she still is upset at me for not doing it in the right mood.

"AITA for swearing in front of my friend's pet parrot? This is so ridiculous and I can't believe I'm coming onto Reddit to talk about this but enough of our mutual friends and his family have said I am the AH that I think I may be the AH for this

Yesterday I was housesitting for my friend, let's call him James. For some context James is heavily religious and he is very uncomfortable with swearing because he thinks it's sinful.

It was just going to be overnight for one night while he went to go visit his mom, and he let me know he had a pet bird that I'd have to feed, which I would find out the hard way is actually a parrot.

I genuinely didn't know it was a parrot until that moment. I heard it squawking some incoherent things but nothing I made out to be English.

So last night I was in the kitchen heating up my dinner when I stubbed my toe on the counter and I yelled ""shit!"" And the bird yelled back ""shit! shit shit shit!"" And I thought it was hilarious and I thought to myself, ""I'm so glad James isn't here."" 

And then I realized it's James's fucking bird and he'd be back tomorrow, but I don't know a single thing about birds so I thought the bird would stop by tomorrow. About an hour later I went to bed.

But this morning the bird was STILL saying ""shit! shit!"" among other things, and I was starting to worry a bit but I thought maybe it wouldn't be a huge deal since... it's literally a bird copying a word, I didn't think James would get too upset. Yes, he's heavily religious but he's a very lighthearted guy.

James got back around noon and the bird was fine. He was talking, but he wasn't saying ""shit"". Me and James chatted for about 10 minutes about just whatever, and he sent me the money on Venmo, and then the bird went ""shit! shit!"" and James turned red in the face. 

It was silent for a moment and then James looked at me angrily and said, ""Did you teach my bird how to say the s-word?"" And I was like ""Hey dude I'm sorry I didn't know, it was an accident."" 

And he essentially said that there's no way I didn't know that was a parrot because parrots are very identifiable and I shouldn't be swearing in his house anyway. 

He calmed down and politely told me to leave, which I did, and this afternoon he sent me a text message saying he was very upset with what I'd done because his bird would not stop saying shit and that he wanted me to send the money back. I still haven't responded.

I don't know what to do. Some mutual friends have texted me to let me know that I was a huge AH for doing this, and his mom is upset as well. So Reddit, AITA?",0.53
"AITA for canceling a family trip because of an argument with my SO? My SO (30m) and I (30f) have been together for 3 years and have a 1 year old. We separated for a few months ago but have recently tried to sort things out and try a relationship again. We decided to plan a little family getaway for the weekend and booked a two night stay on a nearby island for two weeks from now.

Basically my SO lives a few blocks away from me and our little one but we rarely see him. He likes to come over on weekends and sometimes right at bedtime for our little one once per week if we are lucky. The other night he came over to visit and as I was getting the little one ready for bed I was yawning and exhausted even though it was only 7:30, I am up with her every night and every morning and do everything alone. He asked me if he should just go home because I’m so tired and I said no I’d like him to stay. I knew he only wanted to stay because he knew the little one would sleep and that meant we would have “alone time” together, but it’s easier for me to just go with it than tell him I’m tired and to go home and start an argument. 

By 9:30 I’m barely awake and he decides it’s time for him to go home. We say goodnight and he goes home, I asked him let me know you get home safe. As soon as he left I fell right asleep.

I woke up to my phone being dead, I guess it died as I was sleeping and as soon as I plugged it in I got angry messages from him asking why I didn’t say goodnight. I told him I’m so sorry, I fell asleep and I guess my phone died! He didn’t believe me, I’m not sure what exactly he thinks happened but it basically started a huge argument with him insinuating that I am hiding something and that he doesn’t trust me because it was “weird” that I fell asleep so fast and didn’t say goodnight. 

I told him this is childish and if he wants to make up crazy stories in his head when I was so clearly exhausted from caring for our baby day and night then we shouldn’t be considering a vacation at this time. I canceled the reservation which was on my credit card and told him I need a lot of space. He thinks canceling the reservation was a HUGE overreaction and this was something we could have talked about. I disagree and am honestly kind of over it.

"AITA for telling my daughter she's being stupid? 
I (39M) have a 17 year old daughter. Her mother and I divorced when she was 13. My daughter and I had a pretty good relationship after the divorce, until now at least, but she's always been closer with her mother.

My daughter has never been very social, but she does have one close friend who's a few years older than her. I don't know her friend very well, as I've only met her a few times. However, from what I understand, she doesn't come from a great family and my daughter tends to look after her.

A few months ago my daughter told me that she was upset because her friend was moving to another state. I sympathized with her but told her that her friend needs to do what's best for herself. She asked me what I would think if she went with her, and I told her absolutely not, as I didn't want her living in a different state from her mother and I and having to support herself when she was still young.

I didn't think much of it until a few days ago when my daughter called me. She said she wanted to talk to me and asked if I had time and I said yes. She then told me she was going through with the move and told me the exact date she was leaving.

I told her it wasn't a good idea and she started telling me about her plan, how she's going to make money and go to school after she moves. She and her friend even looked at apartments together. I asked her why she would start setting things like that up without even telling me and she said she did, which was the one time she brought it up, but that I “wasn't gonna be helpful” so she didn’t again.

I called my ex-wife to asked if she knew about this, and it turns out my daughter has been talking to them and planning for this for months. She and her husband told me that they aren't thrilled about it either, but that we need to “let her learn for herself” and that once she turns 18, there isn't much they can do. Her husband even told me that he did the same thing when he was her age and ended up fine. I told him that just because he got lucky doesn't mean my daughter will.

I could tell they weren't going to see my side, so I called my daughter again and told her she was being impulsive and stupid to move to another state when she has parents who are willing to support her. I tried to get her to see that not everyone has that, and she told me I didn't understand and hung up.

My daughter isn't talking to me now, and several family members have told me that I'm overreacting and that my daughter has her reasons. I understand wanting to be close to her friend, however I don't think I'm wrong for not wanting my daughter to make a sudden, large financial decision. AITA?",0.8
"AITA for being upset with my room mates fir cooking my food? I’ve signed up for hello Fresh and have been really happy with the service. I get three meals a week with two servings per meal, and usually split the two servings between myself and my two roommates. I don’t mind sharing as I don’t want the food to go to waste, but I’m the only one that pays for the service however. 

Last night (Friday) I was sleeping over at a friends house, and was going to have dinner there. I told my roommates that. When I got home this morning, and was going into the kitchen I notice that the sink was still full of dishes and they had made one of the meal kits. I was already annoyed as they made food, I paid for, without asking, but what got me really upset is the had made the recipe I was most excited for, and the recipe I had picked specifically for Valentine’s Day (the delivery came on Thursday, so 6 days before Valentine’s Day) and my roommates knew that, as I had told them when I placed the order. My one roommate just chuckled and said “sorry I was worried about it going bad” and the other said “I didn’t think you’d mind.” I’ve asked them to go out and buy me replacement ingredients and they’ve said no because I’ve “never asked them to pay before.” They said because I make more than them, I should just suck it up and buy more groceries. I told them just because I make marginally more, it doesn’t mean I can afford to feed them all the time, especially when I told them specifically not to use something. They’re accusing me of wasting money and keeping them poor. 

I feel frustrated because this was something I was looking forward too, but their saying I’m over reacting because “it’s just food.” AITA for asking for them to pay, even if they can’t really afford it? ",0.07
"AITA for expecting I’d be alone on V-Day? I’m curious if I’m the asshole here. Over the past few weeks I’ve made comments to my bf about how I’d like to do something romantic for Valentine’s Day. The first time I mentioned it he kind of scoffed and replied with “how romantic are we talking about?” It felt offputting but I let it slide. The next week I again mentioned how I’d like for us to do something together on Valentine’s Day, and it can just be as simple as making dinner together and watching a movie. Last week I again mentioned how VDay was coming up & I’d like for us to do something together. He said ok but that was it. I even sent a few TikTok’s about “simple guide to Valentine’s Day - ask your girlfriend to be your valentines, get her roses, and write a sweet card. It’s that easy!”

Now it’s the 10th and there has been nothing communicated with me about VDay. Not “I have plans for us that night!” or “hey let’s talk about what we’d like to do together on Valentine’s Day.” As far as I know, we have no plans.

This sent me into an anxious spiral. My partner has a history of not following through with promises and not making me feel important/wanted (big things like engagement, moving in together). So as a defense mechanism, I now shut down. It hurts when I get my hopes up for something special & it ends up being ignored. I’ve experienced this many times and it’s so scary to think it’s happening again. So I’ve been thinking about leaving town for the week and getting an Airbnb in the country somewhere alone. Since we have no plans anyways.

Today I told my bf that I was feeling the need to do that and that it felt safer to be alone since I’ve seen no effort on his part to communicate making/wanting/having plans. I feel like I’m the only one who wants that.

He’s super hurt now that I felt the need to leave to avoid the disappointment of not having a valentine. He’s saying that the fact that I felt like doing that is super fucked up (I initially said that I felt so scared that I was considering just leaving without telling him, but decided it’s better to be honest about it). Obviously this isn’t the first thing that’s happened - there is a years long history of promises being made to me in regards to our relationship that end up being broken or ignored. There’s a reason I’m expecting this desire for connection on Vday to be ignored. Based on what’s been communicated to me thus far, it sounds to me like it *has* been ignored. But bf says that he did in fact have plans for us, and made me feel like I’m a giant asshole for reacting strongly to the lack of initiation. So, am I? 

Tl;dr: I made it clear I would like to make Valentine’s Day plans with my bf, now it’s the 10th and I assume we have no plans since I’ve received no communication about the day. Am I wrong for thinking this lack of initiation or communication is unhealthy? Am I wrong for thinking no communication about vday (and no response to my attempt to make plans) = no plans for vday?",0.13
"AITA for not wanting to attend my grandmother’s birthday dinner? I know the title sounds awful and I’m willing to accept that I may be wrong here.

I [24M] am the only person in my family who has moved out of state. In a few weeks, my grandmother is turning 80 and my family is having a dinner with some other family and friends for her. I believe the guest list is around 30.

Also for context I saw my grandmother for Christmas and I visit at least 3 times a year and I am also looking to move back into the state within the next year or so.

About a week ago, my parents asked me if I would be interested in flying out to come to the dinner. They offered to pay for my flight since it was last minute and was not going to be cheap (which is extremely generous and I am very grateful for the offer). I told them I would consider and let them know.

Now I really don’t want to go mostly because the travel turnaround would be exhausting. I work Monday - Saturday. So Saturday after work I would have to hop on a flight, go to the dinner Sunday, and then hop back on another flight to get home late Sunday and then go to work again Monday.

Additionally, I have been feeling extremely overwhelmed with work and I also have other responsibilities outside of work such as school and other projects I help on. I know it sounds terrible but spending most of my weekend on a plane just sounds exhausting.

When I told my parents that I didn’t think I was going to come they got pretty upset and called me selfish and said I didn’t care about my family.

"AITA for being angry? I (20F) have been dating my boyfriend (21M) who we will call Aaron for five years nearly 6. Aaron has a horrible friend group who are just straight up awful people. They influence him to do awful things which is nerve wracking and when I tell him they aren't good people to be around, he gets defensive. Anyways, I'm used to this now. 

So we were supposed to spend Valentines Day on the Monday rather than Wednesday but it wasn't 100% confirmed. I asked him if we were confirmed for Monday and he said he suddenly remembered he had to go to his best friend's sisters wedding. I wasn't mad because Monday wasn't confirmed.

I (24F) specifically live in a non pet friendly apartment complex.  I have severe allergies to most animals with fur.  Needless to say, I am not a dog or cat person.  I live on the 5th floor of my building, our elevators are painfully slow.

I ask her why she is here.  She says she lives here and this is her service dog.   I sarcastically say sure it is. 

  
While speaking with her, I press all the buttons so I could get off the elevator.  The lady gets pissed at me for doing that.  I call her a bitch for living in a pet free apartment complex. She calls me a btich back for questioning her service dog, which i didn't really do IMO.   I get off at the next floor and take the stairs.

I told her no and she didn't insisted on the idea but she has been more distant since. My birthday is comming soon and I told my parents I didn't want a party, I just wanted to go see Erin. My idea was for just go without telling her anything. Imagine the surprise, so romantic.

My parents wouldn't let me unless we told Erin and her family beforehand. I allowed for my mom to talk to Erin's mom about it with the condition that neither of them tell Erin herself. After the phone call, my mom was acting weird about it and just told me Erin's mom didn't think I visiting was a good idea specially without ""being sure Erin wanted to see me"". I found that idea really insulting, why would she not want to see me? That made no sense.

I offered to sacrifice the surprise and mind Erin but my mom had changed her idea and told me it would be better to forget the whole thing.

"AITA for buying a game despite my girlfriend asking me not to? So I (29M) recently moved in with my girlfriend, and we've recently had an issue crop up that's caused a lot of issues between us.

I have a favorite game series that I've been playing for years. I've loved it since I was a kid and always buy the newest entry whenever it comes out, it's something very important to me and near and dear to my heart. However, my girlfriend has a strong dislike towards the series due to a fairly specific issue. I don't want to go into details for privacy's sake, but one of the people heavily involved in the series has some political views my girlfriend finds extremely objectionable. It's something she feels extremely strongly about, and while I totally understand her reasoning and think her feelings on this topic are valid, it's currently causing an issue in our relationship.

Around the holidays, we were talking about potential gifts we might buy one another, and I brought up that game and said I was really excited for it. My girlfriend flat-out told me she wouldn't be buying it for me because of her feelings on the one creator. I told her that I understood that, and wouldn't ask her to do that. However, my birthday was this past wednesday, and a few weeks ago while we were out with friends I mentioned to a friend that I would probably buy that game as a present to myself. Once we got home, my girlfriend told me she didn't want me buying that game. She said she wasn't comfortable having it in our home and that while she won't ask me to get rid of any of the things I already own, she really doesn't want me to buy this new game because she didn't like feeling I was supporting that. I told her I understand why she feels the way she does, but that I felt it was completely ridiculous to force me to give up a franchise I love so much just because of the views of one of the many people involved with the series.

On my birthday this past week, I ended up buying the game. Once my girlfriend got back from work, she saw I had bought it and blew up. She said she told me not to buy it and that this was really important to her. I told her I understand her feelings, but that this was a series I have loved for years. She said I crossed a boundary with her, that if we're living together the things in our house have to be things we're both comfortable with, and that she couldn't believe I couldn't do this one thing for her. She said it was just a ""stupid game"" and that I was being incredibly selfish for buying it anyway.

I feel bad she's so upset and I do understand why she feels the way she does, but I feel like she's being extremely unreasonable by asking I completely abstain from the series over one creator involved with it having objectionable viewpoints. The game in question does not have any direct involvement from the individual she has the disagreements with, though things they contributed to the series are still very present in it. She's still pretty upset with me and I really don't know what to think. AITA?",0.17
"AITA for yelling and cursing at my mentally ill parents for ""trying to protect me"" ( To give a little background I (29F) have been with my wife, Lesli (32F), for 6 and a half years now. She has a daughter from a previous relationship, named Gwen, who I have adopted. )

I have been no contact with my parents for years, but recently they got diagnosed with dementia, and my siblings agreed that someone should stop by at least two times a day. 

A few days ago I got guilt tripped by my brother, to ""pull my weight"" and check in on them that afternoon. While visiting they got all serious and said there was something important they wanted to discuss with me before I left. They sat me down and asked me to just hear them out and consider what they had to say. Not knowing what was coming I agreed.

They stated that they believed, that my wife, Lesli, was going to cheat on me, now that I am legally obligated to be take care of Gwen. They went on to explain that she has been isolating me from my real family to prevent me from hearing the truth. They urged me to just call a lawyer they know and they pulled out a business card and kept trying to force me to take.

I kept asking them to just stop, but they kept speaking over me, telling me they just want to help, so I kept getting louder and louder till I was shouting. By the point that I was yelling I wasn't thinking entirely reasonably, if I was I would have just left. Instead I yelled that I don't visit because they are terrible people who made my childhood miserable. Then I told them they are not family, and I don't care if they rot.

As you can imagine this did not go over well with my siblings. They believe they are all making sacrifices to care for them, so I should just deal with it like they do. They went on to explain that  it wasn't so bad since at least their intentions were to try to help.

"WIBTA if I refuse to split things more since my bf stays over? Hey all~ 

Recently got into a new relationship 2 months ago. My roommate texted me about splitting things more even since my bf comes over. I told her we can chat about it. 

Thing is, I would totally understand that request if he stayed 5-6 nights a week. He stays 2-3 nights and often comes over to sleep after he’s worked out, had dinner and showered. He doesn’t store things in our fridge or do laundry here. Only cooks when he’s helping me (I’d be cooking anyways). 

Would I be the asshole if I tell my roommate no on splitting rent and utilities? 

Appreciate any tips on how to approach this. Thanks!

EDIT: to address comments about food we do not share food. I buy my own food and they buy theirs. There isn’t an issue of us eating their stuff. In fact we do most of the cleaning in the house. 

EDIT 2: to maybe give some context on why my roommate is asking. I live with my sis and her fiancée. My sister is struggling financially. She is getting help from my mom. She asked my dad but he said no and she was pretty upset about it. So I think that might be where this pressure is coming from? They did this to me before we moved in as well and I agreed to pay more bc I’m the older sister and I do make more so I said yes to alleviate some of that stress. I’m a little annoyed this is coming back again.

it’s been months of this pressure and constantly trying to get me to make this webcomic and stickers for money and i can’t stand it at all, i haven’t created anything in weeks because of the almost daily pressure to make fucking chibis or a webcomic makes my brain hurt. I HAVENT EVEN PRODUCED A COMIC OR POSTED ANYTHING YET BECAUSE I. DONT. WANT. TO. MAKE. FUCKING. CHIBIS.
he told everyone we know about his idea and now other people are expecting this content that i don’t want to make and the more pressure he puts on it the less i want to do it. 

anywhomst, we were on the phone (he’s at work and i’m 1 week post op) and i scrolled passed a meme that said “your art doesn’t have to make money to be important” and i read it out, and he started going off about the chibis and the webcomic again and i got frustrated and stated that i don’t want to spend all my time making chibis and that this is a lot of stress for me and the more he pressures me the less i’m willing to do it (i was considering it before) and i started to cry, to which he told me i was making excuses and it’s just because i’m a perfectionist i don’t want to and then i raised my voice and said something along the lines of “i don’t want to pump out art i don’t fucking enjoy making and am not fucking proud of to appease you” and then we both went silent while i cried until he hung up.

now i feel like a dick because i understand he just wants me to create something and be admired for it and tell stories and make some extra cash and he’s excited, but it’s just frustrating and i want to create stuff that i’m proud of and that i like, i’ve never been a webcomic or an animation person and i don’t necessarily want to be. i just want to make art im happy about. is that so wrong?

"AITAH for putting out grapes at a kids birthday party? This is my first time posting on here so sorry in advance if I violated any rules. So it's all out there, this is an ongoing discussion between my partner and I. I think they are the AH and they disagree. So we are coming to reddit and letting the anonymous masses settle this. 

So we recently celebrated our kid's birthday party. Other than kids and their parents, we knew that one of our close family friends would be bringing their dog. They bring their dog everywhere. We don't mind their dog, however it does have some issues with food and training. It will constantly stand up on its hind legs and grab food off the table or counters. It will also take food right out of kids' hands.
My partner setup the party. Part of the spread included a charcuterie board. On that board were grapes. I've mentioned it to them in the past that all grapes are toxic/deadly to dogs. So during the party I made the comment for them to be careful that the dog doesn't get into the grapes. They looked at me and said: ""I already have too many things to be responsible for. It's (the dog owner's) responsibility to make sure they don't eat grapes.""

So here is where our disagreement arises. I am of the opinion that, knowing the dog is coming we probably just shouldn't put out grapes. We have kids. Kids are careless, the dog needs better training and something bad could happen. I would rather not end up with a dead dog at our kid's party. If you willingly put out grapes, and know the dog will be there (we did), then you should be responsible for making sure the dog doesn't eat them. My partner obviously thinks otherwise.

Later in the evening when we were discussing it, I told them that that way of thinking is kind of asshole behavior. I asked what if there was a child with a peanut allergy coming? Would you still put out nuts and just tell the kid's parents to keep their kid out of the nuts? They said that in that scenario we would not put out nuts at all because it's a child. Their thought is that this is just a dog, and a human life is more important than a dog's life.

I offered to at least pay some of the outing but she still won't let me and now we won't go anywhere because, according to my mom, ""you are being ungrateful and it is too stressful for you to be spending any food, especially expensive food, and for me to be spending a lot of money. We are poor, you are being ungrateful!""",0.11
"AITA for telling people I don’t want their opinions? I (23M) lost my childhood cat last week. I’d had her since I was little as a kitten, and she was the only pet I’d known. I struggle with mental illness and isolation, and whenever I was feeling sad or lonely she was always there. All it would take was for her to do something stupid or say hello to me and suddenly my day wouldn’t feel quite as dark anymore.

Since her passing, I haven’t been able to leave my room to go into the living room or the kitchen because the idea of not seeing her there waiting for me is too much. I’ve had very little appetite and when I do eat, it’s only when I go out.

My close friend (31F) texted me checking in a few days after since I hadn’t really told her much. I sent her a voice note telling her how I was, and it accidentally ended up being 30 minutes.

In it, I expressed my frustrations with several people for telling me “you’ll get another cat” when mine had JUST passed and I really don’t want to do that. I said I felt my grief was being invalidated and like people were trying to rush me through the process.

A while later my friend texted back saying she’d only listened to half the message, and said she didn’t think people were rushing me and that another animal might make me happy. This upset me quite a bit.

I firmly but politely told her she doesn’t know what she’s talking about, the people in question ARE trying to rush me because I know them, and an opinion that I’d already said deeply upset me wasn’t what I needed right now; I was just telling a friend how I felt (since she’d asked) and hoping she’d offer some comfort or simply listen.

She didn’t take this very well. She replied in an offended tone that she does know what she’s talking about and that she was only trying to help and I can’t get mad at her for it. I then said again that I’d already said several times that I didn’t appreciate people saying this to me repeatedly when the wound is fresh, and I was just looking for some compassion from my friend while I’m grieving instead of being given unsolicited opinions and being ridiculed for not appreciating them.

My mother has been a similar way but even worse. Although I know she’s also upset because it was technically her cat too, the entire time she’s been invalidating my feelings and telling me they’re over-the-top. Today she told me if I can’t even go downstairs or glance at certain rooms, I should move house because I’m being ridiculous. I also sent her a similar text firmly telling her that I’m glad she’s not in such emotional agony, but I am and she needs to respect that and let me process at my own pace because telling me not the feel a certain way isn’t going to magically make it so, but rather make me feel even worse.

Neither of them have responded to me still. I’m extremely lonely without my kitty around anymore, and at a time when I need support the most people are leaving me without a lifeline. I have to wonder if I deserve it. AITA?",0.14
"AITA For calling my FILs drone a toy? Over the past few years, my FIL has made quite a few demeaning comments and I guess I felt like I finally had to get back at him 


This year we showed him an itinerary for our trip where we’d be sleeping in AirBnBs and he firmly asked why we weren’t sleeping in a Hilton, stating that AirBnBs are for children (even though he uses them - he’s also not a rich guy and just likes to spend money / is in lot of debt) I stayed quiet, not wanting to start a fight. 



He also made a comment about how “only kids” wear Vans shoes as my wife and I were both putting our Vans on. 


We’re currently renting a room from him for a year until we get our house and he came in our bedroom to talk then went up to my desk, picked up my fidget cube (I have ADHD and it actually helps me) looked at it confused, turned to me looking all concerned and asked me if it was a toy. 



He often shuns any sign of showing an inner child as well. Despite this guy having a shelf of Superman figurines and his dream being to drive a formula one race car. 


He recently bought a drone (one of the random things he buys and plays with for 2 days until it ends up in the garage) and we were watching him use it for a couple minutes until he went to pass me the remote to try and I stuck my hand up and just said “Nah I’m good…” kinda laughing it off then just went “I try not to play with toys with the little free time I have.” And there was an awkward silence where he didn’t say anything and wouldn’t talk to me for the rest of the day. My wife understood why I made the comment since he constantly belittles me, but also things I may have just ended the good relationship we previously had. 



I told her that’s ridiculous if this is the thing that would end it considering he’s bugged her car with an airtag, has gone through our stuff when not around and has done / said a ton of messed up things that we never hold onto. 



Now I’m wondering if I should just continue with how things are going or if I should apologize to him",0.5
"AITA for not getting my sister an autograph from my professor? Apologies if my(20m) English is bad; it is my second language. I'm currently a third year LL.B student. My sister(12), who is very smart, often reads my law textbooks when I'm not using them. She really likes one titled Public Limited Company. When I told her that it was written by my professor in Law on Business Organizations, she quickly asked if I could get her autograph for her.

I said no, because I'm kind of intimidated by this particular professor. She is a great professor, but sort of stoic, I guess. You know, the no-nonsense type. Makes me hesitant to approach her and ask for an autograph. Also not sure whether it'd be weird/inappropriate or not.

"AITA for Calling a Baby Ugly and Gross as a Part of my Culture? I am from India. My son (31M) lives in the USA and is married to an American woman (30F) and they just had a baby girl 4.5 months ago. 

My DIL and I get along just fine. They recently flew to visit me and my husband (his father) and we were all gushing over the baby - she’s adorable really.

I, with my daughter were getting some stuff for the veneration (puja) and in our culture you never call a baby pretty because of nazar (evil eye) 

I did a spitting sound (thu thu thu) and said the baby is ugly, and then put a black mark over the baby’s head. DIL freaked out over it and asked me why I thought it was acceptable to call her baby ugly and gross? 

I was confused. I looked at my son expecting him to say something. I explained to DIL about nazar and how it’s a part of culture but she wouldn’t stop crying, I attributed that to post partum hormones.

I took my son aside and we had an argument. I told him he should’ve told her about what we do before she thinks I’m being an asshole. He thinks I should’ve made sure.

Because apparently my son told me that a friend of hers implied that their baby isn’t as cute and trying to defend her baby’s cuteness is her way of convincing herself and others that her baby is adorable. I reprimanded my son for thinking so little of her daughter and his wife.

"AITA for “ruining” my sisters Sweethearts Dance photos? Let me set the stage. My sister and her boyfriend are going to the high schools Valentine’s Day dance called “Sweethearts.”  Since it’s a dance, my parents wanted to take pictures of my sister and her boyfriend and their group before hand. So we’re at home and my parents are messing with the camera. 

Now I used to do year book when I was in high school 3 years ago as a photographer for the school, so I asked if I could set the camera up so they could get better pictures. My sister (who’s been using the camera for an unofficial journalism club the school has) said I could, and I was messing with the settings to take some practice photos of my sister and her boyfriend. 

My dad asked me if I could help my mom take the pictures at the location they were going to and I said yes. But he didn’t tell my sister this. She and I don’t have a great relationship, mostly because when she got into middle school and especially high school, a lot of teachers and coaches associated her with me, basically knowing who she was because I had told them about it. We live in a small town, and not that many people have my families last name so it’s hard to put two and two together especially since I was told I was a good student, and I did three different sports while in high school. 

To add to this, she doesn’t like me being around her friends because of more or less the same thing. A lot of her friends know me through their siblings and she doesn’t really like that. 

So after I get the photo settings good for INDOOR shooting, I start packing up the camera to go to the location, but my sister gets really upset by this and doesn’t want me to come. She, my mom and her boyfriend get into my mom’s car and go off and I just go play call of duty now cause I didn’t think I was needed anymore. I assumed my sister or my mom would just set the camera back to automatic or something and take the photos that way. 

But they didn’t do that. I didn’t have my phone on me and I didn’t hear it ring. My mom called me four times to try to get help with the camera, and like 7 text messages, but I didn’t see them. 

When my mom got home from my sisters photo shoot and yelled at me for messing with my sisters cameras settings before the shoot, saying it’s my fault the pictures aren’t going to turn out good and she had to use here phone. Apparently they spent 20 minutes trying to reset the camera settings so she could take pictures. I said it’s not my fault and she replied with “if I hadn’t messed with the settings when I knew my sister wouldn’t let me come this wouldn’t have happened.” I guess I should’ve known my sister wouldn’t let me come.

"AITA calling my bestie homophobic? I (teen F) was saving my friend's pronouns onto their contacts by putting them into the “company” spot. My friend, who is basically the one who keeps the whole group together, told me they start using a new pronoun (they/them). I excitedly told my other friend of 2-3 years, we’ll call her Savanna, and she replies with “what? Why would she wanna go by multiple people?” Now I care a lot about respecting people and I was a little upset so I tried and explained her pronouns and the concept of using they/them and Savanna says, “Bro what has this world come to that people are changing themselves to be multiple people” I asked if she was homophobic (which, I’ll admit is kinda untrue,) but I think it’s not fair they she wouldn’t just respect what my friends would like to be called.. this might be a small little nitpick but… AITA??",0.46
"AITA for being on my phone around my kid? My (34F) husband (43M) has been getting onto me about being on my phone around our daughter (2F). 

I am in a full time residency program. I work or study at least 60 hours per week. In the mornings that I’m not in the hospital at 5:30, I do all the morning routine: diaper, breakfast, teeth, clothes, clean the kitchen, etc. When I get home from school or the hospital, I instantly have mom responsibilities and do the bedtime routine every single night. I also cook dinner most nights. I do household chores in the evenings after bedtime before studying. 

Sometimes I get mentally overstimulated. I’ll at times pull out my phone for a few minutes to browse Reddit or IG to distract myself. It’ll be max of 5 minutes once or twice a day if I’ve finished eating first or my daughter is busy playing with my husband. My husband gets very upset and tells me to put my phone away in front of our daughter. He reminds me that he never gets on his phone in front of her. I understand where he’s coming from, but it’s not like I’m neglecting her for my phone. I just feel sometimes I need sometimes distance myself from all my responsibilities to lower my stress before going back to chores or school work.

"AITA for being angry after my friend living me alone in a huge party? I (19F) have a best friend (20F) and we decided to go together to a carnaval party (it's a huge celebration and a lot of people went that day). She has a group of friends I don't know and I met them in the party, we all were together dancing. Out of nowhere she decided to text the boy she likes, and leave the party without telling me, she asked for one of her male friends to tell me but he didn't. I was with her friend (I had met the girl one hour ago) and I started to feel really anxious because I have a several anxiety, and send her a message asking if it was true she left and leave me there alone, in a place full of people I didn't know, she said ""it was ok because I was with her friend"". I started crying because I couldn't believe that everything was happening, I was so sad and disappointed I just wanted to cry so bad. 

- It wasn't the first time she did something like that because of this exactly boy. 
- I had gotten all the tickets for free and free drinks too, in addition to having paid for a ticket for her friend. 
- In the other day she texted me saying I was being dramatic and I always do that, and I try to be de victim every time. 
- I tried to explain that leaving me in a party alone where I didn't know a single person was wrong and dangerous, and she was furious because I don't want to see her happy.
- My parents are really mad and sad because they always did everything they could for her and she left me there, They were afraid that something would happen, so they felt more at ease that I had gone with her, because they trusted her.
- in the morning after she blamed me because she got drunk and threw up, it was my fault cause I always do a storm in a teacup. 
- I am asking this because she got really angry and I am crying all day, and I started asking myself if I was really wrong for thinking that what she did was wrong, I have anxiety and I am bad right now.
 
So, AITA?

I think this might be important: I actually have abandonment trauma (because my parents had to work so much when I was little, but now they take me to the therapy) and bipolar disorder so everything turn out to be something really bad so fast.

"AITA for telling my older sister we cant hang out because my mom is mad at her? For context, I have 6 siblings, 2 older sisters, 1 older brother, 1 younger brother and 2 younger sisters. My older siblings and younger brother are my dads kids while my younger sisters are my both my mom and dads kids. Back in the early 2010’s, my father went to jail for selling substance, while my dad was in jail my mom cheated on him with some guy. They broke up when he got back but remained friends due to the fact that my dad had cheated on her back in the day while she was pregnant with my little sister. He got a new girlfriend who did t like my mom a few years later and their relationship turned sour, separating me and my younger sisters from our older siblings.   
I 17F used to be close with my Sister 23F a long time ago as we visited regularly. But, as one does, once she graduated she left for the military for a few years and once coming back, she wanted to travel. She goes around the world and posts it on her instagra. She’s been to Jamaica, Dubai, Dominican Republic, Aruba and even the Bahamas.   
When she is at home, she’ll try and take us places. Well this time was no different, she called me to ask if me and our younger sisters wanted to go on a picnic. We excitedly said yes and spent the next hour getting our hair done and getting dressed. Once the time she was supposed to come rolled around, i texted her asking if she was nearby. She didn’t answe but then texted that she wouldnt be able to come for some reason. Not gonna lie, i was disappointed. My mom was sitting on the couch and just said “I told ya’ll she wouldnt come. Next time she asks ya’ll to come over, tell her no so she can be disappointed like she made ya’ll.”   
i am not a spiteful person at all, i can’t be mean even if i tried, it usually turns into some cringy kid roast like “you’re dumb” or something lol. a few hours later, my big sister texted me saying her car had broke down and she had switched cars with her girlfriend and if we still wanted to go on the picnic.Here is where i may be th AH. I texted her “No, mom said we cant go because she is mad at you.” My mom was indeed mad at her and i didnt lie or anythin\*, im a bad liar and i didnt want to just say “No.” flat out because that may hurt her feelings.

"AITA for snapping at my dad for plaguing me about colleges? I (17F) have been applying to college this year. My dad (57M) has tried his best to be helpful in the process since junior year, and I appreciate it, but it becomes overbearing. I want to go to performing arts college, which can become an extremely stressful process with auditioning and all that fun stuff. My dad constantly listens to college podcasts and loves to ramble on and on about how my scores need to improve and I need to spend more time on this and that. 

At my extremely competitive performing arts school, tensions have been high. People have been getting accepted and rejected over here and there and jealousy is rampant. I am plagued with thoughts regarding whether or not I’ll get into my top choice, NYU, and I try not to talk about it too much. I have a few months to wait and I’m extremely impatient. Every day people are complaining about their constant failures, flaunting their constant successes, or complaining about the others complaining and flaunting. It drives me mad.

Today, my dad decided to play a college podcast during dinner about how to get into performing arts colleges and make the right application choices. The video validated some of my concerns, but it stressed me out nonetheless. My dad didn’t let anyone make any comments — we had to sit and listen. I mentioned afterwards that listening to the podcast stressed me out, regardless of the fact that it validated my concerns. My dad got upset, saying that he hasn’t mentioned college since I applied, and that 10 minutes of listening to this podcast within three months of silence on the topic should have been fine. I fought back with the fact that I have constant reminders that I might not get into my top school, and I didn’t want to listen to it on the weekend at the dinner table. My dad got upset again, saying that I should be grateful, seeing as the people validated my concerns and I should feel good about it. I got to my boiling point. My dad kept saying I should feel good, and reiterating the point that it was only 10 minutes of discussion in three months. I got angry and yelled at him saying that this plagued my every thought and I didn’t need to think about it more. My mother got angry at us for arguing but mainly sided with him, saying she didn’t know why I was upset. I left the dinner table and started to cry and my dad has been silent since.

"WIBTA if I said my boyfriend's ex is not allowed in our home when we aren't there? I (34f) have been with my boyfriend (37m) for 5 years, living together for 3.5 years, with my step daughter (7f) who we'll call Jess, 50% of the time, basically alternating days at our place & her mom's. Jess has the code to our house because it is her home too. Every once in a while, but lately more often, her mom has been forgetting to get Jesse's stuff (like skis or skates)when neither my boyfriend or I are home.

The time before last his ex said Jesse's skis were at our place. He told her to wait until I got home from work, about 20 mins (I did leave early) & I would go downstairs & grab them. Jess is too small to carry her skis & all the gear herself. When I arrived they were already in the house. Both my boyfriend and I were unhappy about this, but his ex had stayed upstairs at the door. We didn't have the skis, they were at his exes house.

Today Jess had a skating field trip with her mom, we didn't know about it. Jess & her mom came to our place & Jess said they looked everywhere together. Her mom did end up calling my boyfriend, but he had terrible cell service. The skates were in our bedroom. Jess told me today that her mom handed her the green bag with her skates. Which meant that his ex was inside our bedroom & would have had to walk in our room, around the bed to the closet. When Jess said that I was very surprised and said ""your mom was in our bedroom?"" Jess back tracked saying that her mom just stood at the door looking inside for the skates & that Jess had actually grabbed the bag.

I don't know if this is dramatic but I feel very violated over this. She went into our home without permission & not only that into our bedroom. WIBTA if I said his ex is no longer allowed in our house. His mom lives less than a block away and I was thinking of saying that if his ex needs to pick something up she would meet his mother at our house and wait outside. Jess is always allowed in, but his ex is not. I feel very strongly that it is my home and my safe space. 

After I moved in he did have to set a lot of boundaries with his ex, like not just walking into our house as if she still lived there and taking a seat in the living room. She wouldn't even knock.",0.2
"AITA for wanting to have a say in bridesmaid dress worn So my (24f) sister (26f) is getting married in fall. I am her maid of honor since I’m her only sister and she doesn’t have a “best” friend (3 other girls besides myself - one who she’s know for a long time, but the other two are sisters themselves who she’s been on/off friends with and also being a lot of drama to the table … so definitely not as close).

She has continually said through the process that if you don’t like something, she’d happily kick you out of the wedding/she doesn’t care what anyone thinks, it’s her day and she will do what she wants.

Now onto the dress situation… I am someone who likes cute/sweet but modest clothing (certainly nothing revealing) … so for dresses think cottage core, romantic … this is just an example - someone’s style I’ve always like is marzia (pewdiepie’s wife) if you’re looking for reference - check her on instagram. I’m also very self conscious and honestly not comfortable in a lot of things, which she knows (and her whole life she claims to be an “advocate” being respectful of people’s boundaries - and is not afraid to speak up when she is not happy about something). I’ve sent probably 10 ideas that have all been shut down for whatever reason (and I really tried made sure they were in her list guidelines… color, fabric, length,etc.).

She on the other hand continues to select dresses that look like a 75 year old woman should be wearing them (super high neck, lots of ruffles, elastic cinching, etc.) mainly because all her friends have short torso/large chests and she does not want them showing anything (I have a completely different body type than her friends, very long torso and more proportional measurements).

I did also recommend that since I am the maid of honor, it would be nice if I could wear something different (which is popular for bridesmaids to wear different things) but still wear the same color. 

She has said no to wearing different dresses, no to everything I’ve suggested, does not seem willing to budge at all, and does not seem to grasp the concept that a dress can be cute/modest but not matronly.

Would I be the AH if I said I’m dropping out if I’m not wearing something I’m comfortable in given the circumstances? I just think it’s sad, but don’t really know what else to do, and not really sure how much she’d even care.",0.69
"AITA for lashing out at my sister to stay in her roommates bed? Throwaway.

I (22m) and my sister (20f) have always had a great relationship. We got along well as kids, we still do now, and I know one day we will joke about this situation, but this is driving me insane and I wanna make sure I am not taking crazy pills. 

Here's the context. My sister and I are both in college, going to schools in different parts of the country. We have both visited each other once prior. When she visited me, I lived in a 4 bedroom apartment. I gave her my bed to sleep in while I crashed on the couch (despite her protests). When I visited her last year, she was still in a 2 person dorm room with not a ton of space, and despite my protests, she gave me her bed while she slept on the concrete floor. 

I flew to visit her at her school this weekend for 3 nights and the trip has been good for the most part, except for the sleeping arrangements. My sister now lives in a 4 bedroom apartment. She has 3 roommates, who I am going to name Jackie, Katie, and Lucy. My sister is closer with Jackie than the other two. They have a living room with a couch that is fine to sleep on, although is very small (I am a tall human). Sure it's no bed, and I won't sleep great on it, but for 3 days I can make it work.

Here is the dilemma. Lucy was gone for the entire weekend, but made it explicitly clear that no one should enter her room so her bed has always been off limits. Katie, however, was going to be gone nights 2 and 3. She had apparently made an offer to let my sister stay in her bed while she was gone, but that was a few weeks ago, and it was said kind of in passing according to my sister, so I don't know how concrete that offer was.

Regardless, Night one rolls around and yea I didn't sleep great but whatever, its a college couch not the Ritz. Night two rolls around and I asked if my sister if she could ask Katie if she could sleep in her bed so I could sleep in my sister's bed since a bed had opened up. My sister refused to ask because she didn't feel comfortable. She offered to share a bed with Jackie, and I could stay in her room, but I declined. That night, some of their friends came over and were in the living area till 3am, and since I was in the living area, I had no way of going to bed early, so I endured till they left and crashed on the couch.

Night three is where everything hit the fan. I asked if my sister could ask Katie if she could sleep in Katie's bed so I could stay in my sisters bed. My sister refused, saying that she doesn't sleep well when she isn't in her own bed, evidenced by my visit last year and refused to ask if I could stay in Katies bed because she isn't close enough to Katie. We had it out and I (being cranky) raised my voice saying she is being ridiculous, she got mad, and stormed into her room. Ironically, Jackie has a date tonight so she may not even be staying in her bed, so my sister and I have this 4 bedroom apartment to ourselves and I am still on the couch.

"AITA for saying what I said? I (25F) was grocery shopping in Coles (grocery store) today minding my own business. I was walking down the health foods aisle and closer to the end of the aisle I saw what seemed to be a middle aged man a few steps away from his trolly talking to his wife who was facing what seemed to be the muesli bars on the other side, back towards me, so the middle of the aisle was free to walk through. I took this opportunity to walk through the gab as they were conversing and blocking both sides. The man in clear vision of me saw me walking through. I had made it all the way, HOWEVER the corner of the heal of my shoe was caught by the women who had stepped backwards, clearly not looking where she was going. Briskfully unaware a person was behind her as she had not turn around. She seemed to have a little scare of not realising and then I hear her partner loudly say to me ""WATCH IT!"" I immediately completed my step and turned in his direction with an immediate disrespected look on my face. Taken back as I hoped he did not shoot that at me. I shot him the dirty and continued to look at the section beside the one his wife was previously looking at. Taken back I thought to myself did he really say that to me as HIS WIFE STEPPED ON MY HEAL should I not be the one to say ""watch it"" ???. Many thoughts were rushing through my head in this short moment. Thoughts like ""how the fuck am I suppose to know she was going to step backwards and not watch where she was going?"" ""I was literally the only one out of the both of us that was watching where they were going???"" I noticed he was still staring me down and I immediately said ""GOT A STARRING PROBLEM MATE?"". He proceed to say ""WATCH WHERE YOU'RE GOING SHE'S PREGNANT"". I defended myself immediately ""HANG ON A MINUTE YOUR WIFE STEPPED ON MY HEAL, YOU SHOULD TELL HER TO TURN AROUND BEFORE SHE STEPS BACKWARDS!"". I said this out of anger and frustration. I will not take accountability if I was not the one to walk into her, nor was I even aware she was pregnant. I could not believe the lack of social awareness some people can have in a public area?!?! He proceeded to mumble little things which I couldn't hear as he walked away. But that is when I saw the pregnant wife shooting me the dirty, I then told her to ""SORT YOUR MAN OUT"" as they walked away down the aisle where I knew they wouldn't be able to hear me I said out loud ""good luck to your child"".  
It didn't even register she was pregnant until I saw her front on looking at me. I understand it must be scary to think you may have had a fall in that condition. If I did notice she was pregnant prior I would have been more considerate or vocal about my presence behind her. I just don't think I should have been blamed for what had happened.",0.43

- one of my nieces broke my plates, sorry Isabel, Im beating you up 
- the woman who always chooses the spot next to me in Yoga smells soooooo bad, shavasana-suck-on-that
- there are a few more, but I think you get the gist...
- most recently, my best friend didnt invite me to a ""dinner party"" she hosted.... because Im a ""picky"" eater (im literally just Keto) (all of our mutuals were there, and it was a new apartment ""house warming""!! She didnt tell me about it until afterward!!)
Ergo, I made a Mii of my best friend (im talking down to the fine details- the color of her glasses, and outfit shes always in, etc.) there would be no mistaking her mii for someone else. 
When i make these miis, I dont delete them!! Im not a one and done fighter. Why would I delete them?? 
Anyway. The my friend came by and ended up staying the day in my apartment, and I had to head out and do some errands/work. She played on my switch while I was gone and found my hoard of Miis. And found the one that looked exactly like her. 
She got really upset. And I dont feel like I should apologize... she should just be happy i didnt hit her in real life. 

Am i the asshole??!!",0.6
"AITAH for not putting out my leaves fire When I moved to my current home one of many of my boxes to check was that it would be out of the city limits so that we can at times enjoy a small fire here and there without worry. When I moved in I set up a nice stone circle and making sure I was following all of the parish laws (Louisiana). It's also a fair distance away from my neighbors... As much as it can be on probably a 3/4  acre plot.  
  
We burned occasionally but most of the times it’s a few boxes which burns out pretty fast. About 15 minutes. Now about twice a year we clean up the leaves from about 3-4 oak trees all within a 1/4 acre around my house. After checking my trash policy, they won’t pick up bagged leaves. Well, that's ok because I should be able to burn them. Unfortunately, it takes a while and there is some white smoke Shrug at least I don’t do this often. I'm not the only one in the neighborhood that does this. It's standard.  
  
So about a year ago some family members came in town and we tried to clean our yard on the prior weekend. So we started, and I run to the store while my wife and mother watch the fire for a few minutes.  
When I come back they say the neighbor came over, Looking weird, telling them to put out the fire. However, with the family coming, we had to keep going and the neighbor was nowhere to explain this to.   
  
About 45 minutes later the neighbor starts acting out man child tantrum style. I don't respond to tantrums. So I ignore it and he continues yelling on and off for over an hour.  
He gets more heated trying to start a fight. So I call out that if he has a problem with me burning perhaps we can get the cops here to see what they think. He continued so I made the call. Hopefully just police presence will be enough to cut the tension.  
And it worked.  
  
He took all of this as a personal attack. I've even tried to make peace which he only responds with lude gestures, cursing. I reduced my burning, but he still has a chip on his shoulder.  
A few months later after having not burned since the first escalation I saw him walking his dog and politely tried to give him a heads up about burning in case he wanted to try to not be home or w/e. Similar response but then makes a veiled threat of violence. All on security footage. Probably a gold mine if I ever need it. Ironically he ends up not being around that weekend, so hm.  
Fast forward to today we make a good start to trying get our yard cleaned up for the spring. To which he calls the fire department. I’m not concerned by seeing them because I know I’m not doing anything wrong.  
It went even better than that because they invited the kids to tour the fire truck. Now the kids game was playing fireman in clear earshot of the neighborhood. I just know that probably made him writhe.  
I asked around at all my direct neighbors and this one guy is the only one that has a problem with it. And to this date he has not had a cordial discussion with me about it.

"AITA for not sharing my food with my father? When I (17F) order pizza (twice a month usually) I always leave 3-4 slices afterwards. For reference I usually get a medium size plain cheese pizza from Pizza Hut. I always eat the 3-4 slices a day later by microwaving it because that’s just what I like to do.

Also just to prevent this question potentially being asked too many times… larges are too big for me and half the pizza will be left. Smalls are way too small for me. So medium it is. I don’t have a large stomach but I always microwave the remaining slices for later simply because I like the taste of it and I also don’t want to waste it.

Well in the past few months, anytime I’ve ordered pizza hut and left the leftover slices somewhere safe, I come back the next morning to find it all gone. My parents both eat it all, every single time. It’s extremely irritating but I haven’t voiced it outloud. Sometimes when I finish eating and start to put the remaining slices away, they ask me if they can have it all. So I just say yes because it’s not a battle worth having, and if I tell them I don’t want to give it them… it’ll be a battle.

Now, for the past 2-3 times I’ve eaten Pizza Hut, my father keeps asking me in the MIDDLE of dinner if he can have a slice. I say yes. He takes it. I get annoyed.

But today was different. I was starving and it was around 2 pm when I started to eat. My father comes home. Asks me for a slice before I’ve even began eating. At this point I was just exhausted and didn’t want to share yet again. Especially because the majority of times I’ve “shared,” my parents don’t even ask me, they just take it even though they know I like to microwave it the next day.

So I said yes but sort of rolled my eyes. He asked me what was wrong. And so I told him, no, I don’t want him to take a slice in the middle of me eating.

He basically threw a tantrum and my mother chimed in and called me a weirdo. I got fed up of the drama and told them they’re not entitled to my food and if I don’t want to give it to him, I don’t need to. They refuse to talk to me now. I personally think this should be a total non issue, especially considering I almost always say yes.

"AITA for complaining about a Nickelodeon vacation with my family. My wife has been talking about us traveling from Oregon to New Jersey to go to the Nickelodeon theme park. She was pricing and planning the trip for late this summer when I start watching videos about the rides. 

I noticed that most of the rides are roller coasters or have big drops or upside down experiences. I personally hate these kinds of rides and two of my three daughters(ages 8, 9, and 13) also are scaredy cats like myself. 

The rides seem to be mostly for small kids or big adventurous kids but not a lot for my middle of the road kids and myself. My wife is now threatening to spend our vacation money on trips without me since I don’t like to do roller coasters. I like to go out in nature and go out on lakes or hikes and she hates those kinds of places so we never go. Am I just being too much of a stick in the mud?",0.55
"AITA for Not Wanting to Split My Inheritance Equally Among My Siblings? I (32F) recently lost my father after a prolonged illness. In his will, he left behind a significant inheritance. My father and I had a very close relationship, and he always emphasized the importance of hard work and responsibility.  
  
Now, here's the dilemma: My siblings (a brother, 35, and a sister, 29) didn't maintain a good relationship with our father throughout his illness. They rarely visited him or helped with his care. On the other hand, I dedicated most of my time and resources to ensuring he was comfortable and cared for until the very end.  
  
Given this context, I was shocked to discover that my father's will stipulated that the inheritance be split equally among us. I feel it's unfair that my siblings, who were largely absent during our father's most challenging times, should receive an equal share.  
  
I voiced my concerns to my siblings, explaining how much I sacrificed to care for our father and suggesting that perhaps the inheritance should reflect our level of involvement in his life. However, they vehemently disagreed, accusing me of being selfish and entitled.  
  
Now, I'm torn. On one hand, I feel like honoring our father's wishes is important, but on the other hand, I can't shake the feeling of injustice in splitting the inheritance equally when our efforts and sacrifices were anything but equal. So, Reddit, AITA for wanting to revise the distribution of the inheritance to reflect our different levels of involvement in our father's life?",0.87
"WIBTA if I took my brother’s Xbox controller? This happened a few hours ago when my (20) brother (17) woke me up from my sleep from being too loud on his phone at 4am, and banging about in his bedroom. 

I had only just managed to fall asleep when I was woken up by him, so I went in and told him to shut up because I have to get up for work at 8am. He responded by saying that i should “just go to sleep then” and proceeded to call me a “po*f” (a slur for gay people)

I heard him leave to go outside so I went into his room and took my phone charger and his controller. I bought this for his Christmas present and due to my work schedule was difficult for me to get for him but I managed. 

He came into my room around 20 minutes later when I was about to fall asleep, looking for my charger and I told him to get out my room and reminded him that I had work in the morning, in 4 hours. He wouldn’t leave so I woke up my parents to get him to because all I wanted was some sleep. That’s when he decided to call me basically every name under the sun. 

This isn’t the first time he’s been mouthy like that with slurs, he regularly used to scream horrible shit at his Xbox, and my parents would do nothing about it. If I said anything to him about it, I would be scolded because ‘im not the parent’

Calling me a homophobic slur, as a gay woman was the icing on the cake really, and I’ve had enough of him thinking he can say whatever he wants with no consequences. So yeah my plan was to take the controller to work with me and either keep t for myself or sell it to be honest. 

Sorry if this seems silly. I’m running on 2 hours of sleep currently and hyping myself up for a 12 hour shift. Thanks for reading. ",0.16
"AITA for thinking my friend is a slut? My friend (20F) has never really had a history with relationships. However she’s not the one to shy away from posting thirst traps on social media and playing with the attention from boys in her DMS, she’s got a great body and she gets a thrill out of it. I feel like she’s always chasing the attention. 

She’s always meeting random guys and talking to them for a while, then when she finds out they’re an asshole she moves on to the next. However the next is almost always the next person in the guys friend group. This has happened with 3 friend groups I know of so far. The first was 4 boys out of a group, the next was the whole group of 3, and the latest is also a whole group of 3 friends. Personally I find this quite gross, she’s literally passing herself around the friend group. 

Early last year in one of those friend groups she lost her virginity to one of the boys, now I must say this was the only time she had sex until she got into a relationship. A feel this one time brought up her confidence even more than it already was. 

Mid last year she got into a relationship with a random boy, I say random because as one of her closest friends I have no idea who these guys are (no mutual connections etc) this was her first proper relationship and now that she was no longer a virgin, her and her then boyfriend had sex all the time, she would buy nice lingerie to wear for him and everything. They then broke up in December. 

Since then she’s been sleeping around with random guys, I find this so extreme as before she got into a relationship and excluding the one time she had sex before that, she was just being very flirtatious with the guys or only ever kiss them or only ever go as far as second base, she’d also actually hangout with these guys. Id also like to note that this isn’t in reaction to the breakup as she is over him. 

It’s just so crazy to me to see such a dramatic change in her, she tells me about how much they wanted her and she even wears her nice lingerie for them. She hasn’t had a second thought to whether or not these guys have been doing this with other girls or whether they’ve been tested for an sti. Myself personally have been in a committed relationship of 5 years and have always been a relationship person, before my current relationship I would also only ever have sex if I was in a relationship with that person. My friend says she’s not looking for a relationship as she’s just got a new job and is heading to collage in June. So, AITA for thinking she’s a slut?",0.98

It was so bad l I added her to my insurance but recently the way she has been driving  she might raise my rates. I’d tell her not to drive and that I will drive her places. And I have no problem doing it because I work remote jobs but now shes call me manipulative and a narcissist and it’s her car. She can do whatever she wants. I’m fine with that but not on my insurance.

"AITA For not giving back Taylor Swift tickets after buying them? Hey everyone, 

  
Last week i went onto a facebook group looking to purchase Taylor Swift tickets for the Eras Tour in Sydney, Australia. I managed to find a girl who was selling tickets for the Saturday night, and after messaging her and receiving proof I sent her money ($740 aud) in she texted me saying that she would send me the tickets (once they unlock - which is 48hrs before the event).  

  
2 Days ago I receive a message from her, saying that she needs my bank details so she can refund me the money as now her mother and sister want to go. She stated that her mother and sister have recently reconnected and wanted to now go to the show together (Yes, I understand things happen, but wouldn’t you check with your family first?) . I have been going back and forth with her for the last two days - where she keeps on asking to refund me the money and me saying that an exchange was made, and I don't want a refund and I want to keep the tickets. 

(Note: She lacks in communication and takes hours to respond and refuses to call us to discuss this over the phone - and recently she had accused me of harassing her.. (I sent one message at a time and DO NOT bombard her with constant messages))

I personally feel as if I am not responsible for her mix up - we brought the tickets from her and there was no hesitation on her end whilst selling the tickets. We are pretty desperate to go as its a gift for my 13 year old niece (Who's mother has already booked non-refundable tickets from Melbourne, so she can attend with me). 

So, ATIA for not accepting her refund request and giving her back her Taylor Swift tickets?

"AITAH for asking my mother in law to hoover everyday (post gives more context ) So, I live with my mother in law.. we have three dogs in the home. My two non shedding/very low shedding and her high shedding jack russel. 

I’m a dog lover.. but that doesn’t mean I want to be covered in hair… hence me having low shedding dogs and grooming them often to reduce the hair. She doesn’t groom her dog regularly and that’s her choice. 

But, iv asked her to hoover daily to combat her dogs hair being all over the place. My husband and his mother don’t think it’s fair that iv asked her to hoover daily. 

I think it is fair because it’s a shared space and I don’t wish to live amongst tumble weeds of dog hair. Of course I hoover too… but the home doesnt require multiple hoovers a day when her dog isn’t here.. 

So am I an asshole for asking this of her? Is it over the top? Too much?

"AITA for telling a colleague this? Context, I'm a British and Italian 29M who was raised in Rome, I live and work in London. As I was raised in a very foodie family which makes fresh pasta and grows a lot of our own produce, I really care about the quality of food and about how regularly Italian food in the UK is inauthentic. 

Colleague of mine was planning a holiday in Rome, so I offered to give her a list of some of the best restaurants and bars in Rome, these places aren't expensive, just good authentic Roman food. This is a list I commonly give to friends when they plan trips to Rome and I always get excellent reviews. 

When she comes back from Rome I asked her if she went to any of the places I suggested, she responded ""No, but I went to McDonalds 3 times"". While I'm not the biggest fan of McDonalds, I understand the purpose of going there if you aren't certain on food quality, especially in lower to middle income countries. But this is not the case in Rome, one of the most important culinary cities in the world. 

My response to her going to McDonalds 3 times was ""this is why people hate British people abroad, instead of trying authentic stuff you went to McDonalds"". She did take it as a bit of a joke fortunately so it isn't like we aren't on speaking terms, we joke around about this now all the time. 

I was probably a bit harsh in this, but I do firmly believe that you can understand a culture so much by the food you try there, going to a fast food chain isn't the problem, but only going there when you're in another country for a limited amount of time seems a bit dumb to me.

"AITA for buying cheap pencils for my stepdaughter? My daughter loves painting and she is very good at it. It's expensive but I still support her because I know how much it means to her.

My wife who is a sahm thinks I should be the one to buy things for her eventhough she has a dad who can do this.

Well I decided since she is not good at it there is no reason to waste all that money buying quality items when she can just practice with cheap stuff.

"AITA for lying about my first/only gay experience? I need to keep this brief for word count, but for context we were about 17 and in our 20s now.

At a party she tells me she wants to hook up with a girl (one of our friends), long story short she hooked up with me. She initiated it but I made the first move. I knew I was bi but wasn’t out to anyone but the news of the “lesbian tent” girls spread like wild fire around school. I said “she tried to come onto me but I hid in another tent”. She tried to talk to me but I called her a lier and told her to leave me alone. We both had members of the group on our side but she told people not only we slept together but I’m hairy and ashamed of my sexuality. Both true but still. I dragged her name through the mud after this and called her a lier with her rest of the school. There was a girl in the tent with us who apparently didn’t hear us and backed me up that nothing happened.  She ended up pretending it was a lie too to make the bullying stop but we both lost so many friends over it. Worst time of my life. Am I the asshole for not wanting to be outed to the school? I know I messed up to an extent but saw no other way out. To this day no one knows and I call her a lier as I know the truth will scare away my friends who stayed with me through it all.

"AITA for telling my dad's wife she will never be as good as my mom and taunting her that I don't call her mom? My parents divorced when I (17M) was a baby. My dad had met his wife and decided he wanted to be with her and not my mom. It was messy, I'm sure. From the time I was 11 months old my parents were sharing custody of me with an even 50/50 split for parenting time. 

Back when I was a baby/toddler and learning how to speak, my dad's wife thought it would be a good idea to taunt mom with the information that I had said mama for the first time at dad's house and I had said it to her. I have seen the messages because my mom had a folder to prove a hostile co-parenting environment. My dad's wife told her that she was always going to be the first mama and the most important one since she got to hear it for the first time.

Things were so tense between my parents and it got bad enough that the court ordered they shouldn't have contact unless both parties agreed that way I wouldn't be caught in the middle. My mom asked my dad if they could both take me for my first day of school. He said no and said his wife was going to be doing it with him because she was my real mom. Dad's wife sent texts to my mom about the day and saying everyone was complimenting her on how great her son is, etc. She admitted they talked over me when I was going to say something about her and how I ""forgot about her"" after that.

Stuff like that happened a lot and my mom has this folder which proves it all. I read the folder when I was 12. My mom was upset that I'd found it but also relieved that I knew what she had gone through with them.

When I was younger and I felt uncomfortable at my dad's house because I could not mention mom at all and they always talked about dad's wife being my mom. I told this to a person who interviewed me when my mom took my dad to court. My dad ended up losing custody for two years because of it, but won it back by talking classes assigned by the court. Then we got a new judge who refused to let me choose where to live at 14 and again at 16. This was even after saying nothing had really changed, they just got better at not leaving physical proof. But the judge wanted physical proof (texts, emails, letters).

Last weekend I mentioned my mom to someone and dad's wife jumped in acting like I was talking about her. When we were alone I told her she knows I'm not talking about her and to stop it. She was visibly annoyed by that and told me I have two mom's and should be proud of that. I told her I don't have two mom's and would never be proud to call her my mom because she is nowhere near as good as my mom. I told her I know it bothers her that I don't call her mom. I said it was what she deserved for the whole mama thing when I was a baby. I made sure I taunted the point that she will never hear me call her mom.

My dad was furious at me for talking to his wife like that. His wife was acting like she was about to cry for days after and told me it really hurt her feelings that I was so spiteful toward her. It was hell for the rest of that week. AITA?",0.12
"AITA to expect help from my in-laws? I'll get straight to the point, am I asshole for expecting help from my in-laws? I've been in a relationship for a while, and a little over a year ago, we got engaged. We're in the midst of wedding preparations, and from the beginning, my in-laws assured my fiancée they would assist with the wedding. We wanted to avoid asking for help as much as possible, so we managed on our own. It's worth noting for impartiality that they never specified the amount they would contribute, only expressing their desire to help. As time passed, we were planning to rent a venue because, while we have money to finance a property, it wouldn't align with our preferences, and we'd be burdened with existing wedding expenses. Last week, we stumbled upon a property in a great location. It was for purchase, but after calculating, I realized it would be extremely tight financially. I asked my fiancée to check if her parents would contribute, and that's when things went awry. They would vaguely agree to help, but the conversation would fizzle out without defining amounts. We had a figure in mind, but when my fiancée approached her father, he diverted the conversation, suggested nonsensical alternatives, and her mother didn't show much commitment either. Additional important points: 1. The assistance we sought was much less than they could genuinely afford, so money wasn't the issue. 2. As mentioned, they never specified an amount, only expressed willingness to help. 3. My fiancée rarely asks anything from them; she has always worked for her belongings. 4. There was another incident that added to our frustration, involving a promise that fell through when we needed it. If you're interested, I can share the details of another incident!",0.91
"AITA for not giving my husband a free pass even though I have in the past? AITA for not allowing my husband a “free pass” even if I have in the past?

Yes, this is a throwaway due to the face that both me and my husband use this app frequently.

I 25f got into a massive argument this past week with my husband 26m, Jake. We met when I was 19 and he was 20; both still in college. When we first got together we had an open relationship due to the fact that we both wanted to live it up during college. We knew we liked each other but we also didn’t want to settle down yet. About 2 years later we closed off our relationship right after he graduated.

One year later we got married. We have been peacefully together, just us, since then. Until one of our mutual friends decided to get married; Steve.

Steve and Jake have known each other since they were kids and therefore are very close. Jake is the best man in Steve’s wedding and so he was in charge of planning the bachelor party. I would also like to say, Steve’s wife gave him one free pass for his bachelor party, as long as he “doesn’t go all the way”.

Jake decided to plan a trip to Vegas for the weekend before the wedding. He got strippers, a condo, and was looking up different strip clubs in the area they were staying. I had no problem with this because strippers don’t bother me.

It wasn’t until we were all hanging out and Jake mentioned “finding some good hooker spots to use our free passes.” I was shocked by this because I had never agreed to giving Jake a free pass.

After our friends left I asked him what he meant about the free pass and he just kind of laughed and said “Ya know? Like I’m allowed to sleep with another women 

I told him that I never told him he had a free pass and just because Steve’s wife gave him one didn’t mean it extended to him. He got mad and said he wasn’t going to be the only guy keeping his hands to himself since Steve has a free pass and all the other groomsmen are single.

He then said it didn’t matter what I said but that he has a free pass anyways because “what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas.” I then told him that if he sleeps with anyone else, he can stay in Vegas because he wasn’t welcome back in my house.

He stormed out of the house and the next morning Steve’s wife called me asking me why Jake had slept on her couch the night before. I explained the situation and she got mad saying that now she just looks like a shitty woman for giving her fiancé a free pass when I wouldn’t give my husband one.

I hung up on her and called Jake, who didn’t answer. That afternoon they left for Vegas.

When he got back yesterday he immediately started screaming at me about how everyone else had fun but him because he wasn’t able to do anything with other women while all of his friends were. He’s been giving me the cold shoulder about everything.

"AITA for threatening to break lease w my roommate? I (24F) live with my best friend(of 6 yrs)/roommate (23F) in a two bedroom apartment. She is a heavy THC smoker ( both recreational & medically) and I work in a federal position that has zero tolerance for THC use so I do not partake. Since she usually smokes in the form of dabs, there’s no issue with smell or anything like that so my only request is that she conceal her rigs and such when my family/friends visit. Yesterday however, she had a friend over while I was getting ready for work and they chained smoked about 6 joints together in the span of 2 hours. I wasn’t really worried because my work clothes are kept in my room but my purse and the cup I take to work were on the kitchen counter. When I got to work, I had two coworkers mention the smell of weed to me in my office. I played it off by saying i’ve smelt it too and it was weird. after some investigating I found out it’s my purse that smells so strongly. 
During my lunch break I went into the break room to refill my cup with ice water and as soon as i opened my cup the room instantly smelled like weed and a coworker made a comment of it. I blamed it on the ice dispenser but am now super paranoid because I could be fired just for smelling of weed. 
I texted my roommate explaining everything that happened and asked if she could only smoke wax inside and anything else outside. it turned into a fight because she didn’t think it was fair she couldn’t partake in her hobbies in her own home & it’s too cold to smoke on the balcony which causes her pain (she’s never mentioned this before). I finally threatened to break the lease if she couldn’t compromise with me and she hasn’t responded back to my text or talked to me since i’ve been home. idk if ITA bc she does use it medically or if she’s just not willing to meet in the middle.
[UPDATE]
We talked about how this could cause me to be under investigation at work and potentially fired. I also made it clear that if I lose my job I can no longer financially support her and I think that is what caught her attention. She will now be smoking only in her room & will smoke flower outside only. 
Thanks for all the advice !",0.06
"AITA Sister won’t sacrifice for my one big night So old throwaway cause i know my sister scrolls Reddit a lot. Anyway am i theasshole i ((20f) am getting married this summer. Typical girl vibes and im so excited about it. Anyway for the past 3 years or so I’ve gotten significantly closer with my older sister (30f). More than we have ever been. Assuming due to the age gap. 

So i want her to be my maid of honor. She wasn’t exactly like excited when i asked her which i expected. She’s never been a fan of having too much attention on her and really is a Tom boy. Hates dresses. Complete opposites honestly. She was just hesitant. Like laughed nervously and was like “oh wtf really” lol funny tbh. But she ended up agreeing and was excited for me. She’s been so helpful planning, she’s a big diy person and good at it so has taken on the bulk of decor for the day. And organizing literally so much. Like she just makes shit happen. Anyway obviously I’m so thankful for her. 

So i don’t want kids at my wedding. My sister has 2 little boys 2 and 4 that are super sweet and well behaved honestly but i can’t bend the rules for her. She thought i was kidding and responded with “are you fckin dumb” 🙃 she is saying she really has no one to watch them as family will be at my wedding and she’s kind of a loner. Like everyone likes her but she definitely keeps to herself. Her husband has buddies who i suggested take them and she said no because she doesn’t know them on that level and isn’t comfortable with men watching her kids. Called her out on being sexist and controlling cause that’s what this is. 

Another note is i want to shoot guns off at my reception. Like camping vibes. Her husband has a shit ton of that stuff and was ex military. I told my sister this and she says that’s fuckin weird to do and he was gonna watch the kids i guess she decided. I said she can still bring the guns cause technically they are hers too. She said she’s not willing to be responsible for that many people operating firearms and thinks it’s a weird idea regardless.  Which i don’t get. They’re not children. How is she responsible. She says I’m making this too difficult for her to be able to come and i just think she wants to control everything. Her last text said “i love you, but you need to stop wearing your ass as a hat, allow kids or i really don’t know what to do” so am i the asshole for not wanting to change MY rules for her?",0.98
"AITA for telling my husband it wasn’t fair he got a new car? AITA for being pissed my husband got a new car?

Backstory: I make more than my husband so I finance a lot of things in our relationship. My husband doesn’t ask for that, but he essentially only makes money to contribute to our joint bills, his bills (like student loans, car payment), and our joint savings. If I didn’t pay for things, we’d never get to take trips or anything we both want to do. I make good money, so I can afford these things. He had a huge car payment from the car he had before me that ate up all of his leftover money. Basically he could save nothing outside of our joint savings. I was so excited for this to be done so he could contribute more. His car would’ve been paid off in 2 months. 

I also am the only one on the mortgage for our home. He has huge student loan debt (looking at you scammy online schools) and an average credit score, so he was left off the mortgage. I have a salary job and a 1099 job, but due to tax write offs, it doesn’t look like I make much more than my salary job.  To make the loan happen on my one income, I paid the remaining $7k of my car off with some of my personal savings over 2 year ago. 

Now to the actual issue. My husband totaled his car and obviously had to get a new car. Because we work together, I thought it would be nice to get a luxury car and use the car more for both of us. It would be a joint expense instead of individual. He let me know he didn’t like that idea and would pay for the car himself. I figured he’d get something more reasonable since it would be just his. He comes home with a luxury vehicle and it infuriated me. He had the opportunity to get a car that he could fully pay off or just have a small loan on and he chose to get another big payment. This means he still will not have the disposable income for trips or other fun things and I will have to finance them still because while the payment is a little less, the insurance and maintenance will have doubled. He says that we can look at getting me a luxury car, but I can’t since I have our $300k loan attached to one income on my credit. I could easily afford the payments, but no bank is loaning me the money because it looks like I already have a whole house payment myself and I haven’t saved as much as I could in my personal savings since I finance so much of our “fun”. I don’t feel it’s fair that I sacrificed being able to get a nice car so we could have a house and he gets the luxury car.

"AITA for not choosing my SIL as a bridesmaid just to be petty? My fiancé (m23) and I (f21) have been together for eight years. During the Christmas holidays he took me on a trip to Aspen and he proposed to me. Clearly we're on cloud nine with this huge milestone in our lives, so like I'm thinking if maybe what I'm doing is wrong/ staining something that should be a happy memory.

The thing is that my fiancé has a sister (my same age) we went to school together, but we weren't friends. When my fiancé and I started dating, for some reason she started spreading lies about me like saying I was bullying her at school or spreading rumours about me and her brother. She claims that she wasn't the one to say those things, but I know it was her. 

So yeah, we never really had a good/ close relationship and I can say that it has impacted my fiance's relationship with her as well. 

Now I have to choose those who will help me with my bridal party/ wedding planning. I got my own sister, one of my cousins, some friends and my fiance's other little sister (18) as bridesmaids, but I actively excluded his other sister. 

When she found out about it she said she's sick of me always being so petty and such a drama queen. I told her that she'll get an invitation for our wedding, but that tbh I don't want to spend more time than necessary with her, I am not close to her and I have no desire to make her a bridesmaid. She said that I'm acting immature because this is stuff that supposedly happened when we were in school, and she said again that she didn't and I never bothered to ask for her side. I told her whatever, it's my wedding and I can do whatever I want along other things

Some people didn't like my response either. But what actually has me wondering if I was an asshole here is because I was thinking about it. I am an adult and I'm ready to take a big step like marriage with my fiancé, but she called me immature and it kinda stayed with me you know? I'm wondering if it's time to be ""the bigger person"" and start over, which would make my decision here immature and asshole like. She's always going to be my husband's sister, my children's aunt, we'll be an official family now, so I don't know exactly what the saying is, but it's like extend an olive branch? 

However, I also feel entitled to have those who I truly want as my bridesmaids, I feel that's my right as I'll only get married once and I want it to be perfect for me, and that vision of ""perfect"" doesn't include her as a bridesmaid. Sooo, please give me your opinion",0.09
"AITA for explaining the economic halflife of assets to a friend? My friend is an economist and was outraged by me stating irrefutable facts dervied from first principles logic. We havent spoken since the disagreement. Am i the asshole?

Story: I was explaining that gold has 2% supply increase every year, which compounds. In other words, those who store their networth in gold experience their gold share getting halved in proportion to the global supply every 35 years. I then explained that dollars have an economic halflife of 10 years, based on the fact that the dollar has lost 99.8 percent of its purchasing power over the last 100 years, since the federal reserve was created.

I then went on the explain that storing  economic energy or wealth in any commodity...is akin to betting against human intellect and evolution. This is due to the fact that the natural state of a free market is deflation and abundance... as technology and productivity improves. Over time, we get more efficient at creating physical things, and the price to produce will trend to zero over a long enough time.

This is where he got upset. He started to angrily tell me why we need a central bank to inflate the currency supply and debase the purchasing power of its unaware populace to drive GDP. I did not understand this view, so he explained it like this: He said if gold dissolved and disintegrated by 2% every year, it would encourage spending, which drives GDP for the betterment of the central bankers. This is where i said this makes no sense and explained my view:

Time is the universal constant. If i work for 10 hours, and get paid for my time. Why can't i store that 10 hours of labor for future use? Why do i need to spend my 10 hours of labor before it loses all of its value? I explained that whatever good i choose to store my wealth in, should not be diluting and debasing over time, since that would be equivalent to time theft.

Upon hearing this, he paused while turning his head sideways, as if he just had a grand epiphany. He paused for about 10 seconds before violently shaking his head and uttering the word ""No"". ""This is the natural order of things he said"", and we must uphold the status quo to enrich the lives of central bankers. We must value our time in a good they can print for free. He then stormed out of the room and we havent spoken since.

"AITA For Breaking Down? I(23F) have a older sister (27F), with a double knee injury. who is just downright rude to me. Yes, she is rude and attitude-ish to our mother and stepdad, but since I help her out a lot more, I deal with it majorly. I was changing her sheets after she had an accident. (Not mad or disgusted with it, when people are injured and can't get to the bathroom fast enough, sometimes it happens.)

But I changed her sheets, the whole time she was huffing and puffing while watching me, frowning and mugging me and mumbling lowly under her breath cause I was apparently taking too long. She has a LOT of stuff on her bed, so I decided to wrap them in a clean sheet until I was done. I put her pillows on the floor and her bedroom door was slowly closing due to the amount of pillows.

She snaps at me, cause her door was slowly closing. 'Don't close my door, leave it open!' I only sighed, and continued removing the wet sheets. I fix her bed, and proceed to walk to place them in the washer. She grumbles under her breath about me putting her pillows on the floor, being slow with fixing her bed, her door slowly closing...I broke down. I started crying, turned to her and threw the wet sheets at her, crying and screaming at her. Before I could say more, our mom came out her room, telling me to shut up and her (my sister) to be quiet when she say 'You can't treat me like this, Momma not gonna let you.'

Mom gets angry for throwing the sheets saying, my sister had no way of defending herself so I was in the wrong majorly. I tried telling my mother what led up to it all, but of course she didn't want to hear it. Just wanted us to apologize to each other and for me to continue putting the sheets away. She told my sister she needed to treat me better, but she ALWAYS tell my sister that, but never does anything further and my sister still treats me coldly and rudely.

There is more & different situations like this. I know I was wrong for throwing the wet sheets, but I'm TIRED. I'm doing EVERYTHING for EVERYONE. Minus paying bills and driving to doctor appointments. Everything else, is on me. I'm depressed, I'm tired, constantly getting up at odd times 24/7 for either my mother (she has arthritis) and sister. 

My stepdad got sick, and can't do most of the stuff he used to do. But he doesn't want to do the little things either. For example, my mother asking me to clean her room; put her clothes away. I was already doing three other things; cooking, washing up dishes, and something for my sister that I couldn't remember and getting ready to sweep and I said 'No. I'm busy and you know that.'

She sighed heavily, frowned and said it was just clothes. Why couldn't I just put them away? I stayed silent and walked off, heard her asking my stepdad who stayed silent for a few minutes before saying 'Why can't she do them?' Meaning me. Least to say, the clothes are still sitting in the same place, because I'm constantly tired, and constantly moving around doing SOMETHING.",0.11
"AITA for yelling at a friend for smoking in my room I joined my uni 7 months ago and there I instantly became friends with a guy. We would spend all our time together. Soon, this spiraled into a friend group. I was liking it all since I was expecting it to be difficult to make friends here.  
  
This friend of mine was a smoker and I had insisted all my friends to not smoke in my room. It was a humble request and a boundary very clearly established and this room was occupied by two people.  
  
One day I return to my room finding it full of smoke. I quiz my roommate who was a bad liar and fessed up that the friend of ours had smoked here. I barged into his room and started yelling at him for smoking in my room disregarding my boundaries. He came to my room and acted oblivious to it being full of smoke. I continued to berate him and he confessed to have smoked in my room. I was very angry. He eventually apologized and went away.  
  
This incident led to him becoming distant. Communication eventually broke down and he changed his hostel block. Today when I meet him, its at an apprentice level, not a friend. I think about this quite often and wonder should I have reacted differently",0.2
"AITA for wanting to spend time with just my siblings without their kids being there? So I have three older siblings who all have children, I am 25 and the only one who does not have a child and I don’t plan to have any either. For the last couple years I have felt like I am the black sheep of the family and find it hard to socialise at family events because every single conversation is about my niece and nephews or about parenting and I find it very hard to get involved when I cant contribute anything to these types of conversations. 

I recently moved out of London last year so I don’t see my siblings as much and deep down I hoped that maybe it would bring us all closer and may encourage them to all want to spend more time with me. I went down to London this weekend and saw one of my sisters and my brother as they were also down for the weekend. They decided to take their kids out for the morning yet they didn’t invite me along. My dad was at work and the only person who was in the house was my mother who I don’t have a good relationship with so I spent the morning to midday by myself in silence. So I decided to cut my trip short and go home that evening. When I said my goodbyes to my family  my sister seemed annoyed and said she never even spent time with me. I just explained that I was tired but I went home to my boyfriend and just cried about it. 

AITA that I just want to spend time with them without the kids always being involved. I want to be able to have a conversation with them without having to watch what I say, or getting interrupted, or just being able to do something with them all where they ain’t stressing about what their kids are doing or having them ruin the mood because they are miss behaving. I do love my niece and nephews and I love spending time with them but sometimes I just want my siblings to be my siblings and not parents for a couple of hours.",0.36
"AITA for kicking out my step kids within a week of my wife passing away. I do not want sympathy. She is in a better place. 

My wife went into hospice the day after Christmas. She passed away before New Year's. Before that I was taking care of her with help from an in home care nurse. 

My wife used to participate in triathlons. She was a beautiful muscular brute. I don't know what she saw in me but I'm grateful for whatever it was. She weighed just over 90 pounds when she went into hospice. 

Sorry I guess that isn't relevant. I just want people to know how awesome she was and how awful it was at the end. 

Her kids lived on the house with us and didn't help. They are young adults. 23 and 25. My sister would drive from her town across the city to help cook and clean. She has her own family and a full time job and she did that for her best friend and her brother. 

My step kids just made more work for us. They ate food that people from the church brought for us. Then they would leave the casserole out instead of putting the leftovers in the fridge. One time my dog got into it and I spent three hours cleaning dog diarrhea up instead of being with Dani. I fucking hate them for those three hours. 

I've known the kids for ten years. They were good kids. I moved on with Dani a year after we met. We got married a year later. Second marriage for her. First and only for me I think. 

Her ex has systematically screwed her over. She got the house in the divorce. She said she wanted the kids to have stability. Her ex had taken out home equity loans before the divorce. She knew about them but was blindsided by the divorce. 

Sorry I'm rambling. 

Long story short. I sold my condo when we got married and used the money to pay off the house in full. Since there was zero equity I basically bought the house. 

Now that she is gone I don't want to be there any more. So I sold it. I bought a condo in the Ice district. That's a neighborhood by the hockey arena in my city. 

I'd been considering it since we knew the inevitable was coming. I was going to keep.the house for the kids though. 

Their behavior during her illness made me reconsider. 

A few people, including the kids, people from our church, and her ex have called me heartless for kicking them out of their home right after their mother passed away. I'm so numb these days I don't care. 

My sister says that I'm in the right. But she would say that if I committed genocide. She is hard core ride or die.

"AITA for telling my cousin that he is not my brother and needs to get over it? I(F19) have a cousin(M25). His parents were a bit neglectful so he spent most of his time at our house. Eventhough my dad didn't have to take him in he still felt bad for him and let him hang out at our home plus paid for a few things like school supplies, food etc. Again he had no responsibility and only did it because he felt bad for him but as soon as he turned 18 my dad stopped paying for his things and asked him to get a job and start paying rent if he wants to live with us.

For my birthday this year my dad threw me a huge surprise party. It was so amazing and unexpected. In the party he gave me a car because I just got my license a few weeks ago and he also let me know that I can live rent free at one of his houses which is near my college.

When my cousin heard this, he was angry for the rest of the night and wouldn't talk to anyone or eat anything. This ruined my party because all the attention went to him because everyone was worried about him asking him why he doesn't eat anything.

After the party my dad went to talk to him and he told my dad that yes he is upset because my dad kicked him out at 18 while he is still ""babying"" me

I asked what the hell does he expect? I'm my dad's actual child. He is not my brother and he needs to get over it. So my dad felt bad for him and took care of him for a while so what? That doesn't mean he is entitled to a car or rent free housing.

"AITA for being mad that my friend stood me up at my grandmother's funeral and now I don't hear from him? My (23F) grandma(dead) died and her funeral was yesterday. She and I were extremely close and I love her very much. Because I knew it was going to be especially hard, I asked my friend (26M) to come with me. He had met my grandmother once or twice and she really liked him. He is also the only person I feel comfortable crying in front of and the person who I can be completely open and vulnerable emotionally with. I think we're slightly more than friends, but with a lot going on there's no real commitment (however it is exclusive).  
  
During the week he lives 2 hours away. On the weekends he lives 40 minutes away at his parents house. So it wasn't much of an issue for him to come up and go with me to the funeral. On Friday he asked me 2x what time he needed to be at my house. Both times I told him 10:00, taking into account his usual lack of punctuality, because we needed to be at the church which was 10 minutes away at 10:30. He told me he was going to ride his motorcycle up and that we can take my car to the church, which was fine bc I planned on taking my car anyways.  
  
In the morning, I'm getting ready for the funeral. I don't hear from him but that's not unusual. When it's 10:00 and he's still not at my house I get slightly irritated. By 10:15 I text him/call him. But he's on a bike so I know he won't answer. By 10:30 he's still not at my house and I leave, already late, and I get a text that he's just woken up. So I call him. He said that he slept through all his alarms on both his phone and laptop (can confirm that he sleeps through every alarm as I've had to push him out of bed to wake him up) and that his parents forgot to wake him up. He said that he also thinks he accidently took a double dose of his meds which make him really sleepy so he was completely passed out all that night and morning. On the phone he didn't sound quite awake enough to really hear me, and I didn't have it in me to ream him out. I'd barely heard from him all day.  
  
He had told me that unless something happens that takes precedence (his own grandmother is very ill), he will be there for me. I had been worried because he is very very busy and I try to never ask for his time but he reassured me that some things, like this, are more important. I didn't want to be alone yesterday and that's all I have been. I haven't heard from him. I asked him ""so you stand me up and then ghost me today?"" and his response was just ""I literally told you when I got up"".  
  
I think I have every right to be mad. I never get mad at people and tell them, I never let myself get mad at people and feel it. But this time I'm pissed. And he has the nerve to get defensive? Explaining why and that you feel like shit for what happens does not make it better. He needs to fix this one way or another. He can't truly make it up to me as the funeral is already over and I'd really rather not have another one anytime soon, but damn. I want to drive down there and give him a piece of my mind. ",0.36
"AITA for not wanting father-in law to stay with us when he visits? I (28)F and my partner (29)M live in a small one bedroom condo in the city with a dog. Last time his father in-law came to visit, he slept on the pull out couch. I have nothing against my in-laws, they are lovely people. However, when my father in-law stayed with us for 2 weeks; I felt very uncomfortable especially sharing a small space and only having one bathroom. I just couldn't fully relax and unwind when I got back from work. It took a toll on my mental health. I actually went to my parents house 2 hours away for a couple of days. (Going to my own parents house isn't a feasible long term solution because I would have to commute 2 hours one way into the city for work and another 2 hours back just to go out of my way)

Any suggestions with getting a hotel is out of the question for my partner because my father in-law does not have the money for it. I offered to help pay for a portion of the hotel stay but my partner refused and was offended.

This year, his father in law will be coming in September for a week. By that time, we will have  moved into a larger condo with a solarium that can double as a small guest space. I came up with the idea of getting a chaise pull out bed that unfolds into a single bed for the solarium so that communal space isn't being taken over by his father. I've tried to compromise by okaying guests as long as they have a separate area to sleep in. My partner thinks that it's rude to not offer the pull out couch in the living room. So, he will still try to offer the living room pull out couch and nothing would change with the set up.

I've told my partner I don't feel comfortable with visitors for any longer than a weekend but since it's his father, I would be willing to compromise with the solarium set up. But, I will not be okay with anyone sleeping in the living room area.

I need my own space to feel safe and to function properly. I grew up with alot of family abuse, and as a result I really value personal space. My partner tells me that his parents aren't like my family growing up, and that I should move past my trauma. 
He comes from a large family, and he is the only one in my country so he doesn't get to see his family back home and misses them alot.

I'm not sure how to move past this. I empathize that he misses his family and I've tried coming up with ideas to compromise and find solutions but it seems like any suggestions are shot down. Not sure what to do, am I being unreasonable?",0.03

My sister(26F) and I(31M) are estranged. She hasn’t been a great sibling for my entire life. I’m sure I wasn’t either at times. That being said, after a long road, we are now estranged. 

My father shares details of my and my family’s life with her on a recurrent basis. I’ve politely asked him to stop. Yet it continues. That information only flows one direction, he does not share details of her life with me. 

Given the now complete estrangement, I reached out to him and had a pretty heated conversation telling him I was not comfortable with him sharing any details about my family with her as she was dangerous to my family (repeated emotional turmoil). He took the stance of “No it’s my place as a father to share what I deem necessary and I will not do that”. 

That seems like a very unhealthy dynamic to me, and as such I responded very firmly that he is not the arbiter of what gets shared from my family. I cannot imagine how the parent of adult children feels they have such a right. Do they? AITA here?",0.04
"AITA for trying to impress my friend with my VBA coding as a noob, almost messing everything up This post will be a bit technical about Visual Basic and Macros in Microsoft Excel.

My friend is an undergraduate intern and his project is listing the stock prices over time for all S&P 500 companies in Microsoft Excel. He is manually running a formula from the Bloomberg add-on for each of the 500 companies.

I said that I could do the whole thing in 30 minutes using Visual Basic. He was hesitant about it, but I kept persuading him and he finally decided to give it a try. The thing is, I have never programmed in VBA before and was doing this while learning the simplest commands.

I sent him the VBA script, told him to make a copy of the current workbook as an *xlsm* file, and exactly what to click, all over Zoom. It turned out that the code failed, and my attempt to correct the failure ended up deleting the 300 companies he manually entered.

We both forgot that the original file existed, he panicked and angrily ended the call. Later, he was able to restore the original *xlsx* file and I apologized and explained what went wrong.

I was non-religious and believed in science and medicine. She was a diehard evangelist Christian and thought vaccines and such were poison and claimed that if I got my son vaccinated I’d be “abusing” him. I wouldn’t relent. 

4 years ago I came home from work like any other day to find my home empty other than a tv, my fridge, and a couch. She had cleared me out while I was at work and left with my son.

I was able to see him on weekends and did my best to remain professional around his mother. But then she stopped returning my calls.

I contacted a lawyer. He explained to me that since I’m in Georgia, one of the last remaining states that does not recognize common law marriage, that I am basically a stranger to my son in the state’s eyes since I never legitimized him in court. She had technically broken no laws, and my only recourse would be an insanely expensive legal proceeding where I not only would have to cover the cost of finding her, but then sue for a paternity test to prove he is mine, yes, even though my name is on the BC. He said I’m looking at minimum $15-$20k before all is said and done. I simply don’t have it. So I waited, hoping she’d come to her senses.

It has been four years and I have never stopped trying to find my child. I still don’t know where he is, if he’s happy, where he goes to school, anything. It is miserable. It is agony.

I heard through the grapevine that one of her close friends has passed away. The funeral is today at 2 pm (in 2 hours). I am going. I have no intention of even entering the building or interacting with anyone else. And I do not want to do this at a funeral, I am aware that this is not ideal. But after four years of agony I feel I have no choice. I want answers. I am not a violent man and she knows this. She knows I would never harm her or my son. But I need answers, I need to know why this happened. Why I was denied being a father to my son over a petty argument. It has never made sense. All I want is a face to face. I need her to acknowledge my existence and tell me why she has done this. And while every part of my wishes that wasn’t at a funeral, that is how the cookie has crumbled.


TL;DR-ex took my son and vanished four years ago without a trace. I have no idea where they are and did nothing to deserve this. She will be at a funeral today and I plan to wait until the service ends without disrupting it and confront her.",0.29
"AITA for cancelling my (f25) boyfriend’s (m27) uber my boyfriend and i have been together for 5 years and moved out together 3 years ago. he’s gotten in car accidents every single year we’ve been living together. He also got into two other accidents before moving in together but while we were still together but i won’t be talking about those today. 

The first accident, he got in a three car collision with him at fault and with insurance that expired at midnight the day before the accident because he failed to pay. I’ve been reminding him to pay for two months beforehand. My family paid to fix his car. The second accident was with an armored truck because he ran a red light. His car ended up totaled and we left it at the junkyard since we can’t afford to fix it. He had no insurance or registration, which i’ve also reminded him to pay for 7 months. After this, he started borrowing my car and coming with me to work so he can take my car to take himself to his second job. This last accident happened while he was borrowing my car and was someone else’s fault and didn’t cause much damage to my car. Since he’s been out of a car, He’s been taking the bus to his first job which is nearby our home. 

We’ve been tight on money as we both have debts in our name and need to save up to move out of our apartment soon since our lease is ending. He’s not the best with money and i often have to remind him not to make certain purchases. There was a heavy storm and rain in California for a few days and he insisted on skateboarding in the rain to the bus stop a mile away. I felt like it was dumb and dangerous to skate in a storm so i got him an uber to work instead. 

Fast forward to the next week, no more rain. He is going to work his last couple shifts because his company is closing down. I had asked him the night previous how he will be getting to work and he said “I’ll take an uber”. I told him “I would prefer if you took the bus bc it’s no longer raining and we are short on money and he’ll be out of work soon. I want to be sure we can make rent”. No words were exchanged and we went to bed. 

The next morning I find him on my phone calling himself an Uber and he’s late to work. I ask for my phone back and cancel the uber. He calls me unreasonable and that I must hate him. He said that me doing this was not an act of love but an act of war. 

Now i’m sitting here confused and feeling like an asshole but not at the same time. I hope this made sense! Feel free to ask for more clarification on things. Thanks for all your feedback!!",0.66
"AITA for walking in on my (19M) my mom (41F) changing? I’ve been going to the gym for a few years after my mom suggested it to me but ever after since she has tried to get me to join her for a guided group exercise session. I didn’t really find it interesting but today I decided to give it a go. I very rarely go to the gym at the same time as my mom but we both have the habit of changing into gym clothes at home to save time at the gym.

We we’re running a bit late and I had been ready to leave the house for quite some time so I was wondering where my mom was. I decided to call out for her outside of her door but she didn’t reply so I decided to go in and ask her what was going on.

Well she was in her underwear and wearing airpods so that’s why she couldn’t hear me. She freaked out at me and told me that I can’t just walk into people’s rooms like that and that I had to get out immediatly which I did.

I tried to call out for her but as she didn’t reply I thought it was okay to go in and she regularly changes with my sister. I do get that it’s rude to walk into people’s rooms like that. So, AITA?",0.12
"AITA for Snapping at My Sister for Crossing the Line at My Engagement Party? I (28F) am on cloud nine planning my dream wedding with the love of my life, let's call him Mark. We're in the midst of bliss until my sister (26F), let's call her Emma, decides she wants to turn my fairy tale into a soap opera.

Emma has a history of trying to get a little too close for comfort with Mark. It started as innocent teasing, but lately, she's been crossing boundaries. I've tried to ignore it, hoping she'd come to her senses, but things escalated at my engagement party.

Picture this: a room full of friends and family celebrating our love, and Emma decides to grab Mark's thigh while we're all posing for pictures. In that moment, I snapped. I confronted her right then and there, asking her what the heck she thought she was doing.

She tried to play it off as a joke, but it felt like a slap in the face. I lost my cool and told her, in no uncertain terms, that her behavior was inappropriate, disrespectful, and downright disgusting. Our family witnessed the entire scene, and now it feels like my dream wedding is turning into a nightmare.

So, Reddit, AITA for finally snapping at my sister and putting her in her place, or should I have kept my cool and addressed it privately?",0.83
"AITA for backing out of my fiancés family trip I originally “agreed to”? My fiancé Luke and I have been together 2 1/2 years. I come from a small family, he comes from a bigger one and it’s safe to say he’s much closer to them than I am to mine. His family is wonderful. We all get along great, they are kind, and have always been welcoming. 

A few months ago, Luke, his brother, and I discussed visiting him a few states away one day this year either for the autumn time or his birthday. But nothing was ever set in stone. I said that sounds fun and I would be up for it. 

Last week, I get a text from his parents in the family group chat about going to South Dakota to visit him for the weekend in a few weeks. It is a 6 hour drive each way, I have a cat who doesn’t do well with travel so I have to worry about setting up care for him. And I’ll have to miss a day or two of work. I also didn’t know his parents and family would be coming too. 

I thought it was going to be a trip with Luke and I, but his parents, and uncle and aunt want to all go together. 

I told my fiancé that I’m not sure if I can go. And I really just don’t want to spend a whole weekend planned out with no down time. (He said his family vacations are usually like that) 

He said that we discussed it months back and I seemed to have made plans but I didn’t see it that way. Since I thought it would be us. I explained the cat situation, the short notice, and my feelings. 

I asked him why he just couldn’t do this trip without me. He got a little upset, and said he’s not going to wanna go if I don’t go too. But that’s putting pressure on me. I have spent most holidays with his family. Come to birthdays, events. Everything. But I really just don’t want to take a 3-4 day trip.

"AITA for buying a nice ring after my bf left me? Thought I would get some outside perspective on this situation as my ex still thinks I'm an a-hole for this and I have no idea why.

Okay so I am (21f). After dating for two years my Ex who we'll call X (24m) dumped me. We had discussed wanting marriage and kids many years in the future however this never happened because his family didn't like that he was dating outside of his race ( I am European, he isn't). 

&#x200B;

Well I was deveastated after he broke up with me, because he was my first relationship and had nothing to compare him to. I had never lived independently as an adult before we broke up. 

Well it's now been 4 months since we broke up and I am doing well for myself, I live independently in m own apartment near a major city in my country. Because I grew up poor I never had any nice jewellery, So after saving up I decided to buy myself a nice ring. Not too expensive think 250 Euro. 

It's a second hand emerald ring in a cluster setting in white gold and I could't be happier with it since I've never owned anything nice before. The thing is that the ring only fits my ring finger as I couldn't afford to have it resized, So I just wear it on my ring finger.

Well recently my ex and I met up for lunch and he noticed my ring. At first he asked if I had moved on so soon and I was confused. He then pointed out the ""engagement ring"". I corrected him saying it was just a ring I had bought myself.  

He then got upset at me for buying myself a ring like that because no one chose to give it to me and it was ""a slap in the face to engaged couples"". I asked how since my ring isn't a diamond ring and I bought it myself. He then called me ""f-ing cringe"" and left.

"AITA For Fiancées DND Group 
I (30F) am engaged to my fiancée (36M) and a couple months ago him and 4 of his friends started a DND campaign. I have no problem with this. I love that he has hobbies and I support all of his hobbies to the fullest.

As of lately l've noticed every other Monday everyone just automatically starts showing up at 6pm at our place to play. I try to make myself scarce by hanging out on the second floor of our apartment while they play in the kitchen on the first floor. They are loud. There's music playing, they're laughing, and that's fine. I love that they're having a good time. I'll come downstairs to get a bite to eat, but I always feel like l'm interrupting their game or distracting them so l just try to leave them be.

I’ve mentioned a couple weeks ago that I wish other people would offer to host DND at their place.

Well this past Friday I had my wisdom tooth extracted and he mentioned cleaning the bathroom today and I asked why, he said because people are coming over for DND tomorrow and I finally decided I had enough. I don't know if it was my recent surgery or the tooth pain, but with a swollen mouth I reemed him out a bit. I said that I would really appreciate if someone else hosted it sometimes. I feel like I can't watch tv in my livingroom or make an actual meal in the kitchen. He said I can watch the tv with headphones on and I can make whatever food I want. But I'm trying to explain to him that it's my FEELINGS that matter and he should take them more into consideration. He said he should be able to have friends over whenever he wants and I said sure, sometimes. But you should also ask and talk to me about it first. He just said ok well it's every other Monday so now you know and he kept asking me what the big deal was and I had to keep repeating that I had already told him my deal. 

I'm not even asking that they never come again, but maybe just once a month instead of twice a month. With 4 other adults playing surely someone else can host sometimes. 

Then he told me I should invite friends over sometimes. Then I had to explain to a 36 year old man that he is deflecting from my issue, and that isn't even relevant to what we're talking about. We ended up talking in circles so eventually I said well this is your place (only his name on the lease even though we moved into it together 8 years ago), you run the roost around here. So therefore you get exactly what you want. So there, hope you're happy. And I stomped away. Now he's cleaning the bathroom getting it ready for his guests tomorrow.

I feel like he takes advantage of me and dismisses me feelings constantly. AlTA for putting my foot down and and demanding that he find another place to alternate hosting DND?",0.89
"AITA For Not Handing Over My List of Vendors? I hosted an incredibly successful farmers market at a brand new wedding venue as a way to promote the venue itself and get it out in front of the public eye. This was the very first event held on the venues property. I filled over 120 vendor spaces and we had over 1200 attendees - which is pretty good considering this was a first show and the property is in the middle of no where. When I say I ran it, I mean I ran it. I did all of the marketing, advertising, vendor out reach, I booked a band, booked food trucks, I was the main point of contact, I set up all of the vendor spaces, marked them out, built maps and checked everyone in the day of and organized the arrival and placement of vendors. I also coordinated the staff as to where they needed to be and their role for the day. I also sent out surveys to all vendors after the event and got amazingly high remarks from all. A vast majority of the vendors wanted to return for future shows.   


Today, the owners sons fiancé sends me a message today and asks me for my list of all the vendors and their contact information because ""they"" are working on things for this year. She also states that they would like me to be apart of ""some"" of the planning and organization. I asked what sort of involvement I would have and she said they thought I did a good job with logistical and organizational things. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think I did a pretty good f\*\*\*\*\*\* job with the entire show... but I digress.  


With all this known, I don't want to hand over my list of vendors. Its very clear to me I'm trying to be cut out from the event and all involvement. My email address for the business and Facebook access has also been taken away. My thoughts are they saw what I did and now want to do it themselves. Ironically, this is the second time I've built an incredibly successful brand for another business and have been cut from it.  


 So am I the asshole?  


For full clarity, I will point out that some may say I ""owe"" it to the owners of the business. Last year I was laid off and the lease on my house prematurely terminated (owners sold it) in the same month. In a scramble to find a place to live, the owners of the business (my mother and her business partner) let me live in the house on the property for free. No one else lived there. However, I was confined to the small basement and that's it. I was also under constant surveillance and scrutiny during my stay there. I was eventually told to move out for no particular reason. Likely due to disputes between my mother and her business partner. ",0.09
"AITA for not wanting to wash dishes after my gf cooked us dinner? Been seeing new gf for about 2 months. It’s not serious yet, like nowhere near the stage of staying with each other every night or talk of moving in together. She invited me over last night, saying she wanted to cook for me. She made me a really nice dinner and then after suggested, “why don’t you clean up and wash the dishes, since I cooked dinner?”

I was surprised as it really killed the mood of what was a very romantic night, but in my surprise, I agreed to clean. She went and watched tv in another room where I couldn’t even see her while I cleaned up everything and washed all the dishes/pots/pans. All in all, it took 30+ min.

Afterwards, I told her I was heading home. I felt really annoyed and the vibe was killed. She couldn’t figure out what was wrong with me. I didn’t say anything but texted her back about it a couple hours later, explaining that I found it really unusual to have a guest over and then tell them to clean up. She said that she didn’t think it was weird at all and we were just sharing chores, that’s what couples do.

She said I was kind of being a stubborn AH for not wanting to clean up after she cooked for us. Now I’m starting to feel bad and am wondering if I am the AH.

"AITA for not a getting tattoo removal procedure to remove my child’s deadname from my body? Hi everyone, I’m 36f. I have 2 daughters, one of which came out as trans a year ago. Let’s call them Maria(17) and Anna (15, my trans child). I would like to start by saying that when Anna came out, I had no problems so long as her transition didn’t come in the way of school or grades. The problem however, is I have Anna’s “deadname” tattooed on my body. I have had the tattoo since she was a toddler. It’s pretty visible as it’s on my neck, and everytime Anna sees it she gets visibly upset. She’s told me she’s looked into tattoo removal surgery and recommended that I get it removed, or covered with her new name. While I do have the money for it, I do not think it’s something I want to deal with. After all, it is just a tattoo and I don’t think I should have to get it removed to show my love and dedication for this new identity. Anna however has accused me of not taking her seriously, and that if I truly loved or cared I’d get it removed.

I do understand getting the tattoo removed or covered would show dedication but I truly do not see it as necessary. I think she’s being absolutely ridiculous pushing the issue. I’m an adult after all and can make decisions about my own body, just as she can. This issue has put a strain on our relationship and now she barely looks at me these days.

"AITAH for being mad because of my (23F) best friends (23F) new personality? I've been bestfriends with Betty for 6 years now. We met in high school and instantly clicked. She was more of an outsider and so was I. It's been great, there was some ups and downs (for example our contact was worse when she moved for 2 years to a different city to live with her boyfriend) but now it's gotten to the point I can't stand her sometimes.

Recently she's broken up with her long term boyfriend (together for 7 years). Since that moment she changed past all recognition. Like I said we were outsiders, liked some small parties with friends, we were gaming a lot. Now? Since they broke up she met new friends at her job, she instantly hopped on tinder (despite me advicing her to take it slow after such break up and heal - but her coworker besties adviced her otherwise so yea), already found a new boyfriend and all she does now is partying at some clubs and talking about men. To me it's boring. I also prefer having a few best friends over multiple ""friends"", she did as well but now it changed. In high school nobody else liked her, now everyone loves her and she has this attitude of being ""a boss b*tch"" and ""popular girlie"". I don't like and never liked this kind of people (sorry if some of u are like this, it's just how I am). 

The way she talks like unironically ""slay girll"" gives me such an ick. She became a type of girl I avoided in highschool and can't get along with now. She claims I'm her real and only best friend, we had some serious talk but I don't feel like it at all. We barely meet even though she lives like 10 mins from me, she constantly goes to these parties and tells me about how she gets along great with some girls and they love her so much and she has so much fun. Idc. It makes me angry. To me it just seems like she loves to brag how much friends she has unlike me. She invites me to te clubs sometimes, but I told her I'm not going to such places because I have a boyfriend. 

Idk if I'm the AH because it may seem I'm jealous and the problem is me, it may be the fact that she changed so much we just won't get along anymore. I won't hope that ""old her"" will come back. I don't think I will cut contact entirely, maybe I will start being distant because the emotions she makes me feel are awful. I don't think talking with her about it will change anything, because with her current attitude she's going to take offence and nothing will come out of it. But maybe I am the problem here.

"AITA for giving my adult son the bigger bedroom over my teenage sons? Last week, myself and 4 of my children moved into a 4 bedroom house. As there is 5 of us and only 4 bedrooms my teenaged sons are sharing a bedroom. They are 17 and 13. Myself, my 12 year old daughter, and 27 year old autistic son have our own rooms.

They boys have shared a bedroom all their life, until last summer when my 22 year old daughter moved out and one of them took her room.

Now that we've downsized, they're unhappy about sharing a room again. 

The house has two bedrooms and a bathroom upstairs. One of the bedrooms is tiny and is my daughter's room and the other is mine so we can share the same bathroom. 

There is also two bedrooms and a bathroom downstairs. One is around the same size as my bedroom and the other is around 5 feet wider. The smaller bedroom is still a decent size with enough room for two double beds and the rest of their furniture.

In the end I decided to give my teens the smaller bedroom for a few reasons. 

1. My 17 year old is a senior in high school and will be going to college in the fall, at which point my 13 year old will have the room mostly to himself other than school breaks.
2. My 27 year old has a part-time job and pays me $150 in rent a month.
3. My 27 year old also spends more time at home/in his room than his younger brothers. I'm planning on getting him a couch and his own tv set up so he can have his own living space in the room. My teens are very active and have never spent a lot of time hanging out in their rooms even when they each had their own.
4. Although my 13 year old doesn't see his dad, my 17 year old does. He has his own room at his dad's house and although he spends more time at my home he still stays with his dad somewhat frequently.

Despite all the reasons I've listed, the teens have expressed that they are unhappy that they have been given the smaller room. They think as there is two of them, they should have gotten the bigger bedroom. My 13 year old is the most annoyed of the two and was texting his older sister complaining. She talked to me about it and took their side and suggested it seems like I'm playing favorites by giving their older brother the bigger room. 

I understand with their argument, but also don't think a few extra feet of space is going to heal their frustration of sharing a room again.

"AITA For Feeling Unattracted To My Boyfriend's New Look So I (24f) am not one to judge appearance. It really has to bother me to voice I don't like something. I lived all my life being judged for my looks and my weight problems and I also have health issues so I know the feeling of being judged for looks and other stuff feel.  My bf (24m) is a unique cookie. He decided to change his looks with a mustache and haircut I am not attracted to. 

He is visiting tomorrow and the idea we are to spend Valentines Day with him looking a certain way that turns me off just bothers me. He wants me to visit in May for our Birthdays but again the idea of him looking a certain way just make me hesitant and turned off. I don't want to go if I'm not attracted to him cause he'd want to do stuff together but I wouldn't have it in me to participate. 

Now I haven't expressed this to him. He knows I don't like the haircut or mustache but he doesn't know it makes me not want to touch him, kiss him or sleep with him. I want to tell him but I don't want to seem controlling or a bitch. 

I will also mention I don't alter my appearance much either. Every now and then I'll cut dead hair and let it grow out and if I feel creative I'd dye it a nice color but I wouldn't do anything that would purposefully turn my bf off.

"AITA for FORBIDDING my MOM and her BOYFRIENDS to have SEXUAL RELATIONS while I'm at home? I (21 F) used to forbid my mother and her partners over the last few years to have swxual relations while I'm in the house, this also included sensual kissing in front of me and or the men touching her in places like her butt in front of me.
This all was going on from the age of 13 ish to 19 when I moved out. My parents divorced when I was 10 and she date a few men from then on. I never liked any of them like ever, they would do all of the above when I was present in the house which caused me to walk in on her and her partners 2 times when I was 11 or 12. This really REALLY traumatized me. I remember the first time this happened It was mid day and I wanted to get something out of my mom's and my room, mind you after the divorce I shared the bed with my mom because of my extreme anxiety and depression, her and the boyfriend where doing it on my side of the bed, not on top but but leaned against it. After that I ran out the house crying and loved myself inside my treehouse for a long time while she was trying to apologise and stuff but I did not wanna hear it.
After a while we talked and she promised me that this would never happen again. But it did. I never saw anything after but I was able to hear it in the house a few times and it really hurt my feelings. We had a lot of fights over the years. She claimed that I, her daughter, could not tell her what to do and when and my older brother ( by 6 yera older) and my grandma who lived with us due to health reasons agreed with her stating that she's an adult and bla bla bla... Bit I won the argument end she said she would respect my boundaries after reminding her of her promis.
After Dating a few men on and off she then got serious with one and they dated for aground 3 years I think. He did not like the fact that I was still sharing a bed with my mom ( now I also think it's wierd but back then I was way to afraid of sleeping alone, I was 16...)  So he kinda forced me out of there by calling me old enough and stating he wanted alone time with my mom. This did not end well. He broke all the boundaries I set with my mom and it hurt a lot and retraumatised me again and again. This really bout a strain on my relationship with my mom and I grew very distant from her over time. She did break up with him tho after a few years and has reunited with her first ever love she had at 16 and they are now happy together.

"AITA for shamelessly blackmailing my grandmother? My parents are immigrants from an East Asian country. Despite what some may assume, they’re pretty chill with my brother (19) and I (22). 

My maternal grandmother moved in with us about 6 months ago. She lived in our home country before. She’s pretty nice, but there’s obviously some things we can’t do/say in front of her because of certain barriers. Not only culturally but she’s also super religious (while we’re not). 

We’re usually allowed to have boyfriends/girlfriends over (within limit) but were told not to anymore since my grandma moved in. Unfortunately, my brother is stupid and snuck in his girlfriend while our parents and I were at work. Grandma heard some noises and went to check on them and I’m sure you can fill in the rest.

She was horrified and immediately called my mom who had to leave work early because of how angry my grandma was. My parents weren’t really mad at my brother but slightly annoyed. They “yelled” at him and also told my grandma that it wasn’t a big deal and I figured that was that. 

The thing is, my brother told me that our grandma won’t stop calling him nasty things and she even called her sister and told her that my brother’s a gigolo (I think that’s the translation I’m not 100% sure). He wasn’t really complaining but I could tell it was bothering him. Also, yeah he did something wrong but saying all that about him is overdoing it.

I asked her if this was true and she got embarrassed and said she was just venting and that she’s not used to the culture here. She also said she didn’t know my brother could understand the language so well and wouldn’t have said anything had she known. I told her that isn’t an excuse and if she doesn’t apologize to my brother and says something like this again, then I’d tell mom (who would definitely kick her out, what she’s saying is BAD). 

My grandma said she’d apologize but told me that I have no shame for trying to blackmail her and am very disrespectful. She said that my brother and I are very selfish for expecting her to just accept our “culture” and that she’s just venting. I see her point but am I just supposed to let her keep spreading disgusting rumours about my brother? AITA?",0.07
"AITA for wanting my fiancé to cover his ex’s name? My fiancé was dumb when he was younger and got two names tattooed on him. His first “name tattoo” was his girlfriend at the time and then a few years later he got the mother of his children’s name (also his girlfriend at the time and first love- they were together for like 8 years.) This was probably 10 years ago, for context.

He said he wants to cover his ex girlfriend’s name but wants to keep the mother of his children’s name because it’s symbolic to him of his child… somehow. He also has his child’s name tattooed so I’m not sure why that isn’t good enough.  

Anyway, I wouldn’t have a problem with this really, but when asking if he would ever get my name on him he said that he learned his lesson… some what… and would only get my name if I got his. We’ve been together for 4 years and I’m pregnant now with his second child.

I feel like if he doesn’t want to get my name on him then why doesn’t he want to get hers covered at least. He said he will only get my name if I got his, but the mother of his children doesn’t have his name so with that same logic he should get it covered right? Or am I missing something?",0.33
"AITA for telling my SIL she doesn't have to be so uptight all the time? I (19F) was out shopping for clothes with my sister Ellie (26F). I'm the goofball of the family so I'd be the one who's joking around most of the time.

During our shopping, I tried out ridiculously bad combinations of clothes, and asked Ellie for her opinion, obviously to make her laugh. Ellie tried one outfit (after I asked her) and we took ridiculous pictured together.

A short bit later, Ellie's wife (Kate - 33F) called and said she would be dropping by to see us. Kate is/is going to be - I don't really know all the details - a surgical oncologist (cancer surgeon) and is overall a witty, but extremely dry person. Some legend (Ellie) says she's sweet and thoughtful when she's at home but it has never been proven.

Now. When Kate made it, I showed her the pictures and asked her if she wanted to join us and the three of us could maybe try out a weird outfit.

Kate looked at me like I had 3 heads, and asked if I was serious. I said yeah. She said she would not do that, and that she had a reputation and professional image that she wouldn't deem such a stunt to be appropriate. 

Here's where I may be TA because I said she didn't have to be so uptight all the time and a simple 'no thanks' was enough to get her message across. Ellie later called me and said I was rude to Kate, and needed to understand that she has a different taste than I do. Was I an AH?",0.41
"AITA for honking at somebody stealing my parking space? I was going to Costco to get lunch. It seems like every Costco has problems with parking but this one is the worst. I’ve driven through the lot several times without finding a space before. 

When I saw somebody pulling out I stopped and turned on my turn signal to take their space. While I was waiting a pickup truck pulled up from the other side and snuck into the spot while the car that was leaving was passing me. I honked at them and went to look for another spot.

After I parked and was walking to the store, the woman in the pickup truck ran up to me and started screaming about how could I honk when they weren’t going to drive through the space to let me park there. The woman in the next car jumped in and started in to about how they were going to leave and I could have taken their space. I don’t know why they both thought I knew what they were planning to do. I’m not a psychic. 

I tried to defend myself a little and then just walked the other direction and took a long way to the store. When I saw they also went to the food court I just turned around and left.

"AITA for wanting a new gaming rig ? AITA in this situation ?

I (33m) have been talking for months about wanting a new expensive gaming rig (2500€). It’s def a lot of money but hey I’m willing to pay for it. I want to borrow the money, pay in 24 times and that’s it ! 
When I told GF(29f) she told me : “no I’ll buy it for you ! For your birthday”. To which I replied “this in insane it’s way too much money I don’t want you to buy it”. 

Some context, in the last 12 months we’ve split the bill over an iPad for her, an iPad for her mom (both the 350€ version) and I bought her an iPhone 12 for her birthday (I think I paid 400€ and her sisters paid 150€). 

Despite that, because I genuinely don’t care about money between us, I told her I didn’t want her to buy me the rig ! I told her : I just want one thing, that you let me buy it when time comes and you let me borrow money (21st of march which is my bday). She said “oh yeah no problem you can buy it”. 

Tonight (11th of February) the graphics card for the PC was available and it has been sold out since day 1 (4080 Super FE) ! So I told her “I should buy it now” to which she told me “Mmmh I don’t know it’s very expensive”. And after seeing me wine like a baby she told me to buy it. I haven’t. 
Ps : I need her to lend me part of the money because NVIDIA doesn’t offer the option to buy in multiple payments. 

For context for my last birthday she didn’t bother, she just baked a cake. And she told me she’d buy me a massage (I refused I want the gift now or never). At Christmas she told me she’d get me a Nintendo switch but apparently it never arrived because she didn’t click buy or something and I didn’t really want one so I told her it’s ok (would have been nice to receive it though, even if I would have returned it). 
Meanwhile at every apecial occasion I try to find her the best gift at the best of my financial capabilities. 

Now I’m mad, I genuinely want to cry. I feel like a big baby who didn’t get what he wanted. I feel lame AF it feels like I’m 3 and demand a candy or I cry. Worst thing is that I should be responsible enough to have that money, I shouldn’t have to ask and repay later. I should be able to afford my stuff without borrowing from somebody else. 

Other than the gift situation she’s an amazing gf

"AITA for suing my insecure ex girlfriend and her family for damaging my belongings? I have been dating this girl for almost 4 years we’re both fairly young and she was great at first, to me she was gorgeous, athletic, and funny and the relationship has been rocky because I realized she was very insecure. She used to have severe acne and was bullied growing up and I understood why she was insecure but I always made sure to make her feel comfortable and secure with me. It’s has been getting worse recently because I have girls talk to me and flirt with me in front of her and she starts flipping out on me and verbally attacking me as if I’m flirting back and I’m not at all because I’m happy with my girl. I must add I don’t even make eye contact with most girls and she made me cut off my single guy friends because they like to party so all I do is work and come home and play the game here and there.

She goes through my phone constantly and I allow her too because I have nothing to hide and she saw a text from a girl that I work with in the group chat saying how I shouldn’t bring my girlfriend to the work party because her attitude is ugly and how I shouldn’t even be with someone that ugly and how I’m way too handsome for her. I didn’t respond because I wanted to address her face to face with my girlfriend on my arm and my girlfriend at the time flipped out again and kept screaming I should have defended her and kept accusing me of sleeping with my co worker, she even went as far as breaking my phone which I had to replace the next day again no problem I should have left her at this moment but I invested a lot of money and time into making our relationship work so I didn’t want to just give up. 

The last recent outburst was when we out to eat and the waitress was taking our order, she was a decent looking woman and I can already see my gf getting insecure and she didn’t want to talk to the waiter herself she was being rude  so I ordered for her the night went on and I tipped the lady a little extra because of my gf poor attitude and the waiter made a comment saying “good tipper and your cute I can see why your taken” I was just thinking oh my god here we go and we came home and she started screaming and breaking stuff and she damaged all of my belongings and gaming consoles in my apartment, so I called the police and her parents and sent them the videos and pictures of her acting irate and I’m in the middle of suing her for property damages and the family told me I did enough damage and I should cancel the lawsuit because she’s supposedly in a mental institution. this isn’t the first time she has done this and I tried to give her multiple chances to get her act together i even offered for us to go to therapy together because I loved her a lot, I didn’t know she had mental problems.",0.08
"AITA for telling my friend I feel bad she suddenly stopped communicating with me? hey!

Me and my (best) friend live very far from each other. We used to text a lot during the day, for years. We would also speak on the phone regularly. We'd share a lot about our day, what we're dealing with, memes, news, pictures and videos from our every day lives, and stuff like that. At some point, I became very busy, and she complained a few times about me not texting back as much. I felt bad about it, so I tried my best to reply to her as often and as fast as I could. (I also did/do love talking to her).

So that was the state of our friendship for a long time. We were close in our communication and openness with each other. A couple months ago, my friend was having a bit of a rough time in college, feeling kinda lonely and stressed. So she went home for a couple weeks. There, as usual, we spent a lot of time talking together, I tried to make her feel better, encourage her with any advice I could, etc.

She went back to college, she applied some of the things we talked about, and suddenly she was feeling better, which made me really happy. She started going out more, hanging out with more people, doing activities, etc. But almost immediately after that, she practically ghosted me. When it would usually take a couple hours to hear back from her, it now became three days. Even when she would respond, it would be one text or two before she disappears again for another three days. I especially hated when she'd disappear in the middle of me explaining to her why I feel bad about this. When I asked her about it, she said that she's suddenly very busy, and that she doesn't have as much time as she used to have to text. She said she's busy with school, going out, doing activities with the people she's now hanging out with, etc. She basically spends all her free time (8 hours+) hanging out with other people, and she can't spend 10 min to reply to me, and I just find it hurtful.

I tried having a conversation with her about it multiple times and explaining that the sudden change made me feel bad, and it made me feel that, suddenly, I didn't matter as much in her life anymore, especially since I wasn't in the best place mentally when all this happened, which I told her about. She said that she's sorry I feel bad about it, that she still loves me, but that she can only experience college once, and she doesn't have as much time to text the way she used to. I found this odd as she was in college for the past two years, but it didn't impact the way we communicated until now, especially going from being able to speak to me for 4/5 hours a day... to nothing. I asked her how she'd feel if I suddenly changed the way she did. She said it's understandable I'd feel ""kinda bad"" about it, but that's life. People have shit do, and that I should move on and start doing other things too.

So I feel that she kinda stopped wanting to communicate as soon as it wasn't the most fun thing to do. She feels that I take these things way too seriously, and that it's weird a little change (in her words) like this can impact me that much.

"AITA for my husband driving me to work then popping my tire on the way back? Some background: I’ve recently quit my job at the hospital with the encouragement of my husband to work per diem as a home health and hospice nurse. He has heard people make a lot of money doing that so he was always insisting I quit working at the hospital to try it. So far work has been slow and I have student loans to pay for which is causing me financial strain. 

Over the weekend I was told to go see a patient at night in an unfamiliar neighborhood. I suggested to my husband if he wanted to come with me. He first said no then he changed his mind and said he will come. Knowing how impatient he and that he hadn’t eaten all day I told him to stay at home and get food and I would just go alone. He insisted on coming and said he’ll do work in the car. Before this my husband was already irritated that I took this job after hours without negotiating with the company for higher pay. My visit ended up taking two hours. After I got back in the car we were driving to get him food from a food truck and he drove over a pothole and popped my tire. Now he’s upset at me and blames me for the whole situation. AITA?",0.26
"AITA for wanting to wear a wig to my Valentines date?   
I (33f) bought me and my boyfriend (33m) tickets to a light show in a park for Valentines Day a few weeks in advance.  
  
We've been together for two years. I wear wigs sometimes - he knows this, has seen me wear them before, and never said anything. I haven't worn makeup or a wig in several months, but I really wanted to look pretty for the special occasion, so I put on one of my favorite outfits, which includes a silver/platinum mid-length wig. I thought my effort paid off.  
  
I said I was ready to go. He looked at me with disappointment on his face and said, ""Are you bringing the wig with you?"" I was stunned - he clearly did not approve of my wig and of course I was wearing it out - I said I was ready to go. After a pause, I looked at him with disbelief and said, ""What??..."" He repeated the question with the same look on his face.  
  
I got really upset; I never expected this from him. I have been through narcissistic abuse from my father and ex for 29 years, and I have ADHD, which makes it difficult for me to regulate my emotions. I've been working very hard in therapy for years and have come far on my healing journey, but it's still something that requires patience on his part, which I know isn't fair to him, and I feel really bad that he has to put up with it. I do acknowledge when I'm in the wrong and take responsibility for my actions, and then take steps with my therapist to learn and be better moving forward. I'm very open about it because I want other people to understand me and to have as little surprises as possible for them. He knows this well - I've been very open about everything with him because I welcome him to do the same. He has some issues too, and I've been very forgiving and supportive for him. I hope that he can be the same for me too.  
  
I'm not at all proud of what I did next, and immediately regretted it as soon as it happened, but I couldn't control myself in the moment. I threw my wig off my head onto the floor and went to fix my hair. He said he doesn't need this, that I always blame my father and my issues for everything, and that he was going home. I immediately admitted that I shouldn't have thrown it, it wasn't what grown-ups do, and asked him to stay and talk. We both calmed down after a few moments and went on to our date.  
  
His words really hurt me. We had a long difficult talk afterwards. He was overall kind and told me that he never wants me to feel like I did with my ex, and that he was wrong to say all that, and that he didn't mean it. However, he did not seem to want to back down about how the wig makes him uncomfortable. I think it's a reasonable compromise for me to wear a wig once in a blue moon, when usually I have my hair how he prefers. He seemed reluctant to agree. My ex was very controlling about my clothes and hair. I want to stand up for myself, but struggle because I always feel selfish when I do.

"WIBTA If I(29F) asked my bf(32M) to cut his best friend (32F) out of his life? My bf (Sam) and I have been dating for almost 3 years and have lived together for almost 1. When I first met his friends, they all seemed great. His best friend (Jess) was super inviting. She could tell that I'm shy, so over the next couple of years, she has always told Sam that I could talk to her about ANYTHING. She would tell him repeatedly to tell me that I could contact her any time I needed someone to talk to. I've shared bits and pieces of my life, some more personal than others, and have gotten along well until recently. 

Well, just over a year ago, Sam and I got into a really big argument. We were arguing almost every day so after a few months, I decided to contact Jess for help. 

I texted her ""how do you know when you've found ""the one""? "" 
She gave me a long answer of how she knew her husband was the one then asked me if I wasn't happy. I gave her a quick tl;dr, but never went into specifics. She basically told me that she hopes things work out for us thinks we're great together, but work needed to be done. 

After, I told Sam that I reached out to Jess and he blew up at me, and when he texted her, she kept voicing to him how strange she thought it was that I was reaching out to her at all. After this she tried to convince him that I was abusive. I will say, she has the tendency to label undesirable things as something much worse than they are. Ex. She claimed that her husband had a sex addiction, just because he has a kink that she doesn't understand (also for reference, I'm a mental health and addictions nurse, and nothing he did would come close to being an addiction). When Sam would tell her that I wasn't abusive or had any ill intent, she would tell him ""maybe it's unintentional abuse"" and was pretty relentless with this.

Sam and I are currently in couples therapy and he came to realize that he needs to talk to Jess face to face, so they did. He confronted her about what a bad friend she was being (for this, and so much more) and also talked about how she needed to apologize to me in person if she wanted me to forgive her for making crazy abuse allegations against me. She agreed that needed to be done. They finished their meet on good terms and Sam came home and told me everything they talked about. The next day, he texted her to arrange when and where we could meet for the apology, and she flat out said that she has no intention of apologizing cuz she ""doesn't want to get in between our relationship"" and said that she did nothing wrong. 

I told him that I will be cutting her out of my life and going no contact. If we hang out in a group setting, I will simply sit the furthest I possibly can from her and not talk to her. I told him that if he wants to continue to be friends with her, despite her being a bad friend, then I'd support him, but I don't know anymore. I don't want to be the crazy, controlling gf, but I want her out of both our lives.",0.67
"AITA for not paying a fine? It's my first time posting on reddit. I've seen these on TikTok but have never used reddit before. I don't know, maybe this will reach some people. So me and my 4 friends from school rented a car a few months ago because we didn't want to take the train home like we did every day. My friend got her driver's license recently and She has an account on a rental portal for renting cars. She literally just got her driver's license, so she isn’t allowed to upload her driver's license onto the app yet. She used her mother's drivers license.. now here comes the tricky part; she didn't drive the car she just unlocked it. My other friend, who also has his license, drove the car, but not under his name (account details), and neither of them would have driven under THEIR license, it was my friends mothers drivers license.. (I still don't know why he couldn't use his license for the app, but he doesn't have anything to unlock rental cars with) basically we all got into the car, (also I had no idea about any of this before all 4 of us got in the car) they wanted to drop me off first so I was focused on my phone looking for music. not even 5 mins later we had to take a turn I have no idea about anything, that has to do with cars. I don't have a car, I don't have a driver's license. I have no idea how it happened. All I know is that suddenly there was another car in exactly (and only) my seat side and had crashed in while we were turning, everything happened too fast. I don't even remember much of it. All I know is that I screamed and my phone flew out of my hand. The car hit the entire left side of my body and left me with physical head trauma for two weeks. I also spent about 5/6 hours in the hospital that night and couldn't go to school the next day. We were shocked and scared and we all felt like we had really screwed up, but a few days later, it was clear that (it's a shame to say but) it was entirely the fault of my friend who was driving the car, that the other one crashed into us.  police officers and everyone else who saw it also confirmed it. We knew we had to pay a lot. And we told each other that we would pay for it together and support each other no matter what. The car rental company contacted my friend who unlocked the car and the penalty fee shocked us. The total fee is $16,170. The day it happened, my dad immediately warned me not to even think about paying even half a cent, but I felt bad and just waited for the amount to see how much it was and how I could eventually help financially. My friends who weren't involved told me not to pay a single penny because it wasn't my fault, I just sat in the back and trusted my friends to get me home safely, besides none of us and especially me can't afford that amount. My car unlocking friend and driver immediately thought of splitting the bill into 5 and each of us would pay about 3k but I'm just as broke (and innocent) so am i the asshole, because I won't pay 16,000 nor 3,000?",0.05
"AITA for not going to an estranged family members BBQ? I (26f) was invited to a bbq hosted by an estranged cousin, Kelly (26f). I didn’t receive the invite from Kelly personally, instead my grandmother asked me to come. I decided not to go because I haven’t spoken to Kelly or her family for 12 years.

They stopped inviting me and my mum to events because of how I behaved as a teenager. I started drinking when I was around 13. I posted a lot of pictures on social media at parties, with alcohol in hand. Kelly’s mum saw these pictures and decided I was a bad influence. Their family hasn’t spoken to me since.

We live in the same area and I often see them at the local shopping mall but we don’t acknowledge each other. I once tried to say hello to Kelly but she quite literally ran away from me. 

I decided not to go to the bbq because being rejected from Kelly and her family hurts and I didn’t want to put myself in that position again. My grandma, who I see regularly thinks that I should get over it and try to repair the relationship. She is insistent that I apologise for not attending the bbq and will not speak to me until I do. 

But I feel as though I’m the one that’s owed an apology for how I was treated as a teenager. Being cut out was very hurtful, the only family I still see is my mum and grandmother. It took years of therapy to get over my extended family not speaking to me and there’s still a part of me that holds resentment for that.

However I love my grandma a lot. I’d hate the thought of losing her too. So am I being the asshole in this situation by not attending the bbq and not apologising?",0.06
"AITA for being fed up with my coworkers? I (F,30) ecently started a job where a strong percentage of my coworkers are Indian. I have nothing against them except what I am personally experiencing on a day to day basis. 

I am fully aware of our cultural differences and I feel like I am starting to implement racist behavior by being annoyed at the things they do. It is genuinely bothersome. For example: The lunchroom. I am bothered by the lack of awareness when it comes to keeping the area clean. They hack up mucus in the lunch room sink, cough without covering their mouths, and do not clean up the spills from the food they bring in. THIS IS ALL VERY RUDE. I am trying to tell myself that it is a cultural change and the behavior is not them being purposely rude. They put napkins under their food when they use the microwave and leave it in there. I end up throwing it away for them. If they eat chips they leave crumbs on the floor. They bring their dishes from home and leave them in the sink along with bits of food. THEY DO NOT RINSE THE FOOD DOWN. This is not a personal kitchen and it should be mandatory to be aware of other coworkers. No one says anything about it but I know it is bothersome. While we have a janitor I strongly feel it is incredibly rude to make their job any harder than need be. They leave literal trash around. Our lunchroom and entire store has smelled strongly of B.O and ethnic food.  The B.O was so strong I almost puked. They also do not flush the toilets a good portion of the time.

While, I make great conversations and make an effort as a POC myself I genuinely find myself disgusted. My coworkers have also made comments that are very personal and rude. Aloud and amongst customers. They have debated loudly about my hair, commented on what I eat, and question me ALOT as if they have the right to know and as if I am not an adult myself.

"AITA for sabotaging my HS math teacher after she went back on our deal? When I was in Highschool, several years ago, I signed up to Aid a math teacher, which we’ll call Ms. Mars, I aided for her because I had a failing grade and made an agreement to Aid in exchange for a small point curve. She agreed to this, but it was never in writing. I was a 16 year old kid at the time and she was over 35, so I trusted her word. 

A couple weeks go by and she forgot our deal. When I brought it up she replied with “what are you talking about?”, after some explanation she finally said “we’ll see”. I had a 63% in her class and she refused to accept HW my only option: ace the next 3 tests. Since testing was 20% of our total grade, 100%’s would have bumped me over a failing average. I attended two classes with Ms. Mars daily, first period in the morning and 5th period. After a few weeks of keeping my head above water I ended up getting sick for an entire week, and subsequently several days the following weeks; meaning I would have to triple my efforts to relearn old material for aiding and also homework from my other 7 classes. I didn’t want to do this without a guarantee so I asked Ms. Mars and got my answer; she apparently never heard of this deal, nor would she “ever agree to that” with a half smile - like she’d won, that I had been beaten, and I immediately flared up, immediately felt a strong sense of hatred.

What Ms. Mars didn’t know was that I knew some of her family members, and a few of them were into drugs (unbeknownst to her). I would tell kids in my class about her relatives without telling them the relation between her and Ms. Mars. A few days later I said the name of her relative in a “private conversation” with another student, intentionally including the last name. She responded with a “how do you know my nephew” to which I shrugged “ I just do”. Nearly the entire class has heard my deliberate explanations over the course of the week and audible whispers began circulating immediately.

Less than a week later the entire school was openly talking about it and Ms. Mars was talking to the administration over it. I felt nothing for her nephew since he had sold drugs to my siblings before.

I even went to a counselor and told, Ms. Franklin (for anonymity), that Ms. Mars was intentionally sabotaging my grades and that it’s being decided by tests “homework grades are irrelevant to our GPA in that class” (homework is supposed to be 60% of our grade and a way to improve test scores as is their policy)

Ms. Mars underwent a series of rumors of drug use herself, and that her family were drug addicts. An all-encompassing investigation was launched. She started assigning grades to HW. I never did finish that class, I ended up doing online schooling for the remainder of the year.

She reneged on our deal, gave me tremendous amounts of stress throughout my senior year, and smiled at my downfall- knowing I could repeat senior year.

"AITA for thinking we should split the money? Last September a good colleague of mine learnt that he is getting laid off due to the company cutting workforce. As we all felt bad for him, we immediately started to check around for a new job for him. Where we live, it's very normal that people do referrals in their companies, so we were all asking family and friends if they know about some openings in their companies. 

My sister works in a very good corporate so I asked her if she could recommend him if he finds something interesting there. She said sure, as it's a really easy process. So he found two positions that he liked and found fitting and sent my sister his CV so she can put it through the system.

Fast forward to November, he successfully completed two interviews and got hired for one of the positions, starting in December. I helped him a bit to prepare for the interview as my husband worked for that company for quite some time, so I knew a lot - nothing confidential of course. As my sister is quite new in there, she wouldn't be able to help him that much and also I didn't want to burden her with this, so I took up helping him a bit. 

My sister told me a few days ago that she got the referal bonus after him in her recent salary. I was like, that's super! But didn't want to comment more. My husband thinks she should split the money with me as it's because of me she got the opportunity to refer my now ex colleague. I feel split as one part of me is disappointed that she didn't bring this up. Today she was kind of bragging about the money and that she can buy this and that. Again, I didn't say anything. I really don't want to argue and I know money is such a sensitive topic for many people.

I posted this question in a different sub and I got really negative comments where even my husband got accused of turning me against my sister. But most were about me being an AH. So I'm asking here, am I really the AH for thinking we should split the money?

Edit: just to clarify. No one is risking anything with referrals here. Literally everyone I know who works in corporate got the job by referral. People even recommend complete strangers off of FB groups because they know they get better chance and the other party gets the money. I'm not saying it's right but this is the way everyone does around here. I got my job through referal by a complete stranger :D So did my sister. So no reputation or anything could get ruined here quite frankly. (We don't live in the US)",0.82
"AITA for not expecting to pay rent? My (26M) girlfriend's (27F) rental contract is expiring in a month and she is looking for a new place to live. Currently, she has 3 roommates, and she says that it is quite emotionally stressful ensuring that everyone is okay with me coming over since she does not want to upset or bother her roommates.

I don't live in the same city as her, so I need to take the railway to stay with her over the weekend.

She is currently looking at moving into a studio, so that I can visit without worrying about bothering her roommates. Also, it is proving difficult to find roommates that are happy with me coming over every weekend. However, this comes at a much higher rent.

She is proposing that I should contribute around $500 a month towards rent for a studio, since a large part of why she needs to pay for a studio is so that I can freely visit during the weekends. For reference, the total rent is $3000.

The logic makes sense, but part of me is uncomfortable with the situation. My individual lifestyle is relatively frugal, but I try my best not to cheap out on her by taking her to pricey restaurants and buying designer gifts. When she asked for me to pay rent, the additional cost was a bit difficult to accept, especially since I only stay over maybe 2 nights a week.

We were hanging out as boyfriends do and he asked if he should eat the scab he just picked off (I had made a joke about him eating the scab then he was like ""should I?""). I thought he was joking and I asked when is the last time he ate his scabs, and he said 'probably a few months ago.'

I told him that eating scabs is disgusting, and the exact same as eating boogers. I feel like I'm too old to be having this conversation.... I told him that he's a disgusting freak and he got all defensive and said it was normal. Am I crazy?? Am I supposed to be eating my scabs?? Should I have just let it go and not said anything? I kind don't wanna kiss him anymore. AITA?

\[EDIT\]: MY boyfriend knows I posted this, and he preread it and let me post it. We posted this to see who was in the right. It's all fun, I don't abuse my boyfriend",0.69
"AITA For Not letting my In-laws see my newborn the day he was born? For some back story, my wife and I had a 24 week pregnancy end in tragedy roughly two years before this story. This left us feeling very protective of our most recent pregnancy. Our son decided he wanted to wait until the last possible second to arrive so we were scheduled for an induction. The entire time we were in the hospital I was constantly getting bombarded by her parents with texts asking for updates on what was happening. I did my best to keep up with them until my wife got frustrated and told me to leave them on read. At roughly 7pm my wife gave birth to a beautiful baby boy and I could not have been happier. We let everyone know he was here and were immediately asked what room we were in so that her parents could come see him. We hadn’t even left the delivery room yet (no visitors allowed there) and told them that we were too tired for visitors that night. They constantly hounded us until we got to the maternity floor (around midnight) and we went to bed. We awoke to angry texts and voicemails from my FIL saying how disappointed he was that we were so selfish and careless for not letting them come see their grandson. My MIL even had the audacity to say “I might as well mourn this one too.” All of this gutted my wife as she had just pushed a human being out of her and she was already emotionally exhausted. For the remainder of our stay at the hospital they refused to come visit and wouldn’t talk to us no matter what we said. The attitude kept up for the first two weeks of our sons life until I forced a confrontation over the phone where we were berated for not keeping them updated enough, not letting them come invade our space at midnight in the hospital, and making her FIL waste a PTO day (my son was born after he would have gotten off work so it wouldn’t have made a difference.) In the end, I apologized just so my wife could stop stressing as it was affecting her recovery. So am I the asshole?",0.04
"WIBTA if I move away with the dog my ex and I got when we were together? My ex (M30)  and I (F30) broke up two years ago. We were together seven years. Well, not really broke up, more we stop spending time together, sometimes not even calling for months at a time, and it just naturally phased out. He started seeing a new girl, I focused on my career. 

While we didn't live together, his decision not mine, we adopted a mutt puppy, Scout, from a friend's accidental litter. I also had my childhood cat and they are now pretty much bonded. My ex's apartment didn't allow pets, so they lived full time with me.

As we broke up, he also stopped taking care of Scout. She was devastated and constantly waited for him at the door around the time he would come over to have dinner. I felt terrible and would call her, telling her that my ex was not coming. He promised to help, but never did. When the yearly registration came up, I told him I was going to register Scout with only my name unless he sent his half. He agreed for me to register under my name alone.

Eventually, I moved on too. I'm now dating an old friend of mine(M33). Scout adores him and he is right now her main caretaker while I work.

My job recently offered me a position in Mexico. The pay would be AMAZING and cost of living will be much lower. Plus, the area is where I have relatives. My boyfriend was ecstatic and we began looking for house to rent (or buy if the price is in our budget). 

We want something near the beach for Scout. She loves the water. This also gives us a chance to get something with a yard and maybe down the line getting another dog. 

Out of courtesy,  I messaged my ex to let him know when I was leaving. My ex congratulate me on the job and then asked when he could pick up Scout. I told him what he meant and he answered that if I was moving, he needed to take Scout to his current girlfriend.

I told him no, Scout was coming with me and my boyfriend. He got angry and told me I was stealing his dog. He even threatened to sue me. I reminded him we didn't pay for Scout and the vet bills were divided until two years ago when I started paying alone. As far as the records go, I'm Scout's sole owner.

His friends have been constantly harrassing me for stealing Scout. My friends are divided. I have no intentions to change my mind, but I feel a bit bad. Is it wrong for me to take Scout?",0.03
"AITA: for cursing out a driver who almost hit me and my dog **Me (19F) Driver (\~50M) My Dog (5F)**

I was walking my dog at around 3 PM today. Clear skies, very little traffic, the temperature was comfortable. We were crossing a big street but I felt safe doing so because the little white man was indicating that we could cross. As we're crossing the street, a car starts speeding towards us. I have 10 seconds left to cross and the stop light is still red, so I'm thinking this guy is going to slow down once he reaches the intersection. But of course, this is Florida, so why would he.

This man hard brakes past the intersection and nearly hits my dog and I because he was driving so fast up until the moment he stopped. I'm not exaggerating when I say he was one hair away from hitting us. My already very anxious dog is flabbergasted and I am pissed. The guy had his windows down so I yelled, ""Look where you're going b\*\*\*h. Stop trying to drag race, this isn't Miami Beach."" 

For context, I am from Miami, so I'm used to idiot drivers who street race on US1 during rush hour. But because I'm currently in a small town in North Florida, I've come to expect this a lot less. That's why the incident of terrible driving was a surprise and I reacted in anger. 

Apparently I offended the man (surprise surprise) and he starts cursing me out, mainly calling me a dramatic b\*\*\*h and an ugly wh\*\*re who needed to shut up. I was walking away and ignoring him until he started screaming insults about my dog. So, I turned around (did not walk towards him) to scream that he should crawl back into his mom's crater pu\*\*\* and never come out again. And then I walked away for good while he was driving away cursing me. 

I know this wasn't a mature response and he could have been strapped and road raged but this man really pissed me off and I honestly can't tell if I did overreact. To be fair, he didn't hit me but the adrenaline from almost being rammed by a Lincoln SUV triggered my hot-headedness. Am I the asshole for starting the scream match?",0.03
"WIBTA if I only put my parent’s names on the wedding invitation and not my fiancé’s parent’s names? I am drafting the wedding invitations, and I am struggling with the introduction. 

My parents are paying for the entire wedding ($15,000), and my fiancé’s parents are paying for the rehearsal dinner. Because of that I would like to recognize my parents by using the traditional introduction of “Mr. and Mrs. X request the pleasure of your company at the marriage of their daughter A to B.” 

However, I do not want to offend my fiancé’s parents and make it seem like I am excluding them. I am so grateful for what they are contributing both in finances and in support, so I am also considering “Mr. And Mrs. X and Mr. And Mrs. Y request the pleasure of your company at the marriage of A and B.” 

Because of the extreme disparity in contribution I would like to recognize my parents, but I don’t want to punish my fiancé’s family for their inability to contribute equally. What should I do?",0.6
"AITA for dumping my brother/roommate’s clean clothes on top of his dirty clothes? For context, I (25M) live in an apartment with my brother (29). However, we both have widely different work schedules so we don’t see each other that much, except on certain days off from work. He works a normal type of 9-5 job on weekdays whereas I work 5AM-1PM basically every day except on days off, which are random. So there’s not a whole lot of communication between us. 

Anyways, one thing that happens a lot is my brother uses the washer and dryer A LOT to clean his clothes. He likes to do little loads every two or three days. As for me, I prefer doing my laundry once a week, but it can be hard to actually find time when the washer and dryer are completely empty because my brother uses it so much. 

Anyways, today was my day off, so I decide that today is a good day to do my own laundry. I check to see if the washer and dryer are available. The washer is completely open, but the dryer still has clothes in it. Luckily, it’s the weekend and my brother is also home, so I say “Hey, I’m about to do a load of laundry, so can you move your clothes out soon so I can move mine from the washer to the dryer once they’re done?” He agrees so I start my load. About an hour goes by and I go back to the washer and dryer. The wash is done with my clothes but my brother hadn’t yet moved his clothes over.

I needed my clothes in the dryer basically right then and there because my work-clothes were in the washer and I needed them dry by tomorrow and I couldn’t wait because I have an early bed-time due to my job making me work SUPER early in the morning. My brother was actually watching a movie with friends online so I didn’t want to bother him. There was a clothes hamper on top of the dryer that was his and there were a few clothes in there. Since they weren’t in the wash earlier, I assumed that they were clean from an earlier load, so I took all my brothers clothes and put them in the hamper to make room for my clothes to go in the dryer. 

After I finished, my brother got up from his movie and stormed over and after taking a look, he got super pissed at me. He told me the clothes at the bottom of his hamper were dirty. I asked him why they were dirty and not in the washer when I came around when the washer was empty, but he didn’t answer. He stormed off with his clothes to his room. We haven’t spoken for the rest of the night. AITA?",0.05
"AITA for encouraging my sister to break into BIL's phone Obligatory on my phone, sorry if there are any issues. Long time lurker, first time poster.

Okay, quick background. I (f40s) have had a few conversations with my sister ""Angela"" (f40s) about her husband ""Anthony"" (m50s), specifically around some of his suspicious behaviour and unnatural attachment to his phone. 

Anthony has a personal phone and a work phone. He will occasionally leave his personal phone unattended but never his work phone. He does not have a job where he is on call and his work does not contact him on evenings or weekends. But he takes it with him everywhere, including the bathroom. He always follows my sister when she's on the phone and asks who she is speaking with (maybe I've been on Reddit too long but it seems like projection to me).

Anthony has previously been caught inappropriately texting another woman who is a member of a club he belongs to (my sister does not belong to the club). Nothing super racy but definitely suspicious. 

Angela has stated that she feels insecure and would like to have access to his phone. Anthony just brushes it off saying that she has nothing to worry about and won't let her near either phone. Suspicious.

Today he had to rush out in the morning and left his personal phone at home. Angela had a 20 minute window with the phone. She had already scoped out his access code so she checked it out and found that he had downloaded (and since deleted) several apps throughout their marriage including adult hookup, hot one night stands, threesome, bumble, secret photo vault, app vault private lock, focus vault and several other hookup apps. The last download was around a year ago.

I believe that he has deleted everything off his personal phone and is now using his work phone for these apps. I have encouraged her to find a way to separate him from his work phone and go through it to get solid evidence (photos, messages, etc) before confronting him. I believe that he will try to talk his way out of anything she found as it only shows that the apps were downloaded but have since been deleted (he's not super tech savvy and probably didn't realise that she could see the history of downloaded apps).

A friend told me that I shouldn't have encouraged her to look at his work phone I should leave them to their own issues. I understand the perspective but also, no one f#cks with my sister. AITA?

TL;DR: Sister has sus husband and I'm encouraging her to go through his work phone without his knowledge.",0.5
"AITA to Be Annoyed With My Friends as Much as I am? I’ll make this quick. I had friends, who are an engaged couple, visiting from another state a few weeks ago. I’ve known them for 8 and a half years. I’ve visited them multiple times and this is their second time coming to my state, the last time being in 2018. Both times, they were staying with relatives in a different town than me, but I moved since the last time they had came, so I invited them over to spend the night at my house (it’s my parent’s house really, but I pay towards the mortgage & what not) one of the nights they were here. I gave them a tour and all that, but I didn’t let them see my room. It’s just a fucking mess and I’m somewhat of a private person in some ways so I just didn’t want anyone in there. We’re close enough that they make jokes about me being shady and secretive in general, lol. They were *insisting* upon seeing it for some reason, like refused to take no for an answer and telling me they won’t judge if it’s messy or if I had weird items out or anything. I just kept telling them no, but maybe next time. For them, it was just the novelty of seeing it on top of the fact that the more I refused, the more they thought I was hiding shit and wanted to see the room. This was all at night. In the morning, I got up before them and we were hanging out in living room for a bit before leaving the house. 

At some point, when we were all getting ready, one of them quickly snuck into my room just to take a peek & even recorded it, I found out a little before they left when they told me. I was kind of surprised, honestly. Then a day or so later, I felt lowkey kind of violated. I know they didn’t rummage through my stuff or steal anything, but I had weirdly strong emotions toward the whole thing. It was the principle of them violating that boundary that really got to me. They usually FaceTime me at least twice a week, but I legit ignored all of their calls, as well as texts. I replied back to them at some point last week after ignoring them for nearly two weeks. I didn’t tell them why. Do you think I should tell them? Call me petty, but I kind of want them to wonder why I’m upset because they did a handful of other things that lowkey pissed me off when they visited as well, on top of this. Do you think I’m being reasonable to be as mad as I am?",0.12
"AITA for telling my husband I don’t want to hear about his annoying coworker? My husband (30) recently got a job at a pretty unprofessional company and since he got the job he was constantly coming home telling me about this girl at work doing funny things. The first few times didn’t bother me at all but he came home one day and was telling me how shocked he was that she wears a 4 1/2 SIZE SHOE!!! CRAZY!! if you’re a woman with a small foot you know that’s a 6.5… (relatively small, nothing crazy) so I told him like that’s pretty weird the way she was bragging about her foot size and using a kids size to make them seem smaller?… anyways I told him she sounds pretty annoying and I doubt any of the stories he’s gonna tell me of her are gonna entertain me at all. Btw she’s underage and I have no suspicions of my husband being a predator I just don’t care to hear about what the pick me girl at his job is doing to get everyone’s attention. As time goes on she is literally the only coworker he’s coming home and talking about, so I bluntly told him one day. I’m just pretending to care because you seem excited to tell me this stuff but to be honest it’s actually just annoying as f*** and I don’t wanna hear any more stories about her. He laid off for a while but today was telling me how she got in the f****** trash can at work and they were moving her around in it. I cut him off and said I actually REALLY don’t care. He said something about how he likes to talk about his day and sped off. I think if I was genuinely jealous or worried there would be bigger fish to fry. So aita and how do I go about this??",0.5
"AITA for not taking my child for the weekend? My ex wife and I coparent a beautiful 2 year old girl. There is no malice between us and we get along pretty well. We say hello to each other during drop offs and chat about things going on in our lives, normal coparenting stuff.

My husband who is a veteran and going to school full-time uses his GI Bill that allows him to go to school as a full-time job. He also has 100% disability (whoever knows about the VA Disability KNOWS) and since I’m not working this month well , all we have is his income. I do have my business on the side that makes money so we are stable for the month of February . However, spring semester starts tomorrow at our nearby community college. He can go to his first classes of course since I am schedule for later evening Monday, but the following day he also has a set of new classes that he needs to be present, or else he gets dropped. We have been arguing back and forth that he cannot miss Tuesday since he NEEDS to go to SCHOOL. Which I totally understand but what is most important myself and daughter who may be an over night inductions and he feels the need to be gone, and prefers my mother to be present while he is gone. I told him he can simply message his professors and explain to them about me being and labor and possibly be excused, but he says he CANT MISS and has to be gone the next day. We have had heated arguments and he keeps bringing up, the idea he won’t be there and I need to suck it up, since he needs to make money, and my mother will have to replace him during our daughters birth .

"AITA for wanting to know where my husband is My husband and I have been married 10 years and have a 2 year old. My inlaws and I have never ""clicked"" we have never had any words, but it's just one of those things where I'm ignored completely by his sister and his mom really doesn't like engaging with me either. He is told oldest son and the ""hero"" in the family. Meaning when people have problems they always come to him.
It is a known fact that his sister doesn't like me even though she hasn't come right out and said it to my face so my family is never invited to her house and we also do not invite her to our house. Her birthday was a few days ago, my husband works a few blocks away from her house. He texted me last minute at the end of the day and said he got stuck in a meeting. He arrived home an hour and a half late from his usual time. I had a feeling that he wasn't still at work because he never gets stuck that late. I asked him if his mom came into town to see his sister for her birthday he said he was not aware of her coming into town. Yet, when I texted his mom and asked the next time she was coming into town she had said she had been in town for 2 days earlier this week. I told her I'm glad she got to spend time with my husband. She said ""me too!""

 So aita for wanting my husband to tell me the truth about where he is? Even if I don't care for his family and they don't care for me, they are still his family. But I think he should tell the truth. He still hasn't admitted that he was there even though his mom told me he was!",0.42
"AITA? My boyfriends mom lives in filth and I can't stand it anymore. I 20F known my boyfriend 20M since we were 11, we met online through gaming and never met in person until September when I moved in with him, his mom, and sister. I was really excited to finally be with him in person so I didn't care where we were until I got here and the house reeked of animal feces and urine and I seen the flies/gnats and spiders and their webs EVERYWHERE I would constantly get bit in my sleep and had itchy welts all over. I have to tiptoe through the house for multiple reasons. 1. Dogs bark at EVERY noise they hear like Turning a door handle etc. 2. His mother gets mad when dogs bark so leaving the room at night is not an option. 3. There is animal extremists all over the floors, counters, stove etc.. and his mother only let's the dogs outside to use the bathroom as a ""treat"" once in a blue moon so potty pads line the house. Those don't help much for the counters and the dogs go anywhere they please anyway so do the cats. The tub is filled with bags of dirty clothes because the washer is in the basement surrounded by cobwebs and the whole place is riddled with bugs of every kind. His mother has stolen money and cigarettes from me multiple times and manipulates everyone around her, especially my boyfriend.  His sister uses so much toilet paper that a 12 pack will last less than a week so hoarding it is necessary for me. And to make matters worse she not only puts it in the trashcan instead of the toilet but the toilet gets stuck a lot and only me and my boyfriend unclog it so there will just be pee and poop sitting in it until one of us plunges it.. we have a SCRAPER to scrape the floors of hardened animal poop because she let's it sit there so long it gets stuck to the floor.. I've brought up to my boyfriend that I want to find a cleaner place because it's beyond saving at this point but everytime I do he brushes it off because he doesn't want to leave them here, so I suggested we all find a place but his mother refuses.

"AITA for stealing from my boyfriend? My boyfriend and I like to smoke pot. We’ve been together for 9 years now for some context.. also! Weed is legal where we are so it’s not a big deal. 
My boyfriend has a lot of bud in his basement. Sometimes I ask to get some and he says yes. He has cameras down there and he can see me take the bud. 

He went away on a snowboarding trip with his brothers and his mom asked if I could feed and walk their dogs (his parents are away for 3 months). 

Well… lately I’ve been going through a really tough time with bills. I also have two cats (one is his but he lives at home with his parents) living with me and their food can get pricey. I pay all my bills on my own, and the IRS is after me for unpaid taxes because I guess I never did my taxes correctly and didn’t know how/what/when/where to do anything so I have to pay all this debt and I am super stressed. My boyfriend always tells me he will help me with bills but never does. He makes triple what I make, and can easily help me but he likes to buy cars (he has like 5), and bud, and go on trips and buy random splurge things for himself so he never really waaannntttssss to help… you know? He isn’t obligated to help so I don’t complain. It’s not a big deal. 

Anyway, he came home and looked at his cameras to make sure his friend didn’t steal from him. He ended up seeing me take a good amount of bud & now he wants me to send him 500$ because he said I went down there multiple times to steal. His anger was making him forget that he allows me to take bud when I ask! The only time I took anything was when he was away. I was going to sell it to a friend to collect money for my bills. Now he is telling me to go die, he broke up with me, he’s threatening to take my cat away, along with his cat that he never sees and doesn’t take care of, and he’s threatening to call the cops on me because I am on video stealing his weed. I apologized to him, and I told him that I still have the bud, I didn’t touch it. I also didn’t sell it, but I was going to. He told me he was gonna give me $500 this morning, so I did feel a little bad for taking the bud last night. He always says he’s going to do things, but never does them. Especially when it comes to money… or help with money. He wants me to send him $500, but I only have $300 in my bank account. I get paid this Thursday coming up, and he wants me to send him the rest of the money from my bank account.

Am I the asshole for going down to his weed room and taking bud while he was away? I took a good amount… I wanted to sell it because the irs and collections are coming after me and I’m scared I’m going to go to jail. I’m not sure, I am scared! he blocked me on everything, he told me to drop his Xbox off and his clothes off at his parents house before I go to work in the morning. He kind of always breaks up with me, but I feel like this time he’s for real.

Hes a good dog and hes house trained but he destroys pillows and stuffed things so I dont let him roam around unsupervised . In comes his sister . She has been talking about how she wants him to be able to come and go as he pleases but I dont want him to destroy their things so unless someone watches him I keep him in our room . He doesnt mind it and usually just lays in the bed or in one of our laps . When Im gone though he whines and they think its because he wants to be let out . Its actually because he has seperation anxiety . It doesnt matter where he is if im not there he whines a bit and if im in the next room he will just whine at the door till I come back . Flash forward to this morning when the sister and I were talking she says ""You cant keep him in your room , you need to let him roam."" When I explain why she just responds with ,"" Well you still cant.""

This pissed me off . My dog is happy , with a full belly , and well taken care of.

"AITA for wanting to fight with my grandfather and uncles because they’re leaving my father’s name out of the inheritance? Hello, my grandfather is writing his will. The only asset he has is the family’s house. Out of sheer pettiness, he’s not including my father’s name in his will in terms of getting inheritance money while his other children (he has 6 children including my father, 5 sons, 1 daughter) will. This is upsetting because for the past 10 years, DECADE, my father was paying for the family house mortgage as he was the most financially successful out of his siblings. But, COVID affected my father’s business horribly, and my family truly isn’t as wealthy as before and is surviving barely enough. Hence, why my father can’t afford to send money to my grandparents anymore.

However, my parents have shared their efforts on social media to promote their new small business in hopes of generating more income for the household. Apparently, this sparked a lot of discourse amongst my father’s side as they believed my family,  “seemed to do better” or “they’re rich again”— showing their desire to depend shamelessly more on my father again. They tried to reach out to my father regarding this but my father refused, resulting in this petty dispute.

What’s more, the youngest son is manipulating and persuading my grandfather to not let my father get even a cent of the inheritance because “he’s not paying for the house anymore”. 

As my father’s daughter, i’m just absolutely at loss over how shameless this family is. My father had financially shared his wealth not just to my grandparents but also his siblings by giving them job opportunities at his (now-defunct) company. My father doesn’t know yet of this information, only me and my mother.

Half of the 600?  Or half of the 1200?  And if I'm out of work and my trust or sugardaddy or assistance pays all of it does that make him able to pay 0?  And let's clarify he doesn't live here like he's an ex. He takes full advantages of any and all perks of living with me.  He gets his clothes washed  meals cooked etc ...and I buy the all the detergents and most the groceries so why this is even a question to me is ridiculous.",0.74
"AITA for telling my mother to stop calling me my childhood nickname name, Peanut. I am 36. She even does it in public. She does not call my younger brother of 2 years by his childhood nickname, Moose.

"AITA for canceling my old bf Am I the asshole (if) for spreading rumors about my ex (when we agreed not to) if he did it first? My ex and me of 2 years broke up a few months ago, we promised not to talk negatively since we have the same friend group. I recently find out he had told people I would be controlling, and off myself if We broke up , which is completely false, context: he use to be a drug user and wanted to change , so I helped “controlling”. During our relationship I had a horrible relationship with my mother, abusive, and I had depression. My ex turned my depression and thoughts about him, and not my mother.

"AITA for telling my gfs sister to split rent 1/3 My gf(20), her sister(18) and I(21) just got approved and began moving into our new apartment. Splitting a 2x2 where me and my gf have one room and her sister gets the other room. I make $19 an hour while my gf makes $17. Her sister was making $13 an hour so before moving we looked at rent prices and had an idea of her sister paying slightly less than us to accommodate for her income. 

Her sister later quit her job due to multiple reasons within the workplace and I helped her apply to my job where they start out at $18.50. During this process we got approved and began moving into the apartment. My gf and her sister had a severe argument with each other when my gf told her sister that she would now need to pay 1/3 evenly since we all are making generally a similar amount. 

Disclaimer: while looking at prices online (not accurate until actual move in) we saw $1800 listed, and said in conversation that we could have her sister pay $500 a month while me and my gf split the rest 50/50, but this was not confirmed, shook on, or written on paper. The apartment is $1900 a month and her sister has over $10,000 in savings(while we don’t have any savings)  on top of applying for the new job. 

My gf and I feel that because her sister will be making significantly more than before that we should now split the rent evenly 3 ways. However her sister is adamant that the original idea of her only paying $500 was the final decision. 

Please let me know your thoughts on this matter and how we should proceed",0.17
"AITA for threatening legal action? Hello everyone. I have been struggling with this for some time and honestly am having a hard time right now. I (27, agender) have been rubbed the wrong way by an older man who is a part of a volunteer organization that I am in. We are in a DEI board together and when I tell you it has been a nightmare it’s not even the half of it. He has consistently emailed things that have been transphobic, racist, and homophobic all in the name of viewpoint diversity, the right to debate, scientific beliefs, and religious beliefs. All that we have been trying to do is come to an agreement on a code of conduct document for our regular meetings. I am open about being agender and often have my pronouns listed in our zoom meetings. No one else is openly queer in any way so it appears to be just me who is being targeted.
 He has sent so many emails that I just don’t think there is space for all of the micro-aggressions here so I will highlight a few. He has claimed that “transphobe” is a slur. He shared that he does not respect people who use pronouns that “don’t match their biology” referring to non-binary people directly, and stated that marriage is between a man and a woman. I sent an email stated my uncomfortableness and asked that he think about the words he is using. He then called that a “tactic” that DEI advocates use. I stayed silent for a while until he continued to discuss “biology” and how trans and gay people were against his “sincerely held beliefs”. He frequently refers to the LGBTQIA+ community as GLBT and refers to the community as p*dos. This has been especially triggering for me.
I shared a private email with him that I was no longer going to be having this discussion. I shared that his words have been discriminatory, defamatory, and have caused great emotional distress. He proceeded to reply to my email by replying to everyone telling them what I said, stating that I was playing the victim and being discriminatory against his beliefs.
 Because he has been doing this for so long and because he has refused to back down I emailed one last time stating that if he continues in this fashion he will be hearing from my lawyer. I blocked his email but obviously I can still see them coming in. He is still going on about how I am not being inclusive by not allowing him to debate and/or speak his mind. I feel like an asshole for threatening legal action but at this point I am experiencing heightened stress and PTSD because of this guy.
 Now you are probably wondering why I haven’t left the board. I have tried but the volunteer organization that this committee is under keeps saying they are “working on it” and have asked me to hold on as they consider me a valued member. 
 I’m really trying to keep myself in check and often find myself second guessing if I am truly the one being discriminatory for being upset. I honestly don’t know what to do here or what to do next. So, am I the asshole?",0.24
"AITA for not leaving to go with my army husband? Long story short i got inherited a house on native lands here in Hawaii(i’m half native), my husband hates the politics of this state and wants to move to Texas(using the military to help him go there), he was born and raised here, my house is paid off, i cant rent it out since it’s supposed to be for natives only. He keeps convincing me of the pros like bah will pay for housing in the mainland. I myself don’t want to go to the mainland at all as I don’t see myself being compatible with the way of life as it would be a big change, but he then say i can be a housewife up there and not deal with the outside, and yes we have a kid in all of this. I asked him we could do long distance and he can come visit but he said he doesnt want to come back just to visit me and his kid, I told him I’d probably be very depressed up there and probably long for home and that i’d like to be brought back when he’s done with his career. He called me selfish to not think of his happiness and my daughter and that she’d grow up without a father.",0.17
"AITA for getting mad at my stepsister for letting our house get robbed? My family's lives got thrown into chaos three months ago when my mom got arrested for some financial-related crimes. She's probably going away for the next 3 years, we're losing our house, and her and my stepfather are getting divorced. There's no good timing for any of this, but it's especially bad now because I'm in college on the other side of the country, my stepfather isn't even in the country right now (deployed), and my only sibling, my stepsister Stacey, only just turned 17. 

By the time my mom realized she couldn't even make bond, I only had three weeks until winter break, so we agreed that it would be okay for me to keep my original flight back while things were still being sorted out. We decided that I'm going to take a semester off school to help out until everything is settled. Obviously it wasn't ideal to have Stacey hold down the fort for that long, but it's not illegal. 

The bills were paid and everything, so all she had to do was breathe and not burn the house down. She did not do that. She decided that all this meant that she could do whatever she wanted, and moved in with her boyfriend without telling anyone. The house went unattended, and of course, we got robbed. They cleaned the place out. Anything of value that was left after the raid is gone, including basically all of my stuff. 

That's what I came home to. I immediately called Stacey, but she blocked my number. I only know where she went through social media and she wouldn't respond to messages there, so I had to start posting about all of this on Facebook to get her to respond, and now I'm getting shit for blaming her and ""putting too much on a child"". 

I'm expecting too much? On top of having to drop out of school temporarily and everything else I'm responsible for, including probably ending up her guardian, I now have to replace anything I didn't take to college with me and immediately scramble for housing. My only expectation of her was to not just fucking vanish for THREE WEEKS! That was her only responsibility, and she just bailed. Her being a minor makes her actions worse in my opinion because it's not even legal for her to decide that she just wants to live on her own now. She was legally required to stay there because our parents told her to. I don't think I'm required to pretend she was just an angel to talk about it.",0.5
"AITA for asking my bf to leave after he told my mom/family to STFU? I (35f) and my boyfriend (34m) have had a rough on and off relationship over the last 3 years because of situations like this. We went out to breakfast and did some shopping Saturday morning as a family. This included my daughter (14f) from a previous relationship and our daughter (8months). We got home and I began to unload the baby and the bags while he went and watched tv in the living room. Important to not that my mom lives with me as she is terminally ill and disabled and unable to live on her own. Because of this she doesn’t do much other than watch tv as she has mobility and vision issues. She had woken up when we got home and I brought her in the living room and got her situated. A few minutes later we were all in the living room and I was on the floor playing with our youngest. My mom was trying to talk to my boyfriend and asking him questions about what he was watching. I know this can be annoying as my mother has done this to me my whole life especially when I am reading but she doesn’t have ill intentions behind it, just an older woman whose lonely and likes to chat. My boyfriend however got frustrated and threw the remote on the other couch and stood up in the living room declaring that we can see he’s trying to watch something and it would be a lot easier if everyone just shut the f*ck up and then stormed out of the room. My mom immediately started crying asking what she did wrong, my oldest daughter looked at me like omg is he serious? Our baby just looked startled. She does not like yelling or loud sounds. I went in the other room and asked him what his problem was and why he thought it was ok to talk to my mother like that or anyone for that matter? He made excuses and basically tried convincing me it was justified and acted like he did nothing wrong. This is not the first time he’s been disrespectful towards me, my friends, or my family. I told him that I didn’t want him in my house unless he apologized to my mother. This set him off and he started yelling at me. It’s important to note he does not live here. I’m not kicking him out of his house. He left and then texted me saying we’re done. This isn’t new he breaks up with me once a month. I guess what I’m asking is AITA for saying I didn’t want him in my house unless he apologized to my mother?",0.62
"AITA for not wanting to trade gifts with my best friend? So my best friend (I'll call her Jane) and I recently quit our part-time jobs at this small business near us. Our boss knew we both liked reading and got us a book each as a little 'goodbye' present. The book I got, neither of us had read before whereas the book Jane got, she had read before but I had not.

Jane and I discussed this together and eventually she said we could swap books so we could both have something we'd never read before. I told her I didn't want to swap. I'd seen the book that she was given around in some shops and it didn't look like my sort of thing at all. She tried to insist that I would enjoy it but I really just didn't want to swap. She promised that if I gave her my book I could borrow it whenever, but I still refused.

After a bit of back and forth about this, Jane ended up just giving me her book and storming off. Since this has happened I have read both the books and did genuinely enjoy the one she was given (although I still preferred the one I got). I was going to try and offer the book I got to her so she could borrow and read it, but whenever I bring up the topic she goes all moody and says we don't need to talk about 'how selfish' I am.

"AITA for getting mad? Hey, I (29y m) and my partner (27y F) are pregnant, 10+5. W right there. 

Anyway. We ordered a homedoppler to listen to baby's heartbeat. We decided to do it together, and we have, failed to hear it. We tried 3 times last week. (I know it's too early to even use the thing)

Well. We got into an argument yesterday, which ended her sleeping on the couch. 

Well come this morning, and we are still giving eachothers the silent treatment, and I left to school. 

While at school I got a text saying she felt some movement and pinching in the stomach so she decided to use the doppler, and found the heartbeat. 

Now I'm fucking pissed to have missed ""the first"" beat of our unborn child. 

AITA here for getting mad? 

TLDR: Bought a doppler, didn't hear heartbeat, got into a argument, she found it without me.

Edit: The heartbeat happened this morning, not yesterday. I got mad today cause the heartbeat was found today. The reason she tested the doppler alone Today was becouse yesterday's arguments

Edit2: Went home for a lunch break, listened to the heartbeat together. The galloping I heard made me realize how stupid this whole thing was.

"AITA for telling nosy coworkers to mind their business? I work in a warehouse and the vibe is generally sadistic and toxic. Since everyone is in a low vibration state of misery their day seems to be elevated by seeing someone screw up or have an epic fail and then it's stupid shit to gossip and talk about. But 99% of people suck so it's to be expected. 

So I screwed up because I banged a loaded pallet jack into a rack while trying to get out of the way of this kid who was riding my ass. Kid thought it was funny too. It fucked up all the shit I had stacked but because everything is timed I didn't have time to stop and readjust it. Drop it off and lo and behold 5 minutes later i get called back because they didn't like how it looked. 

Then this other kid comes waltzing over a big grin on his face and he goes ""what the fuck is up with that pallet?"" and I'm in the middle of rushing to throw shit off of it so that I don't screw up my own time. I tell him what happened and he goes ""who was it? younger guy older guy?"" And my mind kinda is like I know what you're trying to to do, you're trying to bait me into talking shit so you can go parrot what I said to someone else. So I kinda tweak and say it's none of your business bro don't worry about it. For context this same kid has been in my business since I started, has a habit of interrupting me whenever I talk, and is always trying to make me feel as if I'm going to get fired to instill primal fear so he can feel big in his tiny kingdom. 

But he is obviously thin skinned and gets all pissed off when I finally assert a boundary that is for the protection of my own rep at work (or so I thought), stomps off, and spends the rest of the day being demonstrative whenever he is around me, as if I broke the wall of his illusion that you can just use people as an ATM for info to further slander them. It backfired too because I think he then told other people I got pissed and now I'm sure I'm going to known and hated as the guy with a ""temper.""

"AITA for playing video games when I’ve finished cleaning? I live with my girlfriend and on a weekend we will clean the full apartment. We both have specific chores that we complete. 

I tend to finish first and have asked my girlfriend if she wants any help with hers but she always refused since she likes to do things her way. She was the same when living at home, if her mum did the chores my girlfriend does, she would redo them her way.

I clean the bedroom, office and kitchen and I vacuum the apartment. My girlfriend cleans the bathroom and living room and dusts the apartment. I finished my chores this weekend and then put tv on and started playing a video game.

She walks past the living room and comments “that must be nice”. I asked what she meant and she said it was bullshit that she was still sat cleaning and I was relaxing playing games. I said I can’t help finishing first and that she likes to do her chores her way so what exactly was I supposed to do.

"AITA for always joining in with my fiancé's mom and sisters for mother/daughter days? I (24f) am engaged to Jace (25m). We met in college 6 years ago and we quickly fell in love. I met his family, who are all so nice, and quickly bonded really well with them. His family are aware that I do not have that kind of closeness with my own family. And that there has always been a feeling of sadness for me when I think about my biological family.

I was the youngest of four and the only girl. A lot of people assumed when they saw me with my family that my mom really wanted a daughter and kept trying for one until she got me. They assumed I was the treasured baby sister who had big brothers and a dad who looked out for her and protected her. But my mom only wanted boys. I was an unhappy accident when my dad's vasectomy failed. Mom prepared for another boy and got me. She heavily favored my brothers and they took after her in mostly ignoring me. I wasn't neglected physically but emotionally I was. My dad was always working. He wasn't really home during the day time during the week and when he was home, he was either tired or busy working on projects around the house. He was slightly more attentive than my mom was. But only just. My brothers would often say it was just the three of them, my mom referred to herself as a ""boy mom"" and never did anything mother/daughter with me. As a young kid I cut my hair up short to look more like a boy and I dressed in boys clothes. Mom would roll her eyes at me and dismiss me. My dad would sometimes yell at mom if she took my brothers out without me but he would never try to make it up to me by doing stuff with me. He was also mad when my brothers and mom didn't show for my high school graduation.

I speak to my dad occasionally but haven't heard anything from my mom or brothers in 5 years. Jace and his family expected to meet them at some point when families were visiting college but nobody showed up for me. Jace's family basically adopted me from that point, I feel like.

Now that we're both done with college and we're engaged, we live close to Jace's family. His mom and sisters do monthly mother/daughter days and I'm always included/invited. I was even invited when we'd stop by for quick visits previous years. But now that we're living here they always include me.

His mom's sisters find it weird and they have accused me of inserting myself where I don't belong and getting in the way of the true mother/daughter bonding. They told me I should be letting the others enjoy the day without a daughter in-law being included, because I'm not really her daughter or their sister. Jace's mom disagrees but the issue has caused trouble between her and her sisters and my future SILs and their aunts. The aunts told me deep down SILs resent me for being so present during their time with their mom and they simply don't say it.

"AITA for telling my friend he is narrow minded for not wearing a rainbow-themed top?  I'm a 23-year-old female, and my best friend is also 23 M. We were getting ready to go out to a club when I noticed he was hesitating about wearing a black Thrasher t-shirt with rainbow outlines on the logo. Idk if anyone knows which one I'm talking about. He expressed concern that it might give off the wrong impression to girls, making them think he's gay. He often goes clubbing to pull girls which I'm fine with but I felt his comment was a bit narrow-minded.

I gently reminded him that wearing a shirt with rainbow designs doesn't automatically mean someone is gay. I explained that many people wear rainbow-themed clothing as a sign of support for the LGBTQ+ community or simply because they like the design. I said a rainbow is literally just a set of colours blended together and he is overthinking it. I emphasized that his worries were based on outdated stereotypes and that people shouldn't judge someone's sexual orientation based on their clothing choices. He disagreed and said that I don't understand him from a ""guy's perspective."" 

I told him that his concerns were insensitive and narrow-minded. By assuming that wearing a shirt with rainbow outlines would immediately label him as gay, he was perpetuating harmful stereotypes and contributing to the stigmatization of LGBTQ+ individuals.

"AITA for telling my BIL it’s not because of land lords he can’t afford a house and it’s because he’s lazy and not very smart? We watched the Super Bowl at my fiance’s parent’s house with her entire family. At some point, the conversation turned to how he and his wife wants to buy a house and start a family but they can’t find one in their price range that they like. This turned into her family talking about how expensive houses are which turned into them talking about how landlords are buying up houses which inflate the price. He made some low key remarks about me since I own and rent out a dozen houses.

I didn’t go to college and started working in construction right out of HS. Over time, I started my own fencing company then took on roofing until today where I’m a general contractor. The first house I got was when a housing developer didn’t have enough cash to completely pay me so we made a deal where he sold an empty lot in the back of that development to me for cheap. I built a house on it and lived in it until I decided to rent it out. Over the years, I built most of the other houses in my portfolio using mostly surplus materials and during slow times to keep my men busy. Some houses I bought out of foreclosure or condemnation and fixed or tore completely down and rebuilt. The point is I had to work hard for everything I have.

I was silent for most of the night until he said that landlords should all go to jail for price gouging during a time when most can’t afford houses. That set me off and I said that it’s funny a HS graduate can own a dozen houses while 2 married people with masters in education degrees can’t afford to buy 1 house. This started an argument where they called me a leech on society and I called them lazy for taking the summers off instead of getting a summer job. I said their students work harder than they do. My fiance pulled me out of the house and the night ended in shouting and me telling them that their precious masters must not be very hard to get because they’re too stupid to know basic economics.

My fiance and I argued all the way home. The short of it is she said I was out of line and need to apologize to her family and especially her brother and his wife. I don’t think I have to since they all made low key remarks about me all night. She argues that they made remarks about landlords and never brought up my name and that I was too sensitive.

"AITA at blowing up at my family about unequal treatment? Long time lurker, first time poster. 

For a bit of back story - myself (F21), and my long term partner (M22) had recently bought our first unit in mid-November after working full time straight out of school for the past 3 years. This was a definite decision to not go to University as I didn’t want debt (and wanted to buy a house - this is important later). We also chose to live with my parent for the last 3 years, rather than moving out and renting like most our age.

My sibling, (23), chose a different path - moving out with an ex into a share house at 19, (knowing they were unable to afford this and relying on money from parents), and also going to uni and completing and enrolling in several degrees (racking up a tonne of debt).

Now to the issue - after 3 years of living at home and working our asses off to save a deposit on our unit, my sibling - who has no savings and has never worked a full time job in their life - has now decided they too want and deserve a unit! Please be advised that I was not offered this option, because God knows I would’ve taken it rather than slaving away for 3 years and missing out on University.

My parents have given into this, and have offered a great sum of money on a single bedroom unit for my sibling, and have had this offer accepted today. This has essentially caused me to lose my shit. I am aware I am supposed to be happy for my family, but I cannot see past my anger at not only my sibling for getting everything given to them, but also my parents for enabling this behaviour. 

I lost it at everyone, and whilst my parents understand where I am coming from - they are insisting that I suck it up. They are saying that I must be deeply unhappy with my own life, and need to understand that my sibling will stay in this home forever and never go into bigger and better things, unlike myself (their words not mine).

This whole situation has caused such a large rift in my relationship with my parents and sibling. I genuinely cannot be in the same room as them. 

I am coming to you all, desperately seeking advice and whether or not I am the asshole in this situation. Should I just let this go and live on with my life? I genuinely do not know how to move past this and listen to my sibling talk about how excited they are for this unit without losing my shit.",0.17

I go to 90% of them but when I miss one my husband acts like I have missed all of them and complains I don’t ever hang out with his mom.

"AITA for not letting my child read Harry Potter I (48 F) recently grappled with a moral dilemma concerning my child (10 M) and their interest in the Harry Potter series, which raised concerns about the potential impact of these books.

All too often, evil characters have unique and menacing facial descriptions. Voldemort SPOILER: (the main antagonist of the series) has pale skin, a chalk-white, skull-like face, snake-like slits for nostrils, red eyes, and cat-like slits for pupils. The Dursleys are described as fat, with small beady eyes. Umbridge SPOILER (the most vile person in the books) is described with a broad, flabby face, a wide mouth, and bulging pouchy eyes. Even Sirius Black, at the beginning of PoA, is described as a man with long, matted, and dark hair that falls over his face with sharp features, including a pointed nose and a thin mouth. All of the antagonists have oddly specific, evil face descriptions. They are also usually compared to animals like snakes, toads, and dogs. The issue revolves around the negative connotations associated with physiognomy, a practice where character traits are assumed based on facial features. There is no way to know what type of person someone is based on their facial features, and too much of Harry Potter affirms outward appearances and inward evil. Harry Potter

"AITA for not telling my family I could cook and letting them embarrass themselves in front of my ILs? Growing up as the youngest in my family, I (27f) was often treated like I was a little princess who couldn't do anything for myself, which was aided by the fact I was a very clumsy child and some things took me a lot of practice and patience to get right. I was the butt of the joke and my family loved to tease me and crack jokes about the fact I couldn't boil water or I was a disaster everywhere I went. They would always say I could never be trusted in a kitchen and would need to find a man who could cook and clean for me in the future. It was something I resented and it did make me feel self-conscious. I would try really hard to not mess up but somehow I always seemed to.

Moving out to attend college was the best thing I ever did. I met so many great people, including my husband, and I thrived in an environment where nobody was making fun of me. One of my friends was in culinary school and she taught me a lot of cooking skills that I could use in my day to day life. She was really patient and suggested that I might have something like dyspraxia. She recognized some of my difficulties as being similar to her brothers. Sure enough, I went to my doctor and she referred me to specialists to help diagnose me. I have a milder form which is why it was never brought to attention enough. I just looked like I was careless or clumsy as a kid.

I didn't see or speak to my family a lot during this time. When I did it was awkward. My husband (then boyfriend) would come with me sometimes and he was always so annoyed by the jokes they'd make about me. When we got married... we actually eloped while on vacation overseas with his family. It was amazing and made for a much less stressful wedding. My family and my ILs had seen each other once or twice before but briefly. So when my family decided they wanted to come and see me and stayed for a weekend (in a hotel) we decided to host both families. And I cooked. But we didn't announce that until my parents had started making their little jokes and crediting only my husband for the food and the cleanliness or our home. My ILs were aware of how my family act but they didn't realize how little they believed in me. My husband giddily informed my family, after they had really made asses of themselves, that I had cooked the whole meal and that we shared those responsibilities. He said the same thing goes for the cleaning. My family were like no she can't but my ILs said I was cooking almost as long as they knew me and I did a good job every time. My MIL mentioned my diagnosis and my dad told her they thought I was just trying to make excuses. My family were awkward and my ILs left with a better understanding of my family and a nice dose of anger at them for how far they were going to humiliate me in front of them.

My family were also pissed off at me for not explaining things better beforehand. Not the condition but the fact I do cook now and could do it. They said I tried to humiliate them out of pettiness. AITA?",0.08
"AITA for stating my mom’s obvious favouritism? I (16F) was asked by my mom (44F) if the buffet we were at was good, for context we were invited there by a family member in celebration of têt. I am a hard oyster enjoyer so I asked if they had any, my mom replied with “of course” I walked in with high hopes of enjoying a nice dinner with family, but after circling the entire buffet three times for the raw oysters I found nothing, of course that’s not the reason I’m angry for that would be immature of me. I settled without the oysters and settled for a macron, sushi and salmon sashimi, the sashimi was grey, the sushi had a weird sour sauce and the macron was way too sweet. i then went for another plate, mind you it is now 7-8 pm and all i’ve had is a spam sandwich and an onigiri that morning, the Alfredo was cold, the fries had a weird powder on them, and the broccoli was cold. i didn’t eat it obviously and thats when my mother asked what was wrong with my food. i told her exactly what i just told you, the broccoli was cold, etc. my mother then said i was being rude for saying how bad the food was in front of the family member who invited us, after saying this she continued to complain to her sister in law, brother, mother, basically everyone at our table except the family who invited us how inedible the food was. leaving the buffet my mother continued to consult me about my rude behaviour, at this point i start getting annoyed but ignore it. Three days pass at this time I i forgot all of this and thought it was behind us, i mean i was three days ago right? No before walking out the door to go out with family my mother decided that this would be the perfect time to remind me of how “disrespectful i was” she told me that if i don’t like a place don’t say it so bluntly, at this point i’m tired i tell her that i wasn’t even talking that loudly and wasn’t even that rude, that all i said was that i didn’t like the food, she then went on about how my little sisters weren’t complaining but i was RIGHT next to them and the one she’s comparing me to was right next to me talking out loud about how bad the food was and yet my mom was continuing to say that she was doing nothing wrong, even the sister who was right next to me came to my side. While sitting at a completely different diner with my family my aunt and uncle who were just sitting across from me decide to switch seats with the two little ones, thats when my mom decides to tell me that the reason they switched was cause they’re scarred of me and my attitude.

"AITA for finding my partner’s Birthday gift thanks to an AI tool? For my girlfriend’s birthday, I turned to this AI tool called Giftruly to help me find the perfect gift. She really loved the gift but when she found out I used AI, she seemed disappointed, feeling like it wasn't as personal.

The AI relied on the information I gave it to find the gift idea, it still required some thinking on my side. I saw it more as a way to become aware of items that I simply didn’t know about.

I thought I was being clever, but now I'm second-guessing myself. AITA for using AI instead of just trying to find a gift by myself even though I would probably have picked something less good?",0.93
"AITAH for telling roommate his parents need to stop coming over all the time So my roommate and I are both in college and literally every weekend, his parents come over and spend the night. We are only 1 hour away from their house and my roommate is paying for all of his own living expenses, as am I. Every weekend I walk into my apt and there are his parents just sitting in our living room area watching TV for 8 hours at a time. At night they always come up with some excuse to stay and end up staying all weekend. Then Sunday night comes and they go back home, just to return again the following Friday afternoon.

"AITA I’m thinking of cheating due to my wife’s disability I’ve been with my wife for 14 years now and for the last 7 years we have not had sex.

Background:

• My wife was diagnosed with MS 10 years ago, her condition is deteriorating, she’s in pain, constantly.

• Having sex can be a painful activity to her due to the above

• I love her very much and would never leave her, I want to look after her, even when things get worse (which it will)

• I’m in my late 30s and have a high libido, currently my only resort is masturbation

• It’s not just sex I miss, hikes, camping outdoors and long walks after a nice meal with my loved one

• I have tried to have a discussion with her, she doesn’t want to hear it and she said, “ I would’ve done the same for you, if the circumstances reversed, so I should stick around without any change”

I know she would, she’s the best person I have ever met! But at the same time, I’m missing out in my life too?

"AITA for calling animal control on my roomate? My Roomate and I moved in together in November of 2023. The first week we were moved in, he got a dog. 

The problem first started with him not potty training his dog. So the dog would poop and pee all over the house and the carpet. I had a talk with him about it and he said he’d be on top of his dog more. Instead of potty training his dog, he decided to keep him in a room downstairs. That’s where shit literally hit the fan. 

My Roomate would keep his dog in that room for hours on end without feeding or taking him out to the bathroom. My Roomate works nights. In the mornings when he comes home, he wouldn’t ever check on his dog, instead I would hear him go straight to his room. He would leave days worth of poo just to sit and marinate.

As a result, his lack of care for his dog made the entire house smell. Bad. I had a conversation with him about this and he said he’d be on top of his dog more. That never happened

This had now been going on for 3 months now until I finally called animal control. They came, took his name and number down, and said they’d continue to follow up weekly. 

I feel like I’ve lived him more than enough chances to fix this issue on his own but he just couldn’t seem to hear me out. So I felt the need to get the authorities involved. AITA?

"AITA for accidentally spilling BIL's wedding date? More than a decade ago, during our wedding preparations, I joined an online forum for brides-to-be, where I got good advice and also shared a bit about our plans. I also shared how I was conflicted about some of the traditions in my husband's small hometown, where we were getting married. One of those unwritten rules even triggered my PTSD, so I was totally against it and really needed some advice on how to handle it all. On top of it, the mother of my FBIL's girlfriend one day shouted at me that I, as a non-Christian, had no business getting married at a church (even though the priest didn’t care). Of course I ranted about that in the wedding forum, but only as ""a very devout Christian told me that...""

  
Our wedding day was great. Since I really liked the forum, I stayed and just gave advice.   
Then my BIL and his gf announced to the immediate family that they were getting married on day X. It was a really bad date because back then my husband and I volunteered for an event that takes place once a year, and the rest of the year is full of preparations and coordination, so we really wanted to be there when the event happened, in order to help but also to see what we accomplished. BIL and his fiancée chose the same date, fully aware of this. So I made a post in that forum, just ranting a bit because of course it's their right to choose their wedding day. However, I did not foresee what was coming. 

  
Suddenly, all hell broke loose, and I first didn't know what was wrong. Then my BIL and FSIL asked to talk to me, and then broke the news that some of the women in their town had found my profile (because of the location and date) and stalked me for months. Some of them had even registered and posed as brides-to-be, and given me ""advice"". Whenever I posted something as trivial as ""good morning"", it would be the town's gossip for the week. And of course they all knew what Christian I was talking about, according to FSIL. 

  
So they had known for months that I was being stalked and badmouthed by the whole extensive gossip community of said town, but they never interfered or told me about it. The only reason they let me know now was that I had spilled \*their\* big news, which was supposed to be confidential.   
When I asked them why they had never told me about the stalking, they said something like they ""didn't want to upset me so short before our wedding"", which is bs because it started months before that. If they had told me about this whole thing immediately, I wouldn't have spilled any secrets or ""badmouthed"" her mother (by simply stating what she had done, mind you!). 

  
From then on, FSIL (later SIL) acted cold towards me, actively ignored me or excluded me from conversations etc., and after a few attempts to talk to her, I really just gave up. 

  
BIL and SIL later broke up and we lost all contact, but I recently heard that she still holds a grudge against me. I still think it's her own d\*\*\* fault, but I may be wrong, so please tell me: AITA?

"AITA for demanding a friend apologise for saying my grandpa looks like Hitler on a photo Out of nowhere a very very close friend said to me in a cafe ""I saw that photo you posted on social media the other day, I was so surprised, at first I thought you had posted a photo of Hitler"". After a clarification, she continued ""he really looks like Hitler!"" and not in a hushed voice at all. Now this is a 50 something woman with close relations to Israel and Judeism, so definitely not a Nazi herself, and also a very very close friend so I gently said ""hey, that's not cool, also my grandpa suffered enormously from the Nazis""  but she was on a roll and added a third time ""but really, it's impressive how much he looks like Hitler"".
Now I won't post photos beause this isn't about whether that is true or not (also, no, my grandpa had fair hair with a round face so goodness knows  what crossed her mind), this is about me being incredibly angry and hurt, and after a month of silence I asked her to first apologise for the comparison before we'd resume talking. I received a rambling message a week later with zero allusion to any apology and some ""I'm very angry and I don't understand"".

"WIBTA for bringing a wheelchair to a crowded parade for just in case? My (33F) partner (31F) has recently (~3 years) been diagnosed with a couple disabilities and has started using mobility aids. Mostly just a cane, but I got her a wheelchair specifically for mardi gras, but also as a trial run to see how much it actually comes in handy before buying a nicer one for her. 

She can have pain flare ups, but also has dysautonomia which affects her heart rate and she usually needs several breaks to lower her heart rate. She is able to walk, but long walks will usually spike this. 

She is incredibly wonderful, but she is embarrassed to have to use even her cane. She just wants a normal life. We’ve already been to several smaller parades and the cane was enough, and did great for her confidence after noticing no one treated her any different. We’ve been to a larger parade this year and the cane was fine, she felt great enough to stand for most of the long parade and she had a blast. We did have to walk to and from the car, if you’ve ever done mardi gras, you know. 

I think I may be an asshole bc selfishly, I walk much, much faster than she does in general. I really do try my best to keep up with her pace. I don’t complain, but I feel like the wheelchair could help. I also think the wheelchair would come in handy when she is able to walk, to carry items that we carry (backpacks, cooler etc). I don’t want her to feel forced to use the chair if she is perfectly able to walk. I want the chair to be there for when she needs a break, and it may be difficult to find somewhere to sit, as we will be in a crowd on Tuesday. 

I’m worried that we will come off as shitty people if (hopefully) she doesn’t need the chair. Or if she is feeling fine enough to enjoy the parade on her feet, dancing, and going up to the float for throws, we worry how that’d look with us having a chair. I already know she is going to need it for the walk back to the car. This past weekend she struggled with her cane. She had a great time at this last weekends parade, but had a flare up after the parade and I had to help her along. 

TLDR: WWBTAs if we bring a wheelchair to a mardi gras parade for my disabled partner who doesn’t need mobility aids 24/7?",0.1
"AITA for calling my cousin's ""bestfriend"" his boyfriend? So I (25M) just came back frome living over seas the last couple of years. My little cousin Xander (19M) and his ""bestfriend"" Mikey(20M)  needed a roomate to help pay the lease while thier in school so I moved in with them last week. Now I pretty much assumed they were a couple. They have a two bedroom apartment but no one has ever used the second bedroom. All their stuff is together and they sleep in the same room.Theyre always hugging up on eachother and acting all cuddly amd coupley and playing footsie.They still have those ugh  expensive ""friendship rings"" they gave eachother  their junior year that they now wear on chain. Plus even growing up they've been inseparable since they were like 3. They did everything together sports, clubs, double dates with girlfriends, sleepovers , sharing clothes etc. Till this day I dont think either of them have been on a lone date with a girl without the other there with his girl.

Soooo I thought with the living arrangements they have now they must be out and it's all official now. Last Thursday I told Xander that hey I met this girl and we were probably gonna get drinks and go to the club Saturday and maybe he'd want to come andvbring his Man's with him. Like a double date type thing. He got really red in the face and just goes ""what are you talking about?""

I didn't even necessarily say you were gay buttt like you clearly at least have a boyfriend.  He just tells to stfu and his eyes get a lil wet. I'm just like I'm sorry nevermind.

He refuses to speak after that and just hides in their room. I'm like super complexed on why he reacted like that cause no one in our family is homophobic especially not my aunt and uncle.

"AITA for kick the shit out of my best friend's brother? So, here is the story, about a little while ago, my best friend (lets call him John) John decided to propose to his 2 year gf (great pair too) and he ask me to be his best man, aswell as two of our closest friend to be bestmen 2 and 3, Mark and Jim.

Thing is that my bud has a youger brother, Douche, we grew all toguether, Douche can be a little... entitled at times, ever since childhood, and i dont want to talk bad of my pal's family , but i always have the starge feeling that Douche was the favorite of their mother, dont know why, and he had this strange costum to always make any situation about him, like for example, during Jhons birthday he would sulk and throw tamtrums for the smallest thing until mom gave him a bigger slice of cake or a secret present she had for him, and we all find out minutes after bc he would not shut up about and brag about it.

Anyway, back to the story, Jhon practically beg Douche not to try and ruin his fiance's day, we all knew he had gf he was crazy about a rummors were he was planing to propose aswell. After promising not to do anything, Jhon simple had to trust him, but me, mark and jim knew better, and we warn him not to try anything or he would deal with us.

Fastforward to the big day, one of the bridemaids who knew all of the above hurrilly came to me and told me another girl has seen Douche with what looked like a ring in a box. A yes, when may bud and his new wife were having their first dance a few others join in on the dance floor, that when Douche choose to do his thing, by the time his knee was touching the floor me and mark were already hauling him up while jim gently scorted his gf out aswell. he put quite a struggle to the back exit, he was so angry he actually fight us, and just like we promise we gave him a work over, a quick one.

Anyway my pal and his wife were very gratefull, but he was a bit put off by the beating, but his mom now hate my gut, his dad was surprisingly ok with all of it, but have the people in there ahte me and my buds. so perhaps a just need a thrid party opinion on this.",0.44

"AITA for not fighting the school since my daughter got a zero on a big assignment since she didn’t turn it in when she was sick My daughter is 16 and with modern technology everything is turned in online. Her teacher (Mr.Cat) is a strict teacher, he is probably the best teacher at the school even though his classes are considered difficult. She is also 16 so she is responsible for her work.

My daughter has has a big paper assigned for at least two months. This assignment, gets turned in online and he made it very clear that not turning it will result with a zero. He told everyone (I seen the emails) that the only exception would be if you are in the hospital or no internet. He also said he will give time in class so their is no excuse to not turn it in. I agree with him, since he has made it super clear this is a hard deadline and I have experience hard deadline at lot in life. Sometime you just need to turn stuff in on time or deal with the consequences.

My daughter last Friday wasn’t feeling well, and asked to stay home, I agreed and remembered her that she still needs to turn anything in since she is missing school. We have good internet and she has her school laptop.

Well she didn’t turn it in and she got a zero for the class. This has dropped her a letter grade A to a B. We got in an argument when I wouldn’t fight with the teacher to let her turn it in. I told her she forgot and she needs to live with the consequences. That this is a good learning opportunity since it’s just a letter grade and not forgetting to turn something in in college which results in her failing the class or her losing her job for not hitting a deadline.

"AITA for not filing for my husband to go to the America 
As a 30-year-old American woman with dreams of advancing neonatal healthcare, my life took an unexpected turn when I met my now-husband, a 40-year-old Nigerian man, during a vacation in Germany. Little did I know, this encounter would lead to a whirlwind of challenges, revelations, and ultimately, self-discovery.

Our love story began in the bustling streets of Germany, where cultural differences faded into the background as we connected on a deeper level. However, it wasn't until we traveled to Nigeria to tie the knot that reality hit me like a ton of bricks.

Upon arrival, I was greeted with comments from his family members insinuating that marriage was his ticket to America. It was a red flag that I chose not to ignore. As the days passed, I discovered unsettling truths about my husband's immigration status and his intentions regarding our future together.

Despite my initial hopes of settling in Sweden to pursue my career aspirations, my husband had already painted a different picture for our future, one that revolved around relocating to America. Moreover, financial strains became evident as I found myself solely responsible for household expenses while he sent money back home to his family.

The final blow came when I learned of his infidelity, mere days after exchanging vows. Betrayed and disillusioned, I made the difficult decision to file for annulment, taking control of my destiny behind his back.

Reflecting on my journey, I grapple with feelings of guilt and uncertainty. Am I the villain in this story? Have I been unfair to my husband and his family? These questions haunt me as I navigate the aftermath of our failed marriage.

In the end, I realize that I am not the antagonist of this narrative. I am a woman who dared to stand up for herself, refusing to be a pawn in someone else's game. My decision to seek annulment was an act of self-preservation, driven by a desire for truth and autonomy.

As I embark on the next chapter of my life, I embrace the lessons learned from this tumultuous experience. I am stronger, wiser, and more resilient than I ever thought possible. And though the road ahead may be uncertain, I walk it with courage and conviction, knowing that I am the author of my own story.

"AITA for removing my roommate from my gym membership after being wrongfully blamed? I (26F) have 2 roommates: Ana (25F) and Bo (21M); we met through work, although Ana now works elsewhere.

It’s Bo’s 21st birthday. The plan is to get dinner at 6 pm with the 3 of us plus Bo’s GF and some of his other friends, then meet up with coworkers at the bar next door at 7 pm.

Bo and his GF are both already at our house, so they decide to leave early to give Ana and more time to get ready. Ana and I also decide to ride together.

I’m trying to help Ana pick her outfit, as well as my own. She eventually finishes, and notifies me she’s ready to leave whenever I am. I tell her that I’m wrapping up my lipstick, and finish about 5 minutes later.

We finally leave, but traffic is awful. She tells me that Bo texts her they’re going to go put in their order, so I suggest her to text him her order so it can be ready by the time we get there. She says, “No,” because she hasn’t looked at the menu.

She talks about how she hasn’t eaten all day, and wanted to eat there because she’s never been before, basically insinuating that she won’t get to anymore, then blames me and says, “I told you we should’ve left sooner.”

I look at her with shock on my face and say, “Are you *really* blaming this only on me?”, and then tell her, “I could’ve done my makeup in the car [if it was really a problem]”, to which she says, “Well I didn’t know that.”

I try to make conversation to change the subject and lighten the mood, but she won’t let it go. I get angry and decide to stop talking completely; the rest of the car ride is pure silence.

We finally make it to the restaurant and sit down at 6:40. She orders and eats, and everyone finishes.

We make it to the bar at 7:15. All of the coworkers that Bo invited are dudes. Ana knows them from previously working there, but still seemed like the odd one out with being a bit shy, as well as not working there anymore. Her and I are also the only girls there at this point (Bo’s GF couldn’t make it). So, she follows me around literally *everywhere* and won’t sit next or talk to anyone else. I continue to ignore her to give her the hint, to which she finally tries to talk to other people.

Later, Ana and some of the others are gathered at a cool vending machine. She’s browsing, and I show interest to my coworker in buying something, too. Ana freaks out and tells me, “F*ck off, [my name].”

Ana loves to work out. She had been dying to go to a specific gym, but a multi-year contract is required. However, I found a loophole with my health insurance, so I added her and she’s been paying me for the fee since last year.

It’s been 2 weeks since that night we stopped talking, and we’ve only spoken once, when she said, “Hey,” after I came home from work one day.

Other than that, not once has she tried to talk to me about it. I feel I’ve done no wrong here, and I don’t want to let her continue to benefit from being associated with me. So, I ask:

"AITA for giving a car to my granddaughter even though it was promised to my niece? It’s going to be a long story, so please bear with me.

Me (57F) and my husband (59M) had our daughter Miya at a very young age. She married her high school sweetheart right after she graduated high school in 1999. Unfortunately her husband died in 9/11 and it broke her completely. She had her son Lance (21M now), but since she was in a very dark place mentally, she gave him away to me and my husband.

Miya eventually met another man, twice her age and with some health issues, but he made her happy and they had another child, Kat (17F now). Unfortunately when Kat was still little, Miya was KIA (she was a law enforcement officer). Her boyfriend took care of Kat, but recently he passed away to heart attack. The CPS contacted us and we took Kat in.

We have a car, a 1969 Impala, it belonged to my mother once and when I gave birth to Miya, my mom passed it down to me. Back then it had as much value as a 12 year old car could have. Now it’s considered a classic car and is worth a fortune. Since then it was driven by me, Miya and Lance, and eventually got back to my mom who’s in her late 70s now and doesn’t feel that comfortable driving stick anymore. It was supposed to be handed down to my sister’s youngest daughter, Lisa, who is about to turn 16, unfortunately Lisa knew about our plans. Kat has a license, so we decided that she could drive the Impala. She really needs a car to get around and she knows how to drive a manual. Her father was a mechanic and she knows a thing or two about cars so she fixed some things in the Impala, it runs as good as new. Kat was very grateful because the Impala is one of the few things left of her late mother.

Now, Lisa is upset because she thinks that I tricked her and lied to her. We offered to buy her a modern car instead. She’s dead set on having the Impala even though she learned how to drive automatic only. My sister is raging too because she thinks our mom treated us unfairly when she gave me the Impala and I treater her unfairly when I gave the Impala to Kat. My mom says I made the right decision.",0.42
"AITA for not letting my mother in law drive me around everywhere anymore So about 1.5 yrs I (38f) got diagnosed with epilepsy. I got my drivers licenses taken away and lost pretty much any independence it felt. So I have a great WFH job, usually done with my days around 2pm after work I used to run all the errands. My husband works out side of the house and is usually gone Monday-Friday 6am-5pm. Since my diagnosis my MIL has really helped me out during the week so my husband and I still have the weekends free together and not take up our time running errands. She’s done so much, taken me to doc follow ups, takes me to get groceries, other appointments, costco, vet visits, dog parks etc. mind you I try not to inconvenience her and bundle every on 1 day during the week, she always says it’s not an inconvenience and will drop anything to help me. 

So background on his parents. Both are early 70s, are retired, they don’t leave the house much or do much at all. His MIL often text me when she’s really bored to see if I’m done working and if want to go to the dog park or if I need to go to Costco so she can get out of the house.  My car was also at their house and she’s being doing all this in my car, to help keep my car alive and not just sit. (They have their own cars)

So a couple weeks ago my neurologist finally said meds are working I’ve been seizure free long enough to drive. So I got my car back a couple weeks ago, and I’ve throughly enjoyed going to the dog park in the afternoons alone, going grocery shopping alone, running errands alone. I used to do all these things alone and really enjoyed it and I was crushed when I lost all of that. 

Well she’s been dropping hints to my husband she’s lonely and bored during the week now and my husband says I’m being an asshole because his mom enjoyed doing all those things for me and it gave her something to look forward to and a sense of being needed. And he thinks I should still let her do all those things for me. But I’m so happy that I can finally do things on my own, feel like an adult again, feel somewhat independent again. It’s also nice to not feel pressured to rush. Yes she helped but there was always some level of complaining about something, either parking or crowds in stores, traffic, nowhere she can go smoke etc. She has a replacement hip so can’t walk that far, so I never felt like I could take my time doing something. 

I’m not going to completely shut her out,  and still do dog park days sometimes, and things like that because I know she likes getting out too. But she doesn’t need to drive the 20 mins here to take me to the grocery store or to cvs to get meds or groomers all the little local things I’m really enjoying doing on my own again.

"AITA for telling my (M28) partner (F25) and mother of our child to stop talking about her friends brothers death & to get help?? My partners is best friends with, who we will call Sarah (F24). They have a very close knit relationship, ie. their mothers are best friends, so they've been best friends since the womb. 

Sarah's older brother (M28) passed away suddenly 4 months ago and it took us all by shock.  
My partner would have grown up with him but wouldn't have been particularly close with him.   
I would have known him through various social groups for years also, but my partner would have known him much longer.

Since his passing, my partner has been very depressed and she keeps mentioning how he' has ruined her best friend. She is always up at his grave, or over at the house checking up on her best friend.  
For the first month after his passing, it was hard on both of us. But I reminded myself that it's what he had wanted and we needed to respect that. I've moved on and gave peace to the idea, however, my partner has not. 

I understand people grieve differently, and that is okay, but my partner brings him up Daily.   
I am sick of hearing his name every single day.   
We have a newborn that we need to take care of which adds additional stress, and I work a very high stress job which does not help, we also aren't completely financially stable which is added stress.

My partner went out on Saturday night with her family and friends and got very drunk, when she came home to our apt. at 2am and wanted to be intimate, but then began talking about her friends brother which was just a complete turn off. she asked me 'how he did it' and asked me to describe everything and how she is so angry at him for ruining his best friend and how she seems him every time she closes her eyes or goes to bed. frustrated, I turned to her and I said, why are you even bringing this up, you need to stop getting involved in other peoples shit. He passed away, there's no bringing that back, your friend has changed, there's no bringing that back. You changed when you became a mother, everyone changes. Life moves on. You need to focus on our baby, and our relationship, instead of keeping up with the 'Kardashians' (their last name here). I said, you're so invested in their life's right now, why? what good is it doing to your mental health, why do you feel a need to be so invested, I told her, I'm sick of talking about him, it's all we do, all we do is talk about the 'kardashians'

  
I told her she needs to see a counsellor.  
I got out of bed and went for a drive, frustrated, angry and tired. I just needed to get away from it.

Again, I understand people grief differently, but It's like she is feeding off their grief and becoming sad in the process. I've heard his name and talked about him for 4 months straight now (120++ days). Not a day has gone by  since where he wasn't mentioned. I personally do not have the energy to be talking about him anymore. 

It frustrates me because I have accepted it, and yet she seems to be feeding into her friends grief. It's like she doesn't want to let go of the grief.

"WIBTA if we don’t do Easter with my adopted step kids? So I adopted my officially step kids (10M and 8F) quite recently they were with bio mom before that and we removed from her care due to extreme neglect. My husband and I have never really celebrated Easter and aren’t super interested in putting a religious holiday into our kids lives. The kids have expressed an interest in getting a visit from the Easter bunny, and my parents have even threatened to get them Easter baskets despite our wishes. We honestly aren’t bothered getting them some Easter candy, and spending some family time with them. We’ve also talked about explaining to them that although they have celebrated Easter in the past we will not be doing a traditional Easter with bunnies and church and stuff.

"AITA for locking my son's card when he is late for school? For the last several years, particularly after COVID, my wife and I have had incredibly difficulty getting our son (16M) to care about school and show up on time. He's technically in 10th grade, but has only earned a single credit since 9th grade and was put in alternative school (school districts decision) for excessive tardiness and skipping class last year.

He's been late nearly 50 times this school year, and any attempts to encourage or motivate him have been an abject failure. He has told me that he just doesn't care about graduating high-school, and that nothing I can do or say will ever motivate him.

In a last ditch effort, I've taken to locking his credit card (it only has a small amount and is so he can have lunch with his friends) for the day everytime he is late for school. This morning he was leaving the house after the bell already rang at school, and told me that I'm a horrible parent and am ruining his friendships at school and that it won't change his behavior anyway.

He's well-behaved and a thoughful kid outside of this school issue, and it hurts me so badly to see him head down the same path I took (and had to learn the hard way). We've tried everything with the school and unfortunately are at the point of considering technical programs and GED courses.

His brother was non-verbal and disabled and required so much attention from my wife and I, but he died suddenly 5 months ago and I'm still a wreck. To top it off, my son isn't mine biologically (I've raised him since he was 2) and he brought it up this morning when he was mad at me and it truly broke my heart as I love him as my own son and we used to be inseperable when he was younger.

I just want my son to not struggle like I did, but I don't want him to hate me or add to the burden of him losing his brother. I know this probably sounds like he has no discipline or boundaries at home (he does), but I'm wondering if I'm doing the right thing here.

"AITA for not wanting to meet my bds new girlfriend? So I, 23F, have a daughter, 2F, that I coparent with her dad, 23M. We’ve had problems since I got pregnant with my daughter and they haven’t seem to let up. The most recent problem is that he has a new girlfriend. It’s not the girlfriend that’s the problem though, it’s that I was forced to meet her. My kids dad texted me one day asking if I wanted to meet his gf, and my response was that I didn’t want to meet her until she met our daughter. His response was ‘so not any time soon’. I responded saying that was up to him. Fast forward to later on that day when it’s time to switch off with our daughter, and he texts me four minutes before he gets to my house to tell me that he’s on the way and bringing his gf. Now, I was asleep when he sent the texts so I didn’t see them. He calls me when he’s down the street from my house and tells me that he brought his gf. I’m disoriented from being woken up so I just say okay. He gets to my house and then proceeds to bring his gf inside my house. I didn’t say anything to either one of them, nor did I try to introduce myself to the gf. He got our daughter and left. I texted him after he left and told him it was disrespectful for him to do that without making sure I was comfortable and okay with it beforehand. He responds and says that he doesn’t see an issue with it and he was just giving me the opportunity to meet his gf. I go on to tell him how it’s disrespectful and how I feel. I just want to know if I overreacted to the situation.

Edit: I’d like to add that they’ve only been together for maybe two weeks and he’s only just met her right before they got together. Also, he had a prior gf that he also has a child with that he was with since a month before my daughter was born. He did the same thing with that gf, and even tried having her at the hospital right after my daughter was born.

Girlfriend and I been together 5 months, we are both 31 let’s call her Amy. My girlfriend is beautiful, she works out goes to workout classes everything however, when she was younger she was really hot. This whole conversation started when she was showing me photos from her past (her social media only has recent photos).

  
She told me too that when she was younger she would get free flight upgrades, invited to celebrity parties. She told me that when she started working at her first company, she got invited to their company’s town hall where she got to ask the CEO questions in front of the whole company etc.

  
She then asked me to be honest and tell her would I have preferred dating her now or back then. I told her now, and that I don’t think I could have related to her back then as I do now, and that her personality is what got me to fall in love with her.  She then goes okay what about from a purely physical perspective like lets say my personality is the same now just that we swapped bodies. I said yeah from a physical standpoint I would choose her in early 20s. 

  
She then asks me what age do I find women the most attractive, I  say it depends on the woman but tell her generally 21-24. Up until this point she hasn’t shown an ounce of anger, then she says oh so women after 24 are basically worthless in your eyes. I told her if I could swap and get my 22 year old body back, my youth everything I would do it too in a heart beat. She then starts saying this is not about youth this is attraction. Then starts calling me a creep and an asshole for preferring younger women.

"AITA for not being more proactive in helping my dad with his property renovation? Reddit, seeking some honest feedback. Lots to share to paint a fuller pic, but Reddit has a 3k c. limit.

Dad and I have had lots of drama over the years. Love him, but no one can push my buttons like him.

He's chronically late whenever we meet (he's been late an hour before/sometimes 2). I'm organised. He is the epitome of spontaneous.

If any of you have seen Succession, you might understand. Dad's wealthy. Ironically he has 3 other kids. Our relationship is filled with lots of highs, but also lots of confusing lows, not unlike the show. Sadly.

He's blocked my number when he's upset. Kicked me out of his car. He's also told me he's loved me, and been there when needed. (Had to move out of my flat and get the police involved. Things went awry with my flat-mate's boyfriend. He smoked a tonne of weed and has been arrested). Reddit doesn't allow me to post anything re: violence. But, you can infer he was a paranoid mess and I got the brunt of it.

**The problem**:

Long story short, I asked if he needed help renovating. If so, ""let me know what dates"". He replied: he's there every day. Nothing materialised. Never sent me dates. I didn't proactively offer up any dates *either* (AITA for this? He's made me feel really bad about it). Typically, I see my girlfriend Thurs through Sun. Mon - Weds, I'm at home. Wouldn't have minded giving up some evenings. I offered in the first place to spend quality time. Girlfriend lives in another city, so would be unreasonable to come back and forth. But, if my Dad 100% needed me, I'd plan this out and be there. As it stands, he hasn't communicated anything of the sort. But, he has proactively asked my sister's boyfriend for his help. He's a painter/decorator; I imagine my Dad will be paying him.

Recently, we caught up. Spoke for 40 minutes. I mentioned if he wanted to come and pick me up, we go together. (I don't have a car, and getting an Uber there and back would be unreasonable). Can't afford to be spending £30 per trip. He never offered to pick me up (despite living 10 minutes away). The conversation just moved on to something else.

We did plan to meet for dinner. I gave him a text and said ""I'm free XYZ day to meet.""He ignored my text, and called me 3 x days later; asked me if I was free then and there (on the spot). Was off to go to see GF. Mentioned he ignored me, and I couldn't just drop plans. He exploded.

Cited he was there for me during that time at the flat and inferred that I'm just as bad at texting (""if you want to do texts, son! let's do texts!"") then hung up on me. Said, ""call me when you're feeling better"".

Whenever I've expressed being sad/disappointed, it's never ever gone down well. Never takes accountability and sweeps it under the rug. My Dad had a heart attack 18 months ago. My gran is imploring me to reach out to him and be the bigger man, but I'm drained. I never get any ""sorry's"", tired of being the bigger person. But, the fact that he nearly went 18 months ago is eating me up. And, I'm torn.",0.48
"AITA for telling my mom she's awful? I (17F) have a rocky relationship with my mother. (51F) Her parenting is mad questionable and she's honestly the root cause of my trauma growing up. 

we just had an argument about mainly her nitpicking on me not helping out in the house, and having terrible eating habits.

I'm the eldest child and growing up, never taught to do housework, I had maids to do so. After a maid ran away, my mom decided to take over as a house wife 24/7 and does chores. Occasionally I'd help with the dishes and sometimes sweeping, but mom tells me to not do work, and instead study (as kind of a gesture it is, it backfired alot cus i grew up not knowing how to do basic life skills as i was constantly yelled at for doing them); due to this, she blames me for not knowing how to do certain chores when i was never taught and had to learn by myself.

Second, my diet is awful. I have this problem where I can't take certain food or I'll immediately throw up, but my mother doesn't really understand that or cares, and chalks it up to me being ""ungrateful"" or me using it as an excuse to not eat her cooking. I can only eat noodles and bread, but that's it. can only eat small portions of rice and curry or I throw up, and I'm forced to eat a crap ton of it everyday and as a result have an unstable diet.

now, i'm in the middle of cramming for my finals before moving onto college (so college entrance exams) so I've had reduced time to do anything at home due to the absurd amounts of tutoring sessions my parents signed me up for + self revising. Mom uses this to complain that I barely do anything and it's not fair for HER to keep doing all the work when I don't crap. I told her I can't help it cause I have a packed schedule and try to help out at least with the dishes and clothes folding but nope, she doesn't budge. I have a younger brother (15M) and my dad (53M) and asked her to ask them for help but she refuses because of stupid patriarchial standards that ""men shouldn't do work at home.""

She then escalates about my eating habits and how I should just die with the way I'm eating. The whole thing is her repeating all of this, coupled with how my brother does better at eating certain food and how he helps out at the house (by doing the bare minimum btw) and ofc complaining about my room being a mess with books everywhere due to exams.
Now I'm stressed and in the heat of the moment told her she's the worst mother ever and she never listens to me. she's angry and told me that she will stop doing anything for me, such as cooking food for me (meaning I need to learn how to cook my own food), find a way to go to school and attend after school classes and etc. I can't even ask my dad because he AGREED to this because ""It's a good lesson to teach you how to respect her."" I'm lost. I can't even seek therapy because I rely on my parents to pay for everything as I can't get a job at my current age (need to be 18) in my country and therapy is heavily shunned here.

"AITA for letting my Neighbor’s dog get taken? So. My neighbors have a little dog. He is so friendly, sweet, and well behaved… and  completely neglected. We’ve affectionately nicknamed him “Dirty Snowball” because his white fur is matted and filthy. He’s never inside or contained in their yard. He runs through the streets trying to greet everyone. We have a busy road attached to ours and he darts out into traffic frequently. I’ve watched him narrowly escape getting run over many times.

Dirty Snowball comes over to our house anytime we’re outside. We pet him and give him water. My husband pulled a thorn out of his paw once that had been there for who knows how long. He wants love so bad. I often walk him home to the neighbor’s house but they don’t care or do anything to keep him there. I am never rude, I always greet them with a big smile and a warm “Hey! We had a visitor at our place! Thought we’d help him home! He’s such a sweetheart. Have a great day!”

Two weeks ago I watched as he had an incredibly close call with a pickup truck. What felt like the thousandth close call I’ve seen. I walked him over to my neighbor’s house and knocked. I wanted to relay my concerns and see if they needed help with him in any way. They were home, but they did not answer. Their house is totally rundown and there is an awful smell that was so strong it made the dog gag as we sat and waited for them to open the front door. I wanted so badly to let him into our house, bathe him, give him a home… but we have two pets and a toddler and I’m just not able to do it. But I’ve been heartsick. My husband and I decided we’d try one more time to knock on their door and talk with them last weekend. We didn’t want to call authorities if we didn’t have to because we’re worried they’d put him down. 

Well, before the weekend hit we had a big storm. Freezing cold winds and lots of ice and rain. I had ordered groceries and when the delivery driver arrived I opened the door to find her on my porch and a soaked, shivering and scared little Dirty Snowbal.
We had the following conversation: 

Her: “Is this your dog?” 
Me: “no, he’s our neighbor’s poor little guy! I can’t believe they won’t let him inside even in this weather!” 
Her: “he’s so sweet I love him! I’m tempted to take him!”
Me: “…. Honestly if you’re able to care for him you should take him.”
Her: “seriously?”
Me: “yes. The neighbors neglect him so badly. He’s hungry and lonely and he isn’t safe running through the streets all day and night. We worry about him all the time.”
Her: “I have another little dog at home who would love him….”
Me: “Well, I know he would be happier with you… listen I think if you will love him you should take him... as far as anyone knows, I didn’t see anything.”

I went inside, shut my door and watched her carry Dirty Snowball to her car and drive him home. 

I feel bad… but I’m comforted knowing he probably had a bath, a meal and a warm bed to sleep in that night for possibly the first time ever.

"AITA for telling my mum that my education is more important than hers? My mom recently quit her job. She worked in a small clothing shop, with 2 more women. It’s many people’s dream job in my country. Before that job, she was a stay at home mom but she started it around two years ago because I’m old enough to have some kind of responsibility for myself.
Since she’s quit it, our house became miserable again. Even though she’s here, she does nothing all day. The only thing she does is cleaning once a week. 
When I was in school and she was at work, se wanted the house spotless when she came back from her “very stressful” job. So I would come back from school, make lunch, do the dishes, clean twice a week and she’s still complain and scold me when I wasn’t done with my homework by the time she got home.
My dad’s job is very stressful and hard. It requires both physical strength and requires lots of thinking and knowledge. I have very deep respect for my dad, I love him so much and I feel really really bad seeing him be sad all the time because of my mom. In my opinion, he’s not getting paid enough for the hard work he does. When he comes home, normally, he is tired and hungry. We come back home to find out my mum hasn’t done or cooked anything and we have to end up eating sandwiches or eggs almost every day. So she stays at home all day, quits her job when we need money the most and on top of that does nothing the whole day.
Recently she’s decided she isn’t going back to work and she HAS to apply for university next year. She says she won’t study, but would rather pay to pass her exams (I live in a very corrupt country so that’s quite normal here).
The problem is, we do NOT have this kind of money. I told her I thought we were saving up for me to go to university. What am I going to do after I graduate in two years? We have no money, quite literally. I had plans to study IT and programming. It’s been my dream since as long as I could remember and I’m also an A+ student. But I guess that’s not happening as she’s already made plans to spend the money we don’t have.
To my question, I got the most hurtful and unexpected answer. She just straight up said she doesn’t care what I do or how I live. She doesn’t care whether I’m starving or living on the streets.
I told her she doesn’t that degree as much as I do. She isn’t smart so she wouldn’t understand anything anyway and would just waste the money my dad’s made with lots of sweat and hard work. 
I’ve never been so hurt by anybody else more than my mom. Instantly made me hate her. Recently I found out she’s lied about and basically destroyed my whole life and our small family. 
It hurts so much,  I don’t think I could ever hate her. I’m just very curious as to what made her hate me so much the past few years. Idk what I’ve done do deserve this from her.

"AITA for getting my coworker a mediocre Christmas gift? This past Christmas, my office did a Secret Santa. The person I got chosen to buy a gift for is this girl who I barely talked to, and didn't know well at all, so I had no idea what to get her. One of the only things I really know about her is that every now and then, she would show up to work in the morning with a bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich. Like often enough to the point that I could tell she enjoyed a good BEC. 

I figured it would be thoughtful to sketch up a quick coupon in MS paint, good for 5 free BEC sandwiches (our budget was $25, and a BEC costs about $5-6 at most bagel places) and that whenever she wanted one, she could just let me know and I'd grab her one when I came into work.

Well when I gave her the present, you would've thought I cut her dogs head off and gave her that for Christmas. She basically acted like it wasn't even a present at all. Over the next week or so, when I'd ask her if she wanted one, she'd basically give me a flippant ""nah, I'm good"" response, and at one point another one our other coworkers said to me ""You should've just gotten her a bottle of wine"", so clearly they're talking about how ""bad"" this present was.

Well two weeks ago I explained to my upstairs neighbor politely. Hey I have a 2-year-old. We try to put them down at 9:00. I have to wake up at 3:00 a.m. in the morning so that I can go to work. Can you please try to keep it down? Well it worked. They've moved their daughter's cheerleading routine to 7pm instead of late at night so that's nice! But the problem lies with every night around 11:00 I can hear their bed.. and the neighbor girl. I have no problem with people having sex or having a little bit of fun but the problem I have is my 2-year-old won't sleep in his own room and when he's coming in the my room for a nap or it's bedtime and they're up stairs doing it and he's just staring at the ceiling. Quiet hours in our apartment is from 10:00 to 7:00.

"AITAH for blocking my finsub For context, I have a findom kink.

He sent again, more this time. I sent him back double, and told him he seriously needed to cut it out. It wasn't about the money any more, he wasn't someone i was going to partake in the kink with any more, and that was that.

Now one of the idiots which happens to be my desk-mate since last year, seems to don't even care about what he just did. I told him that he's an asshole and also multiple things but again he didn't seem moved, it's like I talked to a different person to last week. Like the dude seems more moved about the fact that I swore at him than what he did to me in the bus. ( we do swear in this friend group but jokingly, obviously I wasn't joking this time because of that thing)

So what should I do? Move forward and keep being their friend or find someone else and block both of them out of my life? Keep in mind I still have to do 2 years of high school with them. Also AITA if I do end the friendship with them?",0.14
"AITA for not telling my GF I will love her forever? We're now nearly one year in a relationship. She's my first real gf, I'm also her first. She has some small trauma bc of some family thing, it's not a big deal, but I always try to be there for her when she feels down, so she like sees me as one of the few people she can really trust.

We talked a lot about what we want to do in the future. One night we made like plans together, where we'd live, how our house would look like, things like that. I didn't really think much of it at that time.

Now my situation: We were on a video call, when she said something like ""Do you love me forever"". I  was doing sth else at that moment and not paying so much attention. I replied something in the lines of ""Maybe, yes"". To be clear: I said before that I will love her forever. I really love her and I could imagine being with her forever but I'm not really sure. I also don't want to hurt her feelings.

"AITA for insisting with my friend why he wears a mask when he doesn't want to tell me but tells plenty of other people ? I have a friend in high school who wears a mask all the time. Originally, it was because of Covid, but once the restrictions were lifted, he continued to wear it, and I wondered why. He explained to me that it's because he doesn't like his body and that he won't give me more details because it's too embarrassing for him. But he told the whole story to other people at school, and that annoyed me, knowing that I had confided a lot in him about my personal problems. I asked him several times, insisting, why he wears his mask, but he told me the same things again, and I told him how I really felt about it. He asked me if I didn't feel like a a-hole for it, although he said he understood me. I want to point out that we still appreciate each other despite everything.",0.98
"AITA for not paying a parking ticket for my makeup artists 
So for context, I got married a few months ago and hired 2 amazing makeup artists to come do our bridal party glam. They were great, everything was great. However, i did inform them the morning of that they will need to pay for parking but I can reimburse them. (I only told one as they travelled together and the other was driving). 

A week later I received a DM of them asking me to pay for a $105 parking ticket and I told them I’m not paying for it as I advised them it is a paid parking area & the $105 far exceeded the amount if they had just paid for parking in the first place which would’ve come to around $35.

I had already paid $980 between the two of them, $70 travel fee, and a security deposit of $100 each which wasn’t deducted from the full amount (that part I knew when booking). But I really don’t want to pay the parking ticket.

When we started dating, she let me know she had just broken up with someone a month before. She said they weren’t speaking, but that they agreed to be casual friends. They had had an on off relationship for about 2 years. I was totally cool with that and never asked about it again. Yesterday (6 months later) she’s showing me a text from her friend, and I see she’s been messaging this ex. I was a little taken aback, because she never mentioned she is still in contact with him. I asked her about it and she said he’s reached out twice since they broke up about random things that don’t have to do with getting back together. I said that is totally cool and I trust her, but asked if she could share when he reaches out so I don’t have to find out about it by accident.

"AITA (M27) For starting to resent my fiancée (F25) and her lack of care to put any effort into our relationship As title suggests I'm growing extremely tired and feeling so much resentment towards my fiancée but I can't tell if I'm just over reacting or so numb to it all.   
  
My fiancée is baby crazy and has been since we met. I have always wanted kids but I've always been extremely cautious about who I choose to do so with. Within a few weeks of being together she was begging for kids. The problem is I don't think she would be a fit mother whatsoever after living with her for the past two years.   
  
My fiancée is unemployed and every time I mention going back to work it's always excuses, I told her that if she wants to be a SAHM during our first child’s younger years that would be okay but there is no baby involved currently so her schedule is 100% free all day everyday. On the other hand, I work 10 hour days and am on call outside office hours and weekends.   
  
This busy schedule has put a ton of stress on me and feel like it's straining how much effort I have to give my full love to her, but I always go out of my way to make her feel loved, appreciated and feel like a queen. On the other hand it is the complete opposite for me, while I'm at work she sleeps more than half the day away, stays up till all hours of the night and constantly wakes me up, does nothing around the house, doesn't even try to help me cook dinner after I get home and not once has ever made me a meal in the three years we have been together. She spends 12 hours a day or more sitting on her phone and is constantly stirring up petty drama on meaningless social media apps. When I'm around its like pulling teeth trying to get her to put down her phone, everything we do she has to have it with her and it makes me so upset.   
  
When I get home, I literally have to beg her to come have a shower with me half the time it never happens but when it does all she talks about is which argument she started today but never asks how my day was or how I am doing. I feel so lonely, yet I'm engaged to someone who feels like they don't even appreciate me. Everything is always about uping her 'friends' the more money the better, she doesn't even help with bills besides her portion of the rent the rest of her money is blow it on pointless things leaving me to always cover the essentials. Making plans with her are something I don't even take serious now because I know on a whims notice if her 'friends' message her to come hang out she will choose them over me has multiple times.  
  
As the days go on I feel like we grow more and more apart and I just don’t know what to do at tis point. If I try and talk about the way I’m feeling or ask about getting a little more help she turns it around into me attacking her and being unfair then gives me the silent treatment for days like a child.

"AITA for taking the overreaction of my GF too seriously? Ok, so weird situation but I need some input from impartial folks and y'all seem like the easiest community to ask about this.

I (M37) am currently dating V (F35)and she has a German Shepherd (Rocket)  that is really energetic and hyper (which I love because it helps us stay motivated to go out walking)

We recently moved in together and it's been going great until a few days ago when Rocket jumped up and bopped me in the lip, busting it open. Out of surprise, I yelled ""Ow damn"" louder than I actually meant to. She came running in while I was walking to the kitchen to get a paper towel and saw the blood, which freaked her out apparently. For the record, it didn't really hurt, it was just surprising and startled me. I gave her a smile (I thought but she says I didn't) as I walked by her going to check on her dog.

I came back chuckling and she was screaming at Rocket and threatened to drop her off at a local shelter if she didn't behave better. I asked her if she was serious and she just looked at me like I was the crazy one and said (screamed) ""She literally busted you open and you think I'm being too hard on her?"" Rocket was shaking on the couch and looked scared to death and I admit I may have overreacted here, but I told her (in an admittedly icy tone) that if I ever heard her threaten any pets like that again over anything short of a major injury, especially over me, she wouldn't have to worry about her dog ""hurting me"" anymore because I would dump her on the spot.

She told me to GTFO and I heard her screaming at Rocket as I left to cool off as well. I stayed at the neighbors' (good friends of mine) and up all night on their porch just in case I heard anything happen. I came back the next morning (mostly to check on the dog, cause I was still upset at her) and she just flipped me off. I saw Rocket perfectly healthy and she was wagging her tail and playing with a tennis ball, so I relaxed and gave her some scratches. V is being very cold with me when we talk, though, and says she can't believe I would choose her dog over her. I just keep telling her that I can't believe she would choose me over Rocket, either, but either way Rocket doesn't deserve to be punished for an accident that didn't even injure me that badly and that the way she reacted was way over the top and honestly made me worried about what she may do to me or Rocket if she ever got angry enough.

I've tried to talk about it, but she just blows me off and tells me to go pet Rocket if I'm still upset or not ready to apologize for being an AH. I really don't get how someone could choose someone they've only dated for a few months over the dog they've had for years, but I also don't really want to think about dumping her just over this, especially since Rocket is hers and I'm worried for her as well.

If this sounds like it would fit better in another community, feel free to cross-post, I'll take any advice I can get for this.",0.06
"AITAH for pulling into a parking spot before someone else could? I just had an interaction in a parking lot I’m a little unclear on whether I was the asshole. I was looping around the Target parking lot for a while looking for parking, and ended up approaching a free spot from the back of the parking lot since I’d been scanning all the aisles. A car is backing out on the opposite side of where my spot is, and once they start to go around the car behind them to exit the lot I start pulling into my spot. I hear a honk but wasn’t sure who it was directed at, but then the car behind the other car that was pulling out pulls up behind me and sits there waiting as I gather my things. 

She’s not moving so at this point I assume she’s the one who honked and is now waiting to say something to me, and when I get out of the car she starts screaming “YOU SERIOUSLY DIDN’T SEE ME WITH MY SIGNAL ON????” and I said “no, sorry” and she starts going on about how rude I am and how some other lady in the parking lot saw what happened and also couldn’t believe it. I just said “Okay? We’re all looking for parking. Good luck!” and she began screaming expletives and insults at me as I walked into the store. 

I get it’s frustrating to be hopeful about a parking spot just for someone else to get to it first, but that’s life imo. When I’m in that situation I just mutter some words of frustration to myself in the car, and then keep searching.

"AITA for telling my SIL she was stupid and proned to miscarr* I25f have been married to my husband for 2 years. We recently got our first home and are officially homeowners so a few weeks ago we decided to throw a big party with family and friends. We did have a bunch of alcohol drinks and mixed drinks, but I had them separated bc my SIL is 3 months pregnant. 

My SIL has had 4 miscarriages in the past. It’s heart wrenching, and I feel horrible for her. I’ve always been supportive.  She has a form of PCOS.  Anyways at the party I had told SIL that the non alcohol drinks were in the indoor fridge, and to feel free to make herself virgin drinks if she liked. On the table outside I had mixed drinks outside and in the outside cooler. Long short short  sister in law ended up getting trashed, a week later miscarried. She’s been blaming my husband and I since early January for this. Sending us hateful messages spamming my phone, saying one of us must’ve mixed up the drinks (which didn’t happen.) When it first occurred I told her I was so sorry, but it wasn’t our fault we had other guest who were drinking and I had made her aware of where the other drinks were.

Two days ago she tried pulling that stuff again when we ran into her while at my MIL, and again said it and followed me through the house arguing with me. I finally blew and said your the stupid one for A)not listening when I told you where the non alcoholic drinks are, B) for continuing to drink bc she had to of realized she was getting drunk, and C) bc your already prone to miscarriages due to your conditions this isn’t our fault.

She broke down in tears crying and wailing saying I wasn’t sensitive, I was a horrible person. My MIL asked us to leave. My husband and I feel bad for her miscarrying ofc, but she has been harassing us for weeks. SIL texted me off BIL number bc we blocked her, saying how she couldn’t believe I was calling her stupid when her misfortune happened due to my party how I needed to apologize. MIL is backing her up.

"AITA for helping out my SIL and going against my whole family? My (m24) brother (m29) is married to a woman (27). They have been together for three years and she's pregnant (barely, still in the first trimester) 

Tbh I always thought that his marriage with her was kinda off? We're white Americans, she's from Panama and they met when my brother was working there, then they moved back here. Like I'm not saying that Americans can't fall in love with people from other countries, not at all. But you know those wealthy Americans who travel to places like Thailand to get a girlfriend? The situation was like that to me, kinda off as I said. Still, I never told anyone this because my brother, as far as I know, is a good person.

I have always been ""close"" to my brother, like we always watch games together and stuff you know? It's us and two sisters, who are closer with each other, so we're kind of used to this dynamic. When he married, I also naturally became close with his wife. She's a very kind and sweet woman, I was also teaching her English since she wasn't good at it and I was studying to become a Spanish teacher. We have truly become very close... 

So, fast forward to this week. My brother and his wife had a fight and (apparently?) Broke up, and my brother kicked his wife out. I think that's so shitty really, she called me and told me about it, so I told her to get a taxi and come to my home. 

The thing is, that now my whole family is pissed off at me. My mother has called me and told me a lot of nasty things about SIL, and at some point I had to hung up on her because she was getting too heated. My brother, same thing, he told me that I shouldn't get in his business. My dad told me I should be picking ""blood"" over a stranger.

"AITA for defending my autistic son for getting his step-sister pregnant. I (42M) had two sons with my late wife. Kenny (18M) and Christopher (16M). Kenny has been professionally diagnosed with autism. Christopher is normal. We lost my wife to a fatal car accident in 2016. I didn't know what to do for a while, and grieved my ex-wife's passing for years.  
  
In late 2019, I met a wonderful woman, Keara (41F), who had three kids from a toxic relationship. Celeste (18F), Anderson (15M), Breanna (15F). We clicked almost immediately and started dating. On July of 2023, I proposed to Keara. Everything was going well.  
  
Fast forward to around now. Me and Keara got married back in December, and are now currently living each other in a new house. An important note to consider is that Kenny's room has a bathroom, and Celeste doesn't have one.  
  
Ever since we all moved in together, I noticed that Celeste has been going into Kenny's room to 'use the bathroom' at night. I always assumed it was because Kenny's bathroom was the closest to her room, and since Kenny did not mind it, I had no reason to tell her to stop. Last Saturday, Christopher came into my room, and told me that we needed to talk.  
  
He explained to me that he and the twins were snooping in Kenny's room last night to borrow a game cartridge that Kenny owns and refuses to share with anyone else. The three of them heard Kenny and Celeste whisper-arguing about how Kenny still wanted to have intercourse with Celeste after finding out that she was pregnant. The three of them scrambled out the room after overhearing that, and Christopher confessed that he told his friends about it before telling me.  
  
In all honesty, I was shocked beyond belief. Nothing could have prepared me for the fact that my son has been banging someone, let alone his stepsister. I berated Christopher for attempting to steal and telling his friends about personal family matters. I told him to not to confront Kenny or Celeste while I try to figure things out with my wife.  
  
I told my wife about Christopher's findings, and she exploded with anger. She accused my son of being a pervert and coercing Celeste. I couldn't let her talk about Kenny in that light when both of them were in on this. I defended my son, saying that he possibly couldn't be in the wrong, because he has autism. I explained to her that he couldn't possibly understand the situation, and Celeste was the predator. We had a full blown argument and my wife wouldn't talk to me now. Everyone in the house heard the argument because how much we were screaming.  
  
I don't think I did anything wrong by defending my son who can't fully grasp this situation, when Celeste knew what she was doing. I truly think we shouldn't dwell on the fact that they are step-siblings and should figure out what to do next as a family.

"AITA for throwing dog poop at someone? I (25f) split my workdays between the office and home. Today, on my way back, I was mentally ticking off my to-do list, thinking about groceries and fixing my car's brakes. I ended up calling my dad to chat about the brakes and, without realizing it, drove straight home instead of hitting the grocery store.

My driveway's a real pain - it's super narrow and you can't see much when backing out. It's such a tight squeeze that my friends always choose to park on the street instead.

So, realizing I forgot the groceries, I started to back out and ended up completely blocking the sidewalk before I could even see clearly. There was this guy (unknown age and unknown gender. most likely 35m) standing there with his dog, just looking at me. I gave him a sort of ""oops, my bad"" smile and wave, but he wasn't having any of it.

He then proceeds to start screaming at me and yelling saying “no no no, I have the right away, i’m a pedestrian” and the “the pedestrian always has the right away” and “you don’t just get to wave and go”. Which is true but upon one look of my driveway anyone could see I had no way of seeing him and took the precautions to be very slow and safe and thought he was letting me go since he would have walk in the street to pass me. 

So this is when I messed up lol, I rolled down my window and said “relax, I couldn’t see you” and he yells the same things over again and says no. I then say “foff” and roll my window up. 

I pulled up next to the guy and throw the bag at him. I have terrible aim and hit a car. There is splattered poop all of this car. The guy looks a bit dumbfounded for a second and then says “that’s not my car” and I say “f you” and drive to the grocery store. 

When I got back, I did the walk of shame to clean up the mess from the other car. Reflecting on it, I should've just apologized for not seeing him, but man, he was so aggressive.

TLDR: I tried to leave my driveway, exchanged some heated words with a guy, and ended up in a ridiculous dog poop throwing situation. I did clean it off someone else's car, though.",0.71
"AITA for telling my professor its not her business to monitor my bathroom breaks? I just started a COM (speech) class at my college with our first speech being due on the first day of class. I made 90 something.

In the 2nd class she decided to give out **one on one** feedback to the entire class of about 13 people. Me feeling superfluous decided to leave in between speeches and feedback to just get out of the chair, use the bathroom, scroll through my phone etc. I did that for about 30 minutes, waited for the end of another speech then returned to my seat.

In the third class I did the same for less time, probably around 20 minutes while she gave a lecture. As I returned the class was letting out early and as I was gathering my things she says, ""Where were you?"" To which I replied, ""Yeah sorry, just had to walk the dogs."" This being the nicest euphemism I could think of while trying to politely tell her its not her business.

\*\*\*I need to give some details to explain this person and myself before I continue. I'm older and have some life experience under me. I've met many (too many) people like this professor. She obviously has a massive chip on her shoulder for X reasons and tries to find any reason to become confrontational with people she has authority over. She has waved so many red flags its going to be easier to put them into list form:

* During our intro speeches for the first class a girl sitting next to me was reading her notes on a piece of paper and flipped the paper over. Twice. This led the professor to warning whoever it was sitting behind her (she was facing forward to listen to speeches) to not flip paper during the speech, feedback or while she's writing notes... so... ever again. 
* A student realized she was in the wrong class and began leaving during her reciting the syllabus and the professor became very irate and asks the student if she wanted to stay which led to the student saying, ""No thanks I don't want to be yelled at""
* In every single class she would spend 10 minutes mentioning how she failed a group of girls because they were always on their phones. Making sure to state that it wasn't **her** fault they failed. (This led me to believe I couldn't trust her integrity as professor and that if she just straight up didn't like you you'd get a low grade or fail.)
* Her rate-my-professor page has so many blatant obvious self-posted reviews made by alternate accounts because they all end the same way. 
* The first day of class we had 25 people. It was full. The 2nd class we had 13.

I arrived at to the 4th class before anyone else and sat down. She walks over and and sits next to me and says, ""You can't walk your dogs in the middle of class.""

I told her ""I didn't, I went to the bathroom"" what follows is me explaining how I was using a euphemism and she isn't in charge of my bowels. We go back and forth for a while with it ending with my saying ""Good Luck"" and leaving the class.

I have since received an email saying I have to behave if I want to stay in the class. I will not be returning.

"AITA for arguing with my gf for chatting with a guy that has a big crush on her? Me (20M) and my gf (18F) have been dating for 6 months.

There is a guy that they know eachother 1 year and he always had a crush on her. Nothing happened between them. They haven’t even kissed. Months before we started dating, she used to give him false hopes to play with him. She had just broken up with her ex and wanted to have fun. He low key knew she was playing with him. 

One night, they went out with a group of friends. He sat next to her and got a boner, she didn’t do anything to cause it. I will talk about it later 

Then he dated a girl, just to get on her nerves. While they dated, he texted her that he misses her (they had nothing) and that he doesn’t like his then gf and wants her. 

After we started dating, they chatted for 4 mounts during our relationship. One time we accidentally met in public and he said hi to us. 

2 mounts ago, I looked up her phone (after I got her permission). I saw a few messages of their chat. The day he met us, they chatted a bit and she teased him for saying hi to me, that it was a weird move. A few days later, he texted her terrible messages, calling me midget (I’m 5ft6), that I look ugly in person and he doesn’t get how she’s with me. She didn’t answer. After that, he used to send her many messages, sometimes she answered him some other times she left him on read. There was a message that she told him that I know everything about him (I didn’t, only a few things. I wouldn’t let her talk to him if I knew he was obsessive with her and he talked so poorly for me). He asked her if she told me about what happened that night and she said no (she actually told me, the boner thing, he thought it was something). He also said that he wants to find a gf and she said that she remembers what he did in his other relationship and that he treated the girl badly. He said that he only talked with her, and that she has a special place in his heart (she was in a relationship with me at that moment, it’s like admitting that they disrespect me). Their last message was him asking her to go out and she left him on read. 

After that she said that she didn’t even cared about him to cause a scene about him bad mounting me, he was just jealous and it was her fault that she still talked to him but she didn’t want to cause conflict, especially with someone as obsessed as him.

After that, she constantly left him on read until he got upset and blocked her.

Overall, she’s naive, non confrontational, a people pleaser, immature. He is comically unattractive and a total loser, I never took him seriously/saw him as a threat. However, the fact that she entertained the idea of him while she is in a relationship with me and didn’t stand up for me when he talked like that about me is something I can’t forget and find it disrespectful. She gave him more reasons to think he had a chance and to minimise me. It could even be cheating or a red flag of potential cheater.",0.64
"AITA for spoiling my sisters surprise for our birthday because of the Super Bowl? I (19M) am about to turn 20 this week. I have a twin sister, let’s call her X. X and I go to neighboring colleges nearby each other and so I planned a dinner with her next weekend to celebrate and eat yummy food. What she didn’t know is that I secretly invited my dad to the dinner without her knowledge. Her and my dad have always been super close all throughout our lives and I’ve always felt like the odd one out. I wanted my dad to come visit me for my birthday because I wanted to get closer to him but I was very confident he would say no because it didn’t involve my twin and we go to college far away. I also could not go home for my birthday because I have a busy class schedule and can’t miss any days. So I decided to plan a secret visit so my dad and I can surprise my twin with a visit from him.

Flash forward to today it’s the day after the Super Bowl and the chiefs won obviously. My dad and I are big football fans and my sister loves Taylor swift so we were all watching. Then I saw Travis Kelce, Taylor Swifts boyfriend, assault practically the head coach of the chiefs and immediately went to the family gc and told them how horrible and childish Travis behaved. And suddenly my dad decided to support Travis saying that it’s just passion and to stop bitching (his words) and that it wasn’t a big deal. We got into a huge fight and my sister started supporting my dad and saying that I was being dramatic. If yall haven’t seen the video, Kelce grabs the head coach (i am pretty sure he’s in his 60s) because he took him out of a play and the guy fumbled the play. He screams and jostles him until a teammate pulled him away. I think that behavior is unacceptable and should not be tolerated. He told me that he was going to block me because of this so I told him ok block me and don’t come to the dinner and spoiled the surprise because at that point I didn’t want him to come and I needed to set that boundary.

"AITA for wanting to confront my MIL and Fiancée for my BILs weird treatment towards me? My fiancé (20M) and I (21F) have reluctantly lived with his family since 2020 when we were 17. His family included MIL, Amber, youngest BIL, Matt (19M), and my fiancé, James. I helped their mom gain the courage to leave her abusive ex-husband, and we moved in together. But then I noticed Matt treating me poorly, slamming doors in my face, ignoring me, and making rude comments. He even talked badly about me to his mom while I was nearby. I allowed him to do those things to please him and keep our friendship. I would go to James's room and cry about it, but James and Amber brushed it off as Matt being moody and told me to move on. Things escalated when he talked shit about me to his mom, literally 5 feet away. All the emotions I buried came to the surface and I confronted his mom about what he said. She denied he said anything and defended him as usual. This led to a big fight with everyone in the house, and James called me crazy for reacting. I left but returned a few days later. Fast forward to a month ago, Matt has not spoken to me in 10 months but I still overhear him talking badly about me when he thinks I'm asleep. Since the fight, I've discovered his mom secretly meeting with him to talk shit about me, all while pretending to be friendly because she is unaware that I'm aware. This has been going on for months, similar to the last fight. When I informed James about it, he said he talked to them but they're never gonna change and should worry about moving out. I vented to James about catching Matt talking shit about me to his mom on the phone and Amber acting like we're friends but then talking shit with Matt. James comforted me while I cried. Then I left for my sister's place, only to find out that Matt had listened at our door on our conversation and twisted it up and said I said something awful about his mother. ""And James, how could you allow someone to insult your mom like that?"" (without specifying any specific remarks, just constantly repeating that) When James tried to explain to Amber what was said, Matt kept interrupting him and claimed that I brainwashed James, causing Amber to believe him and act as the victim. So I decided to stay at my sister's house after James informed me about the situation, and I expressed my initial reluctance to marry into a family like this (though I later took it back as it wasn't James's fault his family was like this). When I came back, I didn't speak to Amber for a week and began to hate Matt. Before I simply disliked him for his treatment of me but now I look at him with disgust. Despite James' continuous pleas for me to reconcile with his mom, I eventually gave in. However, Matt is now annoying me by purposefully separating my belongings from everyone else's - relocating dishes, piling their stuff on top of mine in the fridge, and kicking my shoes away from the shoe rack. AITA for addressing these recent petty annoyances to Amber and James? Or should I let it go?",0.58
"AITA for trying to talk to my ex after our breakup? i (21F) started dating a man (22M) around 4 months ago. i initially wasn't interested in dating, i just thought it would be a hookup and then over. but he asked me out and we started dating. he told me he wanted me to move with him for his new job after we graduate college in may. he was always so close, loving, and understanding. we would talk about plans we had with each other after graduation and the life we wanted to build together. we made plans to go on vacation next month. everything seemed great.

about a week and a half ago, he started barely texting me back. that night, i apologized to him because i had put a lot of stress on him about an issue i was dealing with when i should have directed those things to my therapist. throughout our entire relationship, we always emphasized how we wanted to talk to each other and avoid miscommunication. he never told me that my issues were a problem to him but i could tell that specific week it was an added stress to him, but something that i could learn not to do again. after i apologized, he said he appreciated it. the next day he tells me he thinks he's making me worse and he needs time and space to think. i told him i wanted to see him but he refused to see me. then a few days later he tells me something happened back home and he has to go home. he wouldn't let me see him and he didn't want to talk to me. this is weird to me because days before this he would have told me anything about his life. he stopped telling me that he loved me. he stopped telling me things about his life. the next day he texts me that he doesn't think we can give each other the emotional support we need. then i called him and we broke up. i wanted to know what was going on at home but he refused to tell me. then i finally got him to tell me and his father had a heart attack. ever since then, i have been trying to get him to talk to me. 

but to me, he changed suddenly one day. we would talk to each other about anything, we would listen and be there for each other. the good things, the bad things, the funny things. we'd tell each other if something bothered one of us. i had never trusted a man more in my life. the day i apologized to him was the day he was never the same again. it was the day i never knew anything about his life again. i am just so lost trying to understand why he would breakup with me. the day before he started acting different, we were still talking about moving in together and how much we loved each other. everything seemed normal. when i try to talk to him, he won't tell me anything about how his father is or how life is for him. he won't tell me why he broke up with me besides what he's already said. i keep texting him trying to get him to talk to me. i know it's wrong to bother him because of things he's dealing with at home. but i feel like i'm going crazy trying to understand what happened between us and why he has been so against seeing and talking to me since that day",0.86
"AITA for asking my girlfriend to help wash my car after a 3-day trip to Zion? I went on a 3-day trip with my girlfriend to Zion. I planned and paid for the whole trip. After the trip, the car was a little dirty. I asked my girlfriend if she could help me wash the car. She laughed at me and said, ""Are you out of your mind?"" She saw this as a form of labor abuse. I understand that it's common for women to be abused for their labor in a marriage, but I don't think this is the case. I was very disappointed and upset after that and we had a big fight.

"AITA for begging my boyfriend to leave his work function? For context, me (25f) and my boyfriend (33m) have been together for almost a year and a half. I am completing my masters at university and he’s been with his company for about 7 years. 

The company my boyfriend works for recently had their christmas party. It was my first time meeting most of his coworkers. I thought everyone was so nice and until I met his boss. 

At first his boss was very nice. I was trying to make a good first impression because I know how important this job is to my boyfriend. My boyfriend has steadily been moving up in the company and from what I understand he wants to be with this company until he retires. 

The interaction started with him complementing my dress and he told me my boyfriend was very lucky to have me which I thought was very nice. He asked me about my job and I explained that I’m still in university. It took a turn for the worst when he made a sexist comment along the lines of “it’s a waste for women to get a higher education when they usually become stay at home moms anyways.” I let it slide because it didn’t seem like an appropriate time or place to share my opinion. He then went on to make a comment about how my beauty would be wasted working in a lab where no one could see me. I told him that I didn’t appreciate that comment and I am very proud of myself for being a woman in a male dominated industry. He told me there’s a reason it’s a male dominated industry and that was my last straw. I told him that history has been on a man’s side and that is one of the leading reasons for it being male dominated. His response was “I think you’ve had too much to drink.” So I politely excused myself because I could not stand to be apart of that conversation any longer. 

I didn’t want to cause a scene but I very desperately wanted to leave. I told my boyfriend that I felt disrespected and I was no longer enjoying myself. I told him I really wanted to leave and it would’ve been a $100+ uber ride (that’s a lot of money to me right now) so I begged my boyfriend to take me home. My boyfriend said there’s no way he’s leaving, he wants to be here and show that he’s a company man and it’d look bad if he left right now. He then told me that he would be very upset if I left because he supports me at my university events and he expects me to do the same. 

I left anyways and I planned on telling him the details of what had happened at a later date because I didn’t want to ruin his night. When I went to explain what had happened he didn’t want to hear it. His boss told him I made a fool of myself and that my acting inappropriately is a bad look for my boyfriend. My boyfriend said it was an asshole thing of me to do and he needs time to think.",0.38
"AITA for asking my roommate to have the blinds open My roommate (18,F) and I (18,F) live in one room together in a dorm room. We live on one of the top floors of a tall building and the view is amazing but for some reason she always closes the blinds. I personally like natural light and the ability to see outside. 

It’s important to note our blinds block out pretty much all light and it is the only window in the room. Our room is arranged in a way that I am closest to the window and she is honestly quite far away. In addition she always wants to keep the temperature in the room at 50 degrees (which is the lowest possible temperature on the thermostat) which makes it even colder with the blinds closed.

She has always acted like this since I met her and always closed the blinds as well as turned the temperature down making it way too cold for me. Recently she got a bit sick and asked if we could keep the blinds closed and the temperature down because the light hurt her eyes and she was feeling too warm. I always grew up with the idea that when you’re sick you should stay warm because the temperature helps fight the germs and sunlight kills bacteria but perhaps she is different. 

I agreed and then three days later I went to open the blinds but she said she wanted to keep them closed because she still couldn’t deal with the light. Even though the night before she was able to stare directly at her laptop for hours that was so bright I had to ask her to turn it down because it was even bothering me while I tried to sleep. In addition her loud noises and videos don’t seem to bother her sensitivities at all. For example she watched the superbowl all last night while yelling and laughing loudly with her sister over ft.

I want to be considerate of her when she is sick but I really like natural light and feel claustrophobic when I can’t see outside of a room. We also have such a nice view and it seems a shame to waste it. So far she still wants to keep the blinds closed and I’m not sure what to do. Am I in the wrong in this situation for not respecting what seems like sensory issues? What should I do?",0.04
"AITA My Husband keeps making excuses to get out of work. Am I the asshole? My husband wasn't able to work for 2 years but was finally able to get a job in November. He took the first job that was offered to him as a night stocker at Walmart. The hours aren't my favorite since I work during the day, but we are able to get some time together during the evenings. 

He is mad at me because I'm ""making"" him go to work. For a little context, this is his first long term full time job. He got covid soon after starting and had to take a week off and then has taken off several more days for various things like feeling sick after getting a vaccine and generally feeling unwell.

He complains almost every day, begging to not go to work. He makes me feel like an asshole when I tell him he has to go. He doesn't get paid for the hours he doesn't work. We are in huge debt from the 2 years he was unemployed.

Today he's complaining his arm is in so much pain after work last night and does not want to go tonight. He finally has enough PTO to get paid for a single day off and wants to use it tonight. I told him he should save it for an emergency. Am I the asshole?",0.42
"AITA for wanting my boyfriend (22m) to spend more time with me (23f) and have less personal time? This has been a frequent topic for us. Me and my partner lived together for around a year and a half, due to unforseen circumstances we have had to live apart (nothing to do with our relationship but to do with our finances and the fact we are no longer studying.) 

He visits me a couple times a month and likewise myself with him. However I always seem more eager about wanting to spend time together. He is an independent person anyway but I feel like he should miss me a bit. 

To put it into context a few weeks ago he told me he was staying with myself for a few days whilst he was off work. He stayed for around 3 days before telling me he was heading home. I found this bizarre as I knew he had another three days off work and asked.if he could stay longer as I have missed him. He said no. When I asked why he said there was no reason why other than he wanted time to himself at home. It just made me sad because I don't get to see him as much as I did obviously when we lived together, don't get me wrong he's completely entitled to time to himself but if it were me I'd want to spend as much time together as possible before we don't see one another for another two weeks. I just didn't understand why he didn't stay an extra day or two.

Tonight I asked him what time he was coming to stay tomorrow and he told me the afternoon so I asked roughly what time that would be. He told me around 4pm, which baffled me as again he has the day off and travelling to each other isn't a long journey. I asked if he could come earlier and he said no because he needs to pack still. He goes to bed quite late so I asked him why he doesn't pack tonight so we have more time together and he answered with oh I just want to relax and have time to myself. He's been off for 2 whole days doing nothing. I don't want to seem unreasonable I just feel like you should want to spend as much time as possible with me and also have time to yourself by going home a day or two earlier. When I told him how I felt he replied with oh don't start. I just don't feel very heard. I'm not trying to be difficult, I just miss his company. I don't think he misses mine. But I feel like such a nag asking him to spend time with me and getting into arguments about it.

Am I the asshole for asking him to come and spend time with me earlier and thinking he's being unreasonable?",0.17
"AITA For Punishing My Son Over Irresponsibility? My (46f) son (M13) ""Nate""  isn't the most responsible when it comes to his stuff, or at least is selective with it. For his age, it's always been frustrating how often I have to tell him to pick up his phone from the table when leaving restaurants, remember his AirPods, or remember to bring his water bottle home. He is also very smart but damn some of his actions can be really stupid. 

&#x200B;

Ok so this specific situation is about my Nate's Chromebook charger. The school lets him take it home for assignments and stuff, but when my other son needed to charge his Chromebook, they were no chargers in the house so I asked Nate if he had seen out, to which he said he brought it to school. Since none of the chargers were in the house, I assumed he had probably brought his, lost it, and brought his brother's, then lost it again. Something similar happened earlier with jackets. 

&#x200B;

Because of the fact, which he did not deny to, I took his phone and told him that he would get it back when he gets both chargers back. And if he didn't, I would his birthday money (which is in my possession) and buy new ones ($15 each). 

&#x200B;

My husband thinks it's too much over a Chromebook charger, but I think that this smaller thing will make its way into bigger problems, and I dont want that I think im teaching him responsibility.

"AITA Ex brought his new girlfriend to my home I am separated from my husband, we are in the process of divorcing. We share custody of the dog we had for seven years before we separated. This is relevant as this is why he was at my house, to pick up the dog for a vet appointment as the vet is closer to his home.

Some back story, I've known his current girlfriend longer than him and I've known him for 30 years. Her and I have a bad history, she once filed a false police report against me (I'm not the only person she's weaponized police against) and she's stolen from me in the past. I also know she's neglectful to her own animals, or at least always was. She is not welcome in my home, obviously. 

This past weekend he brought her to pick up the dog and without even asking brought her into my home. I kept relatively cool about it only because my son was here too but I was shaking with anger.

On top of this, during the exchange he gave her the dogs leash. Ok fine but the dog tried to get away and slipped it's collar. I live by a busy highway and this could have been horrific. It also could have been avoided if she had of taken a couple of steps towards him instead of pulling hard on the leash. 

After they left I messaged him and told him if he's going to let his girlfriend have control of the dog then he needs to watch her better because I will lose my mind if something happens to that animal because of negligence. 
He replied to me saying that his girlfriend assumed that if she kept pulling the collar would just keep tightening, essentially choking out my dog and making him stop moving (it's a martingale, they do tighten but they do not choke). He also pointed out that her dog is always on a harness so she doesn't have to worry about these things. I feel like anyone controlling a dog should have basic knowledge on how a collar works.

I'm furious both at him bringing her here (he drove both ways, no need for her to even be on my property let alone in my house) and how she apparently treats my dog. 

Of course according to him I'm a bitter asshole for having issues with any of this. I assure you I'm not bitter, I left him and am happy about that decision. I really think I was reasonable considering.
So am I an asshole?",0.95
"AITA for parking in front of my neighbor's house? 4 cars total, Dad has two cars (one work van, and one personal car), Mom has one SUV, and I recently got a smaller coupe car. Our neighborhood is a newer development so houses are built closer with little driveway and curb space. As a result, only 3 spots are available close to the house (two on the driveway, and one on the curb). 

I parked in front of my neighbor's house (an older woman, who has one car) living across the street a couple of times. An incident happened and my car was out of commission for 2 days, resulting in it being in front of my neighbor's house for an extended period. This resulted in her leaving a condescending, passive-aggressive note mentioning how we've caused her a few near-misses due to the blindspot, and how we should park in front of our ""rental unit"" (it's not apparent we were renting, hinting that she researched our address.) A bunch of nonsense.

Ever since that note, she'll park her only car out on the curb in front of her house. And a few days before garbage day (36 hours before), she'll park her garbage cans SPREAD OUT across the curb. Am I having bad manners by parking in front of her house? It's not like she needs the parking spot having only one car. She also could've been a little bit nicer about it, but I also find it funny how she spends most of her time patrolling the parking spot strategically preventing anyone from parking there.

"AITA for making my roommate keep me on the lease? I (24F) live with one roommate (24F) in a two bed two bath apartment. We’ve lived together for a couple years, things have been mostly smooth with small bumps here and there. 

I’m in graduate school, and after I finish classes I will be moving out of state. I finish classes May 21st. Our lease is up March 31st. My roommate is hoping to stay in the same apartment and get a new roommate. We had talked previously about extending the lease two months or signing a new lease with three people on it and then dropping me after two months, which our building will let us do. She had shown no issues with this plan before.

Yesterday, we talked and apparently she’s been looking for new roommates and telling them all they can move in April 1st. She did not tell me this until I asked. She said she’s focused on making sure she has affordable housing next year, and is worried that a two month lease extension will increase her rent for next year. We signed an early bird deal our building did last year that kept our rent the same. They did not do the same deal this year, so I had already assumed her rent was going to increase. She thinks that if she just renews again, it will stay the same.

She told me her Plan A is to find a roommate to move into the apartment April 1st. I don’t have a backup plan as to where I could live for two months, as short term leases are very expensive. I told her I was frustrated, her response was that she has to think of herself first. I told her we can just find someone willing to move in June!! Our apartment complex WILL let me drop off the lease! 

So AITA for expecting her to find a June move in? I feel a bit like she’s kicking me out and doesn’t care that I don’t really have a place to live. I don’t have any family nearby and most friends live in small places that couldn’t house another person for two months.

"AITA for wanting my boyfriend to stop using nicotine when I smoke weed? Me (23F) and my boyfriend (24M) have been dating for almost a year now. It has been by far the best relationship I’ve been in: he opens every door, always buys me flowers, makes me breakfast in bed, basically does anything I would ask of him.

The only issue is his nicotine use. He’s been addicted to vaping since he was in high school with only a few extended periods where he quit. When we started dating, I told him I did not like nicotine (never used it and never will) but am okay with him doing it occasionally at parties or socially with friends, just not ALL the time. This was all fine until recently when we took a week-long vacation with his friends where he was hitting their vapes the whole time. To no surprise, when we got home he bought a vape. He told me “I swear I’m not going to buy another one after this!”. 

To no surprise again, he ended up buying another vape about 1 week after he finished the first one. It started to really bother me so I brought it up. He said he would let me throw it away, so I did. 

As a compromise to not hitting a vape all day, he asked if he could just buy a pack of cigarettes. That way he would only have one a day, out of sight, and I wouldn’t have to watch him hit a vape all day. He said again “this will be my only pack and then I’ll stop” and while I had my doubts I said okay.

 To no surprise (x3), he bought a new pack the day after finishing the first one. At this point now he’s smoking around 1-2 cigarettes a day and I regret even telling him I was fine with that in the first place. 

HOWEVER, to give complete context, I smoke weed about every day out of a bong. To him, this seems no different than him smoking a cigarette so he doesn’t understand why I’d be upset. I think weed is pretty different, because while you can still get addicted it’s not a chemical addiction the way nicotine is. It’s certainly not healthy by any means, but I really don’t think long term weed use has the same consequences as cigarettes. Especially when I consume only around 1/2 a bowl per day. 

Am I the asshole for getting upset that he smokes cigarettes now when I also smoke a different substance? Should I give him some leeway since we both have vices? I really don’t think this is worth ruining our relationship but it’s just very hard for me to get past right now…",0.69

All of that being said the other day they both ended up calling me  a couple hours apart pissed at each other telling me they dont know what to do the cheating out of control the fighting out of control. He says he cant stand her and wants to break up but doesnt want to lose his kid she says shes worried if they break up he wont make an effort to see her. He says they are definitely not together, she says he says that but is still treating her like a gf. It was a lot tbh but essentially what I told them was the exact same thing dont engage when things are heated, if you want to be together stop cheating and be honest, if you dont want to be together be prepared to do it on your own. Theres also some dispute over a girl he works with all he told me is he likes her and they play pokemon go, his gf told me that hes been flirting and deleting messages I told both of them it sounds like a crush and I told him not to rebound with her to focus on himself and I told her if hes going to flirt with other girls then she needs to set boundaries and not make herself available to him. The main thing I said to both of them was to focus on their own mental and emotional health to consider therapy and what they want from the relationship and that court might be necessary. All in all I thought I kept things very neutral I maybe favored my brother a bit because he and i are close and his gf hasn't really given me a chance to get to know her in the past. But the truth is I feel bad for both of them they had a teen pregnancy and to their credit they've tried to make it work and that's tough. Somehow they're both pissed at me I woke up yesterday to texts from both of them calling me twofaced and a liar and to basically stay out of their lives then they blocked me. I'm pretty shocked but my best guess is they both took the parts they wanted from what I said and lied to each other. I dont think I'm the asshole tbh and my husband was there for both calls and agreed that I was neutral and told them the same things but I'm pregnant and emotional about everything so this has been driving me nuts so I thought I'd get a second opinion.

"AITAH for not going home for 3 weeks? To preface this
I am 24 and still in college. I still live at home because my parents said I don’t have to work until I graduate so I can focus on school. I’ve had a set back or two because mental health reasons which is why it’s taking so long. My brother passed away in 2019 (there was confusion, it’s been years since he passed. I just wanted to add that in case anybody in here was like “oh why are you still living at home? You should move out” my parents some problem with it, so.) and then the nursing program I was in became too much to try and handle with that so I took a break. 

Fast forward to now, over Christmas. I told my mom that I was going to go to my boyfriend‘s house for a few hours after we got done cooking because that’s what we do every year. We never do anything for Christmas. It’s not like a big holiday for us. His family didn’t invite him anywhere so I said I would come over a few hours and she got really upset by this for some reason like why wasn’t I spending time with family this was family time and I’m like… 1. We never do anything so I didn’t think a few hours with my boyfriend was going to be a big deal since it’s like another day to us. 2. She always tells me the story about how she spent hanksgiving with my dad and his family when she was my age.

And then three weeks ago we got into a big argument over it again and like I spoke up for myself because I was like you keep treating me like I’m this bad person because I wanted to spend a few hours with my boyfriend and we also got into about something else but that’s really personal so I’m not gonna share it here but I just feel like I’m held to these diff but I just feel like I’m held to these different standards than she is or my younger brother is.

A little later he told me this resident (sara for convenience) was asking around if he had a girlfriend, i asked if he told her and he said it would be weird to reach out to her just to say “hey i have a girlfriend” which I agreed with. I later find out that he has her on snap and they snap regularly (she is on his best friends list) he says it’s because i don’t go on snap, which is true so i let this go too. I find out yesterday that she came to find him when she was drunk and tell him that she really wishes he didn’t have a girlfriend, and i asked him if he told her he does and he said no because “she wouldn’t have remembered anyways” this caused a fight between us but he apoligized in the form or taking care of me when i was really sick (103° fever). well since he is a CA he has to go to events his hall hosts so i stayed in his room sick as a dog while he went to the event.

"AITA for making my boyfriend uninvite his friends to a birthday celebration? My (26f) birthday is coming up this week and my boyfriend (30m) said we could celebrate by hosting a small gathering this weekend. 

I don’t really know anyone outside his social circle since I’ve been working from home since I moved to this city. That means the gathering would be made up of his friends entirely. I don’t dislike his friends but we don’t really get along. Whenever we get together we exchange pleasantries but they rarely involve me in their conversation. It’s also hard to involve myself since they mostly talk about their “glory days” back when they were in college. 

When he first brought up the idea a few weeks back I asked him for a few days to think about it, I eventually told him that’s not something I wanted. He told me he had already invited them so I told myself I’d just deal with it. 

He brought it up again today and it just caught me in a bad moment. I told him it wasn’t a celebration for my birthday if they’re just going to talk only to each other, play music I don’t like, eat food I don’t like and then leave me a mess to clean up. He said it would celebrate me because they would be there because of me. 

A couple minutes later I headed towards the bedroom and when he asked me what was wrong I told him I wasn’t happy that he invited his friends when I asked him not to. He angrily replied he would uninvite them. 

I now feel bad and I’m afraid I’m being unappreciative of his efforts. He surely did this to ensure I wouldn’t feel alone and could have a little bit of a “party”. I’m also afraid that he could take it as an attack against his friends who have never been hostile towards me. AITA?",0.82
"AITA for wanting to move back home while pregnant with my second child? 
Me and my husband wanted to try things out in a big city. My husband is from that small town while I grew up in L.A. I liked this new city at first but things started getting depressing because it always rained. I knew staying here was temporary for my mental health and have expressed that to my husband several times that I wanted to move back home to the small town. My 3 aunts still live there and would be a big help to the new baby.

Our living situation is this: we live with his brother, uncle, and grandma.

Living here for 6 years I found out I was pregnant with my first child. I was told from uncle, brother, and grandma that they would help with the baby if I needed a break. Well, no one felt comfortable taking care of a baby so I was having to become a stay at home mom for a while until my baby turned into a toddler. My son is now 2 and I found out I’m having a second. 

I want to move back close to family and out of a house with so many people. It’s hard to keep up with cleaning and living in the city is getting too expensive for our budget. My husband also is starting to hate his job so he’s needing a fresh start back home. 

The problem is this: we need to sell our house. My husband and his uncle have a mortgage on the house which grew equity over the years. His uncle is not wanting to look for new places to live with his mom. He doesn’t want us to leave and making it seem like we’re ruining his life. If we sell we promised to split the equity 50/50. It seems like we have always found places to live for him, and at a time where he would have to look himself he blames us for it. It seems to me that he doesn’t want to do any work to look for places to live other than the house we bought. 

The house we bought is very old and needs some work. Like a new roof, new outside deck, a fixed fence, and many small repairs that we have been doing ourselves. He has done nothing to this house and has been living in clutter in the basement. I can’t live like this anymore!

The thing that makes me seem like an asshole is that it all started with me becoming pregnant again. As soon as I mentioned that we would have to move back due to costs he flipped and started saying how we’re ruining his life. It put a strain in his and my husband’s relationship and now the uncle won’t even talk to us normally. He even mentioned bringing a lawyer in the mix which caused my husband to feel threatened. He’s still angry about it and how his uncle is taking this change. He even threatened to refuse to sell the house. What then? 

I’m due at the end of May and plan to put the house on the market in April. We plan on moving with a newborn as crazy as it sounds. 

TLDR: AITA for wanting to sell our house and move to the town my husband grew up in, straining my husband’s relationship with his uncle?",0.1
"AITA for living with my family for free I 22 moved back home with my mom and brother 6 months ago. I had health issues which made keeping a job hard, and couldn't afford to see a doctor. I am now in a much better condition, though I still have health issues. 

I got a job 3 months ago working 20 hours a week at 15/hr. I do have bills that I pay for such as medical, and insurance, and I buy my own groceries of course. My plan was to take what is outside of that, and put it in savings so I will actually be able to afford a place in a year or 2. I'm hoping to move to family in a different country, as I know the cost of living is better their, I just need to save up to get there.

Currently, I have not been able to put any money into savings because I have been trying to fix my credit score. See my mom bought hearing aids under my name in 2020, and has not paid 1 penny to it. she also used my credit card to buy my Christmas present, or herself a Christmas present from me. which were tickets to a musical for us 2. It's old fights I am done battling, and I decided while I am making money, I should go ahead and try to pay all of that back so my cc score can recover. I worked out a plan, and for the hearing aids alone it should take me a year to pay off. I should start saving up a little bit in March though.

My brother, however, is mad that I don't pay rent. My mom just lost her job. She only worked 6 hours a week at 10/hr, but she doesn't even have that anymore. 6 months ago, right when I moved in, my mom received her divorce settlement, and put the money in my brother's account. She did this so she can get food stamps which we still don't have. Anyways, he sees that we are down half that settlement and he is freaking out. He says if I don't pay rent, then I am throwing our mom out on the street. 

His stance is that I don't care if our mother becomes homeless. My stance is, she is a grown ass woman, I'm not paying for her not to work. I am grateful she let me move back home, I know other people my age sometimes pay rent (no one I know, tho), but not only has she never asked me too, it would be really hard for me to even try. If I pay rent then what would be the purpose of me even moving back home. I am here so I can get secure enough to pay rent somewhere else. 

I don't think it's unreasonable to live rent free with your parents as an adult. I'm not completely dependent on her, I just need a place to go home too. However, I can see his point. I did get a job, and she might need help financially soon, though that point hasn't come yet. I don't want her to be homeless either. I do feel that I shouldn't pay her rent because she can't maintain responsibility of the house, until she actually needs help. She still has time to go get a job, and I think if I pay for it now, it will create codependency, because I can't save up to leave, and she relies on me too get but. thoughts?",0.36

"AITA- argument with another parent over yelling at a game We were at my child’s play-off game and emotions were running high. My child is one of the better players on the team and my husband coaches. My son also has ADHD and has trouble self regulating emotions. He clearly was not in a good headspace and was crying on the bench and visibly frustrated through the game. The team was losing- all kids really played poorly. 

Toward the end of the game, my son yelled that someone needed to throw in the ball. My son’s position does not throw in the ball. One of the father’s yelled back in a snotty tone “you can throw it in too you know” and shakes his head. I called his name and said- don’t yell at my kid. I said emotions are high and they are just kids. He said “just stop- if you really want to get into this I’ll talk to you after the game”. 

After the game, I asked him to step into the hallway. I said I didnt think it was okay that he yelled at my son in front of a whole group of people. That he made it seem like my son was a brat who didn’t want to throw in the ball. I was going to add that it wasn’t the role of my son’s position and he cut me off. He said that it was my insinuation that’s what was said and he never said that. He said it’s in my head but if I really want him to go there I won’t like what he has to say. He said this is just you and I’m not going there.

I said maybe I misinterpreted his intention and was going to try to resolve but he wouldn’t let me get a word in and was visibly shaking with anger. He said he couldn’t talk to me right now and this was absolutely ridiculous. His wife then starts to tell the other parents that I had the audacity to ask him to step outside. 

Apparently the other coach thought my son yelled at the angry guy’s son which I didn’t see and didn’t know at the time. 

Even if my son did yell at his kid, why didn’t he say something to me about it? Why yell at my kid like
An immature asshole then tell everyone that I’m ridiculous? I never once yelled.

 My  opinion is this guy is wayyyyyy out of line. My husband thinks he had a right to be annoyed with our son but shouldn’t have yelled. He chalked it up to high emotions. I get that- but what about all the shit after? He blatantly disregarded me as this overbearing mom.

So I have to ask- am I the asshole?",0.92

"AITA for refusing to eat cooked chicken that had been out of the fridge for 24 hours? So me (26M) and my neighbor (25F) are really close. We text every day, spend a lot of time together, were romantically involved in the past but not anymore.  

However, we still eat together, and she offers to cook for me a few times a week.  

Recently she’s been giving me 3-4 boxes of chicken, rice and veggies for me to take to work.  

The other day I went to her apartment to pick them up and realized they were still on plates on her dining table and not in boxes, I asked her when she cooked everything and she said she cooked it yesterday.  

I was kind of incredulous “you want me to eat chicken that’s been sitting at room temperature for 24 hours?”  

She said yes, it didn’t matter, it wasnt room temperature because the apartment is cold.  

I asked her why she didn’t put it in the fridge and she said it didn’t make a difference since she didn’t have anything to cover it with.  

I calmly left and said I wasn’t going to eat it and that she had to throw it away, but that I’d pay for the ingredients. She was angry, but more because of the effort she spent making it rather than the money.  

We had somewhat of a debate over text about whether it was safe or not, I insisted that it wasn’t and that in my home country we have pretty strict health safety standards, she insisted it was fine.  

Ultimately she agreed to keep it in the fridge next time she cooks and I’m not close by to collect it right away.  

A little added context too, she often cooks and uses the same chopsticks to pick up raw and cooked food (yes chicken) I’ve told her she needs to stop doing this but she says that the heat from the pan will kill the germs on the chopsticks. So this isn’t the first time we’ve had a food safety disagreement.  

I was a little angry and upset, but knew that I shouldn’t direct any of that toward her because she was the one who was being so kind as to cook for me and do all the work that came with it, so I stayed calm the whole time. She was fairly calm for the most part but was upset and angry at me too. 

Which of us is right? AITA?",0.04
"AITA video game character ATIA for

Okay so let me give you some background here, I am a female in a relationship with my female partner,  I’m lesbian, she’s bi. alright cool

So before my partner and I get into a relationship I was lowkey obsessed with a woman video game character, my I repeat, VIDEO GAME. CHARACTER

So, my partner and I are playing said game together and it has that female character I really like in this one scene. I admit, the VIDEO GAME character is attractive,  but I am NOT in love with her nor do I want to do anything with said VIDEO GAME CHARACTER. 
My partner is getting real jealous over the comments about her appearance I have made about the character during the the play through of the game. And I have brought up multiple times that she is not real. She says “if she was real though, you’d f*** her” 
I am not, nor have I ever, commented on the appearance real life women, but she has stated a few times that “this guy is good looking in my class” or “this football player is really attractive to me” 
She’s said she’s not interested but still. So here’s my question. Should she be jealous over the “jokes” I’ve made about a FAKE MADE UP VIDEO GAME CHARACTER? Should I be jealous over the comments she made about IN REAL LIFE MEN?

Like who’s the asshole here?

"AITA for using the bathroom after I was told not to? I (M20) and my girlfriend (F21) are currently visiting her family because it’s her little brothers birthday. Everything was going well until last night. They are currently having renovations done to the house and asked us to only use the upstairs bathroom because the water in our ensuite has been disconnected. 

Last night I woke up in the middle of the night feeling extremely sick. I’m not sure if it was something I ate or a stomach bug but I was about to throw up. I wouldn’t have made it to the upstairs bathroom in time so I went into the ensuite and immediately threw up in the toilet there.

I couldn’t flush it obviously and I panicked and woke up my girlfriend because I didn’t want to upset her parents but didn’t know what to do. She said this was my problem, that I needed to fix it. I did my best to clean it up, and used a bucket to manually fill the cistern.

The next morning I told her parents what happened and they said it was ok but were really quiet the rest of the day. The whole weekend has been really awkward since then and when I mentioned it to my GF she said it was because I betrayed their trust and didn’t respect their boundaries.

I call bullshit and think it was reasonable given what happened but I don’t want to start problems and it seems like I’ve really upset them??

"WIBTA if i brought up my neighbors having EMS come by nearly every day to my landlord? i moved into an apartment complex on my own late last year, and i've mostly had no issues! however i've noticed that for the past two months, my neighbors across the street are having more and more frequent trips from EMS. at first it'd be the whole fleet with lights on at random times during the day, then eventually it was just a firetruck precisely between 11am-12pm with no lights. now we've gone back to ambulances with lights at totally random times

i figure the person has some kind of chronic health condition that requires daily intervention and (assuming, since these apartments are income restricted) can't afford home care, so EMS has to be involved fairly regularly. that would explain the daily-ish visits without lights. the silent, single vehicles during the day are absolutely no problem, and they don't stay very long at all!

however, i have a condition that makes my vision sensitive to light and essentially blocks out my full field of vision when i see flashing lights, so i have to stay inside when they come with lights on. if it was even once a week i really wouldn't care, but this keeps happening more and more frequently. i'm considering mentioning it to my landlord in the event they could do anything, even just seeing if there's a way to request they come with their lights off, but WIBTA in that case? i don't want anything bad to happen to my neighbors, i just want to be able to see when i go outside lol",0.88
AITA for not letting my mom bring her puppy to my house I just need some advice I am a 34f and I own a home with my husband 39M we have 3 kids. Two of my kids are old enough to go to school but my youngest is only 2 and my mother watches him for us when we go to work. But today I found out she got a puppy. I am happy she has one don’t get me wrong but it’s a puppy and it will poop and pee all over the house if it’s not watched and taken care of. I have talked it over with my husband about how she wasn’t even going to say anything to us about it and just show up with the puppy. I have asked her not to bring the puppy here to my house and she got upset and told me she won’t watch my son for us anymore.

"AITA for asking my 18y son to pay rent? I’m a single dad 54M of two kids, daughter 24 who had moved out two years ago to live with her boyfriend, and my son 18 who is living with me. He part time studies and part time works casual jobs, mostly as a kitchen hand, waiter or as a shop assistant. 

I used to have a small business but due to covid lockdowns and my health issues I had to close it in ‘22 and found it quite hard to get a decent job in my age. So I work low paid casual jobs like my son.

Needless to say I’m not doing very well financially. So asked my son to contribute while he’s living at home, $100 per week to help with the bills and food. 

Unfortunately he didn’t take it well. He argues that when his sister was living with us she didn’t have to pay rent and that’s true but that was a different time. I still had my business back then and money wasn’t a big issue. But now I’m in a very different situation, barely scraping by. 

I tried to reason with him that if I found a roommate I could get $200 per week and wouldn’t have to feed him either (let me tell you that a teenage boy eats a lot more than a teenage girl) so $100 seems reasonable. 

But his argument is that my money troubles is not of his problem. Which is kind of true. I get it that he thinks it’s unfair, and that his sis had it easier. I would really really love to make it the same for him as I did for her but the times have changed. I can’t possibly provide the same standard that I could 6 yrs ago. 

AITA for asking my son to contribute?

Update: we’re not in the US, so don’t get too hung up on the $100 p/w. For context we rent our 2 bedroom house rents for around $600 p/w, a roommate would pay around $180 to $220 p/w for a room (incl power but no food obviously). And these are standard prices around here, not a high end or anything. Keep in mind that not every dollar is a US dollar.",0.21
"WIBTAH if I drop my class and not tell my parents who pay my tuition? Hello, I (19f) live at home with my parents who support me. I am currently in school and made the huge mistake of taking a class with a professor who had a 1 star rating on rate my professor.com. The class I am failing is calculus 2 and we are over halfway through the quarter. I have no hope of an academic comeback whatsoever. I am also applying to universities as I am only in community college right now. Withdrawing from the class would cost me nothing gpa wise, I just wouldn’t earn the credits. The credits are not a big deal to me as I am ahead of schedule for graduating with an AA this year. I just feel guilty not telling my parents because I wouldn’t get a refund and i feel bad for wasting 600 dollars just to drop a class when I am not the one paying my tuition, my parents are. I know I can succeed but this class has a professor whom you know hates life. To emphasize, there is no chance of me gaining extra credit or accruing any more points for my grade, unless I ace my exams, which I had failed. So there’s really no hope.",0.75
"AITA for my boyfriend not being able to unclog the toilet? maybe a bit of a tmi but me and my boyfriend (both 18) live together in a single bedroom apartment and a single bath. i just got out of surgery and i have been prescribed a ton of narcotics and opioids that make me extremely constipated. needless to say, i was able to poop today and it was a big one to say the least. i was able to flush it but it ended up clogging our toilet. 

i was super embarrassed to ask for help, but my boyfriend is always willing to help me so i let him know. he was fine with it until he realized how bad the situation was. to be fair, i would’ve dealt with the problem myself but being that i just had surgery i am not able to raise my arms or do any pulling motion with my chest without tearing my stitches or causing pain. 

we get to work and he starts to try and plunge out the toilet, it isn’t working for about a couple of minutes (not even 10) and he starts to complain about how it’s not working and how he wants to just give up. i’m already embarrassed at this point for a lot of things, having to ask him for help, the sight of it, the smell of it, and just causing the problem in general. i get a bit worked up because he is just complaining and not trying at all- and is doing it pretty badly. he doesn’t try to find any new solutions and just lazily keeps complaining. 

i get a bit frustrated at this and tell him to just give it to me, i end up being able to fix it despite my arms aching from having my surgery and i’m pretty pissed off at my boyfriend for complaining so much. he tells me after that he wanted to do it but i had taken it away from him. however the only reason why i took it away is because i didn’t want to hear him complain and bitch about it.

"AITA for not attending a birthday party?   
A close friend of mine invited me to his son's birthday party three weeks in advance. His son and my daughter are the same age and are friends. I mentioned that I might be busy that weekend since my parents were planning to visit us. He suggested that I bring my parents along to the birthday party.  
After consulting with my parents, we canceled a short trip we had planned for that weekend to attend my friend's son's birthday party. Over the following three weeks, our families went on various outings together, and the birthday party was informally discussed. It was mentioned that a formal invitation would be sent to us with the details, and the party was expected to be held during the daytime with catering. We were looking forward to it and even purchased gifts for the birthday boy. I was expecting a casual call from him the day before the party.  
However, that call never came. On the day of the party, we waited for any word from him, assuming that perhaps the party was canceled for personal reasons. We had our lunch late, and my parents were napping when I received a call from my friend at 4:30 pm, asking why we were not at his party, which had started at 4 pm and was scheduled until 5 pm. I was taken aback since we had never discussed such an unusual timing. Given the mention of catering, I was unsure how to respond to this sudden and abrupt call.  
I politely declined, explaining that we had already eaten a late lunch and had other plans for the evening. I also mentioned that we would like to visit on another day for a small celebration. Later, his wife called my wife to invite us over in the evening, but my wife also declined, citing our prior engagement.  
Since then, their family has cut off all contact with us. They neither answer our phone calls nor respond to our messages. This situation has been weighing heavily on me. AITA for not attending a birthday party?",0.64
"AITA for asking my brother to consider rescheduling his wedding? My older brother and his fiance decided that they wanted to have a very small wedding ceremony at a lakefront cottage next fall...on a Wednesday...  
For context, I'm in medical school (and will still be in medical school next fall), so life for me can be pretty hectic in terms of my class schedule, clinical rotations, and of course tons of studying. And while these various obligations can be taxing, they alone obviously wouldn't ever prevent me from attending my own brother's wedding.  
However, I just found out we have a scheduled final exam the Friday after his proposed Wednesday wedding ceremony next fall. Unfortunately, rescheduling/moving a final exam is simply not an option for me.  
Furthermore, the proposed wedding is an 8 hour drive from where I live (excluding stops and such). And to make life even harder, the location of the wedding is about 2 hours from the nearest regional airport. So any thought of flying would mean that I would have to make a connection and THEN have to drive two hours on top of that. Altogether flying would probably take just as long, if not longer, than driving (not to mention would also be more costly). So regardless, I would be looking at 8+ hours of travel each way.  
And just to be thorough, we as medical students DO have several classes/sessions every week where we have to physically be present on campus. Unfortunately my school is pretty stringent about what qualifies as an excused absence, so I'm not sure 'my brother getting married' would qualify as an excusable absence. But even if they did grant me the excuse absence, I would still be obligated to complete the make-up work, which is always obscenely laborious (likely as punishment for missing class). So in addition to the final exam and travel time, the added burden of missing class is, well, a burden.  
All told, I am kind of frustrated that my brother didn't even run his proposed wedding date by me beforehand. Especially when you consider that they're only inviting like 16 people in the first place, so if you're only inviting immediate family/closest friends, at least make sure everyone on your tiny guest list can make it. I'm also frustrated by his decision to have it on a Wednesday??? Like if it's on a weekend that's a lot more manageable for me since I won't have to miss class. He obviously knows I am in medical school, so I think it's a pretty selfish move to not even consider what my availability might look like.  
The good news is that I'm not sure if anything in terms of dates/reservations/accommodations are finalized yet, so perhaps he can change the date without too much of a headache. Nevertheless, AITA for asking him to change his wedding date?",0.46

"AITA for cursing at my grandparents? My paternal grandparents were never really a big part of my life. I can count on one hand the number of times I (18m) saw them. It fits since their son (my father) was a terrible parent and a terrible husband to my mom. He was never around when we needed him, he cheated on my mom a ton, abandoned her after she got injured when I was a kid, wasn't around for me and even when my mom died he was just not there. I was raised by my maternal grandparents after my mom died. The last time I saw him was when he showed up at my grandparents house and yelled at them for filing for child support. The last time I saw my paternal grandparents was my mom's funeral. They showed up and scolded my family (my mom's parents and siblings) for badmouthing their son during the funeral. They didn't even say anything to me while they were there.

My father died sometime last year. I wasn't in touch with him and knew nothing about his life at that point. My paternal grandparents called to tell me two days after it happened. They wanted me to attend the funeral and they wanted me to meet the kid he had with the woman he was married to (first I learned of both of those things). I said no and told them I was busy living my life without him staining it anymore. They told me he was my father and he wasn't all bad. I asked them if they expected me to buy that when I don't have a single positive memory of him. They told me it would be a good chance to support them and meet the child who is my half sibling. I told them I wasn't interested in either of those things and to please leave me alone.

They waited a few weeks to call me again and asked me if I would come meet my half sister because they felt like she could benefit from having more people in her life. I told them no and to leave me alone. They sent me photos of her and I ignored them. They apparently showed up where my grandparents and I used to live and were angry I never told them we had moved. In the end they were contacting me that much that I blocked them. They refused to take no for an answer and acted like I owed them something or had some great connection to a child who, is innocent yeah, but has no actual tie to me other than blood. And blood is a flimsy tie since it doesn't mean a good relationship or that someone blood related is worth knowing. I thought blocking them would be the end of it but two weeks ago I got a message on social media from a brand new account they had set up when they found me online (they were never on any social media before). They told me we're family and I should respect them as my grandparents enough to give this a shot. It pissed me off because they were hardly in my life as a kid. I got so mad that I unblocked them and called them to tell them to leave me the fuck alone and accept I don't want anything to do with them or their granddaughter. They yelled back and said there was no need for that kind of language and I should have more respect.

"AITA for blaming my mom for losing my dress Some background info, my mom has the habit of organizing and cleaning my room. Sometimes even storaging my things away. I've never really been a messy person but it took me time to get around organizing stuff. I also don't ever ask her for hep on this. I've always hated her for reorganizing my room, but I've always felt ungrateful to say it out loud so I never did tell her to stop until my senior year. She never did stop until we have this huge fight a few months ago.

Yesterday I had someone trying to purchase a dress I put up for sales. I had the dress for ages so I'm happy to pack it and ship. The only problem being I could not find it for the life of me from my childhood bedroom. I asked my mom to take me to where she storage my things, then went through every single closet and drawers and still could not find it. I got the dress years ago and was away in college half of the years. So it had definitely went through a few of my mom's ""reorganization"".

My mom offers to find it after I told her how upset I was. Turns out she couldn't find it either. I was really upset and angry. I've asked her to stopped many times before yet she insisted on organizing my things. She told me I could've misplaced it myself I said yeah but we'd never know since you keep moving things in my room for all those time. She apologized, then started crying. Now I've become the AH in the family because Ive blame her for it. 

I've felt incredibly powerless because of her action all these years. It's really demeaning to having to constantly ask someone else where are your own things. Even worse when they themselves don't remembered half of the time. I don't want to forgive her because I've told her to stop multiple times. She's broken and lost things many times before. She just always brush it off as not doing it on purpose. Everyone thinks it's my fault because she's doing it *for my own good* and I didn't  tell her not to do that when I was 12.

"AITA for not including my childhood friend in my wedding party? i (26F) got engaged to my fiancé Dylan (27M)
a few weeks ago and have now started to plan things including bridesmaids/groomsmen 

after a lot of discussion we decided on 4 each because the both of us like the idea of an even number (not that having more bridesmaids than groomsmen or more groomsmen than bridesmaids looks bad we just like the look of even numbers) 

My fiancé has always said when we eventually got married he wanted his three brothers and his childhood friend as his groomsmen which sounded great to me

not wanting to budge on our even amounts in our wedding party’s it meant i’d need to make cuts and before anyone gets mad and says “well you could’ve just made the party’s bigger to fit everyone” it made more sense to us to do 4 of our most significant friends/family up there with us instead of having him scrambling to find none close friends to stand up there with him 

but it wasn’t necessarily a difficult decision, i have two friends from childhood so they were my first two 

then my third, i picked my younger cousin, her and i had always been especially close after her mom passed when i was 15 and she was 11 we formed a close bond and i’ve always known i wanted her apart of my big day 

then came my 4th choice I chose one of my best friends to this day whom i met my freshman year of college. After I asked them all to be my bridesmaids I received a call from my childhood friend who i’ll call N questioning me why I didn’t choose her to be one of my bridesmaids

A quick rundown of N and i’s friendship it was a rocky one. We’ve known each other since elementary school, and have always had a competitive friendship that often led to arguments but as we got older they dissipated honestly, because I didn’t care enough to fight them anymore but there was still a bit of back handed comments from N but I just ignored them

I had mentioned how I wanted her to be one of my bridesmaids, and she basically told me that she did not want me as one of her bridesmaids and then always kind of stuck with me i’d always felt like I valued the friendship more than she did, i was constantly the one reaching out, wanting to hang out and it felt one-sided at times.

I don’t find it necessary to end our friendship because it has lasted so long but it’s definitely been one that I’ve spaced myself from over the years. I basically explained to her that I love her but we had to narrow it down to my four closest people and that i was sorry and If she wanted she could do another role in the wedding , she wasn’t happy with that. Hung up on me then later text me telling me she needed some time.

and it’s really got me thinking AITA?",0.01
"AITA I LIKE MY FRIEND CRUSH AND I ASKED HIM TO GO TO THE PROM WITH ME. I've been crushing on this boy since the first semester let's just call him Cain  but my friend told me she likes him too I didn't say anything because it's just a boy but as the time goes by I find myself liking him more and more, I keep my distance from him cause my friend likes him but I find it odd that she's letting his friend Luke court him even though she likes Cain but obviously he's the only reason she could talk to Cain I feel bad for Luke, Idk at this point I'm lost if I'm going to keep my feelings for Cain cause Luke is courting her but idk what happened me and Luke end up having a conversation when it's just the two of us he opened up to me that he knows she didn't like him but he wanted to show her what is it like to be love by a man, He stared at me and says I know you like Cain too I laughed and said but that was a long ago I moved on from him cause my friend likes him even though it's a lie I really want to move on, he said to me that it's no secret that my friend likes his friends Cain and Dave I was shocked he said that even in front of him she talked about his friends lovingly and when she's with his friend group she gives lot's of attention to Dave an Cain I saw it too she was flirting with them in front of Luke I didn't think about it that much until my friend confess to me that she also likes Dave just what Luke said to me I acted surprised and supportive but the inner me was discussed with her behavior.

"AITA for nearly having dinner with my boss. I (23F) work as a secretary to a pretty important specialist in mergers and acquisitions on Wallstreet.  
He is a conventionally handsome man (27m) and is always dressed well in expensive designer suits, wearing brand watches.  
Let me just say that he has always made comments on me and harassed me, for example a few weeks ago when I was confirming some lunch appointments and business meetings with him, I gave him a compliment on how nice he was dressed.  
Instead of taking it graciously he responded by telling me to not wear the outfit I was wearing and too wear a skirt and high-heels instead.  
For context he is in a steady relationship with someone already but i believe is cheating on her with another partner of an investor who is believed to be gay.  
Anyways a few days ago when I was confirming appointments with him he asked me out to dinner and told me to pick the restaurant. I picked quite a hard restaurant to get reservations too because I heard it was pretty good.  
He called up the place and made a reservation but didn’t give a name, he told me they already knew his voice by memory which I found hard to believe.  
So that night I went to his place where we would take a taxi to dinner. He gave me some ice-cream and when I asked him if he wanted some he told me he was on a diet.  
Now keep in mind he has a very fit man, proportioned muscles, broad shoulders, great six-pack. When I told him this he told me some bullshit about always being more fit.  
He also asked me questions like what I wanted to do with my life and what my aspirations were, then he got a voicemail from partner.  
The voicemail was telling him about a lunch appointment tomorrow and she was flirting with him. I asked him if I should leave now and he said its for the better and that he didn’t want to hurt me.  
This along with the disappearance of another specialist in mergers and acquisitions, who is believed to now be in London has left me conflicted.

"AITA for blowing up at my mother and making her cry when she told me I am lazy and spend all day lying around at home?     Before starting the story I think it is important to provide some background information. I (22F) live with my parents as I still am a university student. Ever since I entered my second year at university my parents and I have had a strained relationship because they always push me to work like my sibling(23f) did in my age. However, unlike my sibling, my major is very difficult and requires me to attend very demanding courses, which means that I often spend close to 5 hours a day at universit. I also have to submit a lot of homework and I am learning 3 foreign languages at the moment. Therefore, I only have one day free each week that I usually spend with my friends or sleeping if I am too exhausted to go out. 
    Yesterday, my mother said  she wanted to talk to me about finding a job because according to her it will make me more socially active (I am an introvert) and help me make some pocket money. I responded that I have no time for that now since I am in my last year of university and will look for a job in summer in which my mother proceed to tell me that I am lazy because I always lay around at home with my phone and not studying (I read my coursebooks and class material through my phone) and that I should be more like my sister that has actually achieved something in her life while working at university (my sister worked part time whilst in her last semester and failed a few classes because of it but my mother doesn't know).
    I, unfortunately, couldn't hold my anger anymore and shouted at my mother that I do not work because I am trying to build my future (I want to do a language post degree) and the fact that I do not complain doesn't mean I am not struggling therefore she should think twice before talking again because despite that my sibling is more successful,  they always run to me for help, not her. My mother started crying saying I disrespected her and the only thing she wanted was for me to be normal so AITA?",0.01
"AITA for not taking my boyfriend to the super bowl? I’m European, my boyfriend is American. I think this might be where the disconnect is but he doesn’t think so, so here goes.

I have been with my bf “Chip” for 8 months. As I said, Chip is American, but he’s never mentioned being a huge US football fanatic. He watches games but not religiously, and not emphatically.

My bio dad is very wealthy, and also a big gambler, known as a vegas high roller/whale, so one of the hotels offered him tickets to the super bowl. He doesn’t like US football so he called me and asked if I wanted to make a long weekend out of it, come to Vegas, and I could go to the Super Bowl with his ex-stepson, “Liam”. I like Vegas a lot and me and Liam get on really well, so I said yes. Granted, neither Liam nor I really watch US football but I’ve been to loads of sporting events where I don’t watch the sport, and it seemed like it would be a cool party atmosphere. 

Chip flipped out when I said I was going. He said I was a jerk for not asking my dad if I could have both tickets and take him instead. He said this would mean so much more to him as a fan than it would to me or Liam and he couldn’t believe I was being so insensitive. I said it’s not like he’s a football fanatic, but he argued that the super bowl is a big deal even if you aren’t a die hard fan. 

My reasons for not inviting him were the following: 

First, I wasn’t offered both tickets.

Second, the invitation wasn’t just about the game, it was a long weekend where we did other activities and generally hung out. I didn’t want to take over a trip I’d been invited to tag along on.

Third, Chip has never met my bio dad or Liam, and I didn’t think a long weekend in vegas was the appropriate time.

Obviously the game has been and gone but Chip is still upset about it. He says he is deeply hurt by the fact that I wouldn’t even try to make it so that he could go. I think my reasons were valid and he is being selfish by making such a big issue of not being invited on what was essentially a trip with my dad, just because he wanted to see a game that he only decided to care about once I was going. 

I feel like maybe I am missing that the super bowl is just universally important in American culture, whether you’re a fan or not, but Chip insists it’s a bigger issue. So AITA for not inviting him?",0.11
"AITA for keeping it real with my bf? Me (30f) and my boyfriend (30m) are currently living together in a small apt. The place is terrible, nothing works and a lot of maintenance is needed. But we pay a little amount of rent so we decided to keep it strong in order to save money to buy a house. Currently he earns more than me (I would say double the amount) - keep in mind that we are not in the US and we are both freelancer, so the amount is not exactly the same each month. He has 2 job - not cause we need it, but because the 2nd one is his dream job, but it doesn't pay much. It is the first one that is giving us the opportunity to have money aside to buy. The first job however is stressful and my bf is thinking of quitting. I'm ok with that cause I love him and I support him, even though I'm scared about the future and the money obviously. I said to him to take a decision after thinking about it and to don't rush anything (he started thinking to quint after a specific event), I didn't say anything about my fears, cause I know that we will be ok in the end. The only other thing I said is that we have to make a decision about the house, because with that job out of the picture we surely need to rethink where to buy and what kind of home (apt/house) - if he quits we would not be able to buy what we desire, and I'm ok with it. (But if we want to buy out dream house without the first job income we would be forced to stay longer in this current apt and this is the only thing I'm not ok with. We want to move to have a place to call home and to be closer to some really good job opportunities for me). So we need to sit down and have a real talk about it. 
Now I feel like I'm the AH for bringing that up, but I want to be real and have a plan. I don't want to improvise everything from now on (if he decide to quit). 
So, am I the AH?",0.1
"AITA for not lending my friend in need money when I very well could afford to? Me (20F) and my friend - let's call her Emma (20F) - don't live in the same country. We met a few years ago on Instagram and instantly hit it off. I love her, she's one of my best friends. We've met in person and it was great.

In 2022, she moved out of her tiny village to go to college. Money's always been tight for her.

Fast forward to September 2023 - she tells me that she's run into some financial issues and asks if I could lend her money. A couple hundred euros in fact. None of the friends around her could lend her anything and she really didn't want to ask her parents because then she'd never hear the end of it and her parents don't have much money to give.

So I was really the only option, and of course I said yes, she's my best friend. My situation to hers is a stark contrast - I also go to college but it's dirt cheap in my country, I get student aid, and I still live with my mother who is pretty well off.

I sent Emma the money in late September and she told me she'd pay me back in November. Only that November turned to December and December turned to February and I still haven't seen a cent of that money. I do believer her when she tells me she wishes to pay me back but can't. I don't think she's lying to me, and I told her it's fine if she pays me back later.

But just yesterday, she asked me if I could lend her another few hundred euros. She's not able to stay in the dorms anymore and has to find an appartment and her small salary alone won't cut it. She works in a call center, I believe it. 

But I told her no. That I can't in good conscience do that, not when I haven't seen a cent of the money she told me she'd pay me back in November. That I had to protect my own interest here. I'm comfortable but I'm not rich.

And now I feel like an asshole. I know my situation is very privileged. I could afford to lend her a few hundred more and it would greatly help her but I have no idea if and when that money might make its way back to me, and I don't wanna make this a habit of her asking for more and more. I do want to help her and I hate seeing her suffer, but I also need to protect my own interest. I fear that I'll only perpetuate the vicious cycle that financial problems are, that the only thing that will change is the amount of money she owes me, and that it'll only get harder and harder for her to pay me back.

I know that money is where friendships end, and I really don't want this to happen. To be clear - she told me that she understood. She's not mad at me or pressuring me in any way, if she did she wouldn't be my friend anymore.

Which would make this situation easier, I suppose. Alas, it is not, so I'm not quite sure if I'm the AH in this situation because I could greatly help her and it wouldn't affect me too much.

Edit - I have actually met her in person. This is not a scam. And the situation with her parents is... complicated. They're not outright abusive but they've certainly done and said some things that crossed some lines so it's not just a matter of her being too cowardly to ask them. ",0.06
"AITA our friends are pissed we skip school I (17f) with my friend (17f) have been skipping school a lot, and our friend group isn’t really having it. 
For context, we are both straight A students and our grades have not slipped since we started skipping, so the teachers don’t mind. We walk my dog, cook together, nap and rot in the apartment, but our friend group resents us for leaving them in that ‘war zone’. If they hate it there so much, why don’t they just join us? 
So, are we the assholes?

"AITA for offering to marry my gf ""on paper""? My gf is from Myanmar and I am from an EU country. We have been together for only 2 months. In these two months we have been arguing a lot but we also had our good moments. 

Recently, as you may have heard on the news, Myanmar's dictatorship announced all men and unmarried women aged up to 35yo, will need to enlist to the army for 3 years minimum. 

I offered to marry my gf ""on paper"" to be able to visit her country without fear of getting enlisted to the army. She said to me ""we fight almost every day, how are we gonna get married"". I said ""it's okay, it's not a real thing. It's only on paper. Even if we break up, we can remain married ""on paper"" for your convenience. Then, later on, when you are no longer in the age group to join the army, we can file for a ""divorce"" and go separate ways. I'm doing it for you."" 

She did not like this at all, and instead of thanking me for offering to make her life easier and protect her from danger, she got offended and told me that she wants to get married out of love, not out of procedure. She also said she has other choices and men who would marry her for real, not on paper. I am not ready to get married.

"AITA for not taking over my bf's game? (English isnt my first language)
Ok so it's probably stupid as hell. But anyway, I (21F) was finishing cooking lunch for me and my mother, who was busy dealing with our water pump outside with my dad, that had come to help, since he's a plumber. (They are divorced, me and my mother live alone). As I was removing the food from the stove, I get a call from my bf (21M), it went like this:

Him: Hey can you do me a favour and take over my ranked game? My aunt asked me for help.

Me: I'm sorry but I'm cooking right now, my mom is busy, and the food is almost ready.

Him: (in a mocking voice) ohh the food's almost ready. Can't you eat later? I don't want them to ban me.

Me: ...the food is ready, I can't really do that. And besides, you never left any game. If this is the first time you do that, they won't ban you.

Him:  I never left any, but I don't want them to ban me. Please?

Me: don't worry, they won't. And I can't. Sorry.

Him: alright, then. bye.


He hanged up angry as I put the food on the plate. After a few minutes, I ask for his credentials to enter his account, since I tried to eat quickly to take over his game, as I felt kinda bad. He send me a vocal message that his brother (who doesnt play that game, and has only played it once or twice) is playing for him, in an annoyed tone. AITA? Because now I feel kind of bad, and kinda angry, too.

"AITA for wanting to stay with my grandparents and not go with my mum to live in our hometown Sorry if this is a bit of a rush, have a lot to do and I need opinions, my brother has told me that im being a jerk for not coming with her again but I can’t do it anymore,I want to share my situation and get your thoughts.

I’ve gotten tired of taking everyone’s crap. 2 weeks ago we came down to my grandparents which is a few days worth of driving and after my sister found out she helped me tell my grandparents, I broke down to my grandparents about how I've been feeling and they offered for me to live with them, which I accepted. Now I feel guilty for leaving my friends, family, and my mom behind. Am I the asshole for not wanting to go back to my hometown with my mother?",0.02
