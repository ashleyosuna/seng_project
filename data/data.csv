"AITA for telling my brother to tell his 2.5year old to stop having a tantrum at dinner? I (29F) recently had dinner with my brother (30M), SIL (29F), mum and dad at my parents house.  I am staying at my parents house for 12 months as they will be doing lots of travel and I am here dog sitting half the time anyway, so this is my house too now.  My brother and SIL come over for dinner with their two young daughters (Lucy, 2.5 year old and Rebecca, 10 month old).  My brother’s parenting style is very much about “letting the girls have their big feelings” and “there’s nothing wrong with crying and being sad”.  However, their eldest daughter Lucy has entered her tantrum stage.  Lucy’s mum turned the TV off because it was dinner time and time to eat at the table.  Lucy instantly had a melt down and started screaming and crying “I want to watch tv”.  This continued at the dinner table and she was having a very big and loud meltdown for at least 5 minutes.  My brother and SIL just let her cry.  They didn’t tell her that she needed to stop having a tantrum and just asked my niece if she “wanted space” and let her continue to scream and cry at the table.  We all just wanted to have a peaceful meal but Lucy would not stop and kept getting worse, and her parents just keep saying it’s “big feelings and she isn’t doing anything wrong”.  AITAH for telling my brother that he should address or at least acknowledge his daughter and tell her she can’t behave this way? And that it’s rude for her to not acknowledge her or even try to discipline her as she is ruining our dinner?",0.15
"AITA for purposefully outing my stepsister’s nasty comments Not in the US

I (24f) currently room with my stepsister Wendy (25f). My dad married her mom. My dad inherited this apartment years ago and let us live there rent free when I got into the same university Wendy did. Wendy and I get along well though we work in different fields and have our own groups of friends.

I have an aunt on my mom’s side, Anna (31f). Anna’s mom, my mom’s former stepmother, used to date Wendy’s dad until he moved to another city. Anna has an extremely wealthy older husband (46m). She met him in high school when she babysat his niece. They dated when Anna graduated from college. They’re now married with a son (3m) and Anna a SAHM since his birth.

Anna lives a luxurious life and shares a lot on social media. I and Wendy are friends with her on several platforms but Wendy is jealous, there’s no other word. She often talks about Anna and her husband age gap. She said it was creepy and there was no way she would date someone so much older.

I always tried to get Wendy to stop but she would just bring the topic back again and again. 

This Christmas our parents went abroad so I went to spend Christmas at my mom's side. My mom passed several years ago but it was nice to see the family. Wendy was set to spend Christmas with her friends but the host was busy last minute, so I invited Wendy to spend Christmas with me.

The day before Wendy and I headed back home, Anna and her family joined us. Anna’s husband broke his ankle so he pretty much sat in a chair and just chatted with anyone who came to talk with him. Anna spent a good deal of time making sure he had food and drinks (meal was buffet style) and checked on him like every 10 minutes.

Wendy of course noticed this and kept whispering to me about how this was just a taste of Anna’s future, having to wait hand and foot on her much older husband in his old age. Wendy said she wouldn’t wish Anna’s fate on her worst enemy. She said her husband has a devoted wife since he groomed her so well.

I have had enough. Wendy was acting like the biggest Grinch with all her joy sucking gossips. So I purposefully raised my voice “Wendy, what do you mean grooming?! Just because they’re 15 years apart doesn’t mean there’s grooming involved!”

Everyone around us went quiet. Anna and her husband stared at us, knowing full well it involved them, but they didn’t say anything.

Wendy was so embarrassed she excused herself and left the party. In the morning when we left, Wendy only said good bye to my grandma before heading out.

Wendy was angry and said I embarrassed her and drove her to her room without even getting dinner. She said I could have told her in private like I have always done and not shame her in public. She said it was normal for people to talk like this about every woman marrying a much older, richer man and Anna should know people say things like this behind her backs no matter what. I was just tired of her jealousy and hoped this would shut her up. AITA?",0.69
"AITA for bashing my girlfriend over a misunderstanding!? Hello, I'm 27M. 
I've been in a relationship with my girlfriend (27F) for 5 years. It has been going good until recently. I'm a very open minded person and so is she, and lately we came to a concensual to explore our sexual lives and after a bit of convincing I made her agree to a threesome with another guy. I'd wanted to experience this for quite some time now. She decided to pick the guy and got a mutual acquaintance (her friend) for the threesome. Since she got the choice, I laid down the ground rules, one of them being ~ no kissing the guy! But during our session, she broke that rule twice or thrice for a continued duration. I ignored at the moment but took up the issue with her later. According to her, it happened it the heat of the moment and was ""only natural"" because it was only a kiss. However I got angry at her and bashed her for breaking one of the only few ground rules. Now we have a legit fight between us. And I'm sitting here wondering whether I am the one at fault or is it justified behaviour on my part!",0.4
"AITA for letting our kids freely play at home. To clarify, my wife and I live on the second floor of a three story apartment complex. We have lived here for almost a year with our two children whom are 1 and 4 years old. Our downstairs neighbors that we got along with recently moved out and an older couple moved in shortly after, we have had no contact with them since they moved in aside from a smile here and wave there.

Tonight the lady of the couple came to the door and unfortunately my pregnant wife was the one who opened the door. Right away the lady who was shaking with anger holding both hands up with balled fists told my wife “ I am sick and tired of your kids running around and making noise from morning to night.” My wife responded with “ I don’t know what you want me to do with a 4 year old.” . The old woman’s response was “I don’t care, it’s common courtesy, if you don’t stop I will call the cops.” My wife responded back with “Alright, I’ll try to stop my toddlers from playing” while going to close the door. The old woman chose to end with  “they make noise till one in the morning and it’s ridiculous” by which point the door was closed and locked. 

My children are down for bed by 9 every night, a complete hour before the 10pm curfew of the complex, but on rare occasion my daughter has woken up and refused to sleep early in the morning but she has never been allowed to run around and make noise when that happens. 

Where I think we could be the assholes is that we don’t restrict our children from playing how they would like aside from limiting them bashing the walls and floor with toys.",0.26
"AITA for thinking MY Christmas gift would be MINE? This is kind of a silly one, but I'm still curious.  
  
My husband (27M) got me (24F) a Nintendo Switch for Christmas! I was so excited since I've wanted one for a few years now. He got me accessories, a protective case, controllers, the works! It was wonderful and now I can play Stardew Valley with my friends!  
  
When we had a break during the day (on Christmas) I was looking through my Switch and saw that there were a few games on the Switch already- Mario Cart (which of course I wanted since it's a fun game to play at parties) but there was also Assasins Creed (which I have never played and am not super interested in but my husband IS). When I asked him about it he said, ""Oh yeah, I got a game for myself too!"". I asked him why he would buy a game just for him, and he said, ""Because it's OUR Switch. It was really expensive, so it's for both of us and we will share it equally"". I kind of bristled at this, and told him that while I was very happy to share- he could, of course, play games with me and by himself when I wasn't home or interested in playing- the Switch is MINE since it was MY Christmas gift. I had been asking for it for so long, so it definitely wasn't OUR Switch, it was MINE and he could use it when it was available. Plus he has an Xbox (although a very old one) that he can play Assasins Creed on whenever he wants.  
  
He asked if I was serious and after I said yes, he got mad and called me selfish and rude.  
  
We did makeup later and he agreed that I could have priority use when I wanted to play (although it seemed begrudgingly). Everything has been fine and we have been sharing and playing together and truly having a wonderful time. I have been playing Stardew Valley with him and he loves it! However, I still think about that conversation and wonder if I was the a-hole. So reddit, am I?  
  
Why I may be the asshole: I told my husband the gift he intended for both of us was MINE and he could use it when I wasn't playing. I may be selfish because of this.",0.09
"AITA for dancing with my ex? I am currently on vacation down in Mexico and I went with my parents and my sibling, and everything at the party was fine running smoothly when my ex asked me to dance.

Now for some background. I have a bf and I told him before I left that my ex would most likely ask me to dance and I can’t reject it as where I’m from it’s seen as incredibly rude to reject an offer to dance no matter who it is. And as I said I had informed my bf about me dancing with other guys and possibly my ex and he has no issue with it.

Well surprise surprise the other day my ex asked me to dance so I did and of course I let him know that I have a bf so he doesn’t make any advances at me and my brother saw and got extremely pissed, when I say extremely I mean extremely. 

No he didn’t know of what I said to my bf and how he didn’t have an issue with it as my brother had a really bad relationship experience with a girl who cheated on him with her ex so he thought I was doing the exact same thing when he didn’t know and yes I tried to explain but he is also extremely stubborn and has really bad anger issues so there was no reasoning with him. 

So now I am giving him the silent treatment and he is as well because I believe he had no reason to act the way he did when he didn’t know the full story. But I do want to try and reason with him but with his stubbornness I don’t know if I can.",0.6

25F I'm not comfortable with wearing a dress. So for my cousin's wedding, I chose to wear a suit to her wedding. My brother and I were essentially dressed same. Dark blue suits with a white shirt underneath.

My family were having fun and I thought all was fine. That is until the MOH came over while I was walking on my way to the washroom. I was confronted about wearing white and she poured wine on me.

Was I really the AH for wearing a white blouse with my navy suit? I didn't think the don't wear white rule was so literal. There was absolutely no way I could have been mistake for the bride. I also saw plenty of men dressed same as me. Some kind of dark suit with a white shirt. Yet none of the were confronted about it.",0.13
"AITA for deleting my Twitter account without telling any of my mutuals why? So, I started a Twitter account for posting art and thoughts of an anime I started watching, because I wanted to put myself out there a little more and also not bother my friends since none of them watch the anime. I have really bad (diagnosed) anxiety issues and my therapist was the one who recommended starting an account in the first place to try to build confidence.

I started getting relatively popular, and was getting lots of comments and people following and dming me, which was getting extremely overwhelming. I was getting incredibly distracted from my work trying to make sure I follow everyone back and answer all comments and dms, because I didn't want anyone to feel like I didn't like them, I have major RSD and the thought of making someone feel bad because they think I don't like them/want to talk to them stresses me out so much I end up throwing up. This was getting incredibly stressful and having so many mutuals of people I barely even know was flaring up my anxiety, so I just decided to delete the account. I didn't want anyone to try to find me or ask if I had somewhere they could message me because that would defeat the whole purpose of deleting. I just want to disappear from the online scene and go back to only lurking around and looking at other's posts without directly interacting/posting things myself.

But now I'm starting to feel like an asshole for deleting and not saying anything about it, AITA?

"AITA for only staying with my partner for finicial reasons... So before anyone calls me a gold digger, or selfish, you need context. Me[18] and my partner[20] met online. They lived down south and I live in the north east of America. They were going to be homeless so I let them move up here and live with me and my family(parents and older brother[20]). My partner and I are both nonbinary, although we are both of the opposite biological sex. I have ptsd, anxeity, deppression, gerd/reflux, insomnia and a variety of phobias. My partner knows im sensitive to touch and sexual stuff. Yet they've taken advantage of me multiple times. I've confronted them about it and they say they're trying to be more careful and or blame their adhd for what they did. I developed hapephobia due to it. And I have the chance of getting pregnant due to the most recent incident. Due to what they've done, the gaslighting, guilt tripping, and manipulation they do I've gained a severe lack of trust for them. My feelings/love for them are fading quickly. And im only staying with them atm cause finically they could help me move out of this house. Away from my abusive and narssacist parents, who groomed me. And my creep of a brother. Along with the fact my partner would help finically if I do end up pregnant with the finances. 

Also I'm aware of the fact my partner forced me into sexual stuff without my consent many times, yet I need them to be able to be finically stable and get out of my terrible environment.

"AITA for not accepting a friend´s opinion on refugees and ending the friendship? 4 years ago, I became friends with a woman who invited me to befriend her group of 6 other friends. It was a lot of fun going out with them. We built a Whats App group to chat and set the dates. Usually we talked about cats because each one of us has at least one cat. 

For many years, my country has been flooded with refugees from eastern countries like Iraq and Syria. There´s always been a debate if we should let refugees in the country and that this would lead to more crime. I´ve never felt that way. I think every nation, religion, colour of skin or whatever differences there may be, have good people and bad people. Therefore, I divide people into criminals and not criminals, good character and bad character, nothing else. I don´t care if your a citizen or a refugee or what religion you have. 

A year ago, there has been an incident at one of the refugee homes near where my friends live (all six women live in the same area). A refugee got angry with another refugee (both young men) and attacked him with a knife. I wouldn´t have known about this incident but my friend wrote it in our Whats App group. She wrote something along the line that refugees are all criminals and they shouldn’t be allowed to live near schools because they kidnap and abuse our children. I had never heard about anything like that and immediately wrote that I don´t think it´s nice of her to say that all of them are criminals. It´s definitely not true. There are so many cases of child abuse and harassment of women from citizens of my country. In addition, all bad encounters which I had (unfortunately many) were never with refugees or men other than citizens of this country. 

However, she went on that those refugees are stealing the money from our people who need and  deserve it more and that they even got more money from the state than our people that didn´t work. Of course I told her that this isn´t the case. She didn´t back off though, saying she has to work hard for the little money she got and they would get everything for free. Just to clarify this: she lives in a house that her parents inherited her, a big house with 5 bedrooms and huge garden. She worked part-time, earning about 2000$ every month that she could spend on anything as she didn´t have to pay rent. She has a nice car, three cats, a fully furnished house and so on. So clearly the refugees aren´t taking away anything from her. She then started again saying they were criminals. By that time I had enough and brought up statistics that I got from a government site. I sent the links to the Whats App group and then left the group. Shortly before this incident, I had adopted a young woman who is trans. My friend was all like „oh that´s wonderful, trans people are humans, too“. After I had left the group, she started posting stuff against trans people (my daughter is trans) on her status and that friends should respect other opinions and I wasn´t a good friend.

"AITA for not wanting my soon to be father in law’s polygamous GF at our wedding - who we haven’t even met? Okay so many details here but I’ll keep it vague. Characters: me- 26 year old female. Chad- my fiance- 25 years old. Paul - Chads father- 55 years old. 

Paul texted Chad soon after we got engaged and told him that he would like a plus one to our wedding. Paul told Chad his plus one is 30 years old and that she really wants a signed baseball from Chad (Chad is a minor league pitcher lmao). Paul made Chad text this plus one to invite her based only on the above info “for brownie points” ? Lol. Chad and I were kinda side eyeing this bc why is a 30 year old fan girling over her “boyfriend’s” son and requesting a signed ball and a text from him ?

Then I got on Facebook and looked up his plus one. Chad and I found out that Paul lied. the plus one is actually MARRIED and has 2 kids under the age of 4. She is ALSO 25 years old (3 months older than Chad and 1 year YOUNGER than me). 

We didn’t want to pry Paul for info or make him explain his relationship. So we told Paul that we didn’t appreciate being manipulated and that we were no longer comfortable with this plus one coming bc we don’t know her and our wedding wasn’t the place to bring her into our intimate moment. I.e. photos, front row in the ceremony etc etc. 

Paul has now drug this topic on for 6 months of our engagement- he is not respecting our boundaries. He informed us his plus one is happily married and that the three of them are in the relationship (?). He’s sold Chads things and forged Chad signature on an MLB check. And now Paul is not coming to our wedding bc his plus one isn’t invited. So my fiance will not have a father at his wedding. AITA? Or are we the assholes —?!

Adding : Chad and I are very much on the same page here. Chad has done all of the communication with Paul. I have been super careful not to overstep Chad. I even told Chad - this situation is out of hand let’s just let him bring her and Chad said absolutely not. Chad is embarrassed by his dad’s actions. We are from the south, polygamy is not normal in the Bible Belt. Chad knows everyone will be weirded out if she comes. Again she’s 3 months older than Chad. ",0.12

"AITA for expecting my property to be replaced although I am not planning to use it? So my brother ""borrowed"" my PlayStation 2 without asking a couple of years ago. I let it slide because I did not want to cause any issues but I absolutely hate it when other people use my stuff without permission.

Either way I said I want it back now (probably going to play once) and he said he will bring it. I've then reminded him but he ghosted me. Then I told my parents to text him and he said he doesn't know where it is etc, so I texted him again and told him I want it back.

---------------

These are the text messages: 

Me: I want it back.

Him: I don't care about that. I searched and can't find it, I can't do anything about it

Me: It's not yours, I need you to find it or replace it.

Him: yeah sure, so you can use it once I will replace it for you. Any other wishes?

Me: It's none of your business, it's not yours. Find it or replace it

Him: no. As if you ever respected the property of others (I don't know what he means, I refuse to even borrow stuff from other people and definitely don't use other people's stuff without asking)

Me: okay so it's no problem if I take your stuff then that you left at home? Maybe I'll lose it too

Him: that won't make you less of a disappointment

----------------

I don't know what he did with it, he probably lost it while moving or borrowed it to one of his friends. He's generally careless with his stuff and has lost so many things while moving so it's no surprise.

I told my parents I will take him to court for it and I will, they are furious I would treat my brother like that but I think he caused the problem AND was rude about it. Now they are offering to pay to replace it so I don't sue him. Call me petty but I am absolutely willing to go that route for the audacity alone.

I want the exact same model, in the same colour, with the same accessories. The cheapest I found is about $150. This is obviously expensive for a 20+ years old console and I think more than half of the original price.

The last time I used it was probably 5 years ago, before that it was probably another 5 years. I was offered a newer model but I refused. I'm really likely not going to use it much, maybe not at all, but it is my property and I want it back because of the emotional attachment (it was a birthday present).

"AITA for asking my flatmate to wear earplugs during her shift work during times I am in the flat and it is reasonable to be making noise? 2 months ago my flatmate started work in the emergency services. Since then, our friendship has changed and I need someone to tell me if I'm the arsehole! FYI we live in a 2 bed flat with our own bedrooms and bathrooms, and a shared kitchen lounge.  
The first incident was when I asked her if I could have someone over from a dating app. She refused and said she was too tired and that her refusing wasn't unreasonable as she was in a new job. I was disappointed at this as I would understand if she had an exam or someone had died, but to refuse because you are tired seemed silly to me - aren't we all after a day of work! This triggered a conversation where she expressed she would only be happy if I had people she did not know round on Friday or Saturday nights only. It also triggered a conversation where she told me it would be nice if I could clean and unload the dishwasher more often, all of which I have taken onboard and quite literally lived by to the point we now live in a spotless flat.  
Since then there have been multiple incidents where she will sleep in the lounge from around 9PM. I have asked her not to do this as it makes me feel bad or awkward if I fancy a snack, drink or need something from the kitchen/lounge and she is in there as I either go without (hunger at night is atrocious to experience) or have to enter and wake her up anyway. Her justification is that I am too noisy calling my friends (which rarely happens after 9-11PM) or chilling in my room so she needs to sleep in the lounge (bedrooms next door to each other). Our building has a no noise policy from 11PM-7AM which we have always adhered to with each other also with no issue. I was toning down at 11PM but now in an attempt to be considerate I try to quiet down by 9PM (I finish work late afternoon so this isn't much time to FaceTime and do what I would like too.) Now she has a new job her shifts are currently 7:00AM-3:00PM but will soon be all over the place as is the nature of shift work. I have suggested time and time again she use earplugs as this would mean she can sleep, I can do what I would like within reason in the afternoons and evenings and have also mentioned to her once she is doing shift work I will undoubtedly be making noise ie if she finishes at 3PM and comes home to sleep I am unfortunately going to need to cook and so the reasonable activities I am carrying out are going to create noise which I can't help. I also don't want to have to put my life on hold or stop calling my friends, watching TV etc (I do all of this before 9 ish now FYI but when a FaceTime has gone on 10 minutes longer until 9:10PM it has still caused issues). She outright refuses earplugs and says she will miss her alarm, no matter how many times I ask her to try them.

"AITA for not telling by husband I'm pregnant TW: pregnancy, loss and termination



I had a positive pregnancy test today with indications I am about 4 weeks.

I'm on birth control and this was not planned. Infact we have made a conscious decision to not have any children - including him booking in for a vasectomy in the coming weeks.

The reason being is that I have previously been unable to carry to term and get incredibly sick - think can't get out of bed, can't keep anything down, become stuck on bed rest for months sick. Three times we have tried and lost and I am not willing to do it again.

I have made the decision to book in for a medical termination. I also want to make it understood that we have both been clear about not wanting children. Hence the birth control (depo shot, always taken on time) and booked in vasectomy.

I don't want to tell him because when we have purposefully conceived in the past, the rollercoaster ride that we went on took a huge mental toll on us both and I don't see how him knowing would add any value to be honest.  I don't want to tell anyone but my GP.

"AITA for lying about my depression I (27M) lied about my feelings of anxiety and depression. Earlier this year I began talking to this woman, and I find genuine joy and happiness from her company. When we initially started going on dates and spending time with one another, one thing she noticed was how happy and carefree I was, and asked if I ever got depressed or anxious, to which I replied ‘no I don’t really feel those things’. A definite lie for sure, but I’ve noticed most people don’t want to hear me talk about my issues. I’d love it if the world were more open, but from my personal experience when I have opened up it’s either been used against me, or made the other person uncomfortable that I shared my issues or problems, even if that person asked to hear about them. So I lied. Now several months have passed and she’s assured me she’s here for me and wants me to open up, to which I’ve slowly began doing so. I shared poetry with her about my inner feelings and the struggles I face. She was shocked to find out I was dealing with issues like this, and after hearing about them remembered our conversation from the beginning and called me a liar said that I was full of shit.

"AITA for not standing up for my mom which in turn deserved her not attending my wedding? My mom and husband got into a fight 4 months before our wedding. It started over money but then my mom changed it to talking about how she felt my husband had anger issues. (He does and this is something we have been working on. He’s never hit or name called but gets hurtful and incredibly dramatic when he’s angry)

My mom confessed she was trying to break us up because she felt like my husband wasn’t good enough for me. His parents eventually got involved in their fight trying to get my mom off his back about his anger and my mom started fighting with them after that. I told her to leave it alone and she didn’t.

While I see her trying to defend and protect me from a potentially bad situation-I also did not ask her to get involved and I feel it was pretty extreme to then not go to her only daughters wedding. She says she regrets making me sad but doesn’t regret not going-she gives me marriage 2 years tops. Not sure how I feel about that.

I’m used to being like, “oh cool thanks! I’ll keep it for later!” if someone gets me something thoughtful and useful but maybe not my everyday style. It’s my money and I wanted him to have it, but at the same time, don’t want to force something on him he doesn’t want. He said he’s particular about this kind of item he might wear on his body and wanted a different style. I never intended it to be something he wears everyday, in my mind it was more of a “nice to have in an emergency” type thing. Anyway, I pouted a bit at his rejection and said I’d handle the return, but I’m not planning on using the return money for buying the replacement in the style he wanted, so AITA for that? I feel like if he wants the specific thing, he can buy it himself, it was a present and he rejected it, so now it’s not any present. Am I being petty? I might be being petty, idk. For context: We buy each other things all the time, no one feels neglected or unloved or unthoughtful to each other, I think my annoyance is that he was annoyed I spent so much on something not exactly to his liking, he worries about money more than me (we both work, we both have our own money.) Overall just makes me not want to replace it, he rejected the present, that was the present and he didn’t want it, so I don’t want to switch it out. I have never complained about presents he’s given me even when it clearly suits what he likes more than what I like, but I’m grateful no matter what. Am I being petty?",0.88
"AITA for not inviting my sister-in-law’s in-laws to my kid’s birthday party? So my kid was born on 31st of December (7 years ago) and each year we celebrate by having a family lunch at our house, with my husband’s family since mine is in a different country. My sister in law got married 3 months ago and had a celebration lunch 2 weeks after. There we met her new in-laws, but we never connected or exchanged more than ‘hello, how are you, good bye’. So they’re practically strangers. They didn’t interact at all with my kid.

Now comes my kid’s birthday and my sister in law says that her in-laws will be in town so they would come to the birthday lunch as well. I didn’t feel like having strangers in the house for that special day, my kid didn’t want them around so I told my sister in law that she and her husband are welcome to come but her in-laws can find something else to do for 3 hours.

So here’s what my sister in law decided to do. She came and brought over her son, left him for the day to spend time and play with my kid. Then she said to her mom and her brother (not my husband)to join her, her husband and her in-laws for a morning coffee. The morning coffee turned into lunch, which turned into no one showing up for my kid. Around 5 pm I tell my husband to call her and tell her to pick up her kid, I was done babysitting him.

She comes(alone) and sees we didn’t cut the cake so she says come on, let’s sing and cut it. My kid didn’t want to, she wanted to leave it for later to do it just with her dad and me. The sister in law kept at it, her son said he wants to try the cake so reluctantly we sang ‘happy birthday’ and we cut it. They had a slice and left (I also gave them a piece of cake to take with them for the in-laws).

My husband and I decided to do at least something special for the day(I won’t say how sad my girl was) so we went bowling (first time for my kid). While in the car, my brother in law send me a message saying that after the outing he had he was sleepy and went to bed and now he is up and wants to come over to give the gift to my kid. I tell him we’re not home. While we’re bowling, my mother in law calls my husband (it was around 7pm by now) and says she wants to pass by to give my husband a sweet she had prepared. I blow up and tell my husband no one is welcomed anymore, we’ll go home and rest so we can be up for the New Year’s fireworks.

So, long story short, because I didn’t invite the in-laws of my sister in law to my kid’s birthday party, no one showed up. Cherry on the cake is that I’ve been told that I’m the a\*\*\*\*\* for making my sister in law choose between my kid and her in-laws. Or for not celebrating the birthday another day.

So, who’s the a\*\*\*\* here? Also, for the past 4 days my sister in law keeps on asking to meet(which she never did before), which I gently refuse cause I’m not ready to see her yet. Was it something so small that I should just forget about it?",0.4
"AITA for not ordering food for my husband? This is short and sweet. 

I was lying on the couch, exhausted out of my mind after a week long care of my sick and hospitalised child. I comment “I’m going to order some noodles or porridge”

He says “that sounds good”

Ten mins later he asks if I’ve ordered food for him too. I say “no, you didn’t ask me to”. 

He argues “I said that sounds good so it means I wanted some”

Back and forth. Yada yada. I’m dumbfounded. I’m pretty sure there wasn’t any da Vinci code level riddle I had to decode. No direct asking was used. And he’s actually very angry, I can tell. But I’m too tired to GAF. Hope you’re reading this to spare me the angry conversation.",0.83
"AITA for asking my husband to quit his job and depend on me. I (30F) am a software engineer with a computer science degree and my husband (30M) has a mechanical engineering diploma.

My husband has found it difficult to get a good job in his field ever since he finished school while I have a good one and earn a lot more than him, a very good salary especially with the cost of living in India and I have almost finished paying of pur flat.

I have suggested to him numerous times to go get a degree instead of a diploma from a good school but he says he doesn't want to as it is too hard. My degree is from a well known University and I have not had much trouble and this is my 3rd job and I work for a well known American company.

He had been unemployed for a while but finally accepted a job at a ""call center"" 3 months ago. In reality his work has nothing to do with support calls and he is given many phones and computers and social media and reddit account passwords and told to make posts online.

This usually involves posts that are designed to share articles and fake stories to provoke responses against immigration including against Indians. This is mostly for Canada but sometimes when someone is off and he fills in, they do UK and USA and Australia as well. He also has to write things to support certain politicians. For USA though they ask him to focus more on South Americans.

I told him he should quit his job and search again or just depend on me and he called me an asshole and says I don't understand how he feels like a man earning less and not providing and this will make it worse. I don't understand this as I have never stopped him from using any funds and have told him what I earn is for the family. I have paid for vacations, new gaming PC, consoles etc for him without any hesitation.

At the same time, I hope to emigrate to either the US or Canada in the coming years if I can and I feel like his employment history for this 'call center' would jeopardise things if ever they get caught.",0.09
"AITA for getting angry at my friend for going after a guy that broke me So basically I was really close with this guy, and I've known him since primary school, and last year me and him got close and we would talk all day when we got the chance, we liked each other and we obviously both new it, and he was the one guy, outside my family, that i could trust, but last year around November he said he just wanted to be friends bc of my trust issues that I developed cause of my ex and family reasons and that shattered me, I stayed up for weeks crying, and I was moving on, but Christmas night I decided to call one of my closest girl friends, and we were being stupid, and I tried guessing who she likes, big surprise, she likes him, and I got really annoyed abt it, so she decided to leave me alone until the next morning, and she asked me why I was annoyed, so I told her, another surprise she screenshotted the message, and sent it to him, they both basically called me the bad guy and kinda made me feel bad and eventually getting me to apologise, that afternoon of that talk with him and her, i hyperventilating, i took a shower and nearly passed out. And then last week, me and her got into an argument abt her liking him, but the thing is, if she were my best friend, she would've backed off of him, but she hasn't, they both ignore me to talk to each other, and whenever I get annoyed, she makes me seem like the bad guy",0.83
"AITA For inviting my dad to my wedding There's been a long-term conflict in my family between my mum's side and my Dad. When my mum passed away 10 years ago, my dad was an alcoholic and was neglectful of myself and my sisters. In his grief, he also caused large amounts of upsets by having multiple girlfriends not long after my mum passed away, losing his job, being out of the house and leaving my youngest sister in my care. I've accepted it, and over the past few years my dad has recovered and I have built up a relationship with him again. My sister's and mum's parents have refused to speak to him ever again.

I'm getting married next month,  small-ish wedding. I invited my dad as I really wanted him there, originally he refused because of the conflict and I gave him an ultimatum to attend my wedding if he wants to be a part of my life. I did mention this to my mum's parents and sisters before I did so, the general response was ""it's your wedding"". My sister's also comforted me when he refused originally. After the ultimatum, he accepted the invite. When I told my family they said they would not attend if he was there and that the day would get ruined by their arguing; or that they couldn't bring themselves to attend and see him after so many years. I held my ground and said he is coming. Apparently 'its your wedding' actually translated to 'its your wedding, but I won't be there'. The situation escalated, and long story short, now I've got neither my Dad or my family in attendance at the wedding.

Sooo... AITI?
And... what do I do now? I'm very stressed, even to the point of nearly pulling the plug on the whole wedding.",0.29
"AITA suing my ex for not paying rent So a couple of month ago my girlfriend of 4 1/2 years broke up with me. She gave reasons, mainly that she didn’t have the energy to be in a relationship with me anymore. I did not want to break up and am pretty shook about the whole thing as this is my first real love, long-term relationship, and breakup. It was the 2 of us and my best friend all sharing a house. When she broke up with me she made it clear she wanted to exit the lease and was going to stay with her mom who lives about an hour away. She gave me these options:

The first and best option was to sublet the lease and have someone sign in her place. We actually did have someone who wanted to do that which would’ve worked out perfectly for everyone. However the landlord made it clear that was impossible without signing a new lease entirely and we don’t consider that an option.

The second option is for me and my friend to sign her out of the lease. She would pay a $500 fee and then we would be stuck paying her rent for the duration of the lease (5 month)  Me and my friend said this isn’t a good option for us since we can’t afford to pay all of that plus utilities.

The third option is that a $5000 termination fee is paid and the lease is ended early. This would leave all of us living with our parents again for a couple months. Me and my roommate didn’t want to do this. We told her she would have to pay the entire $5000 and we wouldn’t split it 3 ways. She says she cannot afford that and we are obligated to split it since we are all on the lease.

After talking to my friends dad who is an attorney he made it clear those were not our only options. He said unless she pays the entire termination fee, we could just do nothing and keep the lease going. This was a good option for me and my friend, but bad for my Ex. She would have to drive an hour to work and back and pay rent for a place she wasn’t staying. This would also prevent her from getting her own place until the lease was over. When we told her this was the option we are choosing she quickly took all her things out of the house and completely ghosted both me and my roommate.

So pretty much a month goes by and she doesn’t pay her portion of the rent. We spoke to the landlord who said she was not answering any attempts at contact. I even texted her daaaaad. My friends dad says we are able to sue her for her portion of rent. So we did and are currently waiting to have the papers processed and served. It won’t cost us any money in the long term since my roommates dad will represent us for free. However this seems to be completely screwing her over and it feels petty taking legal action against my ex-girlfriend of almost 5 years. This would also potentially mess up her renters history. Is it too far suing her or is this a reasonable response?",0.71
"AITA for Refusing to Apply for a New Job Despite My Parents’ Wishes? For a bit of background, I (25F) went to college for a dual degree of business and creative writing. I have a background in theater and have always loved mildly chaotic work environments. I also worked several administrative jobs throughout HS and college. 

Fast forward to Covid, I fell into a career doing HR work as it allowed me to work with a small team in a semi-remote environment during the pandemic. I was very good at my job and loved my employees, but, as you may imagine, HR is not as enjoyable as my previous background and I spent several years working in an extremely toxic environment which severely affected my mental health. A few months ago, I was in a bad car accident (totaled car, several broken bones, concussion, etc) and I went back to working 12 hour shifts after just 5 days off. On top of my physical pain, I was treated horribly by my coworkers and was utterly disgusted with how the circumstances were handled by my higher ups. That was the push that finally convinced me it was time to leave. 

Now, I am 3 weeks into a new job working as a manager for events and I am loving it. There are some downsides, of course. I took a decent pay cut, I commute over an hour each way, and I’m required to work occasional weekends. But there are also amazing benefits and I’m actually excited to go to work for the first time in years. My mental health is finally moving in the right direction.

I currently live at home with my parents. Let me emphasize that they are amazing to me and always have been and I truly don’t know where I’d be without them (ESPECIALLY following my car accident). They encouraged me to take this job as I was unemployed for a bit when I decided to leave my other job without anything else in line and I needed the money. But from the day I accepted this job, they haven’t celebrated it with me at all. They were not as excited as I was for the opportunity and remind me daily about the wear and tear on my car, the weekend shifts, and the loss in my salary. They have actively reminded me daily that I need to be applying for other jobs. Tonight we had an argument because I didn’t want to apply for a local secretary job 10 minutes from home and I commented to them that it felt like my happiness didn’t matter at all when it came to my job. They are continually reminding me that with the salary cut, the apartments I can afford are limited as will be my traveling (I love traveling abroad as much as possible). My dad has also made comments that I’m not thinking clearly and they are just trying to be my voice of reason.

So…..am I being too stubborn about this? AITA for refusing to apply to new jobs so soon?

"AITA for suggesting to drive when my mom gave me other options? I am reposting this just one more time because I had to clear up a few things from my last post. 

So I've been feeling sick for the past day and a half and I asked my mom to take me to the Urgent care so I could take a covid and RSV test. I went in the building for my appointment and stayed in the car to eat. 

When I came back to the car, she was on her computer working and I told her everything that happened. We finished talking about my prescription and she said I either needed to walk down the street or wait until she was done, because she had some deadline she had to meet with whatever she was working on. I suggested that maybe I could just drive us both instead and us switch seats, so that she could still work in the passenger seat and I could go get my prescription. She went off on me, saying that I was being lazy and dramatic for not wanting to cross the street, and pretty much yelled at me. I felt sick and felt like crap but I ended up just walking. Since I was sick I was kind of irritated with having to walk even though it wasn’t far, but I had just made the extra suggestion to drive to make things easier for both of us. 

Later when I got back in the car, I asked her why she got mad at me in the first place and she said that by suggesting that I drive, I was basically telling her that ""I don't care what you have to say, I want to do it my way"" and that ""I never listen."" She also complained that I was inconveniencing because she would have to ""go ALL the way around the car and get in the other side and her wifi might turn off."" (Which I didn’t know until she told me.) Anyways we ended up having another yelling match and I’m confused as to if I was actually being an asshole for suggesting something else.",0.57
"AITA for sending my sick husband a passive aggressive text? My husband and I are new parents, and it has been challenging adjusting to this new life phase- especially when it comes to division of labor and what feels fair to both of us. My husband works full time, and I take care of the new baby. The baby care I do includes their bedtime routine and all of the night wakings/feeds, as well as all of their care during the day. If I go out to do something with friends (which is rare, we’re all new moms) my husband will gladly take any of these tasks over without complaint, but when we’re both home- baby care logistics is pretty much falls on me. While baby care is monotonous and sometimes “easy” it’s a job that never ends. I often feel unseen.

Today is the third day that I have been taking care of the baby with a sickness that was confirmed via a test. Our entire family was exposed to this from someone we were all staying in a house with for a long time, so at this point, me isolating from the baby isn’t going to do anything, they’ve been heavily exposed (yes, I talked to the pediatrician). Up until today, my husband had not yet been sick.

Last night the baby was up crying a lot in the middle of the night (and to be honest, I was crying too). I feel extremely sick and am very exhausted. This morning I come downstairs around 10 (I do morning feeds and first wake window in the nursery in the AM) and my husband is sleeping on the couch. He wakes up to go upstairs, and doesn’t come back down until 2 PM. At that time, I’m frustrated so I give him the cold shoulder, which he immediately picks up on and starts doing the same back. He makes himself lunch, and doesn’t ask me if I’m hungry or want anything (despite the fact that I had an abandoned pot of water on the stove that I had to turn off because the baby woke up). All I’d had time to eat was an ensure shake this morning so I could take medicine. He eats lunch, and goes back upstairs to sleep. 

When he went back upstairs right after lunch, I sent him a passive aggressive text saying something along the lines of “thanks for asking if I was hungry for lunch when I’ve been taking care of the baby 24/7 while sick and you’ve been sleeping all day, I feel really loved and appreciated.” When my husband woke up again five hours later (when baby had just gone down for the first part of the night) he texted me back saying “doesn’t it occur to you that I have the same thing you have?” And said “don’t pull this passive aggressive shit on me.”

"AITA for being ""hom*phobic""? Please, for the love of God tell me if I'm wrong. I was raised by a fucked up family and sometimes I truly don't see that I'm saying something offensive. To sum it up, I have a large friend group. But for context, this involves my best friend ""Jane"" and my best friend ""John"", whom I happened to start dating 9 months ago. All of us are from the same friend group. Jane hooked me up with him. We are ALL super close. However, John started working at a different plant 2 months ago and has gotten really close to this guy ""Nate"". To a point where he is blowing off all of us (our entire friend group) to hang out with Nate at his place. Nate has a baby at home and doesn't like going out (understandable) so my BF John just hangs out there. But it's rather excessive, or getting there. Most weekends he is over there. Well, I was alone tonight and John was supposed to be home at 9 but texted me at like 9:10ish and said ""hey, do you mind if I stay a bit longer?"" I said ""no problem but can you go grab Jane for me and bring her over since you're hanging out with Nate anyways?"" He said ""sure, no problem at all"". And went to go get her. Now, the issue is that I had already known this was going to happen and had been texted Jane saying ""you should just come over and hang out because John is with Nate, probably tongue p\*nching his fart box"". I thought it was funny. She thought it was funny. Hell, even John probably would have found it funny on a normal day. But Jane said something in the truck, trying to make a joke about it and Nate was in the vehicle too and apparently he went silent and awkward. So when John got back here to drop off Jane, he said I'm an AH for saying that because Nate felt it was homophobic and his brother is gay so he took offense. AITA? I truly didn't mean for it to come off like that. My sister is a lesbian and I have no issue with gay people.

ETA: thank you for the comments so far! I think I get it now. See me and Jane are bisexual so there's a lot we joke about that we think is funny that isn't to other and I think I get it now. jokes about a guy being gay is taken more seriously. Thank you for input. I'm the AH;",0.93
"AITA for ending 20+ yr friendship after my kiddo stayed the night at her house? Christy came to see me after an 8 month hiatus I took from hanging out with her because I was severely depressed. She brought her kiddo, Klyde (M6) over to hang out with mine. We hung out and talked while the kiddos played. I apologized for avoiding her and opened up to her how bad my mental health had been and how that had been affecting my life. I have depression and ADHD. I explained that I was ashamed of how hard it was for me to get out of bed and especially how embarrassed I was of the state of my house. My house isn't the cleanest, mostly clutter but it is healthy, functioning and safe.  
  
The kids came down and asked to stay the night. We agreed to switch off nights, with Christy's house first.  
  
I text her that night to check on Lilly, Christy told me she got hit in the head with a basketball and cried so hard she threw up but that she's fine now and sleeping.  
  
I checked in the next day; Christy told me they're fine, on the couch playing on their switches.  
  
4:30 she brings Lilly home who is just so overwhelmed that she runs to her room. Christy told me that last night my kiddo lost a board game and freaked out; ran away to hide and when Christy went to talk to her, Lilly called herself useless. Then today that the children hadn't been getting along. She has another child (M13) and he caught my kiddo going through Klyde's stuff and they called her out for snooping. Lilly was upset and crying. Christy said that Klyde was annoyed and began saying not so nice stuff to her. Christy didn't tell me what was said. She told my kiddo to pack their stuff because they were going to the park but brought her home instead.  
  
I noticed Lilly had a cut on her eyebrow and a pretty bad rash all over her face, eyelids and neck. I asked Christy what happened and she said she hadn't noticed it. Later I discovered a huge bruise on her upper arm.  
  
After Christy left, I found out that Klyde had taken a couple of Lilly's toys. One he hid and the other he had coerced her into giving by asking nonstop.  
  
I let a few days go by without saying anything to Christy so that I don't lash out. Christy drops one of the toys off with a toothbrush, doesn't say anything. I text her one of the toys is still missing and she tells me that I could at least say ""thank you!"" I send an eyeroll emoji and she responds with ""I didn't want to talk to you, Lilly was nothing but a spoiled brat and I am not going to tolerate that. The toothbrush is for Lilly bc she told me hers was dirty. CLEAN YOUR F\*\*\*\*\*\*\* HOUSE!""  
  
Now here's where I may be the AH. I responded by citing the physical damage on Lilly, the emotional damage and Christy dismisses it saying none of that is her fault. I tell her that her children are undisciplined and aggressive (I used a harsher word but I can't use that specific word in this post). I tell her that she is not a good person and blocked her.

Which I understand but it’s my stash and I’m in college and like to have fun (responsible fun but ya know shit happens) I like to keep the pills handy for when I need them cause things happen and I wanna be prepared. Well during this time of my life, slip ups would happen so I would take a plan b. This left me at only 2 or 3 pills left. My friend also 20F has been messing around with a guy in our friend group.

We tell her that she needs to start using condoms and she says “yeah yeah I know” but continues not using one.

"AITA for being upset with my depressed daughter for throwing away my silverware and dishes? I have a daughter (28) that we can call Adriana. About a month ago, her best friend passed away from cancer. My daughter has been living on her own, but after her friend passed away, she asked me if it was okay to stay at my house for a while because she didn’t want to feel lonely and she was feeling very depressed. Of course, I accepted and she has been staying in the guest room for about two weeks.   
Over the past two weeks, my spoons, forks, knives, plates, bowls AND cups have been going missing. I had a feeling that it was Adriana, so I kindly told her that if she had any dishes in her room, she could bring them to the sink so I could wash them. Well, no dishes appeared in the sink, but I did notice something shiny in the trash that day. I saw a fork poking out from underneath a pile of used paper towels. I pulled out the paper towels, which revealed a plate with food on it, a fork and a knife.  
I took the plate and walked to the guest room and asked Adriana if she had thrown out the plate. She started telling me that she did and that she was sorry. I told her that it wasn’t acceptable for her to just throw away my things! I have plastic, paper, glass and ceramic plates. She was throwing out my expensive ceramic plates instead of using the paper or plastic ones. I was very upset with her, but I asked her why. Her reasoning was that since she has been very depressed, she hasn’t had the energy to wash her dishes or put them in the sink. Instead, she just throws them away in the trash then wipes down the counters and throws the used paper towels on top.   
I was beyond angry when she told me she has been doing this since she has been staying with me, which means most of the items she threw away are gone. This is where I think I may have gone wrong. I told her that if she didn’t repay me for the dishes by the end of the week (about $120) that she is going to have to go back to staying at her own place. She started yelling at me and telling me that I should be understanding and that I don’t understand what she is going through right now. I then told her that she had to leave that day and that I would be expecting the money by the end of the week.   
That leads me to today. She left when I asked her to, but this happened last week, and she still hasn’t paid me back or even reached out. So, AITA for being upset with my depressed daughter and asking her to repay me for throwing away my silverware and dishes?

"AITA. My (20 M) girlfriend (16 F) wants us to have kids, like right now. We were having a discussion about this in my room (live with parents while attending college) and we both have very opposite point of views.

She’s stuck on this idea that we can do it if we put our minds to it, and that there are other young parents who have successfully raised a baby.

I’m not saying it’s impossible, but I know it’s going to be wayyyyyy too hard. I really think it’s going to take a horrible mental toll on us. Putting our feelings aside, we could give our baby a much better and deserved life if we had them later on.

I told her both of us are way too young. I’m a college sophomore, she’s a high school junior. And I plan on going to medical school after I finish Undergrad in 2026. And Med school won’t even finish until 2030. So there’s lots of time where I won’t be making an income.

She’ll finish her Undergrad in 2029. I don’t know her plans after that because she doesn’t even know what she wants to do with her life, but right now there’s far too much uncertainty, I only have $2500, she only has like $350 as she only started working recently, so I have no idea how we could manage one.

That being said she’s been begging and begging me to give it a shot and that we can do it. I keep telling her no. I told her she’s an idiot if she thinks it’s a good idea now and she told me I’m being rude.

She keeps telling me to trust her, that we can do it and that I’m being a coward for chickening out. I told her I want us to enjoy our youth, and that not only will we be happier having a baby later on, but the baby will have a better life.

She wouldn’t listen to any point I make, and I told her we aren’t having kids, end of discussion, I don’t consent or approve, she can keep crying about it. I told her she doesn’t know any better, and that as the older one of the two, I can make the better judgement call. We kept arguing about it, and eventually she left my place.

"WIBTA if I got eloped without including my parents? My fiancé Sam (31M) and I (34F) are planning on getting eloped in a week.

We have been together for 8 years and I get along very well with Sam's family. We've never had issues and while visiting they have always been so welcoming and encouraging. My family has always been full of drama and is toxic. I have been low contact since a huge fight and am trying to learn healthy boundaries. I am the only daughter and am living in another country.

Recently Sam's dad had a health scare. We weren't sure if he was going to make it. The life expectancy for Sam's dad is 2 years from the time of his diagnosis.

We are currently visiting Sam's family for the holidays. Beforehand I discussed with Sam the possibility of eloping when visiting due to his dad's health and life expectancy. We are the last couple within the family that aren't married. Sam loved the idea and his dad was overjoyed. My family also has known our plans to elope soon, but had not planned to travel to be a part of it.

Wanting to keep the peace within my family, we decided against an official ceremony. We are only signing the necessary papers with Sam's brother officiating and then going out for supper afterwards. A big ceremony later with everyone included on both sides of the family will happen later.This seemed like a good compromise, yet my mom cares A LOT about marriage and weddings. I called her to discuss things further and it went horribly. 

My mom said that if we do this without including her then she would cry. That I'm her only daughter and ""isn't she important?"" 

I offered to record the process and to send it as a video (I didn't think of live video at the time as an option). She said, ""No. You need to compromise and do a video call. You couldn't even be considerate about that?"" 

The day also became an issue. She would be at work at the time of the signing and kept saying she would never forgive me if I did this while she was at work. She also badmouthed Sam and his family. I stood up for them, but was getting increasingly frustrated. 

This continued and I just regret telling her anything, despite her knowing for months that it was going to happen soon. I might've messed up by eloping soon in the state with Sam's family instead of the state where we are living (with no one involved at all). 

When I talked about the current plans initially, she said she was okay with it and supported our decision, but then changed her mind entirely. 

I understand my mom wanting to be involved, but a live video call with my dad or her gives me so much anxiety. My dad made an awful impression on Sam's brother and Sam doesn't want to be around him due to how he treats me. (Sam has no issues with the rest of my family). 

WIBTA if I don't include my parents in the eloping process and just send them a video of it?

I feel like I might be the asshole due to not communicating the change of location until recently and offering only a recorded video instead of a live video of the signing of documents.",0.05
"AITA for not paying my sister $3000 that she thinks I owe her?? 
My sister and I rented an apartment together last year at the end of February. The total cost for the apartment was $4500 (first, last, and security). She paid $3000 and I paid $1500 (I was in a financial crisis at the time so I only put down whatever I had). She then asked me later on if I could pay her back the $3000 that she put down on the apartment because now she is “broke”…. Initially, I said no at first because I thought that sounded a little ridiculous that I should pay her back a full $3000 because technically I don’t OWE her $3000, I OWE her $750 (the other half for the apartment that I couldn’t afford that she paid for ). However, she didn’t like my response to that so then we got into this HUGE argument, she started bawling her eyes out, yelling at me, literally throwing a whole temper tantrum saying she could take me to court because we made an agreement on it, blah blah blah,  so then I just told her that I would pay her back anyways because I was just tired of going back and forth with her. If I decide not to pay her the $3000 can she sue me in court? I didn’t sign any legal documents stating I owe her $3000, it was a verbal agreement only. I need answers!!!!",0.2
"AITA for declining to make kindergarten crafts at an all-adults online meetup? Summary: I (F, 56) declined to make a kindergarten level craft project during a Zoom meetup with other adults. The hostess (F, 25?) was angry with me because she needs everyone to participate. I said I'd rather just hang out until they finished that part of the meeting. She said I had to leave if I didn't do the craft, so I left the meeting. AITA?

I was a member of an a recurring online meetup during the pandemic, with a rotation of different hosts. One of the hosts, who teaches preschool, thought it would be cute for us to all make a craft project together as part of her event because it was February and we should celebrate Valentine's Day. 

We didn't have a lot of time for that part of the meeting (half an hour or less) and she didn't want people to worry about buying materials. So her idea was to teach us how to make ""huggy hearts"" we could give to our family and friends for Valentine's day. Basically a paper heart with accordion-pleated arms and legs and a happy face drawn on the heart. This is the kind of thing your 5-year-old (or younger?) child would bring home so you can thank them for thinking of you and put it on the refrigerator. Uh, I guess props for thinking of something we can make out of whatever paper is handy, but it seemed kind of infantilizing. (This wasn't a drinking event so we don't even have that excuse.)

I said calmly that I wouldn't be participating in the craft activity, but I'd be happy to hang out while they did it and wait for the next part of the program. The hostess looked at me like a misbehaving child and argued that I could give it to my family or friends to show them how much I love them at Valentine's. 

Okay, maybe that's how she and her friends roll. My usual friend group (not the folks in the online group, I barely knew them) don't exchange Valentine's gifts except privately with their partners, and they would be baffled if I gave them some kindergarten craft project. Like, what do you do when a a professional artist who is older than you are gives you some kindergarten thing made from printer paper or grocery ads? 

She said everyone had to participate and I would be spoiling it for everyone if I didn't join the group--so if I want to stay, I have to do the craft project along with the group. If I don't want to make a Huggy Heart with them, I have to leave the meeting. Well, I don't like having people test my boundaries, so I left the meeting. AITA?

I could've just kept the peace by making the Huggy Heart and recycling it after the meeting, but I didn't like the hostess's attitude so I opted to leave her online meeting early.

My brother has always given me a hard time, making sugar daddy jokes and all different things. It went smooth the first few hours but then my brother got a few too many in him and started with the jokes. We brushed it off and laughed a little. Then He began saying how I look like the grandpa and my wife looks like she belongs with my son. I told him to shut up, which started an argument.

Harris has always been kind of introverted and a loner untill he met his roommate ""Selim"" (16M) just about a. year ago. Selim really got him out of his shell and theyve been like bestfriends. What I didn't know untill recently was that they were dating. Selim's dae is a middle eastern diplomat so I understand why he didn't say.

I only found out after I was  teasing my brother last week about never finding a bf because he was so introverted. He got mad an blurted out he had a bf but refused to say who. For a second I  thought it was one of his soccer teammates but I figured it out pretty quickly though and yesterday I talked to selim alone and told him I approved as long as he treated my brother right and that I wouldn't say anything.

He just denies everything and pretends to not know what I'm talking about. The next thing I know later that night I hear about a commotion in the boys dorm. Apparently Selim and Harris got into a huge argument lots of yelling.. I asked my brother what happened and he just yells at me for saying anything to Selim and that Selim is amd at him now saying he cant trust him.

We share a discord server where they never respond to me, and they always exclude me from everything and play dumb when I confront them by acting as they were oblivious even though it was the 4th time I’d questioned them.

Today at around noon me and them had finally gotten together and decided that we were going to do a Trios Rocket League Tournament at 6:00 PM as a sort of reunion. We played other game modes  up until around 5:50, where (N) said he had to get off. I was obviously upset however if he had to go he had to go I suppose. He said he was sorry and I assured him it was OK. 

There was then a SECOND tournament for duos at 9:00 PM. I asked (J) if he wanted to do it and he agreed. although, we did have to them grind the duos mode for hours so we could play it since he wasn’t as high of a level as me, I was willing to help him get there just to play the tourney with my BFF. Around 8:57, we had been waiting in the lobby for about eight minutes. 3 MINUTES BEFORE THE TOURNEY, he says “I’m tired, bye. *leaves party*” He must’ve noticed how mad I was about (N) leaving and he just wanted to screw with me. I was furious. Especially because he usually stays up till 4:00 AM. 

(N) gets on two hours later, he invited (J) but I then explained that he said he wanted to go to bed randomly and how bull it was that he did. Guess what? (J) joined the party on my alt account that we shared (he got banned for a week on his main) I asked him wtf and he responded with “I guess I wasn’t tired”. so I promptly locked him out, changed the password and banned him from our discord.

"AITA for running late grabbing dinner for pregnant wife? My wife [32F] and I [32M] both work from home, however my job is much more demanding, she’ll have 2-3 meetings per day where I’m usually on back-to-backs from 8a-5p.

Every so often it seems like she chooses to do  a ton of stuff around the house during her down time on a work day - which is great to do it on “work” time because in theory we can then both hang out on “our” time - but then she makes me feel like I don’t pull my weight around the house… I’ll thank her for doing everything and get an attitude ridden “Mhmm”…

So this happened the other day, I got a quick break around 4pm between meetings to grab a bite to eat and she was in the kitchen, I thanked her, got the “mhmm”, and then she said I can make it up to her by picking up some fast food for dinner, which I said I would do.

I told her that I had a final meeting at 5p, and that I would try to take it from the car because she’s been liking to eat earlier and getting very hangry when she doesn’t during pregnancy - it seems like she heard me say I WOULD leave at 5, and of course as fate would have it I ended up needing to be near the pc to take some notes down during the call…

5:29p rolls around (it’s a 30 min call) and I hear the garage opening, text her real quick to let her know I’m literally about to leave and get a response that says something along the lines of “I’m pissed and don’t need you pretending like you were going to do something nice”

"AITA for not memorizing things important to my loved ones? My mom has just called me becouse her dog nearly died becouse of a fight with a neighbor's dog. The dog is alright now, will need some medical help but definitely not in danger anymore. Naturally my mom is in great distress, and I am sad to see it. I had asked all about the dog's condition, emergency help, vet appointments, bills (if help here needed), mom's psychological condition, neighbor's dog, possible legal charges. But then I messed the dog's name. And also age -- I have asked mom if her second, younger dog is OK but actually the younger one is the dog who had fight. Mom was very put down and hang on soon after. 

It is my lifelong problem. I don't remember things like dog's names, hobbies and projects, dates, names of children and spourses, plans about moving or career changes or education, vacations. Mostly I write it down and prepare to communicate with people by reading my notes about them (""Nancy, 39 y.o., birthday 01.01, kids: John 03.03 and Mary 23.04, cat Baby, not married, dating Sam, likes comedies, likes to try new fragrances, working on a project XXX, wants to trip to Seul, wants to learn Korean"").

 I were in troubles for this thing more that I am willing to admit. People said to me that I just don't care. It is sadly true. I don't care. It all just don't feel important.

"AITA for telling my roommate to stop eating my food? I moved in with my roommate about 3-4 months ago. When we moved in I had a part-time job and my roommate did not. She had no way of making money the first month we were here. All her money that was saved was for rent. For context we share a college on campus apartment. The rent is about $400 a month. 

I told her not to worry about food and that until she has a job and can provide her own food she can eat mine, except for specific items that are my comfort foods.

I lost my job after the first month and she got 2 jobs. I only buy groceries for myself and my groceries are mostly my comfort foods. I recently left for a week to visit some family and came home to all my food gone. Especially the exact ones I told her to not eat whatsoever.

I asked her to please replace my food as I bought it for specifically me and could not afford to buy any more. She told her she would on her next paycheck.

2 weeks later still no replacement. I asked her again. She yelled and screamed at me, saying that it’s clear no one likes her and she should just die. She said I was telling her what to do with her money and that I was in her pockets, and that she would do whatever she wants with her money. I told her I understand but she ate all my groceries, which is not a lot.. I can’t afford to buy more. I added that I only care about the comfort foods being replaced because I’m currently fighting an ED, and to only replace those and nothing else and that it was only fair. She agreed to get it a few days after the argument.

A week later still nothing. My cousin is staying with us for now and providing my groceries. She is now eating his groceries. On top of that, She is boasting to us about how much money she makes 24/7 now. I brought up my replacement groceries after the most recent time she bragged about making a thousand at work in a day, and she lost it on me again. Saying, now your cousin Is staying here and already helping you so why should I buy the replacements ? She told me I don’t let things go and nothing is that serious, and that she can’t help it if she eats my food because she forgets.

I feel like she’s right though. I decided not to bring it up again because clearly she won’t fix things, and instead just started putting sticky notes on things so she doesn’t forget what not to eat. That had worked so far, however just to mock me or something she bought my comfort foods and put sticky notes on them so I know it’s not replacements and just for her. Now she is rude to me and doesn’t speak to me at all.

"AITA for telling my girlfriend to not scream at me while ranting about her colleagues? So me (M22) and my GF (F23) have been together for 1 Year and 8 Months and have a pretty good relationship going imo.

But yesterday during the evening and night we had a huge fight. To set the scene im writing my bachelor thesis at the moment and she is currently working to become a nurse. I am also currently trying to quit weed and have some withdrawel symptoms. We both havent slept well the last few days and are both pretty stressed.

But our evening went well until suddenly after dinner her mood changed drasticly. I try to ask whats wrong but she doesnt wanna talk about and tells me its not about me and i should leave her alone for a while.

She goes to take a hot bath and afterwards she just starts crying on my chest. I ask her whats wrong and she starts telling me about how her colleagues treat her like shit because they take a smoke break every hour while she doesnt smoke. So she does way more work than her colleagues who get paid way more. While she is ranting she is getting really loud so i ask to lower her voice. I felt like she was just letting all her rage out on me.

But after that comment she just stops her rant and is really pissed. She starts crying again and tells me to forget it. Any attempt to get her to open up to me again is rejected so I suggest we should both get some sleep, because its getting late at this point and we both havent slept well the last few days.

Instead she starts scrolling through facebook and turns around 180 degrees. I am pretty tired at this point so I just start sleeping but i wake up an hour later to her just leaving her own appartment. I try to stop her but she just doesnt listen to me while the door to the elevator closes.

She only did that move once after our worst fight so I am getting angry at this point. Because I felt like i havent done anything wrong up to this point and i dont understand how she doesnt see that sleeping is the best option for both of us right now.

I dont follow her downstairs cuz its cold as fuck. Instead i write some angry messages that she should just come upstairs and get some sleep. I write that she has no reason to be acting this way towards me.

Eventually she comes back but she is now really angry at me because of those messages it takes some mory crying from her and convincing from my side but eventually we sleep. However today she is still pissed at me and doesnt wanna see me.

"AITA for not letting my mum use my discounted travel pass anymore? I (23m) still live with my mum (50f). I have a lot of health issues and limited mobility so I rely on public transport and taxis to get from A to B. Due to my needs, I have a discounted travel pass that lets me travel across my city either for free or a 90% reduction. As I’m often in physical discomfort or experiencing general fatigue, I don’t go out that often, but I still enjoy going to places at the weekend, usually to see friends or the cinema or go to listen to local bands at small seated venues. I also don’t travel to work that often as my company let me work from home a few times a week. So my use of the pass isn’t an everyday thing. Due to this, my mum, who spends a lot on travel because of her job, uses my travel pass. I allowed her to do it because she’s the only person that takes care of me, and she’s my mum so why not let her travel for free if I’m not using it, she would do the same for me. 

However, she isn’t supposed to be using my travel pass. It’s in my name and has my face on it, so if a ticket inspector came, she would be in a lot of trouble and I could lose my card. That being said, inspectors don’t frequent public transport that often but you never know when they can pop up. 

Last week Saturday, she was going out to the pharmacy and then the hairdressers and she still had my travel pass from the day before. I usually like to visit my local theatre venue to watch my friends practice until 5pm. Although, I woke up a little late, I still had time until 5pm to visit before they finished. Just in case I decided to go, I needed my travel pass. 

My mum outright refused to give it to me. She said she’ll be coming back early and so I should just wait, and then she said “you’re not even sure that you’ll go”. But tbh, why is it her business if I ended up not going? It was still my travel pass. Also, she was only taking a couple of buses. While I would understand a little more if she was taking a train as they are more expensive, buses are £2 for a journey where I live. It wouldn’t put a dent in her purse to pay that just for the day. But as I was explaining that I’d like to see my friends, she just walked out. Also, ticket inspectors usually check on buses, not so much on trains, which is why she said she doesn’t really use the pass on buses. So I don’t know why that Saturday she decided to do that. 

When she came back, I didn’t speak to her. I took my pass and told her I’m not letting her use it again. There have been times where I’ve gone out and I’ve had to use my own money because I’ve forgotten to take my pass from her. Yet she can’t fathom spending her own money when I might need my own pass for travel, as if she has the right to decide when it’s justified for me to use my pass. But at the same time, she’s my mum, and she takes care of me, and maybe it was a little harsh to ban her from using the card.

"AITA if I cut off the gravy train Last year, I married a man who had housed his sister and her teenaged sons for years.  The sister was initially a teenaged mom whose parents housed and boarded her and her sons until the kids were 12.  When those parents retired, they could no longer afford to feed and house their daughter and her kids, so my then-single husband took them in, thinking that once the boys turned 18 and left home, their mother would move out, too. However, only one boy left home and went to work.  The other boy and his mother remained. The mother was employed, but she didn’t help by paying rent or helping with house expenses. When she lost her job in 2011, she refused to look for work.  At the same time, my husband became unemployed.  He supported the sister, her unemployed adult son, and himself with credit cards and withdrawals from his 401k.  Eventually, my husband found a new job, and he continued to support them, and they continued to enjoy his generosity without assuming any of the financial burdens of their living expenses.  When I married my husband, his relatives still resided in his home, and by this time they had been there about 24 years.  His sister didn’t want him to get married, and she demanded that he keep secret  from me how much money he gave her and her son.

He has gone to eat solo with his other friends so it makes me feel like an extreme bore. After this scenario happened the other day, I was uninterested in hanging out the rest of the day. I had said I would stay up later to play video games but I went to bed early instead and my room mate was upset that I didn't play with him. It has always been hard for me to make friends and I had thought I finally found a genuine friendship with him , but when things like this happen I question it.

AITA for not hanging out with my room mate after he casually canceled our plans again?",0.12
"WIBTA for asking my family and in-laws to stop expecting my nearly three year old twins to share their presents? With the risk of sounding ungrateful and spoiled for having family members that buy presents for my kids;

I have nearly three year old twins. This Christmas they got toys from both my family and my in-laws. My issue is that they only got one of each toy, meaning they have had to share everything. For example they got a small grocery cart with plastic groceries, and a train that can drive forward. They have been constantly fighting over the toys every single day since, because only one of the boys can play with the toy at a time. The cart is broken, because they kept fighting over it. And I have had to remove the battery from the toy train to make it less interesting, since it was non-stop screaming over who got to play with it.

We don't think it's fair to expect them to share their toys. Their cousin is one year old, and he gets his own presents that he doesn't have to share with anyone. Had our kids been born a year apart, then they would also have recieved separate presents. 

We haven't talked to our families about this yet, but the kids' birthday is in March, so it's right around the corner, and we want to avoid this happening again.

So, would I be an a-hole for asking my family and in-laws to buy two of each toy, or to simply not buy toys at all and instead just buy clothes?

Edit: My mom gave the cart, and the in-laws (the kids’ grandma and grandpa) gave the train. The presents are always labelled “For X & Y”. So it’s one toy for both kids.",0.2
"AITA for asking my friends to please scrape the remaining food from their dishes into the garbage when they’re done? I’ve always hated washing the dishes by hand, I cannot stand the feeling of touching or seeing wet food. It’s a genuine war to resist my stomach turning whenever I have to do it. I can’t use a dishwasher because ours broke and we need to raise money for a new one, so by hand is our only option and I keep losing my rubber gloves for some reason. 

I live with my partner and my best friends, and we rotate who has to do the dishes for that week. I’ve asked them multiple times to please just scrape their extra food into the garbage can that is directly under the sink because of my sensory issues, and their response is always the same, “I shouldn’t have to do more work because of your sensory issues, they’re not my problem”. 

I’ve never once used it as an excuse to not do the dishes, I’ve always done them whenever it’s my turn, but at this point I’m wondering if I’m somehow being unreasonable for asking them to just open the cabinet 6 inches under the sink and scrape the remaining food into the can because it’s the biggest issue between the four of us. It’s not like I’m asking them to scrub them out after every meal, I’m just asking for there not to be half eaten bowls and plates of wet rice, lettuce, corn, or whatever else is in there whenever it’s our turn for dishes. 

My partner and I have been fighting with them for 2 months on this topic, and they say that we’re always on the same page, but nothing ever gets resolved. it feels like we’re the ones left with the extra work of scraping and scrubbing food from their dishes, while we try our best to scrape whatever remaining food is left on our dishes so they don’t have to stand there for 45 minutes scraping crusted brownies out of a mug. 

At this point we’ve fought over this topic so many times, I’m starting to wonder if I’m the unreasonable one here. Everyone in the house knows that I’m autistic with sensory issues, and they claim to have researched what that means and that they listen to my accommodations, but I just feel so ignored and disrespected that they don’t even try.",0.14
"AITA for telling my younger sister I think she has autism I (F17) have a younger sister (10) who is one of my best friends. We have always been close despite out age gap and we always talked girl stuff and been close (we are the only 2 children of my parents). Recently I have noticed my sister displaying symptoms of autism that my parents maybe haven't picked up on. She has severe noise sensitivity and when there are loud noises she often covers her ears and in some cases cries. Another thing is she is extremely picky about the way clothes fit and is they have ruffles or are too tight she won't were them because she doesn't like the feeling, she is also sensitive to certain textures such as polystyrene as well as her not understanding when me or my dad make a sarcastic joke she takes it seriously and doesn't understand sarcasm. My best friend (M17) also had autism which is diagnosed not highly affecting but he also has these symptoms. I did some research and all these are symptoms of mild autism. I brought this up with my sister asking her what she thought and she wasn't sure, the subject slipped out in conversation with my dad and now my parents are mad telling me that it's not my business and I should not have told her this as she is now confused and upset (maybe she was a bit confused but she didn't seem upset).

"AITA for not wanting my MIL at the hospital for the birth of my daughter? AITA for not wanting my MIL in the hospital when I give birth?
I (31f) and my husband (32m) are expecting our 2nd baby girl in 10 days. Last night, his mother texted me telling me I am not allowed to name her granddaughter Mavka because she googled it and didn't like the name interpretations she found. I told her I was aware of the Ukrainian folklore, but that was the name my husband and I had agreed on after many many months of debate and searching for a name that fit all our criteria. She then proceeded to tell me I was being selfish, careless, thoughtless, etc and she refused to call her that or tell anyone that was her name. I told her she didn't have to like the name, but it was not her decision to make.
I tell my husband his mother is arguing with me about the baby's name and he asks me if she told me why. I told him she had, but me and him had already discussed those meanings when I first stumbled across the name (children's movie on Hulu). Of course, he has no recollection of this 🙄 due to his reaction, I asked him if she had already spoken to him about this and he said yes! So I asked him why he thought it was appropriate for her to approach me about it instead of him and he claimed to not know she was going to say something to me. And he didn't say another word about it, so I don't really know where he stands on the name anymore but I know he's not going to argue with me about it this close to birth, especially since I've already ordered her personalized swaddles with that name on them.
I continued texting with his mother, trying to assure her the name was fine, crying in frustration that he ignored, until she told me she'd lost all respect for me. At that point, I no longer want her around for the birth. My friend told me that was going too far, but honestly I feel like if you have no respect for me and aren't supportive, then you have no business being there.
I haven't told my husband or his mother yet, but I'm sure it'll be a fight. I'll have them both removed from the room if I have to, but of course I don't want to have this kind of drama during a time that is supposed to be joyous.

"AITA for telling a friend to stop constantly asking me how I am? A friend keeps double texting me or texting me small talk. He’ll ask twice a week how my week has been. Then if I don’t reply he’ll say he hopes my week went well towards the end of the week. Then he’ll just keep messaging me small talk like this about every other day despite me not replying. If I still don’t reply he’ll begin sending me photos of his dogs saying they say hi and want to know how I am because they haven’t hear from me. 

My other friends and I don’t have small talk like this. We will occasionally ask how each other is if we haven’t spoken recently or hung out recently. When we text it’s either to invite each other somewhere or to discuss something like an actual conversation with substance. The conversation is usually about something and not nothing. 

In the past when I have replied to his small talk messages it gets nowhere. There’s no substance to the conversation and it’s boring so I stopped relying. At one point I ignored the how my week was questions and asked him what’s up as in what did he want to actually discuss. He proceeded to invite me somewhere but again added “I still want to know how your week was”. This is a weekly thing and it’s annoying because my weeks are usually the same which I’ve told him so he doesn’t need to ask multiple times a week. He told me he was just trying to be nice and is interested in how I am and that I’m acting rude for ignoring or not wanting to acknowledge his questions.",0.22
"AITA because I got upset that my step daughter ate dairy after I made her a lactose free meal… We had some family in town and my step daughter(19), step son(25), husband, mom, Sil, niece(11), and nephew(8) were all there for dinner. I made a huge pan of lasagna the first piece I cut was huge and my husband is going through chemo so I knew he wouldn’t eat the huge piece. I gave it to my step son. Turned around cut another piece and gave it to my husband and cut another piece for myself and sat down to eat.  While we were eating my step daughter was sitting in the corner of the couch and did not get up. Suddenly she starts crying so my husband asks her what’s wrong. She goes on to say that she is lactose intolerant and can’t eat the lasagna and was also upset I didn’t serve her a plate(I didnt serve everyone, the first plate was an oops and then served my husband). My husband tells all the other options in the kitchen she can eat or go make. She stays upset. So I got up from my plate and make her a whole other dinner that was lactose free. She Never moved from the couch, I made it, put it on a plate and took it to the couch. My sil made some desert that is chocolate chip cookie crust, cream cheese and chocolate pudding filling (with milk), and whipped cream and topping. Everyone is getting some and my step daughter eats a piece of that…. So fast forward a day later my husband goes to thank me again for doing that but instead of your welcome I try to talk to him and tell him how it made me feel that she couldn’t eat lasagna and I got up from eating to make her a special dinner because in that moment she was lactose intolerant but still ate the dairy filled dessert.

"AITA for planning to standup to my in-laws? I (F32) welcome my first child in 2021. 

A little background: During the pregnancy, we (My husband (M37) and I) discovered that I am a “carrier” of an X chromosome genetic disease. With this disease, there is no way to confirm how badly, if at all, the disease will affect any children that I pass this onto. Thankfully our child does not have this disease, which we didn’t find out until a month after he was born.

In the original appointment with our child geneticist, the doctor was confused as to why I referred to myself as a “carrier” as my disease has no “carriers.” You either have it or not. What we were previously told my the OB geneticist was wrong. I suddenly had to make appointments for 10 different specialist, which make up my regular health team. 

On top of this, I was struggling to breastfeeding a very fussy needed to be held to sleep newborn during a national formula shortage. 

I was also diagnosed with postpartum depression that affected my ability to accept help. In my mind, this was my child and I had to do EVERYTHING. Not even my husband could help. It took me about 6 months to accept the smallest bit of help from my husband and my mother (F58) and still struggle to let go. 

Although not directly to me, my in-laws are not happy that I do not let them put my child to sleep or leave him alone with them. In their eyes, I do not trust them. For me, it’s the fact that this is my child and my responsibility. 

Over the summer, we sat down with my in-laws (F60 and M65) to fill them in on everything that my husband and I had been going through. I was expecting them to acknowledge what we went through and be a little bit more understanding on why I do what I do and how I think. Instead my FIL proceeded to tell me that I am how I am because I am not accepting help from my village. That him and his wife raised their kids and they are alive and I should have no problem with them letting them help. 

I tried to further explain myself but my FIL just kept saying that I did not trust them and if I’m tired, it’s because I do not take advantage my village. A few weeks after, Hillary Clinton’s book, It Takes A Village, arrived to our house with a note saying “this book will help you understand.” 

A few weeks ago, we found out we are expecting our second child and I am trying to prepare myself. One of the things I want to do is set clear boundaries with my in-laws.

We welcome them to our home and we travel to see them. I send pictures/updates to them, most of the time they don’t even respond to the message. When we are with them, I never limit their interaction/play time with our child. I just don’t let them put him to sleep or change him, the things I consider my responsibility. I think my in-laws want to help but on their terms.

"AITA for getting frustrated when explaining my class schedule to my parents I (19F) am currently a freshman in college. I just got into a huge argument with my parents and I know that I could have definitely handled it better but AITA? For context I just finished my first semester in college. I have always struggled in school, not really grade wise but i struggle paying attention in class. I try to pay attention but my mind always ends up drifting to something else and before i know it it’s been 30 minutes and I haven’t listened to anything my professor has said. I struggle with many other symptoms of (what my ex therapist said was most likely) adhd or autism or both. I have been wanting to get tested because this has made turning in and remembering assignments really difficult for me, but my parents don’t believe me and everytime i bring it up they say it is because i don’t get enough sleep or i’m not eating right. So onto the argument. I was taking classes so that I could apply to switch from a biochem major to a marketing major. My request was denied because my grades didn’t qualify to switch. I admit i am in the wrong here. my parents pay for my college and I know that I have messed up. Because i have to retake two classes to get the grades required to switch my major. since finding out that I was not able to switch my major i have switched up my lifestyle in order to make sure i can get the grades necessary. i have started going to bed and waking up early and i have created a complete plan of how i will make it up this semester and going forward. today i was showing my parents my new schedule and explaining it to them and my parents kept commenting on my online class that i wouldn’t be able to do it and that i wouldn’t try hard on it and complete my assignments. this really triggered me because of how hard i’ve been working to show them that i am serious about school despite them ignoring my struggles with it. this created an argument. i said that i didn’t want to discuss with this anymore and i started to go upstairs and my dad said that i would need to figure out my own phone bill. i said that if my grades start slipping again j know it’s because i’m working to pay off my stuff and he said we will see if i even go back. at that point i left and i want to know AITA?",0.67
"AITA for not staying home so my brother can go out? Me (16f) and my brother (17m) made plans with some friends today. My brother handled all the planning as it was his idea and he was very picky on everything so it just made sense. 

My mother was informed by my brother earlier today that he and his friend are going to go out at around 8pm if the rain stops. After that, he communicated absolutely nothing with my mother prior to making arrangements. I was also uninformed, everything he planned, he planned privately. 

Some important info, the friends we were planning on going out with were MY friends that I made. My brother lives out of town and comes here every 2 months and when he does, he goes out with me and my friend group. My mom and stepdad had to go to the temple (were hindu) and my sister had a birthday she attended that day. My brother (8) didnt want to stay home alone. 

Anyways, my mother and stepdad were just getting ready to head out when my brother told our mom that we’re going out at 5:30 or 6pm. She was livid as none of this was discussed beforehand and I didn’t know that either. As my brother did not want to go to the temple NOR stay home alone, and someone had to wait for my sister to return (which means someone would have to be home), she asked me to stay home until 8pm while my brother goes out with my friends and that i could join later. I said no as I wanted to hang out with them too and didn’t want to be excluded.

She was pissed. She started screaming at me to never ask any favors from her ever again and that I never watch the kids so she can go out (which I do and already did 3+ times that week). So my stepdad had to stay home and my mom went alone. It turned out to be my fault that my mom was uninformed meanwhile I had no say in the planning of the outing.

"AITA because I want to know exactly what is in my luggage? My wife (33F) and me (30M) are traveling by plane tomorrow. She has a backpack, I have a backpack and a small check-in luggage. She travelled on short notice, didn't bring much and even bought clothes here. It was obvious that she has to put some things in my luggage. That is absolutely fine since there was plenty of space.

We spent the holidays with my parents and there are a few gifts (including alcohol). My uncle is a butcher and we got some unlabelled cans of pork that we want to bring home. We were starting to pack in the morning. I was aware that there are limitations on some of these items that we want bring back but we were both uninformed about exact numbers. Hence, I asked her to put everything she can't fit into her backpack next to my luggage. Then, I would check the legal limits before packing the items myself. I thought that request was reasonable but she gave me the evil eyes and left the room without replying to my request. When she came back, I confronted her about her dismissive reaction and things escalated over the next 6(!) hours. 

Maybe worth mentioning: half a year ago, she secretly put some liquid in a side pocket of my carry on luggage briefly before I left home for a flight. I was annoyed back then and explained to her that I want to be aware of what is in my luggage. Obviously liquids have to be removed during security checks. If I'm not aware of such liquids, this might cause delays and unpleasant luggage checks. I am certain she had good intentions but didn't think it thought. I thought by setting this boundary, I wouldn't have to discuss this again. 

There is no sense of understanding for my urge to have an overview of what's in the luggage that I am responsible for. She claims that she had everything under control, yet she does not know the legal limits we can bring. She blames me for having a lack of trust and I suspect that she thought that I want to control the things she is 'allowed' to bring.",0.08
AITA to point out that one classmate is stealing money in the name of helping? So I 20 (f) is a nursing student. In our college hostel resident can't go out of the college campus without a permission. Even then it's for a  limited time. As 80% of the student stays in hostel. So they relied on us who lives off campus to bring basic necessary things. I help out if it's convenient for me. But if it's something like going to bookstore ( almost 2  hours journey) I would like compensation for my time. Now one of our classmates R does most of this shopping. Now I have noticed that she sometimes take more money than it's actual cost. Its okay if it's for her time compensation but when someone ask her why it cost more she says yeah I don't know. If they  press more then she says oh how ungrateful you are. Now onto the part where I might messed up. Few days ago our anatomy sir provided a lecture sheet. R willing took on the responsibility to photocopy it for everyone. When she gave us copies she asked triple the usual cost of photocopy. When I asked her why it cost more she just said it's the usual price which I'm sure is not. So I blew up and called her theif. We had some pretty heated argument.

"AITA for trying to avoid meeting my brother's new girlfriend. My brother (40) and I (36) have never had the best relationship. He was the golden child when we were kids, I was the lazy, useless one that was never good enough for our parents.

&#x200B;

For most of the time I could tolerate his bullying. It wasn't anything I didn't deal with at school. Mostly it was name calling - fat, lazy, ugly, dumb. Typical sibling behaviour. He'd lash out sometimes, usually when he was really annoyed with me for one reason or another. I was used to it so it didn't really bother me. It only got worse after I was diagnosed with autism in 2000. 

&#x200B;

He split from his wife a couple years ago (that's a completely different disaster). Ever since, our relationship has started to improve gradually. He will mostly respond to my texts and will reach out for my b'day if he's not working. It's still a fragile relationship, I'm trying not to annoy him again and set back our progress.

&#x200B;

Recently started dating J (?F). My parents seem to like her, but I haven't met her yet. I sent her a little Christmas gift this year, a little handmade bracelet I'd had for a while. I gave my brother a fuel card, something I knew he could use. She's apparently a dog breeder, but I've got my doubts about her legitimacy.

&#x200B;

That seems to have opened the floodgates. Now J keeps messaging me. She's super family oriented and wants to meet me in person. I tried telling her that I wasn't willing to risk my fragile relationship with my brother just yet. She replied that us meeting had nothing to do with him. I told her that it is all about him. She's still sending messages every couple days trying to force me to agree to the meeting. I'm thinking about sending copies of the chats to my brother, but I'm worried that will make him turn away from me again.

"AITA if I pull my son out of a sport? My son (11) and I have participated in a sport together for about a year. I don’t think he loves the sport necessarily but he likes the coaches and one in particular because they share a love of anime. I think my son likes having a male influence since his dad left us abruptly and traumatically about a month ago. But when we go to the class, he doesn’t seem that motivated and he isn’t really seeing results. It’s like before the class and after, he enjoys sharing all his anime thoughts but the 45 minutes of class, he’s frustrated and kind of pissed. AITA for pulling us out?

EDIT: I have talked him numerous times and he doesn’t want to quit because he likes the coach. But for the entire class, he’s almost in tears with frustration. If he enjoyed the class, no matter the results, I would never have asked the community. I just don’t know what’s worse: leaving the coach or leaving the frustration. 

The sport is boxing. No sparring. Just bag work or partner work with mitts and gloves. It’s good for both of us. We’re both traumatized and suffering. It breaks my heart to see him like this during the class but he’s like this with everything that’s frustrating even before his dad left. He been going to a counselor for a year and has seen a dr over his frustration management. I just worry that the frustration with his dad and boxing might be affecting his mental health. 

I also want to thank everyone who has posted support for me as a newly single mother. The whole family, me and my two boys are just trying to do the best we can. Some of the posters have made it to be that I’m a heartless mother for taking him out of something that is a sport. My concern is that he was being overwhelmed, and his life is plenty overwhelming as it is. I have done nothing but support that little boy his whole life. He’s passionate about gardening so he has 10 planters, he plays trumpet, and fixes old computers that I’ve had donated from our neighborhood. He bbqs a mean set of baby back ribs and so I got him a charcoal bbq for Christmas and he loves it. He’s been able to try anything he wants and has been going to a counselor for about a year. His mental health is the utmost importance to me.

"AITA for being mean to my friend? So I (22F) have been friends with my best friend (22F) since my high school sophomore year. We we’re so close, I used to think we were basically like the same person. We’ve always been brutally honest with each other and we’ve always supported each other. Recently, I’ve realized how shes been changing. Specifically how she’s changed when it comes to men. I know it sounds immature to say but she acts boy crazy. She is constantly acting like she NEEDS a man. In the past when we were younger she’d always disapprove of the men I dated/showed interest in, it was always understandable & I genuinely did always take her advice. My point is that she wasn’t afraid to be blunt and let me know I was waisting my time. Me on the other hand, I wasn’t as blunt. I sugar coated things a bit but i think thats just how I am. I never felt any way about her voicing her opinions & I didn’t want her to sugar coat things for me.

Fast forward to now. She started talking to this guy over the summer and he is the worst. I’m not going to go in depth but he is a horrible person. He’s mean to her, to her face and behind her back. He cheats, lies & doesn’t respect her in the slightest. There’s a lot more but I won’t disclose on the internet. I’m assuming that the reason she does put up with him is that he uses cheap psychology on her. But I’m really surprised that she stays with him granted how she used to be to me. She used to make it seem like she would never take disrespect from a man.

For the past months they’ve been together all she does is talk about everything that he does, and how bad he treats her. Shes constantly crying and repeating the same things. In the beginning i tried to be supportive of her and give her the right advice but no matter what, she doesn’t take my advice and ends up running back to him & defending him, calling him a good person. Recently I’ve been getting fed up and I’ve been super blunt about who he is and how he doesn’t respect her. I ended up typing to her one day after one of her rants, “You look dumb and desperate for staying with him after he repeatedly disrespects you and plays in your face. Girl hates you, he knows you have no self respect and won’t leave him. Everyone can see it except for you.

Yesterday she said she wanted a promise ring for her birthday and I reminded her that the holiday is her birthday present already, she responded with 'You actually dont want to get me a ring'' I said that I do and she said no so I tried to explain that her birthday gift is the holiday. She then accused of me of never wanting to replace her ring by saying I was 'unbothered' and that I didnt want to buy another £60 promise ring for her, I tried to explain to her that I can't buy her a ring and couldn't before because of everything that I pay for towards the relationship and my other personal responsibilties that I have in my life.  
  
She continued to accuse me of being unbothered and not trying and then she said if 'I wanted to I would' and that is when I called her ungrateful and she called me out for rubbing in her face that I am paying for the holiday and everything else and that she never wanted anything else for me and I ended the argument with saying I would never spend money on her again and that I didn't want to take her to the hoiday anymore.

"WIBTA if I kicked my daughters homeless friend out of my house? Update (Re-typing it to help with any further questions)
I a 35f have a daughter 16f (Abby) and her friend 16f (Zara).

I'm looking for advice on what to do. I live in America. About a year ago I took in Zara into my house after her mom kicked her out. Zara's a good kid. She got kicked out because her and her mom would constantly get into screaming matches, we know it's because Zara's mom is a narcissist and blames everyone else. When Zara came into my house I told her I only have two rules. No Drugs, or alcohol. 

My phone charger has been mysterious appearing in my room and then moving to other parts of the house. My phone takes type C but everyone else used lightning cables. However we all still have devices that use type C, that's why I checked her room. After asking around for over two weeks I haven't found out who did it. Over the weekend I searched Abby and Zara's room, they share a room. I found a fifth of vodka as well as reusable weed pens, and other e-cigarette's on Zara's side of her room.

Zara takes classes online and rarely goes out with friends. She's basically house kept at her own will. So I don't know how to go about punishing her. Zara has found other accommodations while living at our house but choses to stay with us. I don't want to kick her out because I know how hard it is to get footing in the door especially with how high living costs have gotten. So maybe if I threaten to do so it wont happen again?

So if making threats a horrible thing to do please let me know. I told her my boundaries and she crossed them. I just don't want her to influence my other kids.

Edit* So I talked to Zara about three hours after posting this. I told her I'm going to give her three months to clean up her act but if she can't I wont allow her to live with us anymore.

"AITA for telling my mom the truth? There’s a kind of ‘soup’ in my country that we can have as a breakfast, my (15M) mom usually makes it for my sister (17F) randomly. She says my sister loves it and my sister is always seems happy to eat it.

Today I felt like trying it for once, I told my mom to make me some. She agreed. My sister woke up after I told mom that and mom told her I will also be having some too. My sister pulled me aside and told me I better not say anything about the soup. I’m not really a picky eater so I told her of course not.

Well I was very wrong. The soup was really really bitter. And the strange thing is it’s definitely not supposed to taste that way lol. When my mom left the kitchen I noticed my sister eating it but she would look a bit in pain. I asked her how the hell she was finishing her plate and she said mom always makes it that way and she has no idea how but I should not tell her. 

I thought this was stupid so when my mom came back I told her that I think something was wrong with the soup, she looked a bit dejected and told me she had no idea what could be wrong. My sister then assured her that it was fine and I was being a baby. 

And after that my sister told me that I better make up an excuse to stop mom from being sad cause she loves cooking and takes pride in it (to be fair everything she makes is so good in comparison). She also told me to just not eat it again and she’s fine having it anyway because unlike me she puts mom first. 

AITA? I don’t know if I should apologize or do what my sister said. My mom has also been double checking everything she cooks now asking if I have any problem with it.",0.38
"AITA for not ""just letting my step brother have the green one""? So, me (13f), my stepbrother (13m), stepmother (35f), my stepmother's friend (f) and my dad (37m) were going to play a game. I said I wanted to use the green piece (you know these little things you use to move forward in the game?). Then the rest chose their color but when it came to my step brother he said he wanted to be green. He hadn't heard me when I said I wanted to be green since he was in the kitchen so I (politely) told him I had already taken the green one. He then said ""no, because I am going to be green."" I, once again, told him I had already chosen the green one and he hit me with the ""I took out the game so I had already chosen"". I usually wouldn't fight more but since my parents are always babying my step brother because he has autism (which I have full respect for since my half brother has autism, they just use it as an excuse for EVERYTHING) I decided I wasn't going to back down since I had already clearly said I was going to be green and he can't ALWAYS get exactly what he want. So I stood my ground and said ""no, I'm green"". He then said he wasn't going to play and my response was just a simple ""okay."" He then ran off to his room and cried. My step mother then scolded me and was like ""couldn't you just let him be green since he wanted it so bad?"" So am I the asshole or not?

And I know that this probably sound ridiculous and like a ""kid problem"" but I always back down and let him have what he want since I know that it's usually not worth anything to fight him because our parents will take his side anyways. I just want to know if I overreacted and should have just let him be the green one.

PS. If you guys are wondering since I mentioned his autism, no he isn't always the green one. He switches it up and if it would have been about that I would have let him have the green one. DS",0.07
"WIBTA if I pretended to forget to send my classmate the already done homework after I said that I would send them to him? I 17F have this classmates that basically only messages me to ask me to send him already done homework and I’m starting to get tired of this. I actually had a crush on him for a long time and I still kind of do. We actually used to talk a lot more of anything even deeper topics and we considered each other friends, like he would talk to me and sit next to me, we wouldn’t chat but still. He already asked me homework at the time but I didn’t really care, and also for my class and me asking already solved homework is normal, I also ask it sometimes (almost never to him) but it’s not the only reason you speak to a person. The problem is in the last period he has been talking to me very rarely and only asking me for homework and I miss our old relationship even if it wasn’t romantic and it’s really getting me down, the only times he talks to me it’s still for things that are school subjects related. I don’t understand why he doesn’t treat me like a friend anymore, he told me private things about him that I never told anyone and never will and I enjoyed talking to him so much. We were never super close but still. Also I never told him I have a crush on him and I think nobody knows since I act around him like I act with him like I act with the other guys, maybe I just laugh a little more. Anyway yesterday he asked me for all the homework for after the holidays break when I just returned from a vacation even if he couldn’t have known I was back, I said that I was on vacation and that I would have sent him when I returned and done them since I still didn’t complete anything, he replied with an exaggerated thanks and the next day I told him in a funny way that I probably would have finished them last minute and that I was going to do them not so goodly or something like that and he left me on read after hours and I feel so bad now because I don’t understand what I did wrong to push him away and why he didn’t reply when he was the one to ask them and when I talk to him about them then he ignores me like he wasn’t the one to ask. Does he expect me to just send them to him the minute I’m done with them without saying anything else so he can just reply with a “thank youu”? It isn’t the first time he ignores the texts I send to try and start a conversation but I don’t recall him ever leaving me on read like this. The crush had already started fading but it is a lot faster after this. I think I’ll just do the homework the way I can do them and pretend I forgot to send them and maybe send them if he reminds me, even if i’d prefer not to, but I think that would be mean thing to do since I already told him that I would send them to him and this would make him struggle, but I feel used.

"AITA for Letting My Puppy Whine Outside? I (24f), and my partner (21f), have a rat terrier puppy (5 months) in our apartment complex that we adopted from my partner's coworker at 4 months old. He was incredibly spoiled and attached at the hip to his previous owners, and has some separation anxiety that we have been slowly trying to get rid of.  
  
For context, our puppy sleeps inside of our apartment in a crate right next to our bed. He has a playpen on the balcony, as we live on the second floor. Our puppy loves to bask in the sun outside, eat outside, and play with his toys and watch the ducks outside. We put sweaters on him in case it gets too cold.  
  
Recently, we received a note on our door this morning after we took him inside, as he was whining for attention after his breakfast. He does not cry, he barely whines, but craves attention due to having separation anxiety.  
  
The note reads:  
  
How can you let your dog cry for help every morning? I had dogs for years and these cries are cries of neglect.

  
I hear you every morning come outside on your balcony to basically shoosh the dog into submission. What is your dog doing sleeping on the balcony anyway? It was 46 freaking degrees last night.

  
Train your dog to behave inside. If you don’t love your dog, give it to someone who will. Would YOU like to sleep in a cage outside isolated for hours at a time? OF COURSE NOT!

  
If a dog is properly trained they don’t need a cage at all. 45 minutes of crying this morning… 45 minutes.”  
  
  
No knock on the door, no name or number written, nothing. Just a note on our door and they were gone. I asked my next door neighbor who's door sits parallel to ours, as they have a ring doorbell, if they had seen anything. They at first thought maybe the note left was for them, but are now leaving their ring doorbell recording in case the person comes back.  
  
We honestly didn't think our puppy whined that loud. He has NEVER slept outside ever, and does not misbehave at all inside our apartment. He's never in his playpen for more than an hour. The only time this puppy cries is when he can't see us, or wants to be near us if we are more than a few feet away from him.  
  
We can definitely understand if his whining can be a disturbance, he's outside and its possible that people can hear him and become annoyed, or might not like the sound. I'd be concerned too if I heard a puppy whining while outside. (Puppy whines are the worst!)  
  
We have had no complaints thus far, and have gone to the leasing office to confirm we are in good standing, and make sure we aren't causing a disturbance to anyone else.  
  
Am I the asshole for letting our puppy whine outside?

"AITA I got upset he didn’t get my kids a Christmas gift? My partner and I have been together for almost 3 years. We each have two kids ages 6,7,8,9 from a previous relationship.

I bought his kids something for Christmas this year. Nothing extravagant but something I know they would enjoy and to know we thought about them. He was aware that I did get them something.

He did not get my kids anything. My kids saw his kids presents under the tree and expected they would be exchanging gifts. I feel bad having to explain that to my kids and don’t think it’s right.

The kids get along great but he is not really close with my kids. I spoke to him about it and he got upset. He said he didn’t ask me to get them anything and next year not to get them anything to save him the headache.

"AITA for possibility cancelling my wedding? So, I’m 31 (female) and my fiancé is 30. My parents have four sons and I’m their only daughter so they’ve really played up the whole “fairytale wedding” idea throughout my life. They put quite a bit of money away over the years to be able to afford a beautiful celebration.

Early this December, my dad gave his blessing and the love of my life and I were officially engaged. As my parents were generously offering to cover all wedding expenses, we included them in the decision making process. 

A bit of my backstory. I’m atheist and my parents are incredibly religious. I’ve had to build boundaries to maintain any meaningful relationship, especially when it comes to religion. I grew up with certain expectations and almost died adhering to their standards. I went as far as filing for a restraining order on my mom this last year as she kept driving by my house and stalking my online activity. I went through trauma and I think the guilt she feels for contributing to it has manifested into insane control. I spent over a decade in therapy to move to past the worst of my PTSD while she used prayer as her form of healing. Her behavior has caused me to cut her out of my life many times for long durations. I love them unconditionally and I’m not including any of this to bash them. I’m just trying to explain my perspective. 

After multiple meetings with my parents and fiancé to discuss budgeting, touring and selecting our venue, and a slew of other preparations, my parents announce that they are unwilling to pay for the wedding if they aren’t allowed to give a prayer before dinner. I offered a compromise…my partner’s family is Jewish so perhaps both my dad and his step dad could each say a short prayer. Even though I’m still uncomfortable with this, I can handle that…

If I don’t agree to let them say a Christian prayer during my wedding, they will back out financially. 

AITA? Should I just compromise my boundaries?

"AITA for giving my roommates the silent treatment? My(23F) roommates Lauren & Camille(23F, 23F) will not stop arguing and essentially picking on each other. Right now they're both struggling with their weight and these dumb fights go like this:

The other will reply with some kind of "" Youre fat too"" response. Nobody apologizes and they go back to the junk food trend.

We all went and did our own thing for the holidays but when we all got back earlier this week, Lauren started things off by telling Camille she didn't look great in her swimsuit. Camille'd gone to FL with her family and had posted a bunch of pictures. Camille told Lauren she'd seen her X-mas photos and told her she looked fat in her skirt.

I think dina is really beautiful, hot even. Especially in the Halloween episodes. I made a comment about how beautiful she was. My boyfriend kept saying that she's ugly and then he mentioned that there's a scale for women. 
About how there's beauty and personality and you get a score.

"AITA: i think my neighbours being unreasonable about noise i (30 F) live in an apartment with my partner (28 M). all the units in my building are the same (1 bdrm thin walls) so we’re typically very respectful about noise. we never host parties or play loud music, stomp around or anything like that. 
i’ve always accepted a bit of noise is normal in an apartment like this so i’ve never complained about my neighbours. 

a few months ago my partner and i got into an argument. it was dumb, over nothing and we resolved it quickly. it couldn’t have lasted longer than 15 min before we went back to enjoying our day. (it was a saturday, middle of the day). 
an hour later the cops showed up. i have never in my life had the cops called on me for anything, let alone “potential violence” so this really scared me. mind you, they were immediately confused and apologetic. they left after a few min of talking to us and did not file a report. 

i’ll be the first to admit i can get a bit loud when triggered. i’m in therapy for it and have medical trauma that really messed me up. i shriek at the drop of a pin and will raise my voice for a minute before immediately falling into shame and shutting up. i have empathy for my neighbours, but at the same time, im human and working on it. i don’t yell aggressively or cuss, it’s usually just “omg!” or some sort of exclamation. that’s it. truly. 

the couple above me is quite loud. the man gets very angry watching sports and i’ve been woken up to door slamming, yelling, i’ve heard smashing between bellowing and hammering at bizarre times. (they also had a washer hooked up to their sink and the dirty water drained into my apartment for months before my building threatened to fine them. it was awful).
i have no way to prove it was them calling the cops, but i saw them watching from the stairwell when the cops left. 

now whenever we have a small argument these neighbours retaliate by stomping on the ceiling non stop. there has been no “yelling” just slightly raised voices, and as always things are resolved quickly. 

i can’t stop thinking about how many times i’ve ignored their shit.
i’m also very, very anxious. i feel paranoid that my housing will be compromised. i imagine they complain to building management as well and i deeply believe this is petty and irrational. clearly they exaggerated what they heard to get the cops to actually show up. 

it’s getting to the point where i don’t know what to do with my frustration. i’ve considered reaching out to apologize or leaving a note but truthfully i don’t want to interact with them. they seem rude, ive seen them leave notes on another residents mailbox calling them “air polluters that should be evicted” (lol).

"AITA for expressing depression online and excluding people from the updates Backstory: I, 40+m (throwaway account), have had recurrent depression and anxiety first emergent during teenage years. After a significant low point 10 years ago, I had reached out to therapy which has helped recognize flags and signals better. Progress has been made, yet is never linear. At times I feel I lose control, yet manage to get back on that horse.

So. These past two months have been hard personally. In no short order: insurance is dropping coverage to my hospital I use for annual MRIs, my parents' health are taking a turn, the job - in addition to it being holiday heck - has informed me of a promotion with additional requirements yet no additional pay, my deceased ex's birthday passed, and another family member found themselves in the hospital.

It got overwhelming through December, so I got onto the internet to vent. No names were mentioned, just how I was feeling ""done with it all."" Privacy settings were set to keep family out of it. This was not smart, yet friends caught on and reached out. 

Fast forward to two days ago. My sister, Sally, informs me that a friend of mine (unknown, let's call them Pat) reached out to her ultimately with screenshots of the posts. Sally's rightfully concerned, and I'm confused by Pat breaking the wall to chat with my family. 

Today I feel awful, angry at myself for venting stress, embarrassed for the reactions, and feeling I gaslit people into believing (a) everything is okay, (b) a protective narrative because I feel need to defend myself, (c) that I'm just attention seeking when I truly feel overwhelmed.

"AITA boyfriend/baby dad behavior All right everybody. This is my first AITA and whether I am or not, i want opinions lol. 

AITA for expecting my boyfriend to buck the fuck up. 
I (F/26) I’ve been with my boyfriend (M/27) for 3+ years and in October 2023 we had our first child together. And overall we have a pretty great relationship, I really can’t complain or say that we have too many bad times. However, things get real sometimes. 
Now as of the last few months income has been tight, newborn BS (its a blessing but iykyk), and he’s looking for a new job. As a man, I can imagine there’s probably a lot of societal, cultural expectations of him. However, I have made it a very safe place, there are no gender roles, but us being a family and taking care of one another together or when the others in need. So with him being without a job right now, he stays home with our son. Personally, it’s a win for me! Because we’re not paying for daycare, and he’s with his dad! But get this… today I went home on my lunch to pump and eat, to find him so melancholy and sad. I pull on my girlfriend pants, go, sit beside him, and ask what’s wrong, what I can do, that he can talk to me. And he happens to say, “son is just too much. I’m not feeling this anymore”. Now I know that I can be dramatic and I’ll be like “I’m dying” when it gets to be a hard day with the kids… but how he said it and even what he said just isn’t sitting right… and I really just want to say get tf over it and buck up! “Money isn’t real” it comes and goes, we talked when i found out i was pregnant and made this choice together to raise him and buck tf up bc yeah we don’t like everything going on in life - thats everyone- but you keep keeping on and be grateful for this day and what you have. It may not be much but were fortunate. 
And I’m working on my patience and empathy when it comes to other people because we’re not all built the same, mentally. However, when it comes to my children, I have always bucked up and handled mine. When I’ve been broke, or on my last $5, I made, and found away. And at the end of the day we have everything we need that is set in stone, just not the extra shit. So am I the asshole for thinking that this man needs to get the fuck over himself and trudge through? Bc what the fuck is pouting and boohooing about shit i cannot control rn? NADA.

"AITA for telling my friend she needs therapy after she was traumatized by a client at her job as an erotic dancer? My friend (25F) told me (26M) (over snapchat) that she was [really hurt] by a male patron at the gentleman's club she was working at. She told me her job was a fever dream and a nightmare and she was done with it. I gave her job advice and offered to fix her resume. We've been friends for 6 months. She tells me everything. I asked her if she had a therapist. She said no, and that she needs one.

 I said ""as a friend, you really need one."" 

She said ""why do you ask?"" 

I said ""Your experiences at that place aren't natural and will stay with you. If you repress any of those experiences without processing them you will suffer from anxiety and depression without knowing the source."" 

She had a very negative reaction to that. 

""I don't care for your unsolicited advice on the job I've been doing for the better part of 4 years or the mental health issues I have been dealing with for quite literally my entire life. I have been in and out of therapy."" 

It fell apart from there. A little bit about me, I've been [really hurt]  before too while on deployment. I've been [really hurt] by my ex girlfriend. I know trauma and anxiety and depression.

""I'm sorry that I upset you. It's not my intent to upset you. Next time I'll ask before giving mental health advice and I'll be more careful to deliver it in a way that doesn't sound condescending.

"AITA for telling a doctor I don't need their consult? I was born with a cleft lip and had extensive surgeries to correct it. Now it's significantly less visible and the result was told to be impressive. On the unrelated note, I also have a wax issue with my ears so I have to see an ENT specialist doctor from time to time to get the wax removed.  
  
It happened to me before to have doctors (which are supposed to just remove my wax) to marvel at my cleft lip and the whole work done around it. For me it's weird because 1) I don't consider it THAT ground-breaking and 2) they're doctors, shouldn't they be more USED to that? However, I usually don't say much about it.  
  
Anyway cue doctor Jane who was supposed to remove my wax for the day. I scheduled an appointment SPECIFICALLY for that. She does it and then proceeds to ask me to open my mouth (although I told her the issue is with my EARS). I comply, foolishly imagining it's gonna be relevant to my problem but she begins talking about my cleft lip and how great the result is and wants to examine my nose point at which I stop her. I tell her there's nothing wrong with my nose and ask her if she suspects there might be an infection spreading to my ears or something. She says something like ""No, I just wanted to have a look and see more about your cleft lip..."". I stop her again (literally pushing her hands away) and keep asking if she's done with my ears. She says yes and KEEPS TRYING to see the work for my cleft lip.  
  
I told her to quit it, that I'm not sort of a museum piece that she gets to look at from all the sides and that for my cleft lip problems I see other doctors. Meanwhile I got up from the chair and started to get my stuff to leave. She said that there's no need to react like that and all she did was try to help me. I explained all the help I needed from her was with my ears and if I need more, I'll let her know. By then I was already dressed with the hand on the door handle.   
  
She kept telling me this is no way of behaving and I'm disrespectful to her. I (almost) snapped but told her as calmly as I could that for me this is not an ""interesting case"", but a lifelong condition and I'm not fond of people pointing fingers at it. I explained to her I find it unprofessional and rude. I then just left to avoid further conflict. Was I wrong?

"AITA for telling my boyfriend he deserved to get humbled. I (18F) and my boyfriend (19M) have been dating since we started college in October 2021. For the past I’d say 8 months my bf has become very interested in UFC (mma? idk what to call it). He gets up at like 3AM to watch fights and often has play fights with his friends one of these friends are important in this situation (I’ll call him S). We had a very large group of friends,we all graduated in summer but we all kept in touch over summer until now. Now these play fights or “spars” as my bf would say were all fun and games but they actually led my bf to believe he could actually fight because S (who says he does mma) said he’s naturally good. 

This led to a massive ego and he said he wanted to have a actual fight, and one of our other friends dad owned a gym with ring and he said he could let him fight there (idk if that was even legal). S proposed a guy for him to fight and it was a guy back from school I’ll call A. S was friends with A(not close friends) and I knew A because we used to sit next to each other in class. S said he’ll try get a hold of him. A agreed, shockingly. 

When A agreed I did express some concern to my bf (multiple times) and he didn’t listen. A was a quiet guy, but as we sat next to each other for a year I knew probably more than others about him, he was pretty much just one of those traditional masculine males in a physical sense, worked out 6 days a week, rode horses and did archery, owned large dogs but was one of those guys that looked intimidating but was actually a nerdy and friendly guy. My bf didn’t like A or A’s friends, and neither did the rest of the boys in our friends group. I always questioned my bf on this as A had literally never even spoken to him, and my bf used to say it’s because A is so arrogant and thinks he’s so good looking, this led to a lot of arguments with my bf, because why did my bf care if other women were attracted to A when he had me?

Nobody knew if A could fight but S said he told him something about he had been training in some form of martial arts. The whole build up to this my bf was acting so childish, he’d constantly try insult A in a group chat that was made and A wouldn’t even open them 90% of the time and I dont think he responded once. When the fight came along there was only one outcome from the start,  A was visibly towering over my bf, and he had clearly bulked up. On top of that, turned out he could fight, my bf lost in i’d say 90 seconds. 

After it I didn’t bother consoling him, I berated him because I expressed my concern multiple times and he picked not to listen to me. He said I’m an AH because I should support him unconditionally if I really loved him. He now wont speak to me, because he says I embarrassed him in front of his friends while he was vulnerable.

I (19F) live with my mum (47F) and grandparents while I attend university. As a New Year's gift to my mum and her cousin (49M), with whom we're close, I got us tickets to the theatre. I had worked a summer job and most of my paychecks I had put towards replacing furniture for the house, but I had a small amount left over. The day came and I walked out in a plain black dress, almost knee length. My mum had a meltdown the moment she saw me.

She started shouting that it is inappropriate and that I should go change. I refused to. She kept saying she wouldn't come if I wore it, and I kept saying it's just a dress, it's not revealing and no one's going to be looking at me in a theatre anyways. After 5 minutes of this back and forth she demanded I at least wear my floor length, lined coat and button it up. I was wearing a baggy jacket that was longer than the dress, but it wasn't nearly cold enough outside to justify wearing a coat. She then went on the rant she goes on everytime I do something she doesn't like. She called me a sl\*t (among other cuss words), said that I'm an embarrassment to her and that if I had a father he'd slap some sense into me (he left when I was a baby). And at that point, I would normally relent and go change into jeans and a sweater to get her to calm down. However, this happened:

A few days prior I'd confided in her about a situation that had left me hurt and asked her to keep it between us. I won't go into detail, but I basically found out that some people I thought were my friends were saying bad things about me behind my back. And she brought it up during the argument and said it's my fault no one likes me.

Here's where I might have been the a-hole. She again said she wasn't coming, so I told her I was leaving, so that at least one of the tickets wouldn't go to waste (they were non-refundable). That's when it hit the fan. She said she'd gladly pay me back for the tickets because she takes pride in always paying back what she owes. Well, everytime I lent her money, I never got it back, or I got back a small portion with a promise for more that never came. I would occassionally ask for it back (to little avail), but never confronted her about it because at the end of the day she's my mum, so I felt bad starting a fight about money. However, I lent her almost 250E back in October (more than 1/3 of my last paycheck) and every month she swore she'd pay me back the next. So, I told her that if she wants to claim that high ground she can do so by first paying me back the 250 she owes me. She then started yelling that I embarrassed her in front of her cousin, as I had promised I wouldn't tell anyone about it, which I never did.

Eventually we all went, but we were silent the whole time. I feel bad about the money thing but at the same time I don't think I'm completely in the wrong. I could use some prespective. AITA?",0.03
"AITA if I leave dishes in the sink instead of putting them in the dishwasher? My husband is constantly saying I don’t load the dishwasher correctly. Everyone has their own system. I think I put things in in a logical manner, but hubby regularly says this is in the wrong place, that is in the wrong place, and moves things around as he loads it. I don’t let it bother me. I put things in where they fit, and I only move something if I am trying to fit in that last item before running the dishwasher.

The other day, I noticed that he must have had a conniption, and he flung things around, thus one of the little tupperware cups was now right side up, and a tupperware lid was laying flat across the top rack.

I questioned him (nicely) and said, is this better than the way it was? Now the cup will fill with water and the lid is blocking the spray and will probably fly around. He blew up and said, cups go here, plates here, this goes here, and proceeded to show me where things go in the dishwasher.

So, finally I said, fine, you can load the dishwasher from now on. I will leave all the dishes in the sink. I will only do the few handwash things that don’t go in the dishwasher and you can do the rest.

I don’t want to be petty, but I think he is making a big deal about nothing.

So AITA if I say I will just leave all dishes in the sink instead of putting them in the dishwasher?

EDIT:

I feel like I haven’t explained the situation well. I do load the dishwasher correctly, but for some reason he has a certain way that he can’t really tell me because he doesn’t necessarily have a way. Sometimes he will say, cups go here on this side. Then he will say bowls go up top, not at the bottom. But you can’t always say that or else you will have one rack full and the other half empty.  
  
I’m not saying my way is right and his way is wrong. They are just different and I’m not trying to make a big deal about it. But when he yells and throws things around in the dishwasher because it isn’t his way, I’m just going to walk away.   
  
I don’t care if he does things differently than me. The issue is that he has a conniption about it and tells me I did it wrong.

"AITA for not wanting to pay for my in-laws occassional home expenses My wife's parents own 2 properties. They live in 1 and we live in the other. We pay them rent. About $500 less than the average rent in my city. So we get a small discount.

Once in a while, my father-in-law asks my wife for money to upgrade the air conditioning, heater, insulation, etc in both houses. Over the past 3 years, we coughed up about $5000 in these types of expenses which comes out of our joint account.

My wife and I got in a fight yesterday and she defends them by saying the 2 properties will end up coming to us (and her sister) when they pass away so its worth it to help out. I feel this is not normal and feel we're taken advantage of. My parents never asked me for any financial support and their house will come to us anyways when they pass away. Same with many others I know.

And the small rental discount isn't something I asked for. We have a small child and we are currently saving up for a down payment for our own house so we are pretty extended financially. And her in-laws to expect ~$1000 dollars out of nowhere and we struggle sometimes in those months. AITA?",0.6

"AITA For getting annoyed when my boyfriend says ""I love you"" all the time? My boyfriend (20M) and I (21F) have been together for over a year now and things have for the most part been really good. We both love each other very much and we can see ourselves being together for a long time. My biggest pet peeve is that he says ""I love you"" SO frequently. In my opinion, ""I love you"" shouldn't be said very frequently because I feel as though it loses its meaning. My boyfriend uses ""I love you"" as something to say in times of silence or when he doesn't have anything else to say, and I can't help but get annoyed. There have been times where we are hanging out and he'll say ""I love you"" which I of course follow with ""I love you, too"". This is then followed with 15ish seconds of silence where we're each doing something and not actively conversating, and then he'll say again ""I love you"". I either get annoyed or say it back while trying not to get annoyed. And then 2 minutes later, he'll say it again. I've talked to him about it numerous times and explained that I never want him to stop saying ""I love you"" but that the repetitiveness of it is very annoying and frustrating, but he never stops doing it. I try to explain that I'm not getting annoyed that he's saying it, but I'm getting annoyed that he's repeating himself over and over again.

"AITAH for prioritizing a concert over our honeymoon trip? So, newly married, my husband and I are planning our honeymoon. His ultimate dream is going to Japan – the country he's always wanted to visit but was typically out of reach for us (way too expensive). Thanks to the wedding, this trip becomes a reality, and it's awesome. We plan it out, and first twist: his job sucks with vacation times, and it's either smack in the middle of summer in August or early May, nothing else.

August is twice as expensive and definitely not ideal for Japan so it's absolutely out of the question. So May seems perfect. It's affordable, it's spring – boom!
We're excited, thrilled, and then, bam, second twist. I have a concert right in the middle of the trip. Damn. I'll have to cancel.

And here's the snag – I really don't want to cancel. 
It's Taylor Swift concert. An artist I've followed since I started understanding English, I've grown up, learned, and lived with her music. Her discography is ingrained in me. Plus, this concert is the Eras Tour, a special one covering all her albums from the beginning. Something unique that I won't get to experience again. Especially since Madame Swift doesn't often tour in my country, making it a rare event in itself. And to add to all of that, I've never went to any show of that scale, so it would be an absolute first for me.

Am I the asshole in this situation? It's just a concert. Isn't my relationship, heck, my marriage, more important than a show? In what world can I justify this? I feel guilty for even thinking it, for not being able to make a decision, for creating this discord in my relationship. He doesn't seem to get what make this decision so hard on me, so maybe it shouldn't be hard ?
Quick note, it's not the honeymoon itself that's jeopardize but specifically the Japan destination being impossible if I do not cancel the show. It's really more a question of my dream of Taylor Swift vs his dream of Japan.

Edit :
The honeymoon is happening no matter what. 
It's specifically Japan as a destination part that's in questioning if I choose the concert. I'm not attached to any destination, as long as I'm with him it's the perfect trip. 
For him, Japan as a honeymoon is kind of a unique opportunity because it's a trip that's hard to plan without this type of occasion. In a lifetime, we could find a way to go there as a ""normal"" trip, but we might as well never have that opportunity ever again.


Edit and conclusion :
Thank you all so much, and I mean everyone – yes, even those who jumped to conclusions about me being a wife just because I'm a Taylor Swift fan, and those who didn't hold back on assumptions.

So, we're headed to Japan, and I'm thrilled to say I'll be enjoying the concert too. Your feedback and ideas on prioritizing everything really helped me see the bigger picture. I came to realize, thanks to your insights, that what mattered most was the significance of Japan to my husband. It was intricately tied to the honeymoon aspect of our trip, which wasn't initially clear, given that we had considered multiple destinations before settling on Japan.

My plan was to cancel the concert as soon as this became clear. Without any remorse. However, he managed to persuade me otherwise. You see, even if someone doesn't share your taste in music, it doesn't invalidate the profound connection one may have with a particular artist. Being a 27-year-old French male, I'm quite used to people not getting the impact TS has had on my life. Fortunately, my wonderful husband not only understood this but also recognized its importance. Together, we made compromises and adjustments, finding a way to accommodate both his wish and mine.

As a closing note, I can't help but think that the tone of all this might have been different if Taylor Swift hadn't been mentioned. I thought that it was quite irrelevant, but all of you made it abundantly clear: just because she's who she is, then I'm the worst person. Well done.",0.75
"AITA for not attending my sister in law's wedding because she is identically coping mine wedding? I told my in-laws I am not attending my sister in law's wedding because she has decided to copy my wedding. My husband and I live in MI, USA.  5 years ago we chose to have a destination wedding in the Outer Banks, NC. We invited our closest friends and family for a full week of fun to include the ceremony. We spent a year selecting the venue nationally, flying down, meeting with vendors and selected the perfect beachfront to have the reception and ceremony. Yesterday a text message was sent from my sister in law  (who also lives in MI) in a group chat to the entire family announcing that she was now having her own destination wedding, in the same state, on the same beach, at the same house using the same vendors, taking the same photos in the same poses as my husband and I. This was not discussed with my husband and I ahead of time. 

My husband and I told his family that by copying our wedding, they are overriding our memories made there and that it really bothers us. We even found another house for her to book but she refuses to change her venue.  My heart is broken and today we told them we will not be attending. My father in law called me this afternoon and said that his daughter has the right to choose where she wants to get married and that copying another person's wedding was a compliment and no big deal.

"AITA for being disappointed about my best friend's self-made presents My (24F) best friend (26F)
discovered crocheting about 2 years ago. Now she crochets stuff all the time - when we watch a movie together, when we just chill and talk, even when she goes out and has to wait 5 minutes. She's made blankets and hats and cardigans and bags. She absolutely LOVES crocheting. 

But for the past 1 ½ years, for Christmas and my birthday I've only ever been given her crocheted stuff. Don't get me wrong: I appreciate the time and effort she's put into those gifts and they're really good.

BUT: Our birthdays are really close (we're born thirteen days apart, my birthday's first), and she's always hyping up my presents and how much I'm going to LOVE my present, and I've become really stressed about what to give her in return (the same applies to Christmas).

I've tried really hard to find something amazing for her as well - so far I've talked to her favourite artist and asked for her permission to buy one of her pictures (my besties favourite art) digitally so I can print it on a sweatshirt. Then for her birthday I got her a ticket to her favourite musical, and bought myself one as well (even though I genuinely don't like it) so we can have a cool day out together. And for this Christmas I got her something to help with crocheting (a ring called CrochetPal), a book about new crocheting patterns, and a book from her book list that she hasn't read yet.

In return, for my birthday I got a self-made handbag (I only ever use backpacks or fanny bags, and she KNOWS that), and this Christmas I got three pairs of crocheted earrings. I like wearing ridiculous earrings like little water bottles or whiskey bottles, or -my favourite- a serving of currywurst with chips, but unfortunately the crocheted pairs and not really my style as they're pretty, but not funny.

I'm usually very vocal about the things I like, and I feel like she could easily get me anything in relation to the things I won't shut up about.

I'm increasingly getting frustrated with the presents because while they're good presents, they just don't actually seem like they fit me. Like the presents seem less about me actually liking or using the things I'm given but rather about her being able to crochet and ""save"" money for other things that she can't make herself.

I haven't found the courage to talk to her about it, because I'm not sure if I'm actually in the wrong. 



TLDR: I keep getting crocheted stuff that I have no use for, and feel disappointed that my best friend doesn't seem to put in as much thought into my gifts as I put into hers.",0.75
"AITA for asking my boyfriend to prioritize a night with me over a favor for his mom? I (25F) just returned from a 10 day trip without my boyfriend (25M). Of course we were really looking forward to spending time together, he talked up all of this stuff about just wanting to rest with me before school and work starts back up again after the weekend. I even bought an early flight so that I would return before my roommates and my boyfriend and I could enjoy one night alone at my house then wake up together and do breakfast. 
Well, the day before my return flight he texts me that he forgot to request the evening off work and wouldn’t be able to pick me up from the airport. I was disappointed because we had clearly planned this and Ubers are expensive in our location, but I wasn’t pissed and would have managed without his ride. He then found someone to swap shifts with him and ended up picking me up. 
We get back to my house and I am EXHAUSTED, I had been awake for over 20 hours on trains and busses across a country and a long uncomfortable flight over seas. I showered, we had sex, I gift him the souvenirs I got, then he tells me he needs to leave because his mom (who he lives with) doesn’t like their dog being left alone at home in case he gets anxious. 
Side note: my boyfriend was supposed to help watch my rabbit while I was away and at one point forgot to feed him for three days! 
Now, I did express being quite ticked off at this. This isn’t the first time that a demand from his mom has thwarted our time together.
So he says, “How about I bring you to my house (1 hour away) and we spend our time together there?” And “By the way, since we’ll be there I can invite my friends over and if you don’t feel up to it then you can just sleep in my room.” I told him that last-minute planning a party with his friends on this evening is a little hurtful, so he said he wouldn’t do that - but he still needs to go home because now his mom is getting upset.
I have been away from my house and was looking forward to being in my own bed, giving my rabbit the company he deserves, and I hadn’t even unpacked yet! I’m half asleep as he’s proposing this idea to me, then he starts to rush me. “We’ve been here for an hour, I need to get back to my house. Can I grab your things for you? Etc.”
I snapped a little and told him that he wouldn’t understand the desperate want to be at home because I work my butt off to pay thousands in  rent here and he lives at his mom’s for free.
At this point it really turns into an argument. 
Could the dog absolutely not spend one night alone? Is his mom incapable of allowing him to have commitments outside of her needs? Would he ever be able to tell his mom “no”? Will I always come second to whatever she needs? 
Our evening together was planned well in advance and I do expect my partner to be sensitive to my comfort and needs, especially after a long trip.",0.11

We have been dating each other for almost 8 years and are very understanding and mature.

I said sure, you can come visit me and bf as we live together and he can bring her girl and we all can have good time. To which he said I don’t want to make your bf awkward. I was a bit taken aback but I gave it the benefit of doubt and let him know that my bf is very chill and not at all insecure. Then he again asked and said he is uncomfortable meeting my bf, so I said but I don’t think it’s right to meet you alone and that it is more werid for my bf and me. Then he insisted that I hide it from him, to which I clearly said no, I don’t ever lie to him and will never do that.

He has texted me twice since then and I kept ignoring him. Now I feel bad for his partner and I am pretty sure he is flirting and talking with other girls too. But the thing is I am not too close to any of these people plus according to my past experiences (not to brag but I have a very nice personality and many guys try to hit on me so their gfs have felt insecure and treated me poorly), so I m just afraid to start a new drama and take the blame and get called names.

"AITA for telling my (nb 24) parents about my sisters (f31) debt? For context, my sister and my parents were originally planning to buy a house and live together this summer as recent as a month and a half ago. My parents still were considering renting a house with them until i accidentally spilled the beans.

My sister told me she had 10k in credit card debt 2 months ago asked me not to tell our parents. I knew she'd tell them eventually so i wasnt worried about it.

But over the holidays they still talking big plans and i was surprised she didnt tell them. So right after we left i sent her what was supposed to be a quick encouraging text--""to consider telling mom and dad about her financial situation before they live together.""

However this really upset my sister and she said some hurtful things to me, before admitting she told them about the debt and that they know everything.

I was surprised she didn't just tell me that instead of being mean first but whatever. Anyways, I wanted to know how stressed and concerned my parents were about it and so i went to ask how they were feeling. But when i said ""debt,"" they both looked confused and my mom only said she kinda remembered my sister mentioning it.

I admitted the truth of the situation because i felt like they deserved to know since they were planning on making some big financial decisions together. My parents were shocked and very upset with my sister.

"AITA for turning off a movie because my son wouldn't stop talking? Earlier this evening, my 9-year-old son was bored, so I suggested we watch a movie on a streaming service. I picked a classic sports movie that I thought he would like, but pretty soon it became apparent that this was a bad idea. 

You see, he would not stop talking, especially asking questions that the movie would later answer. I kept pausing the movie to answer his questions, yet he couldn't take the hint to stop talking. I wasn't going to let him talk over the movie. Finally, I had it. I told him that he was being unbearable with all of his dumb remarks and that if he was interested in talking, I would simply turn the movie off. Well, this seemed to upset my son, and he started tearing up. It's pretty clear that his teachers at school don't enforce any discipline if this was his reaction to being told to shut up. 

Eventually, my son stopped crying and we were enjoying the movie in silence, but this was short-lived. The movie had a plot twist, which shocked my son, and he just couldn't help himself. He had another childish outburst, and I angrily turned the TV off. I told him that I had provided him with ample warning and that he refused to comply with my instructions. He tried talking back, which made me even angrier. I led by him his hand into his room and told him to sit in there for an hour or so and reflect on why he couldn't button his lips shut.

My wife was out shopping, and when she came home, I told her the whole thing and chuckled at my son's lack of self-control. Initially, I was annoyed by it, but now I find it ridiculous and laughable.

Burner for this one,dont wnat my life to be fucked over even more:

 So, my fiancée (29F) and I (34M) are counting down the days until our wedding. The only cloud on our happy horizon is her 38-year-old brother, who's been crashing at our place and sone other family memebers for what feels like an eternity. Now, don't get me wrong—I believe in helping family, but this guy is a fucking shmuck. Living comfortably off our hospitality, he's practically made our home his personal hotel, rent-free and even before he came we were screwed financially, ive been sacked so my entry-level accountant fiancee is having to carry us both and now her prick brother too.  
  
Frustrated with the financial strain and feeling like a doormat, I decided to lay down the law. I sat him down and told him he needs a job, can't mooch off us forever, and that his lack of responsibility is messing with our future. Shockingly, my fiancée, who's usually my rock, is now giving me the cold shoulder. Apparently, I've become the heartless villain, the guy who ruins family dynamics for the sake of financial stability.

"AITA for joining my brother and his friends for their boys’ night? My brother and I are pretty close and he has some cool friends that I hangout with sometimes as well. Last night he invited four of his friends to our house to chill, play some xbox and eat pizza and since I was super bored that night I thougt I could join them.

I don’t really play video games but it was fun playing a bit and just hanging out with them. None of his friends seemed bothered by me joining and everything was fine. However, afterwards my brother told me that I totally ruined their boys’ night (I didn’t know it was one) and that I shouldn’t join them uninvited. I apologized to him and said I would ask next time but I feel like it’s not that weird to join them if they’re chilling at our house and nobody seemed to be bothere by it. So, AITA?

"AITA for defending my friend who like Black metal music? I’m going to preface this by saying I’m a devout Christian I go to church every week bible study youth groups the whole thing 

But I have a best friend in the whole wide world (mark) that I live very much that listens to a black metal and likes very unconventional fashion styles.

I don’t think it’s a big deal at all I’ve known him for ever and I already surround myself with ALL types of people race sexuality beliefs.

I made a new friend I call Lia (half her name) 
She’s new to my church and it was basically my job to help her feel welcome and we became friends. She’s met the mark and made a slight comment about him ‘being a weirdo’ I just said he liked different things and god created us all to be different 

Though a week or so ago I saw a TikTok about a band called Mayhem and their whole album cover thing. Lia tagged along with me the next time I went to see mark and I asked him about the band and he went on a tangent about erurgimous (???) and how he was awful etc etc and Lia kinda scoffed when he we’d done and said ‘I thought all satanist liked each other you all worship the devil why does it matter how it’s done’ (verbatim) 

Mark rolled his eyes but I got mad and told her to be ashamed of herself and god hates judgemental people and insulting others isn’t right (even though I did add some more rude comments). She burst into tears and walked out 

She went to church and for this past week I’ve been ostracized by the bible study group I started, parents won’t let me take care of the kids during church hours even though *I’m youth leader and my pastors have pulled me aside to talk to me about “inappropriate friendships” I feel awful and I don’t know if what I’ve done was really that bad I want my community back and idk what to do should I apologize and cut ties with mark I don’t want to but I miss my people.

"AITA for being a hyprocrite? I never used reddit before so please bear with me. My friend suggested I come here to get an outside perspective.

I male 19 have a brother who's 15. I'll call him Jay. Two days ago I picked Jay up from his friend's house and I noticed he smelt like weed. I asked him if he'd been smoking weed and he said ""It was none of my business."" I told him it's dangerous and he shouldn't be smoking it while underaged. He got mad at me and told me to ""To shut the Fuck up and drive."" When he said that, that kinda pissed me off so I ultimately decided to tell our parents since he wasn't going to listen to me.

Well, after I told our parents they got really upset at him and grounded him for the remainder of his Christmas break. Taking his phone, computer, and forbidding him from going out with his friends. They told him they that were disappointed and other things I forgot. However, Jay yelled and said that I did the same thing when I was his age. (Which is true but I stopped). I told Jay that what I did was in the passed and I'm only trying to make sure that he doesn't cause long term affects on himself in the future. Jay called me a bitch and told me to ""Fucking die."" That kinda hurt me because I never wanted to hurt him this badly. He's been ignoring me and won't even look in my direction and hasn't talked to anybody since. I feel bad and I hope this didn't ruin our relationship as I love my brother with all my heart. My parents said I did the right thing as since I was only doing it to protect my brother.

"AITA for quoting a racial slur used by my racist father, even though my intentions were not hateful? For context I am a white male and my friend is a black female. I come from a racist family that instilled certain beliefs in me as a child that I had to work to unlearn as I went through my teenage years. I don't think I'm perfect and I'm still working on recognizing unconscious actions of racism that I have.  
Me and my friend, Ava (changed), met a few weeks ago and instantly hit it off, and we have been talking ever since. We often liked to talk about politics, economics, social issues, etc. One day we somehow got onto the conversation of race in America, specifically about black people. From there we got to talking about my experience growing up in a racist family and how I shed my prejudiced beliefs throughout my teenage years. At one point I relayed a story of my father calling someone a ""Fking Hard R"" and saying that he should ""go back to Africa"". However, I fully typed out what he actually said without censoring it. I immediately asked Ava f I shouldn't had typed it out fully even though I was only quoting, and I said that ""I did not mean to be offensive"". She responded with ""It’s still wrong to say and type, it’s still offensive."" I responded with ""I’m sorry about that I didn’t mean anything by it. I’m still trying to do better obviously."" She never responded to this and has since ghosted me. I sent another message a few days later apologizing again saying, ""Hey, I'm really sorry if I hurt you by saying that yesterday. I really did not mean anything by it I'm just still learning to do better"".  
Personally, I really think what happened was just a misunderstanding. I always quote people without censoring them. If someone said ""fuck you"" I would almost always quote that rather then something like ""F You"". I understand these words are not the same thing though. I just made the assumption that Fuck and N-word would be treated the same without thinking.  
I think what I did was obviously not sensitive and I do not plan on doing it again, but I am wondering was it morally wrong on any level?

"AITA for Reporting a Potentially Valid Transaction as Fraud Back in December, I saw pending transactions on my credit card from a different state than the one I reside in. I suspected fraud so I immediately called my credit card company. While on hold, I reached out to my anyone who might’ve used my card. For a bit of context, I occasionally let my sibling or my mom use my credit card for family related expenses. In the past before either of them used my card, they communicate their needs and general amount so I’m not surprised by those charges when I check my statement. 

I waited to hear back from anyone for about 30-45 minutes but because I didn’t hear back, I went through the normal credit card fraud process. I went through my last few transactions to filter fraudulent charges from legitimate ones. There were 2 charges that I definitely didn’t recognize, with one charge I wasn’t sure about (let’s call this charge #3). To be safe, I told my FI I didn’t recognize charge #3 and figured that if it ended up being a legitimate charge then I can backtrack and let them know that I was wrong about charge #3.

4 hours after my call, my sibling reached out and said that charge #3 was from a business they recognize. They said they’ll reach out to the business the following day to check if it was them. By that point, I had already disputed the charge and I didn’t think my sibling expected me to wait to hear back from them. 

Fast forward to today— I didn’t hear back with an update about the business in question until today, 11 days later. My sibling called me upset, saying that the business in question ended up charging their card twice for some unknown reason, and they suspect it’s because I disputed charge #3. My sibling called me an asshole for disputing the charge when he responded to me 4 hours later on the day I called my FI. They’re claiming I am selfish for not waiting to file the fraud claim until I heard back from them because they were at work—now they have to deal with the business for causing a complicated situation with duplicate charges. My sibling is saying that waiting until I heard from them wouldn’t have made my situation exponentially worse than it already was, so I should’ve waited. Ultimately, by not being patient, I’m an asshole, and I should’ve been understanding that he was at work. To be clear, it’s very tough for my sibling to check his phone at work, but it’s not impossible. 

In my defense, I googled what I should do in a fraud situation. Every article I read said to call my FI immediately. I was panicked and worried that more charges might come through so I acted immediately. Am I wrong? 

TLDR: I sometimes share my credit card with my sibling. I was a victim of CC fraud and disputed charges without getting confirmation on a charge from my sibling. AITA for not waiting to hear back from my sibling before filing fraud claims?",0.07

But this girl is different. When my fiancé and I first started dating, I started getting some random crazy text messages from google voice numbers about my fiancé and how he would never truly love me and just weird messages that were trying to make me feel weird.

"AITA for roasting my husband in front of friends about forgetting my birthday? My birthday was a couple days ago and I'm feeling really hurt by how my husband acted. 

A few days before my birthday, it was our dog's birthday. My husband was so excited - he jumped out of bed to sing happy birthday to the dog and made a big fuss over her. At the beginning I thought It was really sweet.

When my birthday arrived, I woke up hoping my husband would be just as excited. But he just said good morning like any other day. He didn't remember it was my birthday until my mom called to wish me happy birthday. 

I tried not to let it bother me, but I was really disappointed. I hoped he would plan something special for dinner or at least get a cake, but instead he went out with friends and didn't come home until late. 

The next day, when my friends asked about my birthday while we were out to dinner, I made a joke about how my husband was out celebrating without me. I was trying to laugh it off, but my husband got really mad. He wanted to leave right away and started arguing with me about it when we got home.

I feel hurt that he forgot my birthday and didn't make an effort to celebrate it with me. But I also feel bad for making that joke in front of my friends. I was upset in the moment and handled it poorly.

"AITA for doing it with my sisters newly wed husband? 
This post was too long the first time so redo!

So, I (32f) was invited to my sisters (25f) wedding. We had just gotten in an argument about bringing my newly wed husband to her wedding. They have never gotten along and she didn’t want him to ruin her “special day”.

I thought that I would show up with him and she would have no choice but to let us in, so I secretly bought him and I tickets for a flight to Tulum and reserved a room at the resort my whole family was staying in. She had been suspicious of some things being:
1. I had a larger room than what I would need for myself and
2. I had two seats reserved for the rehearsal dinner.

Once we landed in Mexico, we were careful to not run into any family members before the rehearsal dinner that evening. 

Me and my husband, (we’ll call him Jace,) were leaving the resort to head to the dinner when I ran into my soon-to-be mother in law. She was obsessed with being an unpaid wedding planner and organizer, so she knew every single attendee’s name and the exact number of guests on the list. When MIL saw Jace, she immediately questioned his presence. I told her that I was going to bring him despite my sister’s wishes, and no one was going to change that. 

Once we arrived, heads were turning. My sister was angry to say the least. She went ballistic and told me and my husband to go to hell or leave. Me and my husband left, but still planned on going to the wedding the next day.

Fast forward to the day of the wedding-
Once we arrived, my name was still on the guest list so I was let in. I told the receptionist that Jace was my plus one and she let him in as well. Me and my sister made eye contact a few times, but I think she was just trying to avoid me.

The wedding ceremony was beautiful, and they were both very ecstatic on their special day. Hooray! Then all was at peace… right? Wrong.

During the reception, everyone could tell that the bride and groom were HAMMERED. The problem? So was I. 

I needed to use the restroom, so I excused myself. As I was searching for the ladies room, I realized there wasn’t one. There was one family bathroom that had two stalls. I opened the door to find my sisters new husband, aka my BIL. 

Apparently, my drink was starting to taste like BIL. I guess his was starting to taste like SIL too, and next thing I know we are doing it in the family bathroom stall. The door cracks open, and we both freeze. 

The cracking of the door was from my sister. She opened the door to find me in the toilet and her husband naked. Needless to say she went ballistic. I ran.

The next scene was her husband redressing and walking out and partying like nothing happened. 

I tried to speak to my sister and she was just as hungover as her husband but she remembered everything and absolutely refused to speak to me. And then that ended. And me and my sister never talked again.

Me and her husband have been happily married for 10 years.",0.98
"AITA for not wishing her on her birthday while on a break? Here's a summary of the sequence of events leading g up to the birthday. 

4 months before her birthday we had a heated argument over a stupid hypothetical situation. I was disrespectful. I was also drunk. I apologized the next day. She accepted the apology.

2 months later we had another argument. We were in a LDR and were supposed to meetup in December. She said she is unsure if she will be able to come in December due to work. She also said, she would have at least tried to come if the previous event had not happened. I learnt she was still upset about it. I apologized again but said we should breakup if we are not meeting in December like it was planned. We didn't quite breakup immediately as she said she will try to come.

Few days later she said she can't meet and she wants a temporary break. She also said I may see other people because she might feel better off being single and not get back. I said okay. 

Her birthday was about 1.5 months after this break which she had initiated. I did not wish. No texts. No calls.

2 days after her birthday she texts me and says now she wants a permanent breakup because I couldn't get myself to wish her on her birthday. She has been posting weird stories about how she is fighting midlife life crisis and how she reeled through the end of 2023.

"WIBTA if I named my son after my friend's stillborn baby? I'll keep it short, but happy to provide more info if necessary. A couple months ago my (27M) best friend (25M) and his partner (25F) unfortunately lost their baby boy, who was born still at 35 weeks. Soon after, I found out that my girlfriend of one year is pregnant, and we just found out we're having a boy. We haven't told anyone about the news yet, and definitely haven't mentioned it to my friend yet as he is still grieving.  


  
When we found out he was a boy we began discussing names, and I mentioned that I really wanted to honour my friend's son by giving our son his middle name. My girlfriend loves the name, but she told me it was very insensitive to use it and it seemed like I was just rubbing it in that his son wasn't here anymore. She said it came accross as self indulgent and I wasn't really taking into account what my friend and his partner would want.

  
I disagree, and think it is a way of keeping his son's memory alive, but I really don't want to do something that would cause him even more hurt. I obviously can't ask him or his partner their thoughts, so I was hoping you all could give me some input. WIBTA?",0.88
"AITA for telling my 7 month pregnant wife I would not forgive her for getting her and the baby hurt moving furniture? Hi, I’m a 30y/o male, I am married to my beautiful wife 32(y/o) of 4 years come August. She is an amazing mother to 3 amazing daughters from her previous marriage that I love and cherish, and I am dad to them.

 As mentioned in the title, my wife is 7 months pregnant with our 4th, but my first child. We have had some unfortunate luck getting pregnant in the past, and had a very big scare in the first trimester with our current. I was devistated, especially losing two prior.  However we have survived the ups and downs and we have a very healthy baby ready to come be with us in 2 months.

Here is where our story begins today. My wife and I love playing pool. we have constantly been on the hunt, when a table came up for $200 We snatched it up quick! he and I loaded it up and we were on our way home with our new treasure.

It’s freezing out now where we are and the humidity is awful. Its no secret a pool table is not light. just the table would have been a dollar per pound if that’s all we got with it. My wife was concerned that the table would get damaged outside, which was a very fair point. Which I was happy to let her help me with since it is a flat level transfer.

The tables final destination was down a steep “L” shaped set of 20 stairs and a railing that is sub-par at best. My plan was to back our truck up to our porch and slide it onto the deck and inside until I could get someone to assist me in making the that trip. We had plans with another couple we are friends with but it fell through, so the move would have to wait.

My wife, however felt as though this needed to be done today, even though there was no need, and I could get someone to help me the next day as it was getting later on in the day. She offered to help me carry this heavy table down to the basement. I told her that I felt very uneasy with the idea because I fear for her safety and the babies going down those stairs. She kept emphasizing that she would be fine, and that I was making excuses for it not to be done. This went back and forth for sometime.

When it came to the point where there was no way to get her to wait for someone else, out of frustration I told her that this was a stupid idea out of impatience but if she was so headstrong about it, I would but if she or the baby got hurt I could never forgive her for putting them in danger over something so unnecessary. She took it as I only cared about the baby and started to break down telling me she would just “sign the baby over after she was born” and thought I would just leave her. I clearly stated to her that I love them both, and her condition at 7months could make it hard for her as it does her normal day to day activities. I love my wife beyond all measure, and couldn’t stand the idea of either of them being crushed or killed by a pool table when there were other options beyond her impatience. AITA?",0.56
"AITA for bringing a friend home and letting her sleep on the couch when my mom was over and supposed to sleep on the couch? I (30f) started college last year. During my second semester, I met Phoebe (19). We were taking 2 classes together and we clicked immediately. We have a lot of the same interests and she’s just such a kind and smart girl. 

Phoebe was diagnosed with cancer over the summer. She spent a few months in the hospital and now goes for outpatient chemo every couple weeks. 

On Thursday Phoebe called me and said her grandpa was supposed to drive her to chemo but he never showed up and asked if I could take her. 

After her chemo she fell asleep in the car. I decided to bring her to my apartment to let her rest because she is one of 6 kids at home and her house is loud, not a good place for recovering from chemo. 

When we got to my apartment I woke her up, brought her to the couch, and brought her some blankets. She was very appreciative of me letting her stay at my apartment.

The thing is, my mom is staying with us and she was supposed to be sleeping on the couch. It totally slipped my mind when I brought Phoebe home. 

My mom got back and asked why Phoebe was here when she saw her sleeping on the couch. I explained the situation and she said it was rude of me to give up the couch without asking her. 

I called my husband, explained the situation, and he picked up an air mattress and extra blankets for my mom but she’s still mad that I gave away the couch for the night (I took Phoebe home Friday afternoon). My husband says he gets why I did it but he gets why she is upset. 

AITA for giving my friend the couch when my mom was staying with us?

Edit: I was told to add this to the post but Phoebe’s family couldn’t care less that she’s sick. They didn’t visit her in the hospital, they don’t take her to appointments unless they’re not working, they don’t have plans, and they feel like going, and they don’t make her siblings let her rest. She asked her mom if she was taking her to get a procedure done and her mom told her they can’t put their lives on hold just because she’s sick again. 

This part wasn’t in the comment but she shares a room with her 13 year old sister and her sister constantly has friends over and they hang out in her room. Phoebe has come over so she could take a nap on the couch before because she can’t rest at home. ",0.36
"AITA for backing out of baby shower planning for my friend because she wants to include her boyfriend? So my (25F) friend (24F) is 7 months pregnant. I've known her since we were kids and I know her likes and dislikes and she has very similar taste to me with regards to a lot of things, so when I found out she was pregnant I offered to plan her baby shower for her.

Now as much as I love my friend, I cannot stand her boyfriend (M26) and do everything I can to support her whilst avoiding him. I personally believe he's a toxic person and he definitely has some abusive traits that my friend can't see. I have encouraged her to leave him before, but she always shuts down my concerns and tells me I don't understand their relationship. So when she became pregnant, I was extremely happy for her since I knew how much she wanted to be a mother, but also worried about him being the man that impregnanted her. Still, I've tried to support her as much as I can so that she has someone to fall back on when her relationship ends. 

Yesterday I was discussing all the details with her about what she wants so that I can work on hiring decor, organising catering, cakes etc in time for her shower. To my dismay, she told me that she actually wanted one big co-ed baby shower so that her partner and his friends could celebrate too, and she started listing things that he had seen online and liked. I told her I thought it was a bad idea to include him, and that something more traditional was probably better. She insisted that her boyfriend be involved, because it is his baby as much as hers. 

I suggested two separate baby showers, one with her female family and friends that I would plan, and then a separate co-ed one with her partner and his friends/their partners. She told me she would be too tired for two baby showers, and that since I offered to plan it for her I should be willing to accomodate her wants.

I reinforced again that I refused to plan anything that involved her boyfriend and that if she didn't like that then she can plan it herself or find someone else to help her plan it. She said that I shouldn't have offered to plan it if I was going to let my selfishness and own personal bias get in the way of what she wants. But I'm only trying to protect her and ensure that this moment is something she can look back on in the future with joy, rather then having it ruined by her abusive boyfriend being there.

"AITA for finally calling my partner selfish and unreliable? I (F23) and my partner (M28) have been together for 5/6 years now. We’re generally quite good communicators and share a 3 year old son together. 

Out of the 5/6 years of us being together, he has been in education at university for 5 of those years. He worked during the 9 months he was out of education but decided to go back to study teaching which I have fully supported. 

Every time he starts to get into studying he writes off the living world around him. He shuts off and out, the only thing that’s important to him is studying and I just seem to take the responsibility of looking after the house, working more than full time (54 hours most weeks) and managing our lifemin. He’s present (within his own means) with our son above all else which I’m very thankful for. 

Recently (I’d say within the past couple of weeks), he’s started becoming forgetful/negligent in his actions and me being a person with Autism, I just wanted to check if the way I’m feeling is fair. 

Examples of the forementioned forgetfulness include: 

• Leaving car/ house keys in the door on more than one occasion

• Forgetting the membership cards I had asked him to remember specifically to get into a Zoo that was over 1 hour away and I would manage food, drinks, winter wear ect. We had to drive home and it would’ve been very late in the day by the time we returned, so our son was upset and let down. I rang ahead at a play area and got him in there so all wasn’t lost. 

• Losing the themed decorations I had bought our son for his 3rd birthday which cost over £80 and I couldn’t afford to replace. 

• Mixing brand new whites with colours in a wash. I wouldn’t be as annoyed by this but I work hard and the new blouses were also expensive. 

• Forgetting about a parking ticket he’d been given for parking on double yellows, so the fine went from £80 to £160 after no payment for 2 weeks. If he had of just told me initially, I could have just dealt with it. 

I really do feel as though I’m at the end of my tether with him and said some hurtful things such as calling him an ‘idiot’ and ‘useless’. I don’t want to damage his worth, I just want him to take accountability but every conversation we have each time about being more mindful just becomes more redundant as I wait for the next thing to go wrong.

"WIBTA? Leaving my friends as soon as I go to university. I am in my Grade 12 year of high school and obviously since university is near, I have been trying extra hard to get my grades up. I have even started my own business over the past year which has done better than I thought, so it requires me to work on it a lot. 

Anyways this context is important because as a result of me being busy all the time, my friends have gone quite low on the priority list. If I’m being 100% honest, my friends are going no where. Just promise me when I tell you these are very lazy people with no plan of action (some are failing out of high school it’s that bad).

Very recently I got into the best University in my country and I’m wondering if I would be a jerk for just totally abandoning my friends and trying to restart fresh in Uni with like minded people. This would be huge though, I’m talking about cutting off like 5+ people who I’ve known for YEARS. I’ve just noticed recently that they make such snarky comments when I don’t want to go out partying with them and they just attack me for no reason. I truly think this has some jealousy behind it ever since I’ve tried improving my education and started my business. I’ve been very quiet about what I feel about them, and if I totally ignored my friends when I start University it would be very unexpected for them and they would definitely think I’m being pretentious/dramatic. The blatant rudeness and lack of support from my friends has made me rather be lonely than to hangout with them.

"AITA for calling my friend fat For context, one of my close friends (who struggles with being overweight) has recently started to go to the gym and has really been trying to become a healthier version of herself. However, ever since she’s started to see results, she’s become a more outspoken and confident person, always speaking her mind, no matter what she’s thinking. She often calls people fat unprovoked and just generally seems like a more judgmental person than she was pre-workout. 

Anyways, I’ve recently started to date a guy for a month now. I really like him and when I was telling my friend about him, she asked to see a picture.

I showed her his picture, continuing to talk him up and telling her how happy I am. 

She then proceeded to say: “Yeah, he’s got a hot face but he’s just too twiggy.”

I asked her what she meant which followed her saying, “I mean he’s just too skinny. Im just used to dating gym guys but I guess that’s just your type.” 

I then said “At least he’s not fat”, obviously referring to her, which she became upset about.

I feel awful about it, she’s my friend and I’m not a “fat phobic” person nor have I ever commented on her weight like that. My other friend told me she deserved it but I’m currently just juggling between whether I should apologize to her or not.

UPDATE: I got in touch with her finally and asked her if we could meet for some lunch so I could apologize in person but she refused. I just apologize over the phone which she responded with “I don’t know if I want to be friends with such a superficial person” and now we’re not talking again.",0.83
"AITA for cutting in the bus line at Disney world Alrighty so this happened a while ago, but it still makes me mad every time. So my school band went to Disney world last year. As expected we had to stay in groups and be back by a specific time. It was the first day and a few of the seniors were standing in line to wait for the bus (this was a little bit after the light show. So the seniors were standing in line to let some of us younger members time to use the bathroom and such. When we got our we stood next to them in line, as we were worried about missing curfew. This dude behind us starts telling us that we needed to get to the back of the line. For context, he had two young and tiered looking kids, both of which were in a stroller. For context, the busses hold a lot of people, and the line was not terribly long (like we would all get on the next bus). One of the seniors explained that we were a school group and had to stay together, and this guy starts yelling at us. Like full on screaming and cursing us out. Now I don't really do to well with yelling and was kind of cowering behind the seniors and he definitely pointed that out in a very rude way (think ""not ready to stand up for your actions"" and calling me a coward) anyways, section leaders eventually back down as to not get into a fight. We all ended up getting on the same bus. This still scares me to this day and I felt really bad for the kids bc they seemed scared to

"AITA for not keeping contact with my host family after my high school exchange year Sorry, first time poster. This is half AITA and half advice, so anything is appreciated. 

I was an exchange student in the US a few years ago. In the program, we lived with host families and attended local high schools. My host family was very supportive in every sense. They accepted me as a part of their family. I enjoyed the year and all of us cried at the end when we were saying goodbyes. 

In the first year when I was back, I would call them every week. Gradually, as I became busier with studies, we would call less frequently, but we would still talk 1-2 times a month. In the past year, we have had very little contact, limited to birthdays and deaths, and here is why:

They have completely different worldviews and values from me. They are a US military family with both retired and active members in it. They praise the US and its military in every and any way, they justify the actions of the US military. They have raised the little kid in the family with military values and precise knowledge. Those are not values that I share at all, and I am uncomfortable with being in contact with people who do think this way. On top of that, I have friends from countries that have directly suffered from the actions of the US military. 

I was talking to my family today though, and they are very insistent that since my host family treated me so well, I shouldn't cut them off from my life, and that it's also ungrateful towards them because  in my personal experience, they have supported me in every possible way during thr exchange year. 

Whenever I talked to my host family, they were happy to talk to me and made me know that they would like to talk more often, but they also never messaged/called first. So, should I keep the contact with them?

TLDR: my host family was very supportive of me in my high school exchange year, but they have different values from me because they are a military family. AITA? Should I keep in contact with them?",0.09
"AITA for not giving up smoking? I am a smoker, I know smoking is bad for you but at the end of the day it's my decision and I decided to smoke. My sister hates smoking, when she got with my BIL she made him quit or it be the end of their relationship and he quit. Due to my smoking it often causes a lot of fights between me and my sister. I respect her opinions on smoking and I do understand that she's the mother to my niece. Since welcoming my niece into this world I don't smoke around my niece but if I want a cigarette I do go outside the house if I visit their property and if my niece is in my house I go outside of my house to have a cigarette. 

My sister is extremely pissed with me for not giving up smoking. We got into an argument the other day about me smoking around my niece. I've explained I don't smoke around my niece but if she's inside I'll smoke outside and just wait half an hour before going inside. My sister says I'm an asshole because my niece should be my encouragement for giving up smoking altogether. I get everyone has different views around smoking but personally smoking is something I'm going to do.

"AITA for dressing how I want? I (20f) like to dress in kimonos and lolita (nothing to do with the book!! The Japanese street fashion). My dad (43m) constantly shouts at me every day for going ""over the top"". 

I try wearing what I think is normal, but I've always had an odd fashion taste. I told him to help me pick out outfits so I won't ""embarrass"" him when he walks in the street with me. He said I must be r*tarded if I can't make a normal outfit.

Fair enough when it's me by myself because he's scared I'm going to get attacked, but when I'm with him I feel safer. I try not to go over the top but I gave all my ""normal"" clothes away a while back.

I've had 3 days straight of arguments now, I don't even ask his opinion but he sees me and it's straight to arguing. Today he's saying my apron is too much and ""it's not even doing anything so what's the point"".",0.17
"AITA for ignoring my brother's stepson? My brother has a 14yo daughter and a 16yo stepson.

He got married a few months ago and one of the first things that his wife did was reducing his custody time. He went from having full custody to being the every other weekend parent. This obviously hurts my niece so much especially when she sees how close her dad is to her stepbrother and how much time they spend together. 

This has caused her to resent her stepbrother and she gets very jealous when we pay any attention to him and starts crying because she is afraid we will love him more than we love her.

So in order to make her feel better we have kinda been ignoring him. We haven't been mean or anything like that we just don't include him when we invite the rest of the niblings to do something and other things like that

"AITA for spending my free time playing games with strangers online despite my bf not liking it? I, 24F, am self-aware that I have co-dependency issues with my boyfriend (24M). Unlike him, I only have a very small and closed circle of friends and they're all always busy with work. We live together but he goes out every afternoon to play sports with his friends and frequently drink (like every 2 days). He'd be gone around 1PM and will return around 7PM, then often times he'd be gone around the same time but will return around 3AM. I tend to feel lonely every time he's out having a great time with other people but I try to understand that he doesn't always have to be with me. It's not like he doesn't take me out; in fact, he spends a good amount of time with me and even always brings home stuff I'd like after a night out.

To help myself with my co-dependency issues, I decided to get back to my hobbies as a diversion. Solo gaming was my favorite hobby in the past, but I thought that maybe playing with other people would help me feel like I'm not being left out or something. I joined several Discord channels for different games and started playing with other peopl, and even with camera on for other gamers I was beginning to feel comfy with.

One night, my boyfriend comes home for dinner and he catches me playing with my online friends. I've already told him that I play games again and I have a few new friends online. We were playing Among Us for a casual night of gaming. There were 8 of us and only 2 of us were females. He didn't like that fact. He said it didn't paint a good picture since I only played games while he wasn't around, and I played with guys most of the time. We both let what he said go but the next day, he went home earlier as if he wanted to catch me ""in the act"" (of innocently playing with my new friends). This time, he got mad, saying that it's disrespectful for me to keep playing with other men. I told him that I played games to distract myself from his absence. I told him that he was lucky since I'm a homebody and that he never has to worry about my safety nor a third-party while I just sit back at home and make sure all the chores are done and he comes home with a full meal ready. That he never gets to feel the anxiety I feel everytime he comes home late. Overwhelmed with emotions, I just told him that he makes me feel alone, that he makes me feel like a ""trad wife"" when we both work and provide. That games make me happier than he do nowadays and that my online friends make me feel more appreciated than he does. Now he doesn't want to talk to me and I regret it since I feel even more alone now..

So, am I th Ahole for continuing to play with my new friends despite him wanting me to stop? I think I'm not but I just want to know if you guys think I'm in the wrong here so I can go apologize. It's the first time I've spoken about my feelings in a LONG while.",0.09
"AITA for confronting my best friend after she never showed up to my birthday? AITA for confronting my friend (14F) for ghosting me and never showing up to my birthday? (15F)

This girl (lets call her elle) was one of my very good friends. Mid 2023 she stopped replying to half of my messages and secretly unadding me on some accounts on her tiktok, but at first i thought i was being delusional. Around my birthday, she started ghosting me completely, ignoring all of my messages, and leaving me to believe i was a horrible person. 

She really took her ghosting to the next level on the day of my birthday party. I gave her two weeks notice, and she told me the days she could come and I invited her and she said yes. Once everyone arrived, we waited 30 minutes for Elle to show up but she never did. I texted her asking her where she was and she left me on read, however when my friend texted her asking she said “oops i forgot” and then laughed.

For the next few weeks, she completely ignored me, never asked me about my birthday or wished me a happy birthday, never apologised and seemed to show no remorse.

I sent her a message a few weeks later asking her if i did anything wrong, and she liked my message but continued to ignore me. A few weeks after that i sent her a slightly more straightforward message about how she hurt me, and she replied and basically said i didn’t do anything wrong but that she would continue to drift from me.

She has now gone even colder towards me, unadding me on many of her socials and overall making me wonder if i was being overdramatic. I am definitely going to let go of it from now on, as she has made her feelings clear, but i think it was very naive to hold on to and question something that was never there. AITA for confronting her?

"AITA for leaving a small house party without saying goodbye? I (27F) moved back to my home town late last year to save some money and this meant that I could spend more time with one of my closest friends (also 27F). She still lives an hour from where I am living. After being back for some weeks and her being well aware of my relocation I hadn’t heard from her so I reached out to let her know I was back and that we should catch up. As part of the plans, I was already going to be nearby her home earlier in the day so I said that I was happy to jump into plans if she already had any but really wanted to see her and catch up. This discussion was several days ahead of time and she did say that nothing had been fully planned but possibilities of things happening with some of her other friends that I have met maybe twice could be in the works and I said I was fine to tag along. In the end it was a small house party with maybe 10 people present at her friend’s place (who I met twice).

Now here’s the kicker, I was not friends with anyone else, nor did my close friend initially introduce me to people as they arrived. Furthermore at no point did my close friend sit near me or make an effort to be a part of any of the conversations I had with others and essentially I was lost out of most conversations as they would speak about mutual things. I felt awkward and out of place to say the least. 

Around 10.30-11pm everyone decided they wanted to go out, so everyone got up to start organising themselves (finish drinks, clean up got to toilet etc). Meanwhile, I mention to my close friend that I was tired and not really keen on this so that I would get an Uber back to her place and drive home. She acknowledged this and then continued to organise herself. In the meantime I grabbed my bag, ordered an Uber and literally walked out the front door of the house and stood on the street for maybe 5 minutes until the Uber arrived without formally saying goodbye to the party crowd or my friend (call it an Irish goodbye). TBH I was pissed off that I had tried to make an effort to see her and catch up but ultimately was tagged into a whole other event with a completely different friendship circle she has - and whilst I don’t mind meeting new people, my aim was to see her and felt that she made no effort toward me, whilst I was drained and had zero commitment to the ultimately random individuals at this party. 

I have not heard from her since this event and wonder if she’s annoyed with me for rudely leaving - so wondering AITA?",0.64
"AITA for not showing up at my 2nd day of babysitting? Hello. So last friday, my mom called to ask me if I (24f) can babysit for a friend of her's, who I've known for a long time and has a 2.5 yo, for the weekend. They will come to the city for a conference thats being held. Not thinking enough I said yes, I'm free this weekend. Mom said great and hung up the phone. I thought they would drop the baby to my house. I'm married and I don't have children of my own yet. 

Then my mom's friend called me saying they are on the way and very happy that I agreed to babysit. She informed me that the baby is sick-ish and wants to be around mommy all the time so we might not be able to take her even to my mom's house, which is way more near the conference, so we have to be at the conference place. This is how I learnt they wanted me to babysit in a really far place and with no comfort of a house. They were already on the way. There was no chance I could say no from then on.

So saturday came and while dressing up mom's friend texted me saying there is a chance their niece can cover the sunday and they'll let me know tonight for sure. 

My husband tagged along since he didn't want to send me off all the way there on my own. It takes 1.5hr and 4 subways to get there. Overall it was not bad to babysit, I'm good with kids but we spent a lot of money to food and other needs since we had to be there from 11am to 6pm. No expenses covered, not even mentioned.

I think i should mention what happened during babysitting. We were there at 11am but the father was only half-busy and not really attending the conference so they didn't handed me the baby until 1pm or so. 2 hours doing nothing. 

Then they gave me the baby, I put her to sleep and my husband is really chatty and he just didn't stop talking even though the baby was asleep on my lap and I was sitting right next to him. I shushed him and he got offended and out of pettiness, he kept talking to say this is how it's gonna be when we have children. Just so you understand why I stayed up late and cried my eyes out because we argued over this at home.

I also waited for them to clear if the niece is gonna show up but they didn't, so I assumed its covered. While I was relieved I won't have to go tomorrow too, around midnight she texted me asking at what time I'm gonna be there, and I asked I thought her niece was gonna cover the Sunday. She said no, the niece won't be coming. 

I didn't want another day in the outside with a baby, spending that much money just to go there and feed myself and I didn't want my husband there either to repeat the day and night all over, so I just told her something came up, I won't be coming. I feel guilty so I told her if they really can't take care of the baby, just to give me a call and I'll be on my way there. I just dodged my mom's call probably to scold the shit out of me. She thinks I left them in a bad situation and I'm an asshole.

"AITA for asking my GF to do the dishes when I always cook for us? Hey

So in short we’ve been dating for like 8 months now and know each other for over a year. 

I’m 27 and she’s 23. I work full time as a surgical nurse, she’s e still a student. 

We spend most of our together time at my apartment since she lives with her parents and I live alone. But we hang out at hers place too, I have a pretty friendly relationship with her parents. 

Now since we spend most of the time at my place, and I’m the one working and earning money, I take care of paying for stuff we do or buy together. I never even thought about it, for me it’s a normal thing. I don’t mind it at all. But we do cook for us a lot and well let’s just say 99% of the time it’s me who cooks. 

Even when we meet in the evening after my 12 hour shift, when she’s home with parents all day, I’m the one cooking dinner. And at some point I realized that dishes just always kinda stay there and then she leaves the next morning and I do the dishes and clean up the kitchen. I make the bed, clean up the bedroom etc. 

And I don’t know if I’m being an ass but in mind I just thought for a second that I’m cooking, paying for everything, cooking what she wants to eat that day. Why wouldn’t she at least help with the dishes? So I kinda mentioned it casually when cooking. I just said something like “it would be amazing if you could help with the dishes after!” And she was like sure yes but then again same scenario she didn’t even touch them. One time she cooked, I helped her with most of it and then I did all the dishes telling her I’m gonna go clean up since she cooked and it was an amazing food! But yea not much changed after. Then one morning I tell her that the dishes are still there and she promised she will do them. And she ends up all angry about it. 

So AITA for asking this of her? Is it too soon in a relationship or is it an asshole thing to ask of her? 

TLDR: AITA for asking my gf to do dishes (doesn’t live with me but sleeps over often ) when I always cook and pay for everything we do and buy together? I will cook after a 12 hour shift and she still would get mad I asked if she could maybe help with clean up after cooking.",0.05
"AITA for wanting my partner to shut off the phone and reality t.v.? Lately I (26m) and my wife (34f) have been getting into more fights and I keep making a constant connection between our fights and her phone/reality t.v. usage. Many of our arguments are over small meaningless things that could be improved through a simple conversation. I think to myself that maybe there is something underlying this emotional drive to argue, so I have meditated only to conclude that we simply don’t have anything big between us. My direct approach of questioning her about her emotions thereafter came to no fruition either, so now I’m stuck pondering. After giving it a little more thought I realized she typically watches a few episodes of her shows (bachelor nation/love is blind) and comes out of the room for a few minutes before arguing about petty things such as what I’m doing (school work), how long I’ve been doing it (about the same amount of time she’d been in the room), and what isn’t done. At this point my nerves tighten and heart race when she walks past me to get to the kitchen now.
     She is on her phone constantly on instagram, TikTok, and other stuff. I use Reddit sometimes (obviously), because it can be useful and subtle (as I don’t like communication platforms with my name directly attached). Other than that I do not use my phone, in fact I am terrible at responding to texts most of the time (except for my wife’s). I’ve noticed that the phrases and terminology used in her tv shows invades our conversations such as “on the same page”. I’ve asked what that means only to have her run in circles with the conversation until we are both thoroughly confused. “On the same page” to her simply means “you’re not doing things the way I like and you are causing those problems so fix it”. I’ve confronted that too only to be met with “no” and anger. She wishes for constant excitement and wants me to facilitate that need. I think that (with love and honesty) a combination of short attention span and creative thinking has been the problem. Her phone and tv shows as “hobby’s” are suspect in my eyes, and she does those two things constantly.
     I think a meaningful conversation can be hard sometimes too. Once I realized she changes the subject and averts my attention to something else almost every time I try to talk to her about my day or her day, I called these problems out. I proposed that we should do more talking. She was not happy and ended up saying YTA. AITA?",0.76
"AITA for making my joke make my girlfriend feel belittled? My girlfriend likes to ""joke"" on me and I don't like her jokes at all. I'm not the most educated guy, and I don't know the answers to many questions in the school program. My girlfriend asks me these questions every day to make fun of me. I realize they are simple questions, like why leaves are green or why most colorblind people are male, but I don't know the answers. My girlfriend makes fun of me for it, which makes me feel insecure. If I tell her about it, she replies that I'm too sensitive and unmasculine and she was just kidding. 

She used to ask these questions rarely, then more and more often, and now she attacks me with these questions several times a day. I feel stupid and belittled. 

I decided to show her how much I dislike her jokes, I hoped she would understand. Today at lunch I didn't wait for her to start asking questions first and asked ""Do you know what Greenwich Mean Time is?"" (geography is the only science I know more or less well). She looked so confused that I didn't laugh at her, but explained what Greenwich Mean Time is and how it determines time zones.

"AITA for asking my bf to leave so I can poop? UPDATE: He thought I was mad, I thought he was mad and we were both just scared of making it worse lol
It wasn’t actually an issue and we talked it through


Edit: I know it’s mental, I’m on the waiting list for a therapist.

First of all, I do realize how dumb it sounds, that everyone poops and it shouldn’t be a big deal.

However, I physically can’t poop unless I’m home alone, no matter how much I have to go, it’s like my body won’t let me.

He’s told me multiple times that I can just ask him to go for a walk or whatever, that he’ll find some way to be gone for about 15-20 minutes, but I’ve very rarely done it (maybe 2-3 times over the last year) as I’m very shy about it for some reason and I’ll rather hold it…

I asked him today, but he was very reluctant and kept saying “just go shit” and after I told him 2 times that I can’t when he’s home, I just thought “whatever, I’ll hold it” but then he suddenly left without saying anything (which he never does, he always kisses me goodbye) and didn’t answer my text for almost an hour.

He was gone for like 3-4 hours and was very very dry in the few texts I got and when he got home he didn’t say anything to me. He’s been home for about 2 hours and still hasn’t said anything to me… to be fair, I haven’t said anything to him either, but when people are mad at me (or when I think they are) I’m scared I’ll make it worse if I say or do anything

So am I the asshole? I waited for him to wake up and then waited another 2 hours before asking him and I feel like I only did what he told me to (even though it’s hard for me) but I can also completely understand why it’s annoying to be basically kicked out of your house",0.62

I thought she’d accept it for what it is but she took away a certain decoration so it matched her vibe better, the two angels that said “sisters”.  This really bothered me.

I’ve already discussed with all of my friends (including my gf) that I had family plans on my birthday so I didn’t want any surprises (my birthday is in February) on the actual day of my birthday. However, my gf and her friends took this with a grain of salt and basically ignored my very specific rules and planned me a surprise birthday party. My best friend and roommate told me that my gf was planning this and I immediately told her to cancel anything she had planned before it’s too late.

Of course she got upset over it and tried to pressure me into just “letting her go through with it” because she already got all of the decorations and the invitations were already sent out. I then reminded her that I already had plans with my family for my birthday, and she just told me “well they can come too”. After a long time of compromising, I was too tired to say no and ended up telling her to just do whatever she wanted. I know that sounded very passive aggressive but I genuinely didn’t have the energy to deal with her or her plans anymore. 

This isn’t how I wanted to spend my nineteenth birthday. I’m not a party person and even the thought of having a birthday party right now makes me extremely upset. It’s been a few days and I thought I would warm up to the idea but I just can’t. I haven’t even told my family of any change of plans because I can’t believe this is happening to me right now. I decided I’d go through with the plans I’ve made with my family and just not go to whatever party my gf is planning, but I already feel bad. I’m not sure what I can do to make myself feel better at this point, and my birthday is right around the corner. WIBTA for not going?",0.12
AITA for lying to my husbands parents that our baby is baptised? My husbands family is pretty religious and since we had our baby they’ve been on us (mostly since my husbands at work when they call usually) to baptise him. My husband just kinda changed the subject or is vague with his answer. I’ve told them no but because of the way my husband is handling it I don’t wanna start a fight with his family. I just ended up telling them our baby was baptised to shut them up. They live far away and know we’re not church goers normally so it’s not a hard lie to keep. My husband is very upset with me for making him lie.,0.33
"AITA for not doing the dishes when my mom said it was up to me? I (16f) have been extremely confused about my mom’s (almost 50f) recent behavior but today is really making me think I might be in the wrong.

This morning I woke up early. My mom woke up and came In my room and asked me to feed the dogs which I did. She then said verbatimish “Hey could you do me a favor, and it’s up to you/you don’t have to if you don’t want to (I can’t remember which but it was one of the two), can you do thease dishes and fold the blankets before your grandmother gets here? I’m going out to do a workout and when I get back it’s going to be a rush.” 
I said maybe, when she left I did the blankets but the dishes were mainly my sisters(20f)and I hate the fact she is a total slob whenever she is home and never cleans up( leaving me to do it). I decided to go upstairs and enjoy my last morning of break.

When my mom comes in the door she screams “MINTCOFEE get your fucking ass down here right now” she proceeds to berate me and say she failed raising me that I’m a bad daughter and that I should know better because I’m a smart girl and that she’s not going to fail me again I feel like I’m missing a puzzle piece here because she said it was up to me, and I did have the stuff it wasn’t my mess to begin with she was the one who went out to do something for fun and she could’ve stayed home and done it if she wanted to. She goes out to workout all the time. I don’t understand what I did wrong but she’s saying that she’s going to talk to me when she’s ready. She has a history of pulling stuff like this but I’m really starting to think I might be an awful child. 

For more context as the kind of person I am I have a 4.0 GPA I work a job. I do my chores at home all the time without complaint I never sneak out do things behind her back. I don’t understand what I’m doing wrong? I feel like I’m missing something. She said it was up to be but she came home like she had told me to do it if she simply said I need this done before I get back and hadn’t phrased it as it’s up to you I would’ve done it, but she didn’t so I don’t understand why she’s mad whenever I ask her she says I’m not ready to get a clue am I the asshole did I do something wrong? 

TLDR: I woke up early, and my mom asked me after phrasing that it was up to me, and I didn’t have to to do dishes and fold some blankets. I folded the blankets, but decided not to do the dishes. She came home and yelled at me for not doing them, and said that it was my fault, and that she had failed me as a mother, and that she wouldn’t fail me again, I would’ve done it if she had simply said that she needed it done and didn’t phrase it as a question. She is extremely angry and will talk to me. Asshole for not doing the dishes.",0.91
"AITA for not wanting to book the Airbnb? Hello, everyone! First of all, happy New Year. I hope 2024 is your year. So, my friends (6 people) and I are planning a vacation in Copenhagen for March. Usually, the friend who handles bookings, from finding flights to arranging transportation from the airport back home, is me. However, this time, one of my friends wants to bring an unregistered guest, and I said no, as this friend has brought 3 unregistered guests to our Airbnb without asking in the past. I don't feel comfortable asking for money this time, unlike previous occasions when similar situations occurred. I'm not great with money, and I currently have an issue with my bank card. Today, two of my friends asked me how much to send me to book the Airbnb. I explained my card issue in our group chat. Then, another friend asked me how much to send, and I reiterated my card problem. They responded with a tone similar to explaining to a child they are going to send the money digitally. In the same tone, I asked who is going book the Airbnb. Aita for not wanting to book the Airbnb?

"AITA for making my wife leave church? AITA for making my wife leave church?

For context here my wife(let’s call her P) and I have been together for 11 years, married for 10. When we met I was going through a rough divorce where my now ex(let’s call her K) had cheated on me and gotten pregnant by another man while I was away for the Army. K and I had been separated for about a year when I met my P. When P got pregnant I proposed because I wanted a family unit and my child to not grow up in a broken home.

 Fast forward 11 years and my wife and I are searching for a new church home in our area. She went to this church one time 4-5 years ago and loved it, so she suggested we try it out. 

We walked in and loved the vibe, and the kids area seemed awesome. We got to the sanctuary and started worship when I noticed about three rows to my left was K and the guy she is with. I was frozen for a few minutes and then had to leave. I couldn’t stand to be in the same room as her.

Now my wife is saying because I am still that angry she feels like a consolation prize because I never delt with the anger and hurt that K caused me.

AITA?

Edit : thank you all for your input. Here to answer a few questions I’ve seen pop up.

1 ) yes this just happened today. We had a long conversation about this shortly after I posted this, I just wanted some non-biased opinions.

2) as many of you pointed out we initially married for duty. We liked each other at that point but the first 3-5 years of our marriage were hard. The only reason we’re still together (we will both tell you) is because we were legally married. The last 5 years of our life has been wonderful and I do love P with all my heart and am excited to spend the rest of my life with her.

Lastly, many of you pointed out that I never healed, or dealt with the trauma, and you’re right. I never went to therapy, talked to anybody etc. my coping mechanism was to throw myself 80+ hours a week into work and cry myself to sleep at night. Then I met P, and life has been a whirlwind since. I did not know K lived in my city as she used to live about 30 miles from where I currently reside, and I have had no contact (verbal or visual) since the divorce so I didn’t have to deal with it. 

I have decided that i will be pursuing professional help both individually and as a couple with P to help us work through all this.

Thank you so much for those who took the time to respond and give honest feedback.

"AITA for refusing to support my best friend's decision to not divorce his wife? So basically, my best friend's wife cheated on him with one of his other friends. I have a no tolerance policy with cheating, and have encouraged him to leave his wife, and find someone else.

Long story short, he decided to stay with his wife. I refuse to support this decision, because he deserves better. I've made it clear to him that I love him, but I don't want to hear about her anymore, and she's not welcome around me anymore.

Anyways, its 6 months as later, and i still hate his wife. Now, he accuses ME of being an AH, and says if I'm adding drama into his life by inviting me to things that she's not welcome to come to. He says I should support his decision to stay with wife. I disagree. I support him, but I cannot support his decision to stay with a cheater and I refuse to be around her.

He now is calling her off the hook literally spamming her phone to reconnect with her because he is dying and is seriously ill.

"AITA for telling my brother I don't like his wife?

Me and her used to be close but as of recent I just think she's been acting a bit weird and entitled and selfish for example she was upset that I didn't ask her for her schedule before planning my daughter's birthday party on her birthday and didn't revolve my party planning around her life (she's never once asked me would I be available on a weekend so she can plan her children's birthday party) so I didn't know that was a thing asking her for her availability.

"AITA for buying an umbrella? I was visiting a European city with two friends of mine and it was raining heavily since that morning. None of us had an umbrella and one of my friends had a waterproof jacket on but I didn’t and the other friend neither. 

Around 11 am my jacket was wet and spending the whole day outside in the cold weather and with a soaked jacket on was the last thing I wanted, so I approached one of those men who sell umbrellas on the streets (it’s very common to see them in Europe) and bought one for 5€. While I was handing him the money I saw my friends watch me from a noticeable distance and in disapproval, so I asked them if they wanted one too, offering to buy it with my money, since I knew that the umbrella was small and couldn’t fit 3 people and that I hate sharing umbrellas. They said no. I bought the umbrella for myself and we kept walking. We haven’t spoke for a while after that. 

I shared my umbrella with my friend even though I would have preferred to buy her a second one than sharing mine. 

That afternoon it was still raining and we were waiting in line outside a museum. There were a lot of those men selling umbrellas but my friends, completely soaked at that point, still refused to buy one. 

I was still sharing my umbrella with my friend but she was getting wet anyways because the umbrella was small and I was prioritising me no getting wet. At that point my other friend stated that I was being selfish because I was keeping the umbrella for myself and my friend was not perfectly covered by it. I didn’t replied cause I didn’t want to start a fight, but I got really offended.

"AITA Rent and Family I purchased a home in a Bay Area suburb at 21, with my mom co-signing the loan. She signed her rights away in 2011, having co-signed contingent on clearing her $15k credit card debt. I work in financial services, saved every penny, and accommodated my mom and brother when they moved in to avoid my mom's boyfriend.
My mom paid utilities, and my brother initially paid $300 rent, later increased to $500. His rent increased to $600. I moved out in 2019, still paying the $2300 mortgage while raised his rent to $1350 in 2021.
I threatened to sell the house when paying the entire mortgage became unfair due to me not living there, and my brother agreed to pay more to avoid moving. In 2023, I demanded full mortgage rent that led to disputes—claiming it's unfair as I gain equity and due to some furniture, calling the rent difference a storage fee. 
My brother texted “How about no rent and I live free until you evict me, which can take up to a year if you wanna play like that. 😃 Be careful on how you wanna do me. I’ve been straight with you, including paying the full rent when you didn’t have a job.”
He paid the full rent from Nov 2020- March 2021 when I was laid off from my job. The choice was either pay or move.

"AITA for asking my artist friend if I was an influence for one of their characters? One of my(22M) best friends(20NB) for eight years is an artist, and has a large collection of unique characters they have created. About two or so years ago, they showed me a new character of theirs (or at least new to me at that time), and since then this has been one of their favorited and most-drawn characters.  
  
Also since then, there has been a small-but-mostly-ignorable thought in the back of my mind that this character appears strikingly similar to me. I mean same body type, same facial features, same clothing styles, same hair, even same glasses. At one point I even remember comparing an image of them on my phone side-by-side with my face in a mirror, thinking 'no way, right?' Now, I knew this character was obviously not meant to be me, or even represent me in any way (or at least I really hope not since he is portrayed as a villainous megalomaniac). However, sometimes when I see drawings including them I still think 'hey, this guy kind of looks like me.'  
  
So I asked them. I admit: it was almost as abruptly as that last sentence, and I can understand that not-ideal timing contributing to me being an AH, but the question was in my head at that moment, and I was unsure of the next time we would talk. They nonchalantly explain the character is not influenced by me. I say okay, we laugh a little, and we move on.  
  
About ten minutes later they text me saying they are very upset and that I ruined both characters for them. Among other more vulgar names, I was called self-absorbed, completely selfish, and told they can never look at their characters the same way again. I tried to explain I never meant to cause any offense or insult, I just thought I saw some similarities, and I do not deserve intentional attempts to make me feel horrible when I never had any such intention myself whatsoever. They replied by saying they do not want to talk to me, then blocked me.  
  
I feel like if I was truly selfish I would have simply assumed this character was influenced by me and never think anything more of it. I'm not a narcissist, I'm not offended or anything like that just because I'm not the influence. I would like to think that, by asking them, I am showing interest in what they are creating and where they find inspiration—I've asked hundreds of questions over the years about their art and not one of those questions had anything to do with me. Especially considering I was not an influence, why should the implication of that even matter? I'm very confused as to why this question was so hurtful. I suspected asking it would be awkward (which it wasn't even), but never to cause damage.

"AITA for refusing to wear a dress to my mother’s wedding?    Recently my family was sitting in the living room discussing plans for my mother and her new partner’s wedding. The wedding will not be any time soon as they are not yet engaged and are in poor financial condition. Still, they are both dreamers and like to talk about and make plans for things far into the future.
   Everything was going fine and the conversation was very pleasant. We discussed the typical things like what kind of flowers they would like, what season the wedding would be held in, and so on. Then we got to the topic of attire. My mother made it very clear that she would like her bridesmaids to wear short dresses with floral designs. She immediately looked towards me as she knew I would be against wearing a dress for multiple personal reasons. 
   At first I thought she was going to say that of course I wouldn’t have to wear one and that we would find a matching alternative but she just kept staring. So I spoke up and said “I don’t want to wear a dress.” She went on to say how it was her dream wedding and that I would essentially ruin the vision. I listed off multiple alternatives such as a pantsuit, tuxedo, anything but a dress.

"AITA for refusing to meet my dad’s girlfriend after the appalling way he treated my mum? Hi folks,

So, my parents separated just over four years ago, although they only actually got divorced about a year ago. Now patently there is nothing wrong with wanting to leave a marriage if it is irreparably broken. However, I am sure that would most would agree that there are proper ways and means of doing it. My dad just upped sticks and left, giving my mum no explanation. He refused to go to therapy. Not long afterwards he had a new girlfriend. He claims that there was no overlap. However, after he left, it transpired that he’d had a seven-year affair with someone else in the 90s, which I had no idea about. He doesn’t exactly have the best track record generally so it’s hard to believe him. He was also pretty horrible to my mum around the time of his leaving. About a year before, my mum was undergoing treatment for breast cancer and he was so unsympathetic, often dropping her at appointments and then leaving her alone to get the train to work. His job is such that he could have been way more flexible, especially under these circumstances.

Anyway, fast forward to the present day and he is still with this woman. In fact, I overheard that they are going to get married. I know he wants me to get to know her. However, my mum who is still alone is unhappy at the prospect of me playing ‘happy family’ with this woman, especially after she called my mum a ‘lazy cow’. My mum is a very fragile woman. In fact, she’s had a history of abandonment by everyone, including every boyfriend/husband, brother and parents. Despite that, she is the most loving person you could ever imagine. She has supported me more than anyone in the world, including through some of my darkest moments, and I am forever grateful. I feel that I owe it to my mum to be loyal. Besides, she never wronged my dad.

"AITA for asking my husband to return back a Christmas gift my in laws gifted our baby ? My husband and I just had our first baby last year. Our daughter is the first grandchild on both sides of our families, so as a result she is quite spoiled. Although we are always appreciative of the gifts we receive for our child there has always been a boundary issue with my in laws since my husband and I met which I will not go into but it’s important to note. This Christmas being our daughters first she was showered with many, many gifts majority being toys and stuff we had mentioned to our parents that she needed. We were super grateful that majority would be items that will be put to good use, since most of the gifts she received we can’t afford at the moment me being a stay at home mom and us living off of just my husbands income. this is where the boundary issue comes in. We had mentioned multiple times to our parents how we are choosing to raise our child. My husband and I both decided we would like to steer away from screen time as much as possible and opt in for more engaging activities and toys. That means no phones, no iPad and limited tv time since our little one is ONLY 5 months. Well my father in law went out of his way and bought our daughter a 65” screen tv for us to put in the room. We don’t even have enough space for a tv that big nor do we even watch tv that much ourselves to be interested in a tv that big not to mention that a FIVE month old has no business having a tv for herself. I told my husband that he’s just going to have to give his dad the gift back but my husband is refusing to since he says that it will offend him. 

[EDIT] there are just something’s I’d like to clarify since I’ve noticed previous comments have similar questions. No, my husband did not secretly go behind my back and ask for a TV for himself, we were both rather shocked when we saw FIL haul this thing into our living room. Yes, both sets of grandparents are aware of how we’re choosing to raise our child. At one point I did suggest my husband we swap it out with the one in our living for the occasional movie night. but unfortunately since we are currently living in an apartment there’s just not enough space hence why we also can’t just place it in the garage, etc. because we live in an apartment. As obnoxious as this might sound my FIL made it very clear to us that this is a gift for his grandkid and not a family gift which is why it doesn’t feel like a genuine gift. FIL has had a track récord of testing us as new parents. This is the same man who in summary threw a fit over a no sick visitor rule when our baby was a NB while no one else seemed to have any issues with that request. The only reason I’m suggesting we give it back is in hopes that, that be the best option as FIL can just return it and get back his moneys worth and we can forget all this even happened. ",0.07

"AITA for having a neighbor's vehicle ticketed for parking too close to my driveway? I live in a relatively dense residential neighborhood of a large city. There is no assigned street parking on my street -- if you can find a spot to park, you can park there.

Because the space between houses is minimal, the street parking between my driveway and my next door neighbor's driveway can accommodate either one or two vehicles, depending on the size of vehicle parked there. Often, I will see just a single vehicle in the middle. This seems to frustrate one of my neighbors, because it leaves a possible parking spot on a busy street inaccessible.

If this said neighbor, with whom I have never spoken to, sees a parking spot near my driveway available, she will park her large SUV such that the front tire is at my driveway line, completely leaving her front bumper blocking my driveway. It could be because she is trying not to be ""that person"" taking up two street parking spots when parking is already scarce, but I don't know for sure. But, when she chooses to park in this spot, she parks like this CONSTANTLY, even if the space behind her is available. I should clarify that I often see her car parked a few houses east, leading me to believe she lives a few houses away. But since I have never spoken to this lady, I have no idea which house exactly. I have only ever seen her getting into and out of the car.

While I can still get my car out when blocked like this, it's more challenging and dangerous, given that a large SUV is now obstructing my view of oncoming traffic to a relatively busy residential street. 

I've been giving her the benefit of the doubt for a few months, hoping maybe she will realize she's parked improperly upon returning to her vehicle and be more considerate next time. But nothing has changed. On one particularly poor parking day (as in worse than most days), I got fed up and called the city telling them a car had been parked blocking my driveway. I gave them a location and they said they would try to investigate. 

A few hours later, I look out the window to see they have a brand new parking ticket on their windshield.

I don't know if it will change anything, but I do feel a bit petty for taking this kind of action rather than trying to work it out in person (or at least through a note left on the windshield). So AITA?",0.19

So I decided to sort of ignore her texts for a while,cuz she's given me silent treatments for stuff that hurt me,so I was like this time lemme have some space,18 days go by,she doesnt ask me anything.Today I finally texted her asking if she even cares?and how hurt I was.
She said that all I wanted to do was show off my body,and she doesnt post cleavage pics cuz she has morals,and she doesnt get why I wanted to show off my body to him(whilst repeatedly ignoring my texts where Im saying that i just wanted her to post good pics of mine)and that am guilt tripping her by telling her that I cried on my birthday.There was this one thing too i can swear she held back from saying ""If you wanna show your body off that bad then..."" i bet she was boutta say something about OF.Then after all this she said sorry lol and i replied that this doesnt mean shit after you slutshame me,she replied ""the shit u do compells me to say these things"" i feel so cheap
Am I in the wrong??",0.34
"AITA for crying at my birthday party? I, 17m, have a very financially well-off family. My mom and dad have very high-paying jobs at a really big company. My parents have always said that they want me to have a good life and to them that means that they want me to have lots of money.

My parents aren’t very present in my life. They’re always at work or out at a dinner party for their work, etc. I’m home alone pretty much all the time, or with my best friend Alex. Alex has a smaller house and really nice parents so I hang out there a lot. Once I was at Alex’s house for a whole week before my parents noticed I was gone.

So, every year I ask my parents for the same thing for my birthday: to spend one afternoon together. But, instead, I always get a text saying they have to stay at work late and I can go pick myself out a present.

My 17th birthday was last week and I asked my mom and dad if we could go to an arcade and the movies to see a movie I really wanted to see. All the days leading up to my birthday, my parents said that was fine. They were going to meet me at the arcade at 5:30 when they got out of work.

I was waiting in my car at the arcade until 7:00 waiting for them to get there. I drove home and waited in the living room for them to get home. They walked in the door at 8:45 and barely acknowledged me. They walked past the living room, into the kitchen and poured themselves glasses of wine. I followed them into the kitchen and looked at them, standing there and talking to each other.

I cleared my throat and my parents looked at me. My dad mumbled an apology and said they had gotten caught up at work. He tossed me a small box with car keys inside. He told me I could have his old car, because he just bought a new one. He smiled and gave me a half-hug. I said thanks and my mom asked if something was wrong.

I told them that they left me hanging on my birthday again and my dad groaned and said to man up. He said that birthday parties are stupid, and I should be thankful that I got a nice car. I told him I’m super grateful for the car but I just wanted to hang out with him and my mom. My mom said that she couldn’t believe what an ungrateful boy she raised. Before I knew what was happening I was crying.

I told them that all I’ve ever wanted for my birthday is to have a normal day with them but they never did that. I cried even more and went to my room. I told Alex about what happened and he was pissed. He said I’m so out of touch and a bitch for crying when I got my own car. I explained that I wasn’t upset about the car but he said I’m an entitled asshole.

I really want to know if I am being out of touch and annoying about this, so any feedback is appreciated. Sorry if this sounded stupid.",0.07
"AITA for telling my mom to f off? I am a 16m

I was sleeping in my bed. We were supposed to go out in the morning for a walk, but I accidentally overslept.

My mom then walked into my room without announcing herself/knocking and then ripped off my blankets, which exposed my body as I was naked. She saw everything and was yelling at me to get up. 

I was so embarrassed and mortified and I felt that I had 0 privacy in that moment. I ended up telling her to ""f off"" as it was all bizarre to me, and I had only just woken up. 

Fast forward, both of my parents are angry with me for telling her to f off, and won't really talk to me a week later. My mom refuses to see her part in it either, and believes that she didn't do anything wrong.",0.13
"AITA for telling his gf he came to see me against her wishes? I moved across country for college. I was in a really vulnerable position after getting out of a horrible relationship. I met Wes at the library. It was really cute, and we chatted for hours afterwards. We became friends. I didn't know anyone around, and I was a shy person. I also fell in love with him the day I met him. I could just tell he was a good person and he was also so beautiful. He was in a relationship though.  
  
I ended up exiting that toxic relationship shortly after meeting Wes. I lived with the ex, and I had no close friends, no place to go, no family. I called Wes, out of desperation, and admitted I didn't have a place to go & he took me in. Let me stay for months with his roommates. They were so sweet to me.  
  
His GF was spending the summer in London for college, and she told me she was absolutely not cool with me staying there. She said she could tell I had a crush on him, and Wes confided in me that she has jealousy issues.  
  
But he still let me stay. I had never felt that safe and looked after before in my life. I remember my ex coming & they scared him off for me. He took me to the police station to get a restraining order and he saved me. We got really close and shared a lot with each other. He said he didn't know anyone else with a broken family & it was nice talking to someone who got it.  
  
I asked why he was with his gf with all her jealousy issues, if he has to lie to her, and he said besides that the relationship is perfect, and she's his soulmate and everything to him. He said it was worth it dealing with the jealousy issues because he loves her so much. They've been together for 6 years. He said she was young and would grow out of it.

I felt jealous. I knew she wasn't good enough for him.   
  
I ended up moving out and getting my own place soon after. His GF came back, and eventually she found out about me living with him. She messaged me and said I could never see him again or she'd ruin my life.   
  
I ended up having a breakdown. I messaged him and begged him to come see me and he did. He asked what was wrong. I acted like a mess. I told him I had never felt so safe. I use to dream about dying, getting hurt, and having someone around me who gave a shit and took care of me. When I was with him, I felt special. Like he cared for me. But it was never special.  
  
I was crying & he comforted me. He said it was special, his GF would kill him if she knew he was here but he still came because I'm special to him. He said we'll always be friends, and he would talk to her and he'd convince her we can be friends. He said if he knows I'm not in love with him, she'll be fine with it.  
  
I asked if she would break up with him if she knew, and he said no, she'd be very upset tho. I couldn't let the idea go. I ended up asking a friend to tell her we met again. I was hoping it would break them up, but instead she got him to block me on all socials but they are still together. I feel sick to my stomach, like I betrayed him.

"AITA for telling my sister that her advice was unsolicited? I(39M) am a single dad to my daughter(22F) and what was great when she was growing up was my sister(42F) really stepped up and was that female role model that my daughter needed since her mom wasn't around.

My daughter's struggled with her weight since junior high. I take full blame for not setting a better example for healthy food habits or exercise. I should have but I didn't and really dropped the ball.

Now, I don't discuss weight with my daughter, I never have. My sister is not afraid to have those conversations with her though. 

This morning, I got a call from my sister, who I knew was planning to spend the weekend with my daughter and it was just this "" girls weekend"" thing which I thought was great for both of them. 

My sister tells me that they got to talking about my daughter's weight and how much she exercises and what she eats. My sister's big points to me were that my daughter is 80 pounds overweight, rarely exercises, and usually opts for quick, easy food. 

I asked why she was telling me all of this and if there was an endpoint. She got very agitated and told me I should be more worried about my out of shape 22 year old daughter being 80 pounds heavier than she should be.

She started advising me to crack the whip on my daughter, that was her phrase. I asked her how you crack the whip on a 22 year old. She just said I need to do it and that I need to get a handle on things. I got upset, told her that her advice was bullshit and that it was unsolicited.

"AITA for yelling at my nephew and sister for disrespecting me I (29M) am visiting my sister over for my uni winter-break. She has 3 kids (6F), (8M) & (10M). Also if that matters she's the one that invited me and also paid for my ticket since I'm a non-working student.

Generally I like playing around with most kids, and most of the kids like spending time with me. The 2 younger kids often say that I am their favourite uncle and they enjoy spending time and playing with me. They listen to what I ask of them and are well-behaved around me. Obviously they are still kids and do stupid things, but overall I enjoy spending time with them. All that while I'm literally fed-up with the eldest kid. He never listens and always talks back to me (to his parents too but to lesser extent). Also since day one that I arrived at their place he keeps on disrespecting my privacy- looks through my things behind my back, peaks over my shoulder at my laptop/phone and comments it, tries to play paparazzo shooting photos of me etc. And I mean constantly. I've never yelled at him for that, but was very annoyed with his behaviour and told him countless times.

Also very important detail to add is that I smoke cigarettes, the fact which my family condemns very strong and tries to shame me for it all the time even tho I'm 30 and soon a physician so I know what I'm doing lol.

Neither my sister nor my brother-in-law made any serious attempts to stop his doing. Sure they did tell him sometimes to stop but never really did anything to make it happen. So his behaviour stays the same. After he looks through my things and finds my cigarettes or sees that I'm on my phone scrolling instagram or sth equally stupid he yells that loud, sends photos on our family chat etc. And while it doesn't do any serious harm it's constant and very annoying.

So today he has done all of that again several times, and after the last time he was peaking over my shoulder I yelled at him to stop. And while I know he's just a kid etc. I stand to repeat that it's very annoying and his parents not doing anything with that is just infuriating. Obviously he started talking back to me, after sometime my sister joined bashing me for yelling at her kid.

A big argument ensued with both of us saying mean things, on my part it was centered around not respecting myself and my privacy by her, her kid and whole family in general. Between many things said she told me that's her house and rules and I can't treat her kid like that. That I shouldn't be mad and arguing with the kid because I'm an adult etc.

So AITA for getting mad and yelling at/arguing with her and the kid?

"AITA for ignoring my brothers gf? I (20F) have an older brother (25M), who's been dating his girlfriend (20F) for the past 3 months. 

Little background here, I knew his girlfriend before they even got together, as she was my friend in high-school. We were super closer in our freshman, sophomore and junior year before covid got the better of our friendship and created a rift between us. Out of our whole friend group, she was my favorite and we did almost everything together.

3 months ago, my brother came to me about dating someone, I was happy for him, seeing as his last relationship went horribly. He didn't tell me her name or anything, just said he was seeing someone. About a week after he told me had a girlfriend, he brought her over and I was completely blindsided, seeing as it was my friend that he is dating. 

I was okay with him dating her, it took a little while to adjust to seeing her with my brother but ultimately, I was okay with it. Mind you they told me that even if I wasn't okay with it, they would've still seen each other. 

Anyway, ever since she started dating my brother, I see a different side of her, a toxic obsessive side of her. She constantly posts gross and explicit photos of them all over her socials, talks about him 24/7, got a tracking app on his phone and she constantly gets jealous of anyone who gets his attention, she even gets jealous of me. She doesn't have a job and my brother has a really good paying job and will get anything for her, even when he chooses to not pay his bills and then ask me to help with them. Anytime I try and talk to her, she will only talk about my brother and about how handsome he is and about how good he is in bed, which ew I do not need to know. She's even changing his whole style and everything about him, I can honestly say that a  doppelganger took my brothers spot with how different he is. 


I cant stand being around her anymore, she just drains my energy every single time she talks about my brother. We stopped being friends the second she ended up in my brothers bed. Yesterday she messaged me, asking if my brother would like a few gifts she was planning on buying him, and I completely ignored her messages,  I guess she told my brother and he messaged me asking if I received her message, when I told him I saw it and didn't respond, he got mad and said I was being a bitch for ignoring her. Like bro, how do you expect me to be all cool with her after she fucked my brother and said goodbye to our friendship?? AITA?",0.31
"AITA for having an aversion to basmati rice  
For some context:
I (F21) live with my family in the states. We moved here almost ten years ago and we come from a south asian background. Rice is our main dish in our daily life. The thing is I despise Basmati rice. Growing up I have never had this specific type of rice and I only got to know about it after moving to the states. I can't seem to like it no matter what. People seem to enjoy it a lot especially with biryani. I don't like chewing it, it just feels so weird to me. It kinda makes the whole eating experience weird. 

My mother knows about it. So does my aunt since her children don't seem to like it as well. If I'm invited to any gatherings and there is no other alternative then I will obviously eat it as I'm a guest in their house, but at least at home I prefer to have my own comfort of rice which is parboiled one. My mother does all of the cooking at home. It's not like my father or I can't cook but she prefers it that way. So unless she is sick or unavailable for some reason, she doesn't let us do any of the cooking and likes to be in charge. 

Today she cooked rice in the rice cooker for lunch and we already had a lot of items in the fridge to eat with it. When I got really hungry at noon I went to serve myself lunch and saw that she cooked basmati rice. She does it a lot of the times randomly without giving me any heads up. I'm not trying to dictate what rice to eat but I believe when she does it she can give me a little heads up or asks me beforehand so that I could cook myself something quickly or get my own food. It's not like she forgets but she simply just doesn't get it even though I have mentioned it a lot of times before. 

I simply sat down and was trying to figure whether to go cook something for myself or order but my dad suggested to eat it for today and assured me that mom will keep it in mind next time. Also, in our culture or at least in my family if someone cooks something for you and if you get some other arrangements for yourself it comes off as disrespectful and insulting to the cook unless you're deathly allergic to it or anything significant. 

I am not trying to seem ungrateful or entitled but AITA for constantly bickering over this rice issue?",0.2

"AITA for carrying through purchasing land from my FIL after he died and MIL is the estate? My father in law owned a large ranch that has been in his family for a few generations. This summer he was starting to go blind from diabetes so I drove out and spent a few months rounding up his cattle and cutting his hay to get sold. When the work was done he said he wanted to sell my wife and I the ranch. He named his price, which was certainly under market, but would provide well for him and his wife until they passed. We agreed and had attorneys draw up the purchase agreement, had land surveys done, legal, etc. Everything was signed and set to close. The day prior to closing FIL was served with divorce papers, halting the sale. MIL stated that she wanted to make sure she got her fair share out of the deal and getting a divorce was the only way she would be legally entitled to half. 

A few days after getting served FIL has a heart attack, and died in the ICU about a month after.   My wife and I dug the hole with a backhoe , bought him a casket, and put him to rest yesterday. Mother in law didn’t even bother to show up for the burial, neither did his other daughter. 

Today, I stopped in to say goodbye to MIL before my wife and I started the two day drive home. She asked what needed to be done to cancel the land purchase agreement, to which I told her that we still intend to proceed, that all of the money would now go to her alone. She said that we weren’t paying enough for the land and she wanted us to cancel the agreement. 

We said no, we had a deal with FIL that we would buy the land, and provide for them, and also promised to keep the ranch whole as long as we could. This didn’t end well; she accused us of stealing her inheritance, going behind her back, screwing her over, etc. It got to the point where I just had to say I’m sorry, I love you, but I have to get back home. 

So, I plan on enforcing the purchase as agreed with my father in law, despite my mother in laws wishes. I feel guilty as fuck.  AITA?

Edit:  We are not concerned about the legal side of things; we had 3 lawyers work on the PA to make sure it was legit (ours, his, and a neutral 3rd party draftsmen). The agreement is valid and executable. Im just wondering if IATA for enforcing the agreement against MIL’s wishes after FIL passed away.  ",0.14
"AITA for admitting I didn’t love my Christmas gifts I (30F) celebrated Christmas with my family which includes my mom, two sisters, one brother in law, and four nieces. The children were spoiled by all which would never bother me considering I get them as much as I possibly can. I also try really hard to get everybody else stuff they would actually want or use. Now, I tell my mother all the time I don’t need presents, I make plenty of money, but she still insists which is also fine by me. My older sister got clothes and makeup, a pair of nice heels, jewelry, and gift cards. Her and my mother are both into that stuff. My younger sister loves decorating her home and gardening, she got many things suited to those interests. I like video games, sneakers, working out. I got a handful of knick-knacks. Like 4 random items that I don’t know what to do with. And a “humorous” sweatshirt that even my mother said “I know you’d never wear it but it’s funny”. So I got a handful of items I will put in a drawer and never use. I smiled and hugged her and thanked her. 
Since Christmas, she has been asking me constantly if I like my presents. I kept saying yes, of course, they are lovely, they are cute, funny, etc. I suppose I wasn’t convincing enough because when she asked me yet again just the other day I said “I mean, yes mother they are cute but I’m never going to use them”. I kinda pointed out how my siblings got things tailored to their interests and she got upset with me and basically said how she doesn’t understand my interests, but she got me presents and I’m being ungrateful.

"AITA | Christmas gifts A little bit of a back story, I started working at my present job about 6 years ago. 5 years ago, I had met this girl that had just started working there also. We clicked and have been close friends ever since. We know pretty much all of each others’ personal lives and we hang out outside of work also. I’m 27(F), and she’s 32.

Anyways, I had given her and her child (8F) Christmas presents, naturally, like we’ve always done. I had given hers a week before Christmas since I was having a small surgery that week. I had gifted her a massive fur comforter set, some cosmetics that were pricey (she asked her bf for them but he said it’s “too much to figure out”),a limited edition body wash, a lip balm set, and a bunch of office supplies since she got a little promotion and she’s always complaining about not having any supplies. The total for hers was around $120ish.

I gifted her daughter a box of sticker dispensers that had 1000s of stickers inside, a couple body sprays, and bubble bath stuff, it’s not much but I like when kids have something to unwrap. I had also given her $50 cash along with these little things.

Christmas passes, hell, even new year passes, and I still have no gift. She proceeds to ask me what I wanted for Christmas. I’m annoyed because why are you asking me this now?? Why can’t you figure it out? Anyways, I told her a bag of makeup wipes would be great, they’re about $8. Nothing crazy. She had also asked my boyfriend what I’d like. He also told her about a purse I liked which was also $25.

Time passes, and finally, on January 5th, I get handed my Christmas gift. As she handed it to me she said “if you don’t like it you can return it”. Which blew me. I opened it and it was a box of bandaids, and a do-it-yourself crochet kit. The kit is smaller than my hand.

This might sound like I’m ungrateful, I appreciate the gift. But there was 0 thought put into it. She had 365 days to get something. I’ve never expressed any interest in crochet nor do I have the time for that.

The cherry on top is her talking about her bday party all the time n what she wants for her birthday, and how she gets all this $ from her child’s father in child support that she uses on herself, but yet doesn’t even bother to use her brain and do something decent for someone whose always been there for her?

"AITA for miscalculating the length of my relationship if I was seeing someone else while we were separated? My (50M) husband and I (41F) will have *known* each other for 10 yrs this year. We broke up for about 9 months and I was in a relationship with someone else for 6 of those. So technically in my opinion we've been together for just over 9yrs and not quote the 10 that he wants to celebrate.

 He is upset that I would not consider my time while we were on a break away as part of the relationship. Logically I was with someone else and that to me is a valid life experience that in my history I refuse to erase.

"AITA for not forcing a relationship w my fiancés stepdaughter? My fiancé has a 13 y/o girl that although she is not his biological daughter, he looks at her as his daughter because he’s been in her life so long. When we first got together we spent plenty of time together, I’ve always gotten her things and went out of my way on special days to include her. I noticed that if we seen her in public and she asked him for money but he didn’t have change or something, I would go in my purse and give it to her and she would respond with “thank you daddy” as if it didn’t come from me, she would get in our car and not speak to me, she attempted to steal 2 iPhones from me, etc. I have continued to “try” to bond with her but nothing seems to have been good enough for him. He says I’ve ruined their relationship because she doesn’t feel comfortable asking to come over and they used to spend everyday together before he met me. 

Backstory: I have simply requested that he cleans the house before we have any company, her included. Day to day cleaning is all on me, I’m expected to do it and he never helps UNLESS he has plans for her to come over, then he gets up with ease and cleans the whole house w no problem. Me just asking him to do it has never been enough. So on days where he is cleaning and I know it’s only because he wants her to come over, I don’t help. He expects me to be eager to get up and help him as soon as he starts which I don’t think is fair. Your company, your responsibility to make sure the house is clean. He has never disciplined her, or held her accountable with consequences for her actions, but definitely has no problem disciplining my 5 y/o (from a previous relationship.)

I also feel like she only comes around when she’s asking for something or “gift-giving” occasions are close. Which makes me not want her around even more bc I can’t stand to have ppl in my space that I feel like are always looking for an opportunity to get something out of me. So recently I have completely washed my hands of the situation and decided that I have 3 kids of my own, I cannot spend that much energy trying to “prove” to someone else’s child that I “like” them.

"WIBTA for not watching over my younger siblings? I, 16F, am the eldest and have 2 younger brothers, 9M and 4M. Sometimes, my parents have me watch over them, which I don't want to do, but do it begrudgingly anyway to take the load off my busy working parents and be more grateful. The 9M can handle himself most of the time, but the 4M isn't potty-trained, doesn't understand language, and treats everything like a game (knocking down the furniture, messing with the expensive things in the house, stripping his diaper/clothes, etc.). I don't have to watch over them often enough that it interferes with my grades or social life, but when it does happen (almost always unplanned), I lose hours of my time because I can't multitask and do homework while watching them.

Recently, my Dad was out of town and my Mom asked me to care for my siblings once I got home from a sleepover since she had been caring for both of them for the 1.5 days I was out and needed to finish some work at home. Initially, I was fine with this, it felt only fair after a day off, but getting home to an immediate argument with 9M and chasing 4M to prevent messes for an hour, I wanted a break and to do my work. I ended up watching them for another 2 hours before I felt I wouldn't get denied a break (which happens if I call too soon or while my parents are busy) and called my mom, who did come.

This has only really started happening since I turned 15. To my parents' credit, they have a hired full-time house helper who works 6 days a week and stops working just before 4M goes to bed, so I've never been one of the main carers for a long time unless we were switching between house helpers (on the day of my example, she wasn't working). I've asked my parents before if I can watch over my brothers less, but they generally don't agree unless I offer an academic reason (eg. I need to study).

Compared to my parents who grew up less off than I am, they're not asking for as much as their parents asked them, so they feel entitled to expect me to give some of my time to watch my siblings. I'm envious of my friends that are the only child, the younger sibling, or have siblings in a closer age range. I don't plan on caring for them once I'm 18 and out of the house, which my parents are mostly aware of, but I'm also considering refusing to care as much for my siblings until I turn 18 as I'm only getting busier with tasks & college applications in high school and want more independence.

"AITA for not complaining that my plane seat got moved? Recently I (20m) have returned from an international trip with my girlfriend (21f) and her sister (17f). On our return trip, the first plane we had to take had only 4 seats per row (2 on either side of the aisle), so the seating arrangement that we had would sit my girlfriend and her sister next to each other, and I would sit right behind them next to somebody else (or, if I was lucky, next to an empty seat!). My girlfriend's sister has a fear of flying, so my girlfriend had to sit next to her, and I was okay with sitting outside of their row. We booked these seats in advance.

  
At the airport while we were at our gate waiting to board, literally about 5 minutes before boarding started, the gate agent called me up and told me that my assigned seat had been moved 9 rows up in order to accommodate a family that had to sit together. I was not asked beforehand at all if I wanted to move my seat, and when I got to the gate agent they already had a new boarding pass printed out for me.

  
When I returned to my girlfriend and her sister to tell them that my seat had been moved, my girlfriend asked me why I didn't complain that they moved me and demand my original seat back, and I reply that I just didn't think to in the moment. She then tells me to go back up to the gate agent to complain, to which I say that I didn't want to, as the flight was going to be boarding *very* soon.

  
I am not a confrontational person, my girlfriend knows that, as we have been dating for over a year. We had a tight connection after this flight (less than an hour), and the flight itself was rather short (also less than an hour), so I did not think it was that big of a deal to cause a scene or risk delaying the flight even by a moment, as I was nervous about missing the connection. Not to mention that I had only found out literally 5 minutes before boarding the plane.

  
After this, my girlfriend got very mad at me, saying things like ""I don't know why you can't stand up for yourself"" and ""I'm pissed off that we have to sit in the back of the plane and we're not even sitting by each other"" (when I booked the flight, the back half of the plane was the only spot where all three of us could sit in close proximity, due to other seats being booked, etc; she and her sister okayed the arrangement before I booked the seats, and I did not foresee myself getting moved).

  
After we boarded the plane, before takeoff, my girlfriend texted me ""the 'family' behind us is a couple. good job 👍"", to which I replied ""they just told me it was a family"", to which she said ""mhm"".

  
After the plane landed, my girlfriend didn't talk to me and seemed to ignore me for most of the rest of the day, even when I talked to her. I was seated next to her on our next flight which was much longer, and she barely talked to me or acknowledged me, which made me sad. I don't think it is fair that she is very mad at me for something that is outside of my control, but I just want a third party opinion on this if IATA.",0.5
"AITA about getting upset about porn? I know this is gonna come off really silly. And I do fully support healthy sex lives and needs and wants. Believe me I do.

But here’s the thing my husband (32m) and I (30f) have been together for 5 years. We have an extremely healthy sex life, I’d say. We might not get to as often with kids and work life balance but we do happily enjoy our time when we do. 

Now, over the past weekend I had taken a shower and he’s normally really good about checking with me if I’ve gone to bed or getting ready for bed blah blah blah. And I was playing my phone game and he didn’t come upstairs but I was listening for him and to find out he was watching porn. Now I normally do not mind, but not when I’m home, alone with zero kids for the weekend. It basically really hurt my feelings. And I had explained to him that it did and we do not fight or ever argue. We’re really good about talking and explaining things but we’ve also never done anything to harm another one’s feelings, so when I had mentioned it to him he was dead silent, and that also bothered me. 

Like I mentioned I don’t mind that he watches it just not when I’m home? Is that a bad thing? Like I’m cool if you wanna wake me up and knock one out, by all means but there’s something that really bothers me about my person watching another female (who’s always hands down prettier) have sex. Now I’m constantly over thinking that’s what he does when I’m asleep and that I’m not meeting the needs he has. 

Am I the asshole for feeling this way?",0.83
"AITA for not wanting to make amends? I’m on talking terms with my siblings but we never acknowledge what stopped us from talking. And honestly, idk if I want to because it’s been so many little fightings leading up to a really big one. I’ve lost any trust I had in them and maybe they feel the same towards me but I guess I’m in a weird spot. 

Because I want us to be cool enough to not act like we don’t exist but not close enough to where they want to know any personal information. So AITA for wanting that? I just don’t think I ever want to fully trust them again. It feels like I’m finally starting to see how this family works, and I don’t have a place in it. 

I don’t have anyone on my side. I’m always by myself and I realized each fight, I was either blamed or pushed to be the bad guy. It’s exhausting. I’m just so tired. But how can I maintain boundaries with them? They’re my family so I can’t completely cut them off. Am I wrong for feeling like this?",0.36
"AITA for speaking up against in laws for enabling sis in law Mostly a rant more than a question,
Hi! In context the sis in law stole so much money from my in laws, borrowed money from other people, lied to our faces on why she did it. Didn’t pay off a loan to a loan shark where her friend is a guarantor. pawned off vehicles and still couldn’t explain where the money goes. 

my in laws couldn’t even tell her off. she manipulates them and they kept believing despite the screenshots/proofs that I sent them from various people she borrowed money from. making stories like “oh my dad is in the hospital” and other disgusting stuff that’s not true. also always making my husband amd look bad. 

when she was caught stealing money her reason was connected to my husband which is untrue. she just keeps including my husband so the focus goes to him but I knew better and got proof. 

Now one of her lenders and I were friends so we talked about what’s happening and mentioning how my inlaws are enablers not even doing anything. ignoring how she’s not even trying to compensate and asking the inlaws for money to pay off her debt!!! 

those screenshots were leaked and somehow found a way to my sis in law and guess what, my in laws told me off lol

"AITA for not agreeing with my wife's seemingly random prohibitions for my nieces when they visit My wife(24f) and I(26m) got into an argument because she didn't think the way I spend time with my niece was acceptable. 
Context. I lived with my sister since my niece(11f) was born. Last year I've moved out on my own and in the same year I got married to my wife. Because of the rapid shift in life and work becoming more busy then ever, I haven't had the time or energy to make time for that part of my family. 
 Recently I made time to invite my niece over. No plans, just for her to come over and hang out with my wife and I. After picking her up on the way home she talked about wanting to build a snow man and a bunch of other things we thought would be fun. After getting home my wife says that while Niece and I go out to play in the snow she'll finish some chores around the house.
 Before going out Niece sees my Vr headset and shows interest so I offer to let her play it before going outside. She says yes, so.i start it up and she starts playing. 5 minutes pass and my wife comes into the room and asks why we aren't outside yet. I tell her that Niece wanted to play VR first so I let her. Wife gets upset, saying video games isn't quality time. I respond with ""we're spending time together and niece is having fun, so why does it matter?"" Wife storms off. 
Soon after niece and I do go out and make a couple of snowmen and snow angles, ect.
And after playing in the snow for 30ish minutes, Niece asks to play vr again. I say yes and she skips away to play vr in the living room. We switch back and forth trying to beat each others score in Beat Saber and stuff like that.

Fast forward. I drop Niece back off at home and come back home and my wife has a list made out for me when I walk back into the door. It's a list of things that our young guests aren't allowed to do while at our house. And on the list is no playing video games amongst other seemingly arbitrary prohibitions.
 I say "" The list is not necessary, because when I bring my family or friends over I'm going to do what we enjoy.""
She says ""that's no way to spend time with kids, doing nothing but playing video games. I like doing crafts and playing board games and other things with my siblings when they come over, why can't you do the same?""
I respond ""because we weren't raised don't those things so i didn't think to do those things, but if you offered to try some of that stuff when she was still here I would've obliged. But I'm not going to accept a list of prohibitions because you don't like our version of fun.""
The argument escalated and I maybe sorta said some mean things like ""you're too narrow minded and dull to accept that things other than what you like are fun"" 

Tl;DR
Wife imposed rules for what activities I'm not allowed to do with my nieces when they come over. I refused to accept it because it prohibits playing video games.

AITA for prioritizing an Billy Joel concert over a wedding cause I really want to go to again ?? I'm a fan of 80s music and Billy Joel is one of my most favorite artists that I like listening to. I have most of his songs on an playlist on apple music. I've seen him twice. He is performing again this upcoming spring and I'm wanting to go to another one of his concerts. The only problem that I'm facing right now is that I'm supposed to be attending a wedding on the same day that he is performing. I'm thinking about just driving up there since it I rather go to a concert than to drive 9 hours to go see some stupid wedding . I'm not a fan of weddings unless it is my wedding which I'm planning on having one soon in a couple of years as my main goal is to find someone within 5 years. Which is the reasoning why I want to empty my bucket list. I'm facing backlash here as I'm wanting to back out of the wedding to go to the concert as I'm the bestman and people are forcing me to stay at the wedding. I don't want to be at the wedding as its just only going to make me more depressed and it is hard already for me having manic depression and mood swings which is killing me each day.

"AITA for not staying silent when people took our chair at the restaurant? My husband and I have 2 small kids and I'm due with our 3rd this week. A few days ago we went to an indoor playground where you can eat and hang out while the kids play. We live in the netherlands (crappy weather). 

The place was full but we managed to find a table with 4 chairs. We placed our coats on our chairs and went with our kids to play. Some parents just hang out at the table while their kids play alone, our kids are 6 and 4 so we went along to get them settled in.

After a while we decided to go get drinks and lunch at the restaurant in this indoor playground. Next to our table were a grandma and grandpa with 2 kids. 

We make a short stop at our table to drop off our shoes and walk a few meters to order food. When we return no more than 15 min later with our drinks and stuff I see that the grandma had removed my kids coat and had taken our chair. 
In total confusion and disbelief I turn to my husband and say ""someone took our chair?! They even removed our stuff to take our chair!""

I was honestly shocked. I looked around and saw the grandma sitting in a corner of her table super obviously with the extra chair. All other tables had 4 chairs except theirs now had 5 and our had 3.
My husband tried to hush me and said ""I know I know just sit in my chair"" and went to take our girls to pee. 

I looked around for an extra chair but saw all tables were empty but occupied (like coats and stuff). I was now forced to ""steal"" someone elses chair and took an empty chair. I would never touch someone's stuff though. I then saw that grandma had used one of their 4 chairs to put her bags on. We just put our stuff on the floor. 

When my husband returned I pointed this out to him. Now I didn't whisper and I'm sure my shock was evident. I responded with my authentic response like not extra dramatic or more subdued. I believe that if people behave asocially you can call them out on it. Hindsight that's what I should have done. 

My issue really lays in my husbands response though. He told me to hush up. Which I regrettably did. When we were at home I asked him about it and told him i was disappointed in his conflict avoidant behavior. He criticizes people for this kind of behavior behind closed doors but in public tells me to hush up and let it go. 
He is now telling me I was making a scene and acting like I am the asshole. Since we didn't actually see her do it he says we can't address it and if I had said something about it calmly and quietly he would have done something about it. So a hundred reasons why he didn't do anything and why I am the reason for it. He says that ""evolving"" (turning to him to tell him someone took our chair) him wasn't fair. I honestly feel like he is gaslighting me. I think I responded like he wish he would have, making him feel like less of an alfa for not defending us or standing up for us. Now I just feel really frustrated that not only did he not support me in the situation, he hushed me (which is hypocriet) and now tries to make me look like the asshole. AITA? Thanks!",0.04
"AITA for asking for my money back after my BF lost his savings I(23F) met my boyfriend(29M) last year in my father's cancer hospital where he used to work in operations department .He asked me to marry him 3 times in the last 1 year but I refused saying that we are still getting to know each other. We live in different cities so we only met for a week every 2 months. Even that 1 week he was meeting his friends and was taking me along when I clearly told that I want to spend time with him alone. He told that he was depressed and that his friends were a distraction and that he didn't want to show me his bad side. We had arguments about him not giving me proper time but he always blamed it on his depression. When he finally got a job 2 months ago and was not depressed about unemployment anymore he told that he has to give all his time to the hospital so that he doesn't lose his job.   
I gave him money multiple times for his credit card bills which is around $14000 till now. I invested $8500 in a bond that my BF suggested which I got as my dad's death claim. I also bought a land he introduced for $30000.I paid him $3600 commission for introducing the land. The registration for the land is still not done even after I transferred the money 6 months back. I do have the land papers though. After I transferred him the money for the bond he sent me a text which had the name and the units of the bond and told me that is the only proof I get . Finally after 6 months when I was not taking any of his lies he finally told that he checked with the investor and that the investor is missing and his number is invalid. He told me that along with my money he also invested his ,his father's and his friend's money. He told me that all the money he invested in that bond was also in my name so I will get the returns in my bank account and I can take that as the money that I gave him. In the last 1 year he was giving money to his friends when he didn't have any money himself. He still has credit card bills to pay and was asking me to give him money from my dad's savings but I refused. I asked him to return the money that I gave him and also the investment money because it seemed too convenient that he got scammed suddenly when I asked him for money and that he did not check all this time if the investment has been made. He told me he would return the money after 2 years but I asked him to return it in a month or that I will have to ask his parents for my money. He got angry and told me he would not give me the money and refused to even write a message as a proof stating he would give me my money after 2 years. He tells me he was very hurt when I refused to marry him and was offended when I called him a scammer and told me to suck his dick, die and called me names.

 I 40 (F) was talking to my boyfriend who 40 (M) on the way from a football game. We usually have nice talks on car rides. I don’t remember how the conversation came up but he said “ why do girls always go first the bad boys?” So I told him back in my day when I was 17 or 18 years old it  was the fast money and the partying and all the shopping.

"AITA for obviously favoring of my niece? Using fake names for obvious reasons.

I (35F) have been married to my wife (Amy - 33F) for the past 10 years. I have no siblings. Amy has a brother (Max - 40M) who has three kids, two sons (Leo 6 and Ryan 5) and a daughter (Anne 8). We have two kids (Sarah 7 and Ava 5). 

Now I love all of Max's children. And they get along really well with our kids. They constantly have sleepovers and play together, etc. Leo and Ryan are walking earthquakes. They're pretty active kids who enjoy physical activities much more than anything else. Anne is more laid back, and we have a special bond.

For example, my wife and I have a thing where we play chess or do crafts with our girls. Anne usually joins and asks us to sit with her. She also likes my profession (I'm an ENT doctor) and asks me all kinds of questions. (She loves the idea of being able to see inside one's nose and ear).

For Christmas, we got all of Max's kids a special gift. They came over for dinner one day during the holidays. Now I'd already gotten Anne her very own chess set around a month ago, and hadn't been able to give it to her because I kept forgetting it and it was in my office for a good while.

However, I thought I'd just give her the gift while she was with us. Amy also agreed and said it would be a good idea and she could play chess with her friends etc. Max seemed to hate the idea. When the kids were gone he told me I was being sexist for clearly favoring his daughter, and said I needed to treat his kids equally.

I said I just wanted to give a special gift, Amy took my side and said Max was being very petty about something as innocent as this. He is still upset with me. I wanted to apologise but Amy said I don't need to because I didn't do anything wrong. Was it an AH move to give her the chess set then?",0.14
"AITA for hiding stuff from my boyfriend? My boyfriend is mad at me right now because he found a screenshot of a guy hitting on me during our relationship. Keep in mind i never replied to this guy nor had any interaction with him. I just took a screenshot and removed him. He's arguing that i never told him and is now second guessing our whole relationship. 
During the start, before dating each other he had to tell me to remove multiple guys i had a situation-ship with and he brought that up saying ""i had to tell you to remove them, why should i believe u removed this guy on your own"". I don't mind doing the things he asks but he'll just open my phone and start going through it. He's my first boyfriend so im genuinely confused. Is this actually how relationships are? 
He wont let me even keep my highlights unless every guy is blocking from seeing them. I had no intention to hide the fact that guys hit on me, i just didn't care enough to bring it up. 
I feel responsible for his trust issues though. He opened my chat with a guy once where i didn't properly shut him down for flirting. Once he found out he lost it and made me block him.

"AITA for not introducing gf to dad? I live at home with parents and invited my gf (29) over for a movie, she has never met my dad before and by the time she arrives at around 9.30pm, my dad is kind of doing his own thing upstairs, he didn't come downstairs to 'meet her' per se as I have friends over every now and then so nothing out of the ordinary.  (I do however, let my dad know that I have a guest over just as general courtesy since I'll be in the main living area) 

About half through the movie my dad comes downstairs and asks me a quick question about whether I'm able to empty the dishwasher and I tell him that it's not a problem, he goes to the kitchen, grabs some water and go back upstairs. (this whole interaction was probably less than 30 seconds). For context - the way the living area is configured means that he walks behind us to go the kitchen meaning me and my gf have our backs facing him as he walks behind us to get to the kitchen. 

This entire time my gf afaik is still watching the movie and doesn't indicate anything and she doesn't get up either during the interaction with my dad and just keeps watching the movie. We finish up and she goes home.

Later on she texts me and says that she was extremely upset and felt disrespected that I didn't introduce her to my dad. I tell her that we didn't really discuss it beforehand so felt that since she didn't really tell me that what she wanted an intro. 

tbh I did think of it but didn't want to pressure her and make it awkward. I told her that I'm happy to introduce her another time when she's over. I also tell her that my dad probably just doesn't want to disturb since the movie was still playing. She doesn't really address this directly and remains upset.

The next day we touch on this situation again and says that it was 50% my fault and 50% my dad's fault for not greeting her as the 'guest'. I ask, if she wanted an introduction, why didn't she say 'hi' since the guest in the house can typically also initiate but she said that 'she didn't have the chance to'. 

I can definitely make more of an effort but she feels extremely upset about it, so I feel like a bit of an AH.

"AITA for demanding a clean bathroom? i (m20) live with my partner (23) sister “jane” (19) and her ex bf “john” (19) as well as another sibling and parents but for the sake of this these are the only important ones. 
my partner and i have a very poorly converted basement kinda room which has a toilet and sink but no shower, so the only time we use the upstairs bathroom is to shower once a day. 

the main issue: this bathroom is fucking filthy. it’s an old house that never feels clean so it’s super important to keep this bathroom clean or in a week it is disgusting. i wish i was exaggerating. 

new years last year my partner and i got back from overseas and we lost it with this bathroom being filthy, he has major OCD and we are both hindu if that makes any difference to the importance of cleanliness. we spent two days deep cleaning this to the MAXX and decided upon a system, each week we would rotate between john and jane cleaning and then my partner and i. from the beginning this had issues of them accusing us of not cleaning whilst themselves not cleaning. they wouldn’t clean, i would ask my mum to tell them (because if i ask they ignore me or cause an argument) and she would say oh they’re tired they’ll do it tomorrow. they don’t then we do double the clean the next week. 

i gave up and made a chart for the bathroom detailing who’s week is who and what steps need to be taken to clean it. this worked for maybe two weeks. 

i’m sitting here now with dirt caked on the sink, someone’s clean clothes sitting in a filthy tub, a bin full of food bags and alcohol cans. and i’m done. i can’t do it anymore. i feel like a child the way im frustrated about this but no one else has any respect for others sharing a space.

"AITA for saying to my sister our jobs aren't the same? Last night my sister and I went to a dinner party to catch up with friends. We went to the same school together, my friends were her friend's younger siblings. Before Covid-19 happened we hadn't seen each other for at least two years and covid happened so it's been five years since we all saw each other. A lot has changed, many of us have graduated and have full-time jobs, many have gone on to start a PhD and so on. 

My sister works at a high school as an English teacher whereas I work at a university as a university research lecturer. My sister spends 80% of her working hours teaching, the other 20% of the time is spent marking and doing admin. During dinner, a friend of hers asked me what I was up to now; before I got the chance to answer, my sister butted in, saying she's got the same job as me; she teaches. At this point, I said no, we don't have the same job. I corrected the fact she works as a teacher at a secondary school. I work at a university, and I only spend ten hours a week teaching; the rest is spent researching my field of work, coming up with new project proposals, publishing and much more. 

I do admit that I have an attitude problem but I don't know why. Most of the time anything I say comes out in a rude tone even though I don't mean to. I immediately apologised for giving a rude attitude as it genuinely wasn't meant to happen. However, I didn't apologise for correcting my sister.

I won't apologise for correcting you and saying our jobs are different. You are a teacher, and most of your hours are spent teaching; the rest is spent marking and doing admin tasks.

"AITA for refusing to get my wife’s car fixed? About 6 years ago, my wife (F48) and I (M51) were expecting our 5th child. As such, we needed to upsize our family car. Being a middle-aged parent with several children, I had accepted the fact that we’d probably buy a minivan or, at the very least, some sort of boring crossover. Unfortunately, my wife wasn’t very receptive to any of these options. Instead, she found this 2013 Mercedes GL that she absolutely fell in love with.

It also made sense on some level to get a car my wife would like since it would double as her personal car in addition to our family car.

In the 6 years we’ve owned this car, it’s been an absolute money pit. It's not an exaggeration when I say that every few months I need to drop thousands of dollars into it just to keep it running. Over the past year, it has caused us so much trouble, in fact, that we don’t even take it on vacations anymore. We just rent a car instead. I am convinced at this point all this car is good for is inducing stress and causing headaches. My wife, on the other hand, still thinks it’s an “adequate car” in her words.

This morning, when I was wrapping up my call shift, I got a call from my wife telling me that her car wouldn’t start. She tried a few times, and our eldest son (M16) tried, and neither of them could get it started. Because of this, I needed to get home right away so that my wife could use my personal car to get our kids to school and go to work.

Once I had my shower and ate some food, I went out to check on the Benz, and of course, it didn’t start. About 20 minutes after checking myself, my wife started texting me, saying that I should probably call our mechanic as we needed the car up and running soon. I messaged her back, saying that I didn’t think getting it fixed would be such a good idea since it would just break down again in a few weeks.

She then called me, saying that I needed to come up with a solution if I didn’t want to get the car fixed, so I told her that we should sell it and try buying something else. She then started talking about how the market isn’t good, how the kids love the car, and that we just need to find a better mechanic.

I told her that the points she brought up didn’t address what has become a long-term problem and that investing more money into the car was a bad idea, and therefore, I could not support that plan. She then told me that I was being argumentative and uncooperative and needed to be less difficult. Before she left as her class was about to start, she told me that ultimately it was her decision to make since it was her car.

AITA?

I had to take a power nap after last night, but I have crunched some numbers.

In the last 18 months, we've spent at least $8327.65 in repairs.

The car's value now is probably around 20-25k, my wife seems to think that the only fair price is +30k",0.17
"AITA for not consistently helping my GF get ready in the morning? My girlfriend and I live together and both start work in the morning. She has to be at an office around 8:30am (short 15 minute driving commute). I work from home and have to start my day at 9:00am at my computer. She's always been frustrated and angry that I'm not as willing to spend more time helping her consistently get ready every morning (help fill up her coffee, water bottle, make a smoothie, pack her lunch bag). I do help, and am glad to help now and then, but try to communicate that she's more running behind, than actually needing help.

She wakes up around 6am, drinks coffee, lays in bed on her phone until around 7am (no judgement, just how she chooses to spend her time), and then leaves herself around an hour to get ready after that. She'll shower, get dressed, makeup, and all the usual morning routine.

I wake up around 7am and start my own routine when I'm out of bed. So we're both up and getting ready around the same time (some days I do sleep in later; when I do, she doesn't bother me or have an issue I'm not helping. Only the mornings that I'm also up anyway).

I'm always glad to be helpful whenever she needs an extra hand now and then, and want to be helpful, but I told her I felt she has an unfair expectation I spend part of my morning (~ 30 minutes total when you add up the random tasks here and there) helping her get out the door each day. Since I work from home, she feels I should be more flexible and more willing to support her. I feel I shouldn't be expected to spend a decent chunk of my morning always helping her, when I have my own routines I'd like to work on before starting my day too (cleaning up in the kitchen, taking care of the dog, a quick workout, breakfast, showering).

I may be the asshole that could just help out and oblige instead of pushing back on the issue. So, AITA?",0.01
"AITA for going to the police because my boundaries weren't respected Hello!

I (35M) got to spend Xmas in the mountains, at a nice hotel. Since I was single, I installed a dating app for the 475356th time and set up the account with the Quick Fun option when it asked me what are you looking for. 

Couple of days later, Maria (25M) matches me and after confirming that both of us are looking for a ONS only, we got together and had our ONS. It was great, because we also got to talk a lot, but we knew this was it, since both of us had to leave back home the next day.

Or so I thought. A couple of days later, she follows me on IG and slides into my DMs. She's telling me she's still remembering our night together. Our conversation. And how she would like one more night together.

I responded about how I enjoyed it too, but all I was looking was a ONS. Just like we agreed before we got together. And I tried to make her understand I wasn't interested in pursuing anything else.

Well, instead of not hearing again from her, she started to send me NFSW pictures and messages. All kind of spicy fantasies. She even found out my number and started to call me. And a couple of days later, even said she's in her car, on her way to my city, so I'd better make sure I'm ready for her.

This is when I started to freak out and went straight to the nearest police station with my lawyer, told them about the situation, and because she kept calling me, the cops were able to hear the conversation and even join. They told her that if she really is on her way to my city, she needs to make a pit stop at the police station, because they are going to open an investigation, and they would like to hear her version of the story as well. Well, guess who closed her phone after that...

The cops went ahead and really opened the investigation and since in our country the phone number is linked to your ID, they were going to find her ASAP and that all things considered, I could even ask for a restraining order. Which I did. 

Only to receive a angry phone call from her after a couple of days, telling me how this could ruin her life. That this is going to be on her permanent record. That she was just having some fun and thought I was just teasing her by saying no.

Thing is, I was kinda happy before this call. But after it, I kinda felt like an AH for potentially ruining her life and thought that maybe going to the police was going too far. But after blocking several of her accounts and phone numbers, what else was I supposed to do?

So, AITA for going to the police because my boundaries weren't respected?",0.31
"AITAH for not providing store-bought bottled water? Over the holidays we entertained a few times, nothing real fancy, just casual family gatherings. My husband's sister only drinks water but refused to drink the water from our reverse osmosis tap that we keep refrigerated-chilled in a glass container. She said something like ""it is inconsiderate to not also offer bottled water like everyone else does because most people don't like city tap water."" Her brother explained to her that our filtered ""tap water"" is probably safer and better tasting than most bottled waters. That led to a ten-minute debate amongst the families about which is preferred, and not everyone agreed with us. FWIW, we provided a choice of either disposable cups or drinking glass because we are aware some people are particular about that. So, are we the  A-holes for not providing bottled water, should we provide bought water next time?",0.12
"AITA for refusing to drive my mother to work? A couple weeks ago, my mother asked me (18m) to drive her to work as she had a Christmas party. I was pissed about the request, since I had to get up earlier, I was unemployed (due to medical reasons) AND especially since 8 months prior, I had 3 seizures and wasn’t able to drive for 6 months. Every time I asked her if she could take me somewhere, she’d always say no because she was “too tired” or “couldn’t be bothered”. So I told her I find it unfair as she never took me anywhere so why should I take her to work? She got pissed at me because she has done “so much” for me and always brings it back to past complications (e.g. when I had a stroke in 2020, I was unable to wipe once finished in the toilet so she and my dad would have to help me and she always goes back to it like “remember who wiped your ass when you couldn’t?” - I didn’t have a fucking choice-). 

So she left it alone for a few hours before coming to me and asking if I was taking her or not so I said “yea I guess” and she said she could always take an Uber, and I repeated that I’d take her. She then proceeded to say that I don’t seem excited/interested in taking her so she can and will take an Uber, so since that seemed to be what she wanted, I said, “okay, take the Uber then,” and she went off at me saying “she’ll remember this next time I need something from her”. I couldn’t fucking win. I said that I’d take her then if she was gonna be all dramatic about it and she accepted so I drove her to work (against my will AND had to pick up her boss too).

She is always been a large girl but more recently, she’s just getting larger and larger. She does not drive even though she has a license and her mother is toxic to her and I think that’s a huge part in who she is today. My friend is getting married who is also her best friend and I am the maid of honor, and I am trying to keep the wedding for my best friend as calm as possible, this friend is instigating herself in the bachelorette party giving un and unwanted opinions and also me and the bride are severely concerned that she’s not gonna fit in the biggest size of the bridesmaids dress. We’ve spoken her multiple times about how she needs to lose weight because we’re scared that she’s going to end up having a heart attack And the brighter at wits end with what to do with her she is the only single one left in the group and all of us live with our significant others. At this point I don’t know what to do but I’d be an asshole for telling her that she needs to check herself before she wrecks herself because she is becoming so toxic and she is just out of line. She is overly insistent that we hang out 1 or more times a week and when we do go out we end up spending an unnecessary amount of money. She does not have to pay rent or anything because she still lives at home. If we want to do something she does not like she will try to get us to change it and if we don’t she makes snide comments the whole time.

"AITA for planning the (wrong) birthday activity for my partner? Throwaway account. 

I’ll try to recount everything in the most objective way, as I understand I can be biased. 

My partner (40f) turned 40 today. To celebrate the occasion, I wanted to do something a bit more special compared to all the previous birthdays, so I decided we would spend the day out (I asked in advance if she wanted to stay in or go out), have lunch, go wherever she wanted to go, and then go to the minigolf at 6pm where my sister and her boyfriend would join us and turn this in a mini surprise birthday party. Nothing crazy, just spending 1 hour together, then get some dessert and be home by about 9pm. 

Before I booked, I asked her if she was fine being out and about from around 1pm, then going at X location for a chill activity at 6pm, and be home by 9pm. I kept it vague, but told her it was something I know she would’ve liked because she mentioned going to the minigolf before (we’ve been together 8 years btw). 

She said ok, so I booked everything. That was on December 29. 

All seemed ok. She seemed excited about the prospect of doing something. This morning I mentioned it again, and she was jokingly trying to find out were we were going. I didn’t want to tell her, and she left it at that. 

Sometime later, she asked me if I could cancel. I said not really because it was already paid and should’ve cancel yesterday to get the money back. Then, thinking it would put her mind at ease, I told her where we were going, and that my sister and her boyfriend would join us. 

It went downhill from there. 

She said I ruined her birthday, that she couldn’t do anything in the morning because of me (I was working from home until 12pm), that her nan couldn’t visit (I told her she could and I would’ve worked in the bedroom), that she already told her nan she couldn’t visit because I was working so she couldn’t backtrack now (I said she could’ve said “nevermind, OP said it’s ok she will be in the other room). She said I booked it too far away, that it was too late (she’s not working tomorrow), that I should’ve booked it closer to home, that I wasn’t thinking about her, and some more. 

I ended up cancelling saying that my partner was ill so today was cancelled. 

Some time late I go in the bedroom where she is crying to apologise. It was not my intention to hurt her, i was trying to do something nice and it backfired. I asked if she wanted to still go out and have a meal together, wherever she wanted. 

I tried to hug her and she shrugged me off, saying that she is too hurt by this, that her day is forever ruined, she said “how do we come back from this?”, and that she will not accept my apology, that she won’t be submissive. 

At that point I got annoyed again because yes, I made a mistake, but it was not done with the intention to cause harm, and I think it’s unfair to be treated like I did some unspeakable thing instead of a poorly planned birthday.

"AITA for insisting my depressed partner help me search for a place to live? I(35 F) and my partner(33 M) just moved to New York City from California. We’ve been crashing in a furnished rental that’s up in 5 weeks, so the clock is starting to tick on finding an apartment to live in. 

I’ve lived in NY before and explained to him that the rental market is intense and moves very quickly. I’ve been sending him listings I find, and he replies, “I’ll look at them in a few days.” I told him that won’t work- they’ll be rented by then. We need to prioritize apartment hunting and I need his help. I work remotely so I said I’ll go see the places if he can’t get away, but he has to at least read the listings and tell me what he thinks- it’s an apartment for both of us to live in. He said it’s too fast paced and upsetting for him to handle- I told him I didn’t make it that way, New York did. And I also wanted to see the listings he found, too, since he hadn’t been sending me any- and he got really upset and said he doesn’t know how to find apartments online! 

He’s a fully employed adult man who works in tech and has a masters degree, who has lived in multiple cities and states before in different apartments. I got super pissed and told him I need his help and I’m sick of doing all the work to find us a place to live.

He responded by saying that’s what abusers say- that they’re doing all the work in a relationship. I looked it up and that’s true, abusers do say that. If I ever get impatient or upset with him, he takes it so hard I can’t even tell if I’m justified or not. I definitely don’t want to be abusive, but I don’t think I’m being unreasonable insisting my partner help me and just accept that for a few weeks, he’s gonna have to adapt to a stressful apartment hunt. And to help me. He was really stoked to move to New York together and that’s just an aspect of life here. 

Additional context, he’s struggled with chronic depression for years, and I understand that. But he’s functional in daily life unless he doesn’t feel like doing something, and then he’ll melt down. He’s been like that since I’ve known him, and I had to plan almost every logistical aspect of our move, for example- which I also didn’t appreciate, but I tried to be understanding. I get feeling that way! He can’t control his feelings… but if he can show up for work every single day and be a great employee, AITA for asking for help in our living situation?


Edit: I really appreciate everyone’s feedback. You’ve given me a lot to think about re: the situation, myself, and relationship overall. Thank you. ",0.08
"AITA for suggesting to another soccer mom to remove her daughter from our team? I will start by saying as parents we should be able to gage our children's abilities and what programs are the best fit for them. We play on a competitive recreational indoor soccer league (during our non parks and rec off season). The Parks and Rec in our area offer two different forms of indoor soccer ""social"" being the least competitive and more about having a good time, being laid back & learning at a slower pace and  ""competitive""... self explanatory. Our kids are 9-10 yrs old and really want to win! These girls fight hard and truly give it their all. 

One player on the team literally just runs around flailing her arms in the air. She does not know the rules of the game. She will drop to the ground on field and start throwing a fit if the other team scores a goal. Screaming ""we're going to lose!"". It's such a distraction to all of the players on the team. And even the opposing team gets so confused. They have her in the defender box most of the time and when it's time to defend and match up she shakes her hands in the other kids face or just runs the opposite direction. It's just hard to watch as a parent. Also a factor in this is we pay a few hundred in fees every season and some of us help sponsor as well. So we are invested in being competitive. This isn't professional soccer lol but we still take it pretty serious. 

I spoke with her mother recently who just laughed and giggled about the girls behavior. Calling it ""cute"" and how she's just having a good time out there. I did not pry into her medical history because that's none of my business. But the mom voluntarily shared that her daughter had ADHD and was thinking about medications. Personally I think there is something else going on with the kid, but again that part is none of my biz! I then suggested to the mom maybe the social league would be a better fit for her daughter, that what she was doing on the field and during practice was so distracting and counterproductive. That it was detrimental to the team and our chances of even making the playoffs. She snapped at me hardcore and said this is ""just little kids sports"" and it shouldn't matter at all to ""keep my fucking thoughts to myself"". Also that she won't go to the social league and how dare I even approach her with my opinion. Am I the asshole here??

He has so much time since his current job never gives him work and he works from home. His current job has lowered his confidence and I just want him to find something that would bring it back. He’s EXTREMELY intelligent (many people think he is the smartest person they know) but his lack of confidence holds him back for exploring things that might be challenging. He is mad that I’m pushing this so much but I really don’t see why it’s that bad - he could interview with them and THEN decide it’s not for him. Then I would totally understand. Or he interviews and realizes he DOES like the job - in my view, there are only upsides to applying/interviewing. Maybe it’s because I am less scared of rejection and don’t mind interviewing? So maybe someone who hates interviewing could give me a different standpoint. He says he could find a better job but he hasn’t started applying. But then when I bring that up he talks poorly about himself which I really don’t like. The main thing is I want him to get his confidence back but idk the best way for that to happen.",0.4
"AITA for not wanting to take people off my wedding guest list? 
My fiance and I got engaged in June and made our guest list before booking our venue in July. We asked both sets of parents (before we booked the venue) to please contribute and add anyone to the guest list that we missed/that they wanted to invite. His mom added some family, and my mom didn’t add anyone, saying that I could choose who I want to come. We ended up with 175 people on our guest list, and the capacity of the venue we chose is 150, but because we have a lot of out of state friends and family that we knew couldn’t make it, we were comfortable with this number. 
Our wedding is in March. I’m working on sending out invites right now, and only have 25 left to do. 

A few weeks ago, my fiancé’s mom informed us that she was going to add people to the guest list, including friends of hers and extended family that my fiance didn’t even recognize by name. I’m feeling quite frustrated because I asked her multiple times to add people and to make sure the numbers on the list were correct before we even booked the venue. I had ordered extra invitations to have just in case, but I had to order more stamps and seals for these extra invites. Our guest list went up to over 250. I am incredibly stressed about this, and I expressed this to my fiancé’s mom. She told me that she is stressed about it too, and that I need to take people off my list because I have more people invited than my fiance does. This is because my mom has lots of siblings and I have a bigger family than my fiance. We have invited the same number of friends, I just have a bit more family invited than him. 

But now his mom is telling me to take people off my list because that’s what is fair. I am so frustrated, and I’ve tried to trim down my list but can’t take off anyone else without feeling very sad about it, because all of the people I’m inviting are people that are important to me. Meanwhile, my fiance doesn’t even know some of the people his mom added to the list….

My fiancé’s parents are funding 90% of our wedding, and thus, I have a much harder time saying no or standing up to his mom… but I feel like it was so inconsiderate of her to 
1) add so many people MONTHS after the guest list was finalized and venue was booked 
2) add so many people after stationary was ordered 
3) tell me that I need to take people off my list after I already addressed and stamped all their invites and planned to send them out today
4) tell me I have to take people off when these people are people who I’ve been close to for my whole life, while she has invited friends and extended family that my fiance doesn’t even know.

"AITA for not wanting to do a movie night with my bf until we watch a movie I picked? This really is a minor argument, but I'll post here anyway. I (23f) have been dating this guy (28m) for about 6 months. Let's call him Jake. 

We spend quite a lot of time together, and we both enjoy that time. Problem is, we only really listen to / play / watch what he wants. In the beginning I didn't mind, but when I suggest watching something I want to watch he'll say ""if you want to watch X we should watch Y; you'll love it!"". Okay, tried that for a while. Then I started suggesting again, and he's still not open to it. It's not a genre / taste issue, we often like similar movies, he just always wants to pick what to watch. 

So I told him I like the movies we watched (most of them) but I'd also like to choose sometimes, or we can just not watch a movie and do something else instead.

Now he is hurt and angry with me because he bought that ring out of love and he can't believe that I'm not satisfied even though I've been telling him for 8 years that I want something nice and not something small given that the size of the diamond is not large, money was really not a problem.",0.87

"AITA for not wanting my mom to leave me alone with my alcoholic brother for 15 days? Hi everyone, I'm a 23 year old woman with a 48 year old brother who's an alcoholic, and a 68 years old mom.   
  
My relationship with him began to strain when he began stealing valuable items from our house to throw parties at his then home. My mom would go crazy about it for like a day and then forget about it on the next. This dismissal made his actions escalate, which resulted in him stealing and selling my video game console, something he still jokes about and shows no regret towards.  
  
I was furious. This time my mom attempted to actually make him pay, but he was now unable to make money because he'd lost his job. His gf kicked him out, so he had to come back to living with us. To this day he still hasn't tried to get another job, my guess is that he became depressed and turned to alcohol which worsened his behaviors such as lying, stealing, being highly unhygienic, etc.   
  
He constantly wakes up drunk, pisses in a random corner of the house, or manages to get to the bathroom but doesn't reach the toilet. Even when sober his hygiene is poor, and I'm not talking about body hygiene because I know that's hard to keep in check while depressed, but things like throwing a plate full of food into the sink and making the counter nasty, spilling stuff and using a random, small decorative carpet to cover or clean it, or just leaving it there.

Recently she was away for 3 days and I was home alone with him and experienced everything I just told you. I barely got any sleep. He'd leave randomly at 3am and leave the door hanging open, knowing we live in a dangerous neighborhood and have had break-ins before.   
  
I told my mom about all of this and she said she wasn't going to stop living her life because of him. I told her I was prevented from living mine. She said I'm the one who's preventing myself from living, I could've gone with her on vacation if I wanted to, but she KNOWS that I can't. I don't know if my stuff will be here when I come back (I always lock my bedroom when I leave the house, but leaving it for 3 whole days is crazy, I'm pretty sure he'd break in. I used to sleep with my door unlocked until the day I woke up to him looking through my desk). There's also my cats which he's threatened to hurt before.   
  
My mom HERSELF locks her own bedroom when she leaves so she doesn't trust him either but she expects me to.  
  
I understand that she's old and she deserves to go out and have fun. But I can't stand being unable to live. I can't eat because the kitchen is always a mess to the point it depresses me. I can't shower because there's piss everywhere and the bathroom is so dirty it's disgusting. I can't sleep because I'm paranoid he'll steal or leave the house's door open during midnight.   
  
He's not my responsibility. I feel selfish because I do want my mom to live the rest of her life peacefully, but I want to live mine too. AITA? ",0.01
"AITA for not wanting my mom to remarry on my birthday? (or the week of) background info: Okay so me (19f) and my mom (52F) have been living with her boyfriend (50m) of two years for about a year now. He’s very kind to her and protective of her interests and wants only for her to be happy. But he can be extremely belittling about different opinions & is “all about respect” but only for others his age. Because of this, i’m not super crazy about him. Anyways. He proposed on christmas when i wasnt home, he didn’t ask me how i feel about it, (previously when my mom got proposed to, the man asked me if i was okay with it, explained what it would mean for our families, the whole deal, very kind actually) and said they plan to get married in late ‘month’. It’s because it’s when he won’t be busy because of work, but it’s also the week of my birthday. I have quite strong feelings about my birthday because my mom and i have a volatile relationship and she never respects my wishes for how i plan to celebrate (i.e inviting my distant relatives over after i work an 8hr shift, making the only fucking thing im allergic to, etc) So i asked them not to do it that week. It’s the only thing i ask. No complaints or requests on food, attire, music, anything. But now my mom says i hurt her fiancé’s feelings because of my request and that i should seriously reconsider & apologize.
TLDR: My mom wants to remarry a guy i’m not crazy about the week of my birthday and I have to let them or he’ll be upset. AITA?
- its a home wedding
- nothing has been set in stone. they told me they wanted to get married “around then” 
-even though i’m not crazy about him, it doesn’t mean i hate him, or don’t want to like him. 

very quick update: you guys think i’m a narc so i’m going to apologize. have a good day! ",0.35
"AITA for not letting my mom move in with me? For context: we're not from the US.

My (23F) parents' marriage (52F & 62M) have always been utterly toxic. She married him because she was homeless and wanted a family. Previous to my birth, he was total piece of crap to her and my siblings, and I know for sure some crimes were commited on his behalf during that time. After I was born, he got better.

My mother is very much toxic with me and my siblings. She calls us names, heavily criticizes our friends and relationships, tells we're ""cursed to be a failure"" because of dad, says that nobody likes her because ""people can't handle her showing them the truth about themselves"" and simply cannot addmit she's done anything wrong, unless it was somehow somebody else's fault. Today all of us are at universities halfway throught the major or almost finishing it. None of us is really close to our dad.

Their relationship is insufferable nowadays, beyond saving. They're living alone in our hometown ever since I moved. She has panick attacks everyday. They fight daily. They plan on getting a divorce as soon as the money lets, which would be when I graduate in 2026. My dad will move out then. I have no reason to not believe him, althought my mother doesn't.

My mother wants my dad to leave, but we can't afford another rent. The only option is for her to move into my small apartment in another state where I'm studying until I graduate. I reluctantly agreed, thinking it would help her, but it will be a burden for me. When she stayed with me before, it was tough. It also strained my 2-year long-distance relationship with my boyfriend (21M). She interrupted our calls and criticized us, which made me fight with her often.

My boyfriend lives in my hometown, and I stay with him every weekend. He's used to seeing his partner daily from past relationships, and our limited calls are tough for him. He despises my mother for her mistreatment of me. He feels foolish for sympathizing with her treatment towards me, only for me to let her interfere in our lives. He's upset, and I fear letting my mother move in would lead to a breakup. Friends agree, saying my parents are adults, and I can't save them.

I decided to prioritize my life, studies and relationship. Told my mother I thought it would best if she didn't move in with me. She got upset, said how ""every time parents get divorced the the children choose one to forsake"". I feel guilty because she's suffering and she's my mom, but I think she can improve her own life without disrupting mine. She said if she does anything to my dad, it'll be my fault. College is already difficult for me and I value my relationship too much to let it end this way. AITA?

TL;DR: My abusive mom is having panick attacks everyday because of my abusive dad, she wants to move in with me, that would make my life hell and probably end my relationship with my boyfriend, so I refused and now she's upset.",0.04
"AITA for Trying to Use the Oven at the Same Time My boyfriend (37, M) went to put a pizza in the oven for lunch. As I was about to start putting together my lunch as well - I (32, F) asked what temperature the oven was set to, was told 400 degrees and responded “great, I can throw my asparagus in there too”. 

He then gets upset with me and goes on a rant about how I always want to get in the way whenever he goes to do something that reminds me of something I need to do and that this is inconsiderate & rude. I just quietly said okay and listened - I’m used to ovens being shared/cooking multiple things in them. He continues to tell me that this would be rude and would get in his way as it would make his food take longer to cook and that this is an example of my family’s dysfunction. I grew up in a family of 6 and am very used to sharing space and trying to accommodate everyone’s needs. He did not - he grew up in a family where everybody had to wait their turn and seemingly spaces were never truly shared, even with siblings. I’ve never encountered someone being upset by somebody wanting to use the oven at the same time as them unless they were baking something finicky and complex - is this inconsiderate request?

"AITA For yelling at my friend and calling her dumb over miscommunication? My (F16) friends (both F16) and I got off of school about 3 weeks ago for winter break to celebrate with our family’s. In that time, most of us really had nothing to do, so last night we decided to make plans to hang out. (Mind you, today is our last day before we go back to school)  We started talking about what we were going to do, and we decided to go to our local arcade. So, I asked my dad if he could give me a ride, and he said no because he had work. So my friend, I’ll call her Sarah, offered to drive me there. I was super excited because I hadn’t really had a get together with my old trio (mainly because we have a big friend group), so I really wanted to make good of our last day of having no school. So, after a little bit of talking, we decided that me and Sarah were going to drive to (I’ll call other friend Mandy) Mandy’s house, at 1 pm. 

So today, when I woke up, I texted Sarah, in our group chat with Mandy in it, and asked Sarah when she will pick me up. Sarah then says that the arcade actually opened at  3 pm. Mind you, Mandy said we can come over anytime, so that would’ve been fine if we stayed at Mandy’s house, then walked to the arcade. Then Sarah says that her dad (my ride) has a doctors appointment, and she was hanging out with her cousins today, so she didn’t know if we could go. I asked her why we couldn’t go still later, and she said that it was because she wanted to hang with her cousins. She was also saying it in a very bitchy tone, and added question marks and skull faces when I asked questions. 

After a tone of back and forth arguing (I’ll save you from that part) of pretty much just me asking why she made plans with us when she already had plans, and her saying it wasn’t her fault and we should’ve planned it better etc. I basically just told her that next time don’t make plans with us if she had plans already, and to next time communicate with us so it won’t happen again. Now on to the good part. I told her that if she knew she was hanging out with her cousins, to maybe say something like “Hey guys, so my cousins are in town, and I don’t see them a lot, so maybe we can reschedule our plans for another time?”. And she said after “ so you want me to reschedule my plans with my cousins to hang out with you??” So I said “are you fucking dumb”. Yes, that was messed up for me to say, but she wasn’t hearing me out, and she was playing the victim and saying that I was just blaming and attacking her. 

Also, Mandy was sleeping the whole time so she wasn’t even awake when we were fighting.

"AITA For yelling at my friends and calling them monsters for making fun of my best friend? I (16M) am best friends with Julie (16F) for almost a year now, we are extreamly close and we talk to eachother about everything almost every day, I enjoy talking to her alot and she seems to enjoy spending time with me aswell.

We dont go to the same school so she knows none of my friends from school and i wanted to introduce her to some of them. I got my friends Conner and Alessandro (both 15M) to meet her one night and we all hungout together. I was pretty hesitant to introduce them to Julie because they are pretty aggressive and say many rude things towards others and I didnt want to possibly lose my friendship with Julie because of them. I told Julie about them and she didnt mind saying ""Whats the worst they could do?"" I kinda agreed and I planned the meet up.

We were all having a good time at first, playing games, making jokes and such. everything was going good until Julie kept making the same joke over and over (She does that alot) and Conner and Alessando clearly didnt like that so and got more and more angry.

Conner ends up snapping and yells at Julie ""SHUT TF UP ALREADY"" Alessandro followed this by saying something absolutely disgusting but I dont think im allowed to say it on reddit. Julie clearly got uneasy and left the room to go to the bathroom. thats when I snapped at them both and yelled at them back, Calling them both fucking monsters for saying that to her and they should think about what they say before they actually say it. as I was yelling at them Julie went home and i followed her. I apologized a millon times for their behavior. she thankfuly accepted my apology and said she never wants to see them again. I agreed with her and we both walked home.

The next day I went to school as it was first day back from winter break. I was still upset about what happened the night before and I was expecting an apology from both Connor and Alessandro when I got to school. Instaid almost all my friends against me calling me a ""simp"" and such Just for protecting Julie. I obviously protested and told them all what Connor and Alessandro said but they didnt care, only one of my friends was backing me up and saying i did a good thing to tell them off because they shouldnt have said those things to her in the first place.

But almost all of my friends seem to disagree with me for yelling at them. AITA?

"AITA for telling my husband that I will no longer participate in family vacations if his ex is present? Here's the background:

While on a study abroad, my husband ""Robert"" got his foreign girlfriend ""Elizabeth"" pregnant. Their relationship was rocky and they've been broken up since Tim was about 1. I met Robert when their son ""Tim"" was 3 years old, Robert and I have now been together 13 years.

When I met Robert he was upfront that Tim always comes first and unfortunately is a package deal with Elizabeth until Tim is old enough for solo international travel - this was 'unfortunate' because at that time Robert and Elizabeth hated each other. My parents-in-law have always paid for plane tickets for Elizabeth and Tim to visit. Elizabeth and Tim usually visit for 2-3 weeks every year. Robert always requested my presence for these visits, to build a relationship with Tim and (at least the first few years)  for moral support dealing with Elizabeth.

Elizabeth has (mostly) been nice to me although it's very superficial - we are not friends. She's fine with the in-laws, because they're very nice people who just want a relationship with their grandson and would never jeopardize that access. Robert and Elizabeth's relationship gradually improved, and by the time Tim was 7 they were on friendly terms.

Being required to spend 2-3 weeks every year staying in the same house as my husband's ex has always been at minimum uncomfortable for me, at times extremely difficult and painful. But I tolerated it without complaint, without fully expressing how hard it was, because I felt that my main 'job' here is to support Robert. I've been holding out for the goalpost Robert identified early on, that when Tim is old enough to travel alone, presumably Elizabeth will no longer come with.

Well, that time has arrived. Tim is 16, traveled alone to visit last summer and it was awesome. However Elizabeth said she wants to come visit again this year, and continue doing so every other year (no end date stated). My parents-in-law will never stop paying for plane tickets and never suggest Elizabeth not come - in fact 2 years ago, prior to Tim's first solo trip, they assured Elizabeth that she is ALWAYS welcome even after Tim is an adult, that she is family too. Statements/events like that have amounted to 'death by a thousand cuts' in which I've been experiencing serious depression surrounding Elizabeth's visits. I feel like that goalpost I was holding out for...has vanished entirely.

So I told Robert that I will no longer be present for the full 'family' vacations when Elizabeth comes, I will hang out for one or two weekends only (he knows I'm fully on board with vacations that do not include Elizabeth though). He is hurt, says my lack of presence shows everyone (including Tim) that I don't care. I say that a step-mother cannot form a relationship with a step-child *when the mother is present* anyway, and these visits are causing me extreme emotional distress so it's time I take care of myself (because no one else is considering my emotions here).

"AITA for being cold to my brother? I (16f) have a twin brother, and there's this girl he really likes that I've helped him get to know. A hangout with my best friend landed at the same time and place that his first date with her did, so I pretended to be sick to not be a third-wheel. I acted as a kind of waitress when they hung out at the house. I tagged along with him to the public pool, not knowing she would surprise him there with plans to hang out all over town. I didn't want to ruin it by having them drive me home, so I walked home in my bikini. One day she was hanging out, but could not get home due to icy roads, so I let her stay in my bed in my comfiest pajamas.

They're a pretty established ""thing"" now, so I feel like I did my part. I recently met a boy, and I invited him to bake cookies at my place. I asked my brother if he could go elsewhere for the evening, and he said he had to practice clarinet with friends for a good while. I didn't want the house to feel crowded, so I went to a diner with the boy instead. He didn't have any money, so I paid.

He went to the bathroom and didn't come back.

I've been absent-mindedly treating my brother rather coldly for a few days now. 

He said ""Look, I don't know what's eating at you, and I feel like you're being an asshole for no reason right now. I'm just not gonna talk to you until you deal with this, okay?""

"AITA for lowering the temperature to 72 So things are bias in my favor, as you likely already know because other person (grandma) cant defend herself here.

Me and my grandma, G for short have been fighting over the thermostat. Its winter where i am and temperatures can be very cold. She likes it warm and i prefer it more cold. The house is hers and i pay the electric (i have not and will not use this against her in any conversations i have with her). She prefers having the house at 78 degrees which is quite warm for me, so much so that i had to sleep in my car 4 days ago as i was sweating without moving trying to sleep. Yesterday i had lowered the temperature to 72 so i could sleep. I let her know while she was at work (night shift). I had 2 cold waters and snuggled up to sleep. 
When she got home this was our conversation

G: Remove blanket when ur sleeping and I have a thought close ur vents and open ur window then you will get the cold air you need.

Me: I lowered the temperature to be more comfortable, and had 2 waters

G: You can make ur bedroom into an icebox so you can sleep open window, close vents, & close ur bedroom door. But don’t forget (brother), his immune system is weaker than urs. It got 32 degrees this morning is that cold enough?

I can’t take a shower cause if I do my metabolism will drop and I will freeze all day until I can get it back up, and n the meantime the house chores don’t get done, if I’m stuck n my bedroom.

Me: Because i lowered the temperature to 72?

G: Yes 72 is too low, for me, when you get to b my age you won’t want to have the temperature at 72. Most people have it at 75. 

Me: So to recap just to be certain you know what your saying. 6 degress is the difference between being comfortable, and it being too cold to take a shower, it drops your metabolism, and sticks you to your room all day? And be 6 degrees, in your words, 3 less than “most people?”

G: The 75 is for people that have good circulation so they don’t get too cold, I on the other hand have to have it higher cause my circulation is poor, and I was trying to b reasonable with the temperature between 77 and 78.

I plan on moving out because of this which i know will start a fight with more family. I rarely eat food she buys or get in her way, my leaving will be a financial burden on her and emotional burden on mom (maybe brother).

Adam was diagnosed with a terminal illness and he confessed that he had an an affair with an ex coworker a few years back and he begged me not to tell Sean. I struggled with this as I loved Adam and wanted to be there for him in his final weeks but I felt he had betrayed me and was only coming clean as he felt guilty. We had a very complicated relationship, but I made sure Sean never noticed anything different, as he had important exams and was already upset with Adam’s diagnosis.

"AITA for ignoring my neighbour's noise complaint? Our neighbour has been knocking on the wall between our houses angrily during daytime/early nighttime (i.e. 8-9 pm) to express their anger. However, according to local laws, there is only a legal requirement for keeping noise lower than 34db from 11 pm-7 am. They have also complained about our housemates' snoozing alarms, which we were slightly baffled about. Mind you our alarms are at normal phone volume, it is likely due to us sharing a wall and because of this, we can hear their muffled talking too. 

They knock loudly and shout angrily in obscene language whenever we laugh louder (which is bursts of laughter that are particularly loud, they won't go on constantly). They also knocked, spammed our doorbell and shouted at our door protesting our celebrations on Christmas and New Year's Eve (all complaints before 11 pm), but we still continued with our celebrations. All housemates and those invited are aware of the local laws and stay quiet after 11 pm to avoid legal problems. 

I felt like it was only on special occasions that we would have large gatherings, and also our noise was usually bursts of laughter. They themselves would shout in their house angrily, blast music in their room and talk loudly on the phone which we could hear, but we did not bother with that because it was all still before 11 pm, which we felt was none of our business to complain about. They would also scold each other and sometimes cause their dog to wail after 11 pm, to which we would knock the wall back at them to show our discontent, but it is also because they did this to us before 11 pm and we are not happy with how they behaved and their actions sometimes made us feel threatened. Had they not done that to us I feel that we would not even bother. 

We just felt like it was weird how they seemed to complain to us about noises that did not breach the law at all, and it seems they do not feel the same about us as we do towards their noises. Are we the assholes for ignoring their complaints?",0.17
"AITA for not wanting to return 2 gifts I gave my roommate for Xmas? So for Christmas last year, my roommate gave me, as part of my gift, a set of travel silverware with a little roll-up pouch. Unfortunately, I already had one set exactly like this, except a different color. So after Xmas, I asked her if I could get the receipt to exchange it. She said she didn't keep the receipt and that was the end of it. She didn't mention where she got it or offer to help return it. So I let it go.

This year, I ended up getting her 2 books that were duplicates. One she had already been gifted by her boyfriend and was an easy Amazon return to take back to Kohl's, so I swapped it for the next book in the same series. Easy peasy. The other she had actually ordered another copy for herself, because she forgot I mentioned one of her gifts would be late because I ordered it from an independent Amazon seller and they estimated shipping Dec 27-31.

only issue is my mom is extremely against this. she's saying things like ""it's not yours to sell"" and that I'm being ungrateful. she's especially angry I think because I'm saving up for gender affirming surgery and she knows that some of the car money will go to that, if possible. she thinks this is disrespectful to my godmother's memory (I came out after she passed). my dad passed away a few months before my godmother, and my mom isn't this protective of my dad's stuff at ALL. i don't understand why it's different here.

"AITA for wanting to WFH more often? So long story short. I have a chronic illness, it's never going away.  Since covid has happened obviously a lot more companies are open to wfh.  Current set up is 2 days wfh 3 days in office. I was told by the recruiter that they expect it to be moving to 3 days wfh, but that never happened. I also was open about my illness with my employer before I accepted the job, so it's not like this was a shock. I have also exhausted every treatment option. It's at the point where they have even tried to put what is essentially pacemaker in my bladder, and that didn't even fix it.

Due to my chronic illness, I request to work from home more than 2 days a week. It usually ends up being a couple extra days a month. I try my best to come in but due to my chronic illness it's a lot harder for me on days I have flares, I technically could push myself to come in but its very uncomfortable and I'm in pain, I can still do work, as I work a desk job, but driving to the office, and back and sitting in pain just to stare at a computer screen all day seems unreasonable 

When I let my boss know im having a flare, they often just try to push me to use my sick leave and not wfh on the 3 office days, which if it wasn't a CHRONIC illness that would be fine, it's just unrealistic as this is chronic, and incurable, so if I used sick days everytime. I would likely not have enough sick days to cover it.

"AITA for giving one son more inheritance My spouse and I have two sons. We were discussing changing our wills with some new developments and had some negative feedback from friends. Is what we’re considering ok?


My younger son married his college sweetheart. They have three kids with a forth on the way. His wife’s family is extremely poor and have never been able to help financially. We cover quite a bit since there’s no help from one side. She also has multiple siblings and whatever is left in her parents estate is being split among them all. It will likely be very little.


My older son’s wife’s family is of equal (if not more) wealth to us and provide for their daughter without hesitation. As such we have not given them much help since it was never needed. This DIL is not only an only child but the single member of her family in that generation. She is set to inherit from a half dozen estates as the last living relative. They also do not plan on having children. 


Our wills, written before either was married, were originally equal splits. With how things have gone we feel we should leave the majority to our younger. They will get next to nothing from his wife’s family and have children of their own to support. My older son will inherit more than enough from his wife’s side to equal out.

"AITA For Saying No To His Trip To Jamaica? We’ve been together for 9 years and have traveled once together for the weekend to a neighboring state 2 hours away. I paid for that trip because his money went towards all the bills and I saved what I could to go on that trip. Fast forward to the present day and we both finally have better jobs and are almost out of poverty. The plan we agreed on last year was to save money and purchase a new home for our large family. We were going to keep our current home and fix it up to either sell or rent out. 

Our current house is slowly falling apart and I’ve paid for almost everything that needed to be fixed. He pays the mortgage, his car, his credit cards, and utility bill. Finances has always been his weak spot and I’m fed up as I’ve been fixing bills he couldn’t pay and/or paying for everything else and got us to where we are now. He makes $10 more than me and just spends money on everything he wants and refuses to talk about finances with me. I only separate our expenses because he has never wanted to combine them or talk to me about money.

I found out right before our parental leave that he didn’t save anything. Instead he went on a trip to Florida, Illinois, and New York for his business idea while on parental leave. 

A few days ago he tells me that he needs to tell me all the stuff he has planned this year. He has another trip for his business planned and a then trip to 6 day trip to Jamaica for his friend’s wedding anniversary. It costs thousands and he’s doing a payment plan, he already agreed to go and made the first payment. I’m just angry about everything and this feels like my last straw with everything else I deal with in our relationship. 

WE haven’t been anywhere nice like that together, we were supposed to be saving for our house, that money could buy new furniture in our house, that money is enough for a few vacations, there will be couples going so why does he want to go alone?! He claims I wouldn’t have fun because they’re doing activities like zip lining and that he figured I wouldn’t want to spend thousands to go. 

He said it’s his life and I’m being controlling and that he’s making enough money to where he can pay for this trip and everything else, including my expenses. He said the children are stopping us from traveling together but if I plan it, he’ll go. I told him if he goes then I’m done with our relationship. But I feel guilty because it is his life- I want him to go and have fun and not hold it over my head that I didn’t let him go. AITA?",0.02
"AITA for killing a mouse in my moms house even if she said not to? I (18M) am visiting my mom back from college for the break. There has been a mouse inside our house that creeps through corners and always enters in the middle of the night when we are sleeping. Right now it’s just my mom and I living in the house. Mice come every winter in our yard but they have never constantly come inside the house.

It is possible to hear the mouse during night time, but it only comes out during late hours. She has tried blocking the holes from where it could come from with a type of cloth, but every morning the cloth is torn and nibbled through. I told her that I am going to kill it with a mouse trap, as every morning it leaves droppings in random areas. I didn’t notice any food being eaten, but it was better to be safe then sorry. She then told me not to. I kept asking her why and she said she doesn’t want dead animals in the house. She is also very religious and doesn’t like the idea of killing any animals. 

I got sick of this mouse making noise every night and our pit bull would get very startled as well. I decided I’ll just sneak and put the trap anyway. I ended up buying an insta kill trap and I put it in the middle of the night. 

Now I should note that this trap is relatively loud, but I underestimated how loud it would really be. Around 3AM two days ago, I heard a loud “CLACK”, and it was loud enough to wake everyone up. My mom then saw what happened and wasn’t happy about the whole thing. She claimed that the issue wasn’t with the mouse, but the fact that I just decided to go and buy one regardless of her saying not to. I felt that in this situation, the mouse just needed to be killed. For the past two days there have been no droppings and our dog is sleeping well.",0.47
AITA for yelling at my 7 yr old sis? I 16 M and my sister 18 F were both abused by our step father when we were younger. I moved in with my grandmother and grandfather as my mother was addicted to drugs and never there. this was around when i was 10 and my sister was 12 and my younger sister was just turning one years old. My younger sister 7 F still does not know as she is young. The abuser is my younger sister’s biological father. My grandparents still arrange phone calls with the abuser as he is still her father. A year or so back my older sister moved out to start her life. A few weeks back my little sister was on the phone with him in the front room. I was sitting across the room when my little sister told me to come say hello to her father. I told her no several times and she kept pressuring me and then i just screamed at her to leave me alone and went to my room.,0.29
"AITA for wanting to rehome the family dog? 
Throwaway bc my personal has my real identity.

For starters: I [29F] moved back in with my family (Mom, stepdad, and my bedridden grandma) when I was pregnant. Long story short about that situation, my BD ended up being an abusive deadbeat. My child is almost 2 & taking care of him is mentally taxing obvs. Ever since I gave birth, the attention has primarily focused on my child, from all of us. 

That being said, the family dog [4M, if it matters] has pretty much been on the backburner. He is actually supposed to be my sister’s [20F] dog, they got him when she was in high school during the pandemic. I wasn’t living here then. Now she’s in college states away. When she comes back home (during winter & summer break, and occasionally during other holidays) she takes care of him, but returns back without him. Dogs aren’t allowed in the campus dorm rooms. My stepdad doesn’t like dogs, and my grandma is bedridden. So that leaves me & my mom to take care of him. 

I should mention that he is untrained & my mom has been trying to “train” him for years now, to no avail. He poops in the house, tears things up he even bites sometimes, etc. My mom keeps him in a crate in my sister’s room next to my room (alone, since my sister doesn’t live here), or she leaves him out on the covered deck in warmer seasons. She occasionally walks him. So most of the day/night he is kept in the crate and whines all the time very loudly bc he is obviously very lonely and in need of energy to expel for about 20 hours total. I work from home so I hear him constantly.

Mom works in an office, I work fully remote. My mom leaves for work around 8am and usually gets back around 7pm. It starts to make me feel terrible for not helping, but I just really don’t mentally have the spoons to take care of an untrained small dog who chews on underwear in the laundry basket and digs through my trash. Not to mention I can’t have him around my son for too long bc sometimes he bites, and when my child isn’t in daycare he’s p much always with me. 

Also: my sister had a previous dog, back when she was in middle school, but she was too busy with her multiple sports and obligations so they rehomed him. She plays a competitive sport in college and can’t go home often. She told me she will keep going there for her masters. I asked my mom & her when she’s gonna bring him with her when she graduates, and they got defensive and said he’s fine here. When I suggested rehoming him, they said no. 

This morning my mom said not to take him out at all, and I’m at my wits end bc neither of them are here throughout the day, but I feel terrible bc I *could* help more by walking him more or something but I simply just mentally can’t watch a dog who is so unpredictable bc he is anxious and probably neglected, but my mom insists he’s fine and not to “mess with his schedule”. 

So, AITA for not wanting to take care of the family dog?",0.34
"AITA for bullying my friend? AITA for bullying my friend?

This isn't something particularly big but I would genuinely like some feedback on my behaviour and whether my feelings are justified..

For context, I, M14 moved schools about 4 years ago. Even though I moved most of my very close friends still attend my old school and I have had quite a hard time socialising in my new school. Despite this I feel like we have done a good job of maintaining a good friendship and I am still part of their friendship group. 

However recently, a series of events played out it in this order:
It's almost the end of the holidays and I haven't seen any of my friends in a while so I ask each of my 3 closest friends if they are free and they all tell me no they are busy, without context.
It gets later in the day and I get online onto a videogame. One of the friends I asked is online. It turns out he is meeting one of the other friends I asked, but I just assume he can only accommodate one person or whatever. Because the other friend doesn't play many videogames, the three of us have a good time for a while messing about when all of a sudden my friend goes silent. I ask the other friend on text what happened, he says that the mic wont unmute and he refuses when i ask to call. A few minutes of silent gameplay go by when all of a sudden my friend unmutes for a second to say ""his sister will be playing"" which is a blatant lie as his sister doesnt ever play the game. I eventually just quit the game out of upset. At the moment i am in a very rough point of my life because of my parents divorce and often feel extremely lonely. After i quit the game I broke down crying.

The next day the friend is once again online, and i join him in game. When I ask him what happened he is extremely hesitant to tell me but he eventually does. All three of the friends had made plans and stayed at his house. At the point that he muted, the third friend arrived. According to him, they didnt tell me because they didnt want to hurt my feelings and they were muted because they were talking about something i wasnt allowed to know about - which is crazy for me, because I rarely hide anything from them, being my closest friends.

Earlier today I was playing the game again but with different friends i met very recently. My friend asked to join the party but this time I denied it out of anger. When I did, he started insulting me in our groupchat. Throughout this me and the new friends only laughed and teamed up on him, acting toxicly, only making his insults worse. He even brought up things like my parents loving me, calling me gay and autistic etc. 

He has since apologised but I have not responded - was i wrong for ganging up on him?

TL:DR my friends all met up without me then lied to me about it. Out of anger I bullied one of the friends with other kids.",0.8
"AITA for calling my husband selfish for not wanting to go on vacation with us. LAST EDIT: Thanks for all the comments. I'm bowing out of the convo, though, as some people apparently have no reading comprehension and are unable to understand that:
1. We do go on his hiking vacations multiple times a year. Hiking is literally the only vacation he will choose, so there is no ""compromising"" on different locations.
2. He has no trauma with the beach, he just doesn't think it's fun.
3. I never badmouth him in front of our children. 
4. I have no control over the location of this particular vacation.
5. He has only went with us once in 10 years. I don't mind him skipping some, but every once in a while would be nice.

Thank you all. Have a nice day.

Background:

I (37f) and husband (37m) have been married for 10 years and have 3 children. Every summer, my family takes a vacation to the beach. I'm not a huge beach fan, but our kids LOVE it, plus my mom pays for me and my siblings and our families, so it's almost a free trip (excluding travel there, which usually isn't a huge cost). Some years only some of my family makes it, but a few years ago my entire family (50+ people) went as a last trip with my grandma. Husband HATES the beach, but reluctantly went with us. 

His behavior was HORRENDOUS. He wouldn't leave the condo, bailed on previously booked activities that made the cost go up for others, and didn't help AT ALL with our kids. It was basically like he wasn't there, and when he was, he was complaining the whole time. I was so embarrassed. My whole family gave me the pitying stares the whole time and tried to help me as best they could, but it was just a miserable time. Our daughters begged him to play on the beach with them and he just wouldn't engage at all.

Since then, he hasn't accompanied us back. In fact, he will only go on vacations with us if it is a place of his choosing. Which is usually hiking. Don't get me wrong, I like to hike, but I'd also like to do other things. And so would the kids.

Now on to the part where I called him selfish.

We are now planning our trip for this summer to the beach, and once again, he says he will not go. The kids are devastated again, because they want him to go so they can swim together and build sandcastles together. He says he just hates the beach and there's no changing his mind.

I got frustrated and called him selfish because he never wants to do anything that the kids enjoy. He said I was being a jerk and there's nothing I can do that will make him like the beach. I told him it's not about liking the beach, it's about spending time with his family. He says we could skip it and go hiking instead if we want to spend time together. So I said we won't be going on anymore of his vacations.

Now I feel guilty, since that was the one thing he would do with us. AITA?

EDIT: I'm not going to deny my kids the yearly beach vacation. They look forward to it all year long. But they are quite literally the only ones there without their dad present, and they've noticed.

EDIT 2: My whole extended family does not go every year. We don't spend the entire time together. There is plenty of downtime and time to be alone. I have suggested new places before and been vetoed. His family has also wanted to do a beach trip (they love the beach) but he refuses. Also, he has no trauma. He just hates the heat and sand and says it's boring. 

EDIT 3: We do go on smaller hiking trips throughout the year. Every other year, we take a long hiking trip in addition to the beach trip. We can only do that every other year as it isn't a free vacation. He has plenty of vacay time, so that's not an issue. He gets along with my side of the family. Also, in 10 years, he has only gone once. I didn't mind before kids, but I'd like him to go every once in a while with us. I do not expect every year.",0.2
"AITA for telling my siblings they are not my doctor? Then hanged up on my mom. I 36(f) am in a large family. I am one of the youngest of 7 kids. We are close but have had issues in the past. Most of my siblings are strong able bodied people. I am neurodivergent and physically disabled. I have lupus and a protein c deficiency. Because of how bad my illness is there are times I can barely move and my kidneys are currently covered in blood cloth. 

 I have been betrayed by friends and it is hard to get people to help me. My husband cant alwaya help me. So I bit the bullet and asked my siblings to help me with chores in my house. My siblings are very into keto and holistic medicine. They believe it is bad that I take immunosuppressive drugs. But if I didn't my blood clots would not go away. Lupus patients are prone to kidney disease qne joint issues. I have both.

 So one day my siblings were going on how I eat badly and need to get off coffee. Let alone I drink coffee once a day ans eat more veggies, fruit and lean meat then them. my brother was telling me I had to cook with tallow and eat liver. my sister said to only drink tea. Then suggested teas that have just as much caffeine as a cup of coffee. 

I let it go because I assumed they were just worried about me. My sister then said ""I can't clean up this hoard you need room have two plates only two people live here."" I say to her "" what about when I have guest over like my in laws?"" She then says ""use paper plates for them."" I don't feel comfortable with that. 

 I told her I am not doing that. She then said ""where are you going to put all this stuff?"" By this point I showed my sister where I put my stuff three times. I have a shelving area that I keep all my plates cups bowls utensils and more. My brother agreed with her even though his wife and him change out plates every season. But they act like just cause I needed help like my lifestyle and choices were bad.

 They went back to me getting off of steroids, immunosuppresants, and blood thinners. they both tell me it is not good for me and I just need to cut down my clutter, junk food and use homeopathic medicine. I then blew up and said"" just because I am disabled doesn't mean I can't have a normal amount of dishes. Just cause I am disabled does mean I need room live in nothingness. I am not going to eat like a  dog and I am not going to get off my life saving medicine. You are not my doctor!"" 

 My sister got upset and started crying and I think this is where I might be the AH. My sister left and went to my mom. Her and my brother had told my mom I was unhinged and she called me. She knows what they are like but still asked me to apology and I said

 "" why should I do that? They don't listen to me and barely helped me. They want me to get off the medicine that is keeping me alive. Why do I have to always be the bigger person?"" Then my mom said "" because I raised you better than that."" I just hung up and now they are mad. I have not spoken to them in two days and am starting to think I screwed up. So AITA?",0.17
"AITA For Ruining my Coworkers Career? I (19F) work at a restaurant full time, and I quite like my job. Recently, however, I encountered a situation that I believed I handled well at the time but I’ve come to second guess myself. For some context, my coworker Steven (27M) and an old coworker Jean (18F) were a sort of situationship. Despite the fact that Jean no longer worked with us, they still talked a lot about work and other things. Jean and I are also very close, and she tells me a lot of things he says when she feels inclined to. Because of this, I knew Steven had been lying on multiple occasions about things to get out of coming into work. This would bother me even if he was just a team member, but he was a shift lead training to become a GM (General Manager) and his absence has affected the team from these situations. For the most part, he was a great shift lead. He's kind, encouraging, fun to work with and always willing to offer helpful life advice. However I felt like this needed to be resolved from how much it affected the team. Once, I ended up working a double shift to help out when he didn’t show up. However, due to the nature of Steven and Jean’s relationship at the time, I didn’t want to mention it to my GM since I was unsure if Steven would blame her for anything that happened since I wasn’t supposed to know about it. After a while though, they did sever ties and, for reasons unrelated to this she had blocked him so I knew telling my GM wouldn’t cause her any repercussions. After asking her permission to do so, I texted my GM, and forwarded some screenshots of text conversations between Jean and Steven to show proof of this happening. The next day, Steven and I work the same shift and he seems really put off. He’s not talking to everyone like usual, and he’s acting somewhat depressed. I assumed he had been reprimanded, and felt bad, especially since he didn’t know it was me who had told our GM about it. A few days later though, we were working on the same task and I asked him how his GM training was going. He answered quickly saying, “It’s pretty much stopped” then changed the subject. I was pretty stunned. I figured he would get in trouble, and they probably wouldn’t trust him when he asked to call out as much, but I had no idea they would go so far as to basically demote him by stopping his training. Despite the fact that I had only shined the light on the subject, I still feel like I ruined his career. When I told Jean about it, she was stunned too. She told me how he would tell her about how much he wanted that position for the pay, benefits, etc. and now he won’t be getting them. And even if he goes elsewhere, I’m not sure what my GM would say if contacted by another company to ask if they should hire him. I know that these were his actions that got him in trouble, but I’m starting to think I should’ve just kept my mouth shut. AITA?",0.31
"AITA For Avoiding My Boyfriends Mother I 27(F) and my BF 27(M) have been together for 6 years! 
A few weeks ago his grandmother(on his dads side) we’ll call her Nana K, had her annual holiday dinner. I have been to 3 of them and me and his grandparents are really close. 

There has been drama between Nana K and my boyfriends mom (we’ll call her Betsy) for YEARS. Long story short Betsy is not a good wife to Will (my boyfriends dad) nor was she a good mom to my boyfriend (we’ll call him Cory). 

I stay out of things as  it is not my place to get involved. Cory opens up to me about things and I always listen but hearing about what a horrible person Betsy is and how she takes everyone down with her makes me have a huge disdain for her. Plus she told Cory she thinks I turned him into a snob because he tells her he doesn’t want any of the used junk she hoards in her house, so she’s not really nice to me she fakes wanting to bond with me to try and look good. 

Fast forwarding back to this holiday dinner, she is usually never invited, but this year nana k really didn’t want to put her son through the drama of her not being invited so she invited her. I wasn’t necessarily happy when I heard about this but I can handle an hour or two. I planned to just sit far away from her and talk with the other family members. That’s exactly what I did and other then I forced hello and hug which I hate doing because she smells like cigarettes I thought I was in the clear when we were leaving I said my goodbyes to everyone I wanted to say goodbye to and I went into the bathroom texting Cory to “go to the car and let me know when she is gone. “ 

She tracks me down in the bathroom so we could walk out together and I had to endure another fake forced hug. 

Cory thinks it wasn’t I big deal I think she was trying to prove that I was avoiding her. Cory doesn’t have a great relationship with his mom but would prefer no drama, and thinks me blatantly avoiding will cause that.

""This is the BS I be talking about!! All the lights are on!!!"". He says I'm talking to him like a child, and that he's using the light.

And make sure the front door is locked, 5 out of 10 times it's unlocked. Why is there a man here that can't ensure a door is locked and lights are off before he goes to bed. You are not living alone. I would get up in the night to pee and have to check the lock to make sure its locked. Cause he's so absent minded.  Just make it a habit!!

Pretty much 99% of our relationship has been great. This has been the first difficult moment. We both work full time 9-5 Monday to Friday jobs

So basically I play table tennis a lot, I love the sport and its by far my biggest passion. When we first met I only played one local league match a week on an evening after work so it wasn't a big deal. But recently I've really improved and now I'm at a level where I can compete in higher level ranked tournaments around the country. 

So I have been doing this. I always go with my 2 brothers as well as we all play together. These tournaments are usually on weekends. However this is far from every weekend and is 1 or 2 weekends a month. We get a hotel over the Saturday night if we're far away. I absolutely love the tournaments its so fun, I have an amazing time.

However my girlfriend is not impressed. She doesn't think I spend enough time with her. She thinks I care more about table tennis than her. It's not true I just think I should be able to follow my passions as well. She really hates me not been around some weekends. She says she feels lonely and thinks I don't care. 

Even on a tournament weekend I still spend 4 nights a week with her which for me is plenty and a good health amount. I spend at least every other weekend with her and a lot of weeks it's 5 or 6 days a week. But I do feel guilty about her feeling lonely as well. AITA?",0.03
"AITA for wanting to drop out of school? I (16f) have been thinking about dropping out of high school when I turn 17 soon as that's the legal drop out age in the area where I live. I have never been good or interested in school as I've had failing grades ever since 3rd grade, it's a miracle that I'm even in 11th grade right now.

I was having dinner with my mom (44f) and she brought up my grades in which I brought up in the conversation that I might drop out when I'm old enough and just receive my GED when I'm 18 and have an actual job in the meantime (she doesn't allow me to work because school is my job in her eyes).

She threatened to send me to my dad's house if I dropped out of school immediately after I brought it up. As this isn't the first time this has happened I was unfazed but it still hurts that she didn't want me around if I dropped out considering she kept my brother (23m) around after he dropped out and did the same thing I am yearning to do.

She told me if I didn't want to argue then I should drop the topic, and I feel as if I'm in the wrong for not wanting to take part in things that I'm not going to be using in the career path I plan on taking in the future.

"AITA for saying my brother should be castrated? Ok title sounds harsh, but bear with me.

My brother (35m) has always had issues. During lockdown he went missing for over 48 hours after an altercation with my older brother (38m). For context, my older brother noticed he had not left his room in days, even to get water, so knocked on his door and went in telling him he needed to at least get water.

Younger brother had a meltdown. Went to the bathroom and smashed his head off the toilet seat, leaving a cut. Then posted on SM about how older brother did this to him and he’s always abused him etc. Couple of days later he went missing and when he came back, I begged him to go get help. No deal. He’s “fine.”.

A few instances since then, he throws a tantrum, says he does nothing wrong, doesn’t need help, he’s “fine”. He’s not fine. He needs help. But he’s an adult and can’t be forced into help unless he’s a danger to himself or others.

So this Christmas I was staying with my nan and younger brother, he still lives at home. My nan and I were discussing the neighbours 9mo baby. She made a joke how if the baby were in our house their first word would be fuck (we swear like sailors). Ensue following conversation.

Brother: No it wouldn’t, they’d be upstairs studying.

Me: Um. You’d leave a 9mo baby upstairs on its own to study?

Brother: (adamantly) Yeah! That’s how you teach them!

Me: This is why you need castrating.

So WITA for saying that? He told me to fuck off and called me harsh for saying it, but he was seriously talking about leaving a baby alone to ‘study’. I don’t even know what that means.

And no before anyone says he was joking or being sarcastic, he wasn’t. He was serious. He’ll say things like that sometimes and not realise how really bad and/or abusive these comments come off as and then go into his shell when called out on it. He’s not spoken to me since for calling out his comments.",0.42

I make dinner at 6 or 7pm, and try to go to sleep around 10pm because I have to get up for work at 7am and I require 8-9 hours of sleep per night.

I would never put on the tv or leave lights on if my roommate announced she was going to sleep like I do (not to mention I just don’t hang out in the common area while she basically lives in the common area).

"AITA for not being happy with my mom and her boyfriend's plans to visit my boyfriend and I in our new home in another state? A few months ago my boyfriend (24M) moved to another state to start a new job. I (24F) will be moving in with him in March. My boyfriend will be paying half of our shared living expenses, and my parents will pay for my half (divided equally between my mom and dad). That's because I currently have no income, and I'll be moving to start my master's degree (which means my parents are funding my education; they aren't just giving me money so I can live with my boyfriend, they wouldn't do that). And yes, I do plan on having an income as soon as possible.

So my mom (52F) mentioned she's planning to visit us in April, along with her boyfriend of 6 months (55M). I expressed I wished she had consulted me before inviting herself, and especially before inviting her boyfriend (who I don't even know that well, as they've been together for 6 months). She said she has the right to visit whenever she wants, and to invite whoever she wants, because she's paying my bills. And she was hurt by my reaction because she expected me to be happy with her visit.

I feel like even if I'm not paying any bills, it would still be nice and respectful to be asked about possible visits and extra guests. And using my mom's own logic, my boyfriend is paying twice as much as she is, so shouldn't he also get a say on who visits us and when?

It's important to mention my boyfriend and I are extremely introverted. He needs his alone time and I'm very socially anxious, especially around people I don't know that well. Our apartment has only one bedroom and a sofa bed in the living room. In the past, my mom has also expressed she expects us to politely offer her our bedroom/bed.

I almost feel like she would like to replace me as his mother.  I feel like she is trying to have a parallel relationship with our son, while having a frosty relationship with us, his parents. I dont mind them coming occasionally, but every single time feels off to me.  It's weird.  Husbanr has tried to talk to her before and she looses her mind over it.  I frankly don't care - she is trying to insert herself into our family time and I can't take it any more.  I want her to mind her own business.  AITA for not wanting her around?",0.81
"AITA for causing a family rift over a Christmas visit? I (32M) was staying with my aunt and uncle for a few days over Christmas. They had really been looking forward to seeing me as they don’t have kids of their own, helped raise me and my sister when my parents lived abroad and are getting older (mid-seventies) so I decided to come for three days from December 22 to 25. Throughout the trip, my uncle made a few comments about how he wished I could stay for longer. He was also unhappy about the fact that he had to drive me to the airport on Christmas afternoon (they are suburban people while I live in NYC and don’t know how to drive and he also mentioned that he would have preferred to spend Christmas afternoon having a few drinks and not having to drive.) He wouldn’t let go of the fact that I was going back to spend time with my girlfriend (I had planned the trip to make Christmas dinner with her family in the evening) and kept saying that I was not prioritizing his family. There is now a rift in the family as some think it was kind of me to visit at all while others think the visit was too short and inconvenienced my relatives. It’s not almost a month since Christmas and this is still causing tension. AITA?

Edit: the reason I didn’t take an Uber is because my uncle kept offering to and then complaining about it. It’s a strange family dynamic but getting an Uber would have resulted in him saying something like “so you’re a big New Yorker who doesn’t let uncle drive him?”",0.35
"AITA for spending time with my mom and not my gf? I am 25M. My girlfriend (24F) just found out about a month ago that her dad has late stage cancer. He's in their home country so she can't even see him. She used to cry everytime I saw her because of the news, but these days she seems to be doing a lot better. Her mom recently left the country to go stay with her dad in their home country too, so she is gonna be all alone for 2 months. I know she dislikes being alone, and she has anxiety. We live around a 45 minute drive apart and I live with my family still, but we usually see each other every other week. 

Here's where things get a little difficult. My dad works on weekends, so my mom is home alone on the weekends. Seeing as my girlfriend has not been crying as much anymore, I decided to skip a weekend so that I can spend time with my mom, who is also alone every weekend. Reason being: The weekend after that I will be going on a small overnight trip with her. I just wanted to spend some time with my mom before I leave for the trip with my girlfriend.However, my girlfriend looked a little disappointed today over the phone when I told her I won't be visiting this weekend, and she was quiet for most of our call, as she got upset. But I'm spending the next weekend with her, so I don't see what I'm doing wrong? I just want to spend some time on the weekend with my mom who is alone. 

TLDR: My girlfriend's dad has cancer and her family went to all visit him so she is in town alone for two months. I usually visit her every other week and I stuck to that schedule so I can also spend time with my mom the weekends I'm not seeing her. Am I wrong?",0.08
"AITA for not punishing or allowing my husband to punish our daughter? My (23f) husband (23) and I have recently put our daughter (6) in a more advanced school, and she hates leaving her friends behind. She's been very passive agressive and upset about this, and asks to go back every chance she gets. One time, she blew up, and stormed off to her room. I went to tuck her in at bedtime, and she was gone along with her winter clothes and stuffed elephant.

We searched for her until 2 am, when we found her balling her eyes out in the tube slide in the neighborhood's playground. She sped into my arms, and I broke down with her, and carried her home and slept in her bed holding her.

In the morning, she wouldn't let go of me, and was uncharacteristically quiet.

My husband says she needs to be disciplined, but the thought of distressing her just...didn't compute in that moment. I said absolutely not, and put my foot down. He looked exasperated, and said we can't just let that stunt go, and I she's my baby and we are. He said I'm a better mom than that, but let it go. AITA?",0.6
"AITA for releasing my Friend's turtle without her permission? I formed a close friendship with two girls, M and S. Me and S gave M swamp turtles as a birthday gift, but she seemed indifferent and neglected their care. Eventually, M asked me to keep the turtles, and one of them unexpectedly died. During a road trip, I (due to insistence of my father) released the remaining turtle into a swamp, and when I informed the group chat, S supported my decision, but M became accusatory and started a fight, insisting I should have asked before releasing it. The argument escalated, and I responded strongly, leading to a strained relationship with M. S wants us to resolve the conflict, but M continues to blame me. I'm questioning if I was wrong for not asking M before releasing the turtle.",0.19
"AITA for being upset with my (ex) girlfriend for priding themself as a lesbian? I have been in a couple relationships with women and I myself am FtM, a guy. My last girlfriend is an undeniably a queer girl who we will call Tina. In no way am I upset with Tina for that queerness, but I got into a relationship with her because she developed feelings for me first, and me second, resulting in us getting together.  I was the first guy that they had liked romantically and had gotten into a relationship with.

I realized that Tina was probably just Bi like me or whatnot. However, when I was first introduced to her house and room I just saw so. much. of the lesbian flags, and paraphernalia. She mostly ignored them and when I brought it up- because it caused me some uncomfort she said that she'd ""take them down at some point."" This slightly peeved me but even 2 months later they were still up and a very big part of her personality.  She also said how she just loved women so much and hated men, but that's not too uncommon of a sentiment.

I have been in relationships similar to this in which it was an indirect way of having a more ""masculine girlfriend."". I do not like this, it means that I am not being respected for who I am. This doesn't mean that I accused them of being transphobic or anything it just leaves a bad taste. I also tried to explain how their incorrect ""labelling"" or whatever pissed me off.

And no if you are wondering- this is not the reason that we are no longer together I was just wondering if I was justified in being upset by someone else's identity. I am pretty sure that she has no intention of fully dropping the label of lesbian.

Also, if you are wondering, I am not a feminine person, I've been passing for a while.

"AITA for allegedly forcing my “friend” to leave my birthday party? I, F (28) got married this year and my now husband had organised a birthday party for me 10 months ago where he proposed to me. It was a very special evening for me. My sister started passing around the mic to everyone to say something about me. At that point I noticed that Alex, M (32) started changing places so that he could skip speaking about me. 
A little bit of context: I have known Alex and his sister since we were babies and have always thought of them as family. We have had our differences but I always looked at those differences the way you would look at differences within a family. His sister has been my best friend for the longest time. 4 days before my birthday party, Alex, his sister and a couple of our other childhood friends had visited my place. Alex initiated an argument with me. At first, I thought it was normal but then he suddenly started getting super mean. When I tried asking him what was the matter he started with saying that I lied to him about how I met my bf. When I tried explaining to him that I never lied, I just like to keep a few details private he went on and on about it and then started jumping from one topic to another. It seemed like he deliberately wanted to pick a fight with me. He started to humiliate me and say things like no one knows my real side and he will unmask me. I was getting very confused and upset and when I was trying to reason with him he said that  we were never really friends and he never liked me, we were just forced to interact because we have the same circle. 
I left the room in tears. His sister yelled at him and the situation got a bit better. 
Cut to my birthday, another friend started pestering Alex to speak. This friend had no idea about what had happened a few days ago. 
Alex had even made a joke right after the proposal saying that my husband will be irritated for the rest of his life now. 
So, I did not want him to speak. I knew that he is capable of being very rude on the mic. So I said   loudly and a bit rudely “ No, No. Alex won't speak. No one is going to force him. I don't want to ruin my special evening.” 
Around 15 people were present there and a lot of them did not know what had happened a few days ago. Soon after, Alex, his sister and his sister’s husband left the party without saying a word. 
They have not spoken to me since then. His sister was supposed to be my bridesmaid but she cut all contact with me after that day and did not even respond to my wedding invitation.
I was really hurt by this. It's been 10 months and Alex and his sister make a point to avoid me by all cost breaking our social circle and forcing people to chose. 
But our mutual friend (who knows the whole story and was present on both days ) thinks that my behaviour was totally uncalled for and Alex and his sister’s actions are completely justified since what Alex did was in a close group and what I did was in a social setting.
So, AITA?",0.18
"AITA for telling my husband he need to shower at work My husband took a new job on the permanent night shift. Of course, we talked about what that would mean beforehand and he had no problem changing his sleep routine. Say he wants to sleep when he gets home from work early in the morning.  However, the following problem emerged: when he gets home from work at 6 a.m. and takes a 20-minute shower, he wakes me up and I'm wide awake, even though I've only slept about 4 hours (I'm a late riser and need about 10 hours of sleep to function). I accused him of being selfish to wake me up with his long shower and asked him if he could shower at work, he said he didn't want to because he (understandably) felt more comfortable at home. I asked him if he planned to wake me up every night now, for me once I'm really awake it takes hours to fall asleep again, he said he doesn't want to shower at work, so it's probably unavoidable, that he wakes me up by taking a shower. He offered to try to shower faster, but that wouldn't change anything because as soon as the shower turns on I'm wide awake. I said he was an asshole if he didn't care that much and put his well-being above my sleep. He said I was the asshole for putting my sleep over his well-being.  Further information that may be relevant: I am a housewife myself and my husband earns the money for us (both he and I were happy with that many years ago and continue to be so). So that we could still spend as much time together as possible, we originally wanted us to sleep at similar times. The plan was that I would go to bed around 1/2 a.m. and then sleep until around 11 a.m. and then take care of the household until he did  gets up at around 3 p.m. Then we spend the day together and when he goes to work at 9 p.m., I take care of the household again.

"AITA for asking my friend to pay rent while she crashes at my house? I 43F met my 29F friend mid last year. We met through a mutual friend and hung out a few times. She spent a lot of time partying and ended crashing at my condo quite a lot then. I never had a problem with this as it wasn’t long term. Recently we’ve both had a crazy time. I just moved to a new house and she’s gone through a breakup and been kicked out of her rental. I offered for her to move her stuff into my basement and sleep in the spare room down there. She agreed and moved her stuff and cat into my house. She hasn’t been around much due to my kids being too noisy and her work hours (she works night shifts and sleeps during day.) I don’t mind her and her cat staying here but I asked her to pay some “rent” (300$) for utilities as my rent is a lot more expensive then it once was and I’m a single mom who makes less then her. I don’t see asking her for money to be an issue but she does, and keeps bringing up the difficulties she’s going through as an excuse.

My eldest daughter has also been cat sitting the entire time and buying litter + food. She says it’s not an issue for her because she has her own cat and enjoys letting the cats play to get free time but it bothers me that my friend doesn’t see this as a problem or something she should repay my daughter for.

I really do feel for her but I have been taken advantage of way too many times in the past and don’t want to let this be one of those times. I told her If she doesn’t want to pay, she can go because I don’t feel like it’s appropriate to be used as a free cat sitter and storage room. AITA?",0.04

"AITA for getting my girlfriend a “cheep” ring? So I (28M) have a girlfriend (27) we have been dating for five years and I’ve loved every bit of it.

For the past few months, I’ve been thinking about moving forward in our relationship but I don’t want to rush things for her, I’ve been looking at rings I could get her in the meantime to show that I promise to love her forever.
I brought her a silver ring because she only wears silver jewellery and talks about how much she hates gold.

It was $100 whereas the gold ring was $600, I thought that it would be a good choice but when I showed her friends and family they called me cheap, that I should have chosen a more expensive ring because that’s what she deserved, and she does, she deserves the world but I don’t want to spend hundreds of dollars when I will buy a more expensive ring in the future.

They made more comments calling me all sorts of names, I haven’t talked to them much since then but it all plagues my mind.

When they said I should have gotten a different ring I started to have doubts, I don’t want her to be upset about the ring and I don’t want to get her one that she doesn’t want or like.
I’m sure she will love and appreciate the current ring but the people around me are making me feel otherwise.

Should I find a different ring? I don’t want to have this moment be bad for her, I want to make sure it’s perfect but I’m scared to mess it up.

So AITA?

I should probably add that she was the one to suggest the promise ring because she is nervous about a proper proposal, we did talk about rings together and how we wanted the night of the proposal to go.

"AITA for not wanting to take photos during our Japan trip? So my dad (52M) and I (18F) are currently on a Japan trip, we haven’t been out in quite a few years due to COVID so this is pretty much our first trip in forever. He’s a pretty big photography fanatic, and invests a lot of his money into cameras. And he insists on taking a picture of everything, and by that I mean everything. Since he’s been like this ever since I was a kid, I developed a pretty bad aversion to cameras since he shoves it into my face every time we go anywhere. I’m also pretty socially awkward and conscious so I hate that people have to wait to cross a road or whatever just because we have to take a photo. My dad seems to have picked up on it a few years into me being a teenager since I get angry so he doesn’t take as many photos as he did before with me.

We’re currently on our 4th day of our Japan trip, and he’s been taking photos everywhere which I understand but at the same time I couldn’t be bothered about it as much as he does: On the first and second day of the trip I was fine with it, but into the third and fourth day was when I really started to get impatient. He shoves a camera into my face constantly to the point where we have to take a picture even if we’re behind schedule and will be late to our next destination. He insists on taking photos in <10 degree weather (which isn’t that bad but I live in a warm city and I’m not used to cold temperatures) so I was just waiting out in the cold to the point I felt sick and feverish. I was also following him around in random places just to wait for him to finish taking pictures. Eventually I got pissed, and he sensed that I was angry too, and currently we’re not talking to each other.

I didn’t have a great relationship with my dad to begin with, and we’re both not super big open communicators. I understand that he takes pictures for the memories and he’s told me that before: The human memory span is short and we have to document the places which we go. But at the same time, I don’t feel like there’s a need to take a picture of every car park we’ve parked at, every hotel we’ve visited, every meal we’ve eaten, etcetera. “Stand here! Stand there! Look a bit to the left! Smile more!” Every time he says stuff like that it just irritates me more and more even when I’m trying my best not to.

While I understand my dad’s motivations, I really just don’t want a camera shoved in my face every single second of the day. So Reddit, AITA?",0.19

So as punishment we took both our daughters electronics away for a week as we do collective punishment in our house meaning if one sibling misbehaves Both get punished. 

So I took both the phone away now they are mad at me and my husband is saying we should let our daughter have the phone in the room overnight and she can learn natural consequences about what happens if she stays up too late.

"WIBTA if I kick my 14 year old daughter out of the house? I'll start this by saying I never wanted kids. My girlfriend was aware of this but stopped taking birth control because it was time for me to ""grow up and be a man"" which included having a family. I immediately ended things with her and told her I didn't want to be part of the child's life, but I would pay my fair share. She begged and pleaded. So did her parents. I shut them all down and eventually they blocked me on everything. I didn't hear from my ex until Anna, our daughter, was two years old. My ex had gotten arrested with her new boyfriend and they were both going to prison for drug-related charges. The next day, her parents dropped Anna off at my house. That was a little over 12 years ago.

Despite not wanting to be a dad, I tried to step up for Anna. I took care of her. I moved so she could go to a good school. She was involved in after-school activities. I went to every game and event except for one that would have literally cost me my job. I had the birds and bees talk. I even got my sister to help me with that so there would be a woman's perspective, and enlisted her help again when Anna got her first period.

Two months ago, my sister called me in tears. Anna was with her. My sister asked me to come to her house right away, and I did. Long story short, Anna is pregnant. The father of her baby is a fifteen year old boy named Danny. They didn't use protection. Anna's excuse was ""We didn't have condoms and he was too embarrassed to buy them."" Great.

I'm pro-choice. We live in a state where abortion isn't legal, but I have the financial means to get her somewhere it is legal. My sister and I had a long talk with Anna. Consensus was that all three of us would be taking a trip. Anna agreed it was for the best because she wasn't ready to be a mom. (Her words)

The next day, she changed her mind. Danny wants them to keep the baby. He wants them to be a family. I figured it was best to try and talk with Danny's parents. Danny hadn't even told them yet, so I had to drop the bombshell. They agreed abortion was for the best, or adoption if she didn't want to have an abortion. I favored abortion, but was open to adoption.

We (my sister, me and Danny's parents) sat them both down to talk about this. Danny gets withdrawn and mutters when he gets ""stressed."" I couldn't understand half of what he said. Apparently, this is how all conversations go with him, according to his parents. We didn't make any progress. Danny wants to keep the baby and my daughter is bought into the fantasy of them living happily ever after. Danny has no job. No plans to get one but they'll ""figure things out.""

I love Anna. I'm not raising her child. I feel like the only way she will understand the seriousness of this is to be on her own. I think one-two nights of being away from home will make her realize there is no way this is possible. Danny's parents and my sister have said they will not take her in, but that I'm an asshole for thinking about kicking her out.

"AITA for acknowledging that my boyfriend’s family don’t like me and declining an invite to a trip with them? I really don’t see the problem here but my boyfriend is perturbed so I’m trying to see if I’m losing it. 

My boyfriend Dan and I have been together for about a year. We live in a big city while Dan is from the country so he doesn’t see his family that often. However, I have met them several times, and they don’t like me. That’s fine, I’m not overly keen on them either. We just have nothing in common. I can see them cringing when I talk and they make snide comments about me wanting to stay in a hotel if I visit with Dan, etc.. I want to be clear, I don’t have any problem with this. We are all civil and can have a pleasant time over a weekend or whatever, and it really is fine that I’m not their ideal in law, they’re not mine either. But the facts are the facts.

So the other night Dan and I were having dinner with a friend of mine, and Dan mentioned his sister wanted my number so that she could invite me to a girl’s weekend with her, Dan’s mother, and Dan’s SIL. I said he could give her my number but I’m not going to go on the trip, but I would like to be polite and tell her myself and thank her for the invitation. My friend asked why I wouldn’t go and I said because Dan’s family doesn’t like me and I’m not going to ruin their weekend and mine by going on the trip. Dan balked at this and asked why I would say something like that. I said because it’s true. Dan didn’t deny this, just said that was a crass thing to say and they invited me so I should go. I said absolutely not.

Dan dropped the idea of me going (still thinks I should but knows he won’t win that battle) but is still saying that I shouldn’t have been so blunt in saying they don’t like me, that it was an inappropriate thing to say and paints them in a bad light. I don’t think it does at all. It’s not a crime to not like people, and you don’t choose your in laws, what are the odds you actually like them? We’re all civil and that’s what counts. 

Dan is still upset about it, and I don’t really see why he’s so offended.

Edit (I got told to add this for context about their dislike of me) re how I know they don’t like me - They make disparaging remarks about the way I dress, the car I drive, and my cosmetic surgery, to my face. They ask me inappropriate personal questions, they complain about me to Dan (he told me this). They don’t like me. I’m not imagining it. They don’t.",0.5
"AITA for asking my mom to stop providing for my uncle in the future A week ago, I (24F) had a conversation with my mom (64F) about an ongoing situation within my family.

My mom has 3 siblings : my aunt (50F), my uncle Josh (60M) and my 2nd uncle (62M). We come from a well of family through my grandparents who have worked all their life and had a sucessfull career. My two grandparents (88F and 90M) are enjoying their life as they should.

Josh was a brilliant student. He had impressive abilities in mathematics and could have entered one of the best school within our country but one day took his bag and toured the country dropping out of school. When he returned home he encountered his foreign wife and decided to follow her and founded his family in her country. 

Josh lack of diploma has been a big handicap for their income. Josh's wife is a physics teacher in highschool and Josh is a translator. He could make a lot more money if he wasn't only translating texts from ONE PERSON. No, he doesn't have any contract with this person and this person is not writing a lot of content and is not famous. Josh admires this person and is just willing to loose money because he doesn't want to translate any other text.

Josh has 2 children (25M and 20M). They are going abroad several time a year and have been studying music from middle school to university which Josh would have never been able to pay by himself.

There comes my grandparents. I discovered recently that they were providing for Josh's family and I find it quite unfair. My aunt who also has 2 children (18F and 16F) have a really low income and doesn't have another income on which she can rely on. My 2nd uncle doesn't have children but doesn't earn a lot of money and is working hard to earn it. My mother is a single mom and has retired 2 years ago. She is the most well of and the oldest of the siblings eventhough she doesn't earn a lot of money she has a bit of savings.

During christmas week, Josh called my grandparents. He wished everyone a good christmas and while on speaker and cutting off the conversation said, with an agressive tone  : ""We haven't received our 500€ this Christmas. Are we going to or not ?"" my grandmother brush it off with a good laugh as always.

Later I asked my mom what would my uncle do when my grandparents passed away and my mom respond that she would care for him. I was so shoked and told her that it was his choices that led him to this situation and that if he would consider changing his way of working he wouldn't need any other income. My mom seemed to disagree and told me she won't let him on his own and that it was still her money for the moment and she will do what she pleases with it but I know my mom income and it would be a real burden for her to do so.

For my part I think my uncle should open his eyes and encounter the rought side of life for once and he still have his kids and wife on whom he should be able to rely if they didn't live beyond their means.  
Am I the asshole for asking my mom to not provide for my uncle in the future ?

"AITA for saying no to a proposal, despite wanting to get married, because it was at a wedding? I, 25M, have been dating R, 26M, for 5 years. For about a year and a half, I've been ready to tie the knot with him. We had talked about potentially getting married before, and we both seemed to be on the same page, however, months went by without a proposal, and if I didn't have a dream of getting to be the one to be proposed to, I probably would've done so myself.

9 days ago, we were at my friend’s wedding, who I'll refer to as F. F had been a close friend of mine for 8 years, and she was the one who set me up with R, who had been the best friend of her then-boyfriend, now husband, J.

J had made R his best man, and during his speech at the reception, he decided to end the speech by getting down on one knee and proposing to me. 

I was shocked by this for two reasons:

1) I had mentioned to him before that I always dreamed of a more private and intimate proposal.

2) Once or twice F and I talked about how we found the process of proposing at other people's weddings to be really rude, with both our partners being a part of the conversation.

After an awkward minute of silence, I rejected the proposal and pulled R outside to talk. He blew up at me, confused as to why I would say no, embarrassing him like that, even though I've made it clear that I wanted to marry him before. I then argued that while I did want to, he shouldn't have done it at our friends' wedding of all places.

After a bit of back and forth, we chose to leave. Before doing so, I went back in to grab our things and to apologize to F for what happened, where I was informed by J that he gave R permission to do so, to both F's and my confusion.

Since then, R and I have been sleeping in separate rooms, and we still haven't spoken a word to each other since our fight.

"AITA for not moving on from when my friends hung out on my birthday without me? I am f 17 have always had cursed birthdays. So I made sure to hide it from friends so I wouldnt get expectations. Though for this birthday I thought I finally had friends where just being with them can make it amazing.The week before my birthday my best friend and I got into an argument. I didnt feel appreciated by her and when we would go out and all take pictures. She would aways post the ones without me in it, and always posted stuff with our other friends. Though always says how i am her number 1. On my birthday my dad told me I was not allowed to go out because I had gotten in trouble a couple weeks before for being high. He said I could go out friday because my birthday was also during the school week. I was telling my other friend how I would not go out today and would go out friday. What hurts the most is my dad kept trying to get me out of my room to celebrate my birthday with my family and I kept refusing. Thinking to myself I wish I was with my friends. A couple days later I was accidentally told by the same friend I told i couldnt go out that they had all hung out on my birthday. I immediately burst into tears just feeling sorry for myself. Was too busy thinking about my friends to go celebrate with my family and they were out not thinking about me once. Whats worse is both of them said “well you were invited” and its like wow ty so much for inviting to my own birthday celebration. While they have apologized and its been some time. I cant seem to let it go. And i dont know what to do. This is the same best friend im applying to the same colleges as so we can stay together. But i am just so hurt. And even now a couple months later I dont think they get just how much it hurt me. I dont know if I just have a victim complex and am overly sensitive. But one thing I have learned is that I was right to swear off my birthdays and know to never celebrate it again.",0.97
"AITA for more helping my friend who constantly complains about money issues? My friend had a good-paying job where she was in conflict with almost everyone she worked with. Everyone but her was the problem, according to her. She would regularly report her co-workers and her supervisors to HR. I suggested to her that she looked for another job if she was so many unhappy at work, but she refused, and instead spent her energy fighting with everyone. Not too long after, she got fired.

A couple of months later, she got a new job and again was beefing with her employer. She felt that they were giving her too much to do. She quit the job without first lining up another job.

After she repeatedly complained to me about financial hardship, I sent her $700. Two weeks later, she’s back to complaining about money issues. Literally, in every single conversation we have, she would turn it into talking about her financial issues. She once even complained about being cash-strapped after having to pay for a car rental which she needed to go buy organic produce at an upscale grocery store across town as the grocery store on her street didn’t have organic produce. Also, never mind that her town has an excellent public transportation system.

Every single conversation has been about money to the point I dreaded getting on the phone with her.

 On the eve of New Years, she mentioned to me how she had bills piling up and felt that her circumstances had made her realize how she has no one supporting her. (Family members have provided her free housing while she’s unemployed).

 On new years, I posted pics of a recent ski trip I went on, and several hours later, I wished her happy new year. She never acknowledged my text, despite seeing her active on social media. I can’t help but think she might be feeling resentful about seeing me posting about my trip when I have not offered to help her with her finances.

"AITA for asking my Boyfriend to cover up I 32 f have a boyfriend Kyle ( 34) Kyle is a wonderful men who’s a giant goofball (literally a giant he’s 6‘,6“) a little intimidating and scary because he is crazy buff. I been with him a little over 2 years. We met at a party. He was going through some issues and I took it upon myself to help him out. Since it’s been two years. We decided that it’s time to meet the family. His parents were nice so was the rest of the family. They were so thankful that I was able to help out Kyle while going through a rough time. His dad was really nice and happy he’s obsessed with Mexican food and I’m Mexican and know how to cook lol ( thanks to my abuelita) last week it was my turn to bring him to meet my family. He’s COVER in tattoos 80% of his body is done. That itself is not the main issue. I have tattoos and my parents 3 each. The main issue is that my boyfriend has 2 BIG visible tattoos, A pentagram and Baphomet. While my parents are somewhat open minded. They are extremely Catholic. I’m no longer religious but I just play along to keep the peace. As most of you all know most religious people are completely ignorant to the true meaning. They have nothing to do with Satan, or any demonic entity. I asked Kyle if he would be ok if we put a band-Aid over them. He asked why and I explain the reason. He said sure, but I could tell he wasn’t happy about it. He met my family and everything went  amazing. When we got home he ripped them off in a somewhat  angrily way and threw them in the trash. I apologize dearly but he’s clearly really upset about it. So Reddit am I the asshole.


Update: I do want to add that I personally do not have an issue with them. I absolutely love him the way he is with all his tattoos. I truly do love him ",0.69
"AITA for teasing about Michigan football? I have been dating a guy and he seems to have a quick temper when he feels attacked or doesn't like how something is going. AITH in this scenario?

We watched the college football championship last night. I brought snacks and made some too. He made some food, too. It was really fun at first. I was having a great time

Around halftime I noticed it said both teams hadn't won a Championships since the 90s, but I thought Michigan was considered the best team of all time. I also went there for grad school so I was like maybe I have a biased perception. I looked up some stats, and I saw Michigan really doesn't have very many bowl titles. I am an analytical person so I was trying to understand what that meant, esp because I hear people say M is so much better than OSU and MSU but they had won big deal titles more recently than M.

So we talked about that for a min and it was fine, he was really engaged in the conversation. Then I was just joking and I was like broo Michigan suckssss how come everyone convinced me they were so much better than MSU and OSU? So immediately the guy isn't playing around back and he's like look at other bowl titles. And I was like I did, they are not that great!! I grew up in Boston so I am used to people dogging on me about the Pats. I thought it was all in good fun to give a little shit, esp because neither of us watches a lot of football and Michigan was obviously going to win the game anyway.

He really got defensive which took me aback because I thought we were being silly.  Again I went to Michigan, not him. He started saying I was ruining a Big Occasion for him and he loved Michigan since he was a kid and I was completely out of line to disrespect the winningest team in history. So I backed off and was like, yeah, ""I just meant its funny I assumed all these things. Anyway, how does a team win so many games but not win the big titles? Does it have to do with their strengths and stuff?"" And he got defensive again and started giving an explanation like, thats just how it is and I was like, no I'm really curious how does a football program with that many wins not make it to Championships or win bowl games if they're able to win season games so much? And got pretty mad and started waving his arms around for emphasis and was like, you just asked the same question over and over (I asked twice) and if you don't want to listen to me when I explain it to you, then why do I even bother talking.  You're so rude and you never listen. On and on while I just sat there, stunned. 

What's funny is he didn't mention that the two teasing comments I made are what pissed him off. He just kept making it about what a terrible listener I was. I was surprised because when I show him movies or shows I like, he talks about how much they suck, so I didn't think that kind of teasing would upset him so much. Am I really being that triggering??",0.35
"AITA for not allowing my parents to cook meat in my home? I (24f) have been vegetarian for several years, my parents decided that I could either eat their food or buy my own, and I have bought my own food since I was 16. There were times they could have easily made minor changes so I could eat with them (like not adding bacon bits to the salad until after it's served, or using butter/oil instead of bacon grease) but they never did. They don't really accept me not eating meat, especially my dad. 

Anyways. They needed a place to stay near where I lived, and after some pushing I agreed to let them stay with me for one weekend. I got several options for them for food; 

Breakfast: Yogurt parfait, sourdough bread (homemade) and croissants, a bunch of things to put on bread, eggs, OJ, coffee and tea. 

Lunch: soups (tomato and potato leek), grilled cheese / bread rolls. 

Dinner: eggplant parm with salad and garlic bread one day, and chili with rice, sour cream and cheese for the next. 

These are all things they can eat and enjoyed eating in the past (though usually with meat mixed in/as a side). I've provided more for them then they have for me. But according to my dad it wasn't enough. He insisted on going on to buy some ground beef to mix into the chili the second evening. I told him he's free to go out to eat, but he can't cook it in my kitchen.

"AITA for not wanting to change my dream job because my father is an alcoholic? I (17m) am going to start university soon. I plan and want to be a tattoo artist, a college degree or any extra education isn't necessary for the job but my mother convinced me that I need to study in university to have an easier life. Which I agreed on, better to study when I can than to regret not doing so later. I had a few options of where to go and after thinking and researching me and my mother settled on either a college for animation or a university in the same field. 4 years ago I had a conversation with my father (currently 42 male), he started talking about how he won't be around forever but he promised, swore, to pay for my education, be it uni or college. I appreciated it a ton. Now to the current problem In 2023 my parents had a divorce. My father bought himself a few flat (which wasn't necessary for him bc he had a place to stay till he could save up but instead he got a loan. His choice i guess). He also started drinking a lot more and often got blackout drunk. It rarely happened when he still lived with us. He did drink and that was a cause for many problems in the marriage and the reason for the divorce. He often forgot about his job/ didn't show up or outright turned off his phone. One time he got super wasted and had his phone off. Me and his mother called him all day to no avail, grandma even came to his place and knocked on his door and rang the bell. He didn't respond. Like bruh it was a week day. So obviously it caused problems at work. He was told he will be fired in 2 months. Good job, dad. I know nobody drinks for no reason and it's always to numb some pain or whatever but it is affecting him and people around him. He honestly is losing his mind lately. I genuinely think his brain is dying. In a few months he became extremely dumb. Hes impossible talk to. He's getting delusional, I won't get into personal details but he's talking about ideas that are absolutely idiotic and impossible in our situation. He says he wants to change things but he did change things. The divorce, the new place to live, bro, you did change shit around you. He will most likely not be able to afford my education. I talked to my aunt about my worries, about dad, how he behaves and how his actions are affecting things. He's generally a greedy person but 4 years ago he was nice, genuinely wanted to help me. I don't recognize the man who is my father anymore, I'm sorry. My aunt told me I have to grow up and man up. That I have to study harder and change the career path if my father can't help me. That it's not his fault he has money issues. I might be the asshole for his but I told my aunt what my father promised me and that just because he's an addict, it doesn't give him the right to take away my future from me. I told her that I don't want to bend over backwards for a manchild who ruined his own life and is starting to affect mine more than it should.

"AITA for telling my housemate(20F) to unfollow my BF(20F) on his socials My(21F) housemate, Linda is a friendly extrovert. I’m introverted so it’s hard for me to form the type of friendship she wants with me. Like randomly coming into my room to watch movies, going out together or eating meals together. When she brings her friends over she usually tries to fish me out of my room to greet them, which I’m not comfortable with. She thinks my friends should be her’s and vice versa, something I didn’t mind until it came to my sister and my BF.

My BF, Jay usually comes to my apartment since he stays at a strict campus residence. Whenever Linda is in the shared area, even when I’m not in the room, she sparks up conversations with him like they are friends. I was fine with this as she does this with everyone I bring over. 

It started irking me when she couldn’t get the hint that I wanted to be alone with him. Example, sometimes Jay and I like to get high, eat and have high sex to de-stress. She insists to join in (unintentionally guilt trips us when we get high without her) and smoke with us and talks and talks and talks. I’m horny, awkward and try to make some measly excuse that Jay and I need to sleep and she starts another thread of conversation. Once she thought it was a good idea to bring up something I had said over a year ago that offended her for the first time during a high session. Jay saw the uncomfortable direction of the conversation and diverted it. 

On my anniversary Jay came over to pick me up for our date and I went to brush my teeth as I had just eaten spicy food and she loudly commented in shock how I was only brushing my teeth at this time of day(afternoon) in front of him. 
She also gets too comfortable and makes comments that need a certain level of friendship to make. Like she’s commented “As a man, why don’t you have a license yet” “You should be embarrassed that you can’t speak your mother tongue” “Why can’t you cook at this age” to my BF which understandably have made him uncomfortable. I know she doesn’t mean to come off as judgmental and it’s by accident. I told her about this and she apologized.

Another incident was when I invited Jay over so he came and sat in my room but Linda called me out soon after telling me she wanted attention and started playing music, dancing and I just watched awkwardly.

None of my female friends follow Jay on socials so I was irked when I noticed that Jay and Linda follow each other. I let that go. What especially irked me was when Jay reposted a picture of me and she replied to his story saying he should have put the caption “My precious queen”. Jay screenshotted and sent it to me. I’m okay with what she but I dislike that she thinks she can have a relationship with him online.

I told her that I rather she keep her distance from him and refrain from texting him on his socials as I am not comfortable with the two of them being friends. She looked hurt and it’s been awkward between the two of us. AITA for telling her to stop being friendly with my bf?",0.92

I'm not typically attractive, I'm short, fat, and I don't have much of a pretty face. I was insecure about this the other day, so I asked them in dms, if they thought I was physically attractive. 

Two of them (Taylor and Jasper) said that they didn't care about bodies, and it was about personality. 
The other two said that they were attracted to me physically.

Jasper said that he wasn't really sexually attracted to me physically, but more my words.

"AITA for not flagging down the school bus for a special needs kid First off, I'm a male, and a widow. My child only has me as a guardian, and I don't really put myself in risky situations. I hung up my super hero cape a long time ago.

The weather at the bus stop was atrocious today. Two inches of slush on the sidewalk and street, puddling water and rain. The district should have cancelled school, but was the only district in the county to not do so.

The sidewalk itself was the worst, so I actually walked my kid on the street because it had been recently plowed. My child climbed on the bus and I was positioned at an approximately 5 oclock, roughly 20 feet from the door. The children had all gotten on the bus, and the bus was sitting with it's door open for 20 seconds. It could close the door and drive away at any moment. Deep puddles and slush between the door and I. Traffic both behind the bus, and in front, waiting to go. I also had basically business casual shoes on that were not appropriate for the conditions.

I hear another parent behind me say ""2 more coming!"". And I turned and looked, and this woman with her special needs child was slowly coming down the street. I tried my best to yell through the open door that two more were coming, but the wind, rain, and bus engine drowned me out. So I gave up, and started walking back.

The dad who had yelled ""2 more coming"" then ran past me through the slush, and basically was beating on the door, but the driver didn't stop, and started moving.

As I was walking back, the other parents were kind giving me weird looks. And the woman whose kid missed the bus looked at me and said something like ""People have no idea what it takes for me to get these kids out the door in the morning, and only care about themselves.""

"AITA for raising my boyfriends rent A little background, I (43f) have been dating my boyfriend (50m) for 7 years now. 3 years in to our relationship we decided to cohabitate. The house is in my name, I paid the down payment (from sale of my previous house), appraisal, and inspection fees. Pay for all of the upkeep on the house, manage all bills, groceries, house cleaning, etc He basically has no skin in the game, has his own landscaping business ( so work is seasonal)-basically helps with no housework, just the upkeep of the yard work during the summer.  When we initially moved in, the house payment was a little over $1200/month, I told him $800 would cover his half of the bills. He threw a fit saying he should only have to pay $600, but ended up agreeing $800 was ok. Now that the cost of living, my taxes, bills, etc have increased I feel he should be paying me more $ for bills. I think $800 is more than reasonable and he couldn’t find a place as nice as we have for that much. This is a 3200 sq ft house, full finished basement We have a detached 4 car garage- which 2 of those he uses for his business stuff/storage. He thinks since my son lives there he shouldn’t have to pay that much. My son is 20 with a 3 yr old kid,  whom he pays all of the expenses for, buys all of his food, as well as his own necessities, and pays his insurance phone bill etc, he just doesn’t pay $ towards household bills. He and his girlfriend are saving up $ to buy a house for when she graduates college- which I am fine with.

"AITA for being friendly with people at the gym I (30M) am happily married to my wife (30F). We have been together for 7 years and have been married for 2 years. 

A few months ago, I joined a new local gym to get back in shape. I am not overweight but had a lot of anxiety and low self-esteem issues and my therapist suggested that exercising might help.  
I go there in the morning and there are the same 10-15 people there at that time. It's mostly a mix of older people and a few people who are very muscular and dedicated. I am friendly with everyone. I met a girl F (late 20s) there. She is very muscular and is always at the gym when I go. One day when I was working out, she approached me and told me that my form was wrong and that I might hurt myself. She showed me how to do the exercise correctly. I genuinely thought she was a trainer at the gym. Hence, whenever I had any questions, I would always go to her and ask her about stuff. Sometimes, she would advise me on how to order the exercises, etc. and we would do the same circuit training.  
We started chatting after the workout session, but we only talked about workouts, diets, etc. We never exchanged any phone numbers or socials. However, we have met regularly in the gym (4-5 days a week) for the last 2 months or so.  
During the Christmas week, my wife decided to join me in the morning. She generally goes to the gym in the evening (very infrequently), but since she had days off, we both went in the morning. F was working out as usual and staring at us. After our workout was done, I took my wife to meet F and told her that she works here and helps answer any questions. My wife thanked her for helping me out and introduced herself. F gave us a puzzled look and told my wife, I don't work here, but we (me and F) have been working out together regularly for the past 2 months and would be glad to help. We all laughed about the confusion and my wife made a point to tell her how clueless I am in social situations.  
When I went back to the gym last week, F was acting weird and trying to avoid me. I asked her what was going on and she said I was an asshole and asked why I was leading her on for the last two months. She told me I was a creep and not to talk to her again.  
I have never talked to her about anything other than workouts and asking for advice. I never flirted with her or gave any indication that I was interested. I, in fact, always wear my wedding band to the gym. So, I am really confused. Did I do anything wrong here? Why would she think I was leading her on, if I never said anything about it, or flirted with her? What are the rules for talking to people at the gym without being considered as a creep?",0.08
"AITA for charging my BIL rent to stay with us for a few months? My wife and I have been together for 6 years and married for 3. My brother in law and I are pretty close as we are only a few years apart in age and have many similar interests.

For context: I recently purchased my first house with a bit of assistance from my parents after I finally got a good job and on my feet after grad school. My wife wasn’t in a position financially where she felt comfortable with purchasing a home but I was tired of paying rent and we wanted to still live together so I am the home owner but we do live together. She pays a few bills that she can afford, and I take care of most everything else.

About a year ago my BIL moved to the city I had purchased a home in a few months after he graduated college and finally found a job. Right before the holidays this past year he was laid off. His lease was up around the same time and he was considering moving back home to try and reassess things but it’s such a far move and he was enjoying the city so much that my wife asked if he could stay with us. No big deal, we have plenty of space in the house as it’s just my wife and my dog and myself.

Initially when this came up I chatted with him about it and he said he would really appreciate it and was looking for work and had some good leads, also that in the mean time he was bartending and ubering and would be able to pay me rent, so going on the trusted persons clause I told him he didn’t need to worry about it for a month, that was December. I told him he could start paying me in January and mine you I’m not asking for a crazy amount of money because it’s less about that but more about the principle he is family but I don’t want to be taken advantage of either.

My wife told me that I’m being “terrible” and that she thinks it’s embarrassing to her and her family for me to ask him to pay rent while staying with us, he said he sees himself here for at least 3-4 months and on top of that he’s not the best house guest either. When I asked him about rent money he now acted like it was a problem when he is the one who suggested it in the first place.

I also like many things that are ""for kids"" such as shows, toys, I had a party princess at my last birthday, etc.. I know those things can be considered childish, but I am not a child.

-""a study shows 50% of men smoke so you're not quirky for smoking"" to which I responded "" whenever did I ever even slightly implied this ?I just said I got addicted"" she then said ""damn bro got mad 💀 I was jk"" it pissed me off so much then some of them started listing harmful effects of cigarettes but like basic stuff such as yellow teeth, bad lips, bad lungs stuff like that then one of them that said the thing about the study said ""Ig I'll never  talk about smoking then"" so I said something like ""I don't know if it's coming from a place of judgement or trying to help.

For the most part, she has been great. Shows up on time, the boys love her, and they typically just hang out at home and watch a movie. This past Friday, she had come a bit early and I had told her that she could take the boys out to the neighborhood playground since they were pretty rambunctious. The neighborhood playground is a maybe 3 minute walk from our house. It's small, but the boys enjoy it. She texted me an hour or so after we left and said she was taking the boys to the park.

"AITA for charging my friends for the things I brought to our shared dinner table?   One friend of mine invited me and our common close friends to their house for dinner on new year's eve and we all together discussed on what we were going to eat(different eating preferences etc) and agreed that we were going to split the expenses of those agreed choices. 
  I, on my own, since it was a celebration, decided to make a pie as a side for the table and I also got a wine. I had no intention of charging for any of that since it was my decision to bring extra things that we hadn't talk about.
  The dinner was awesome, my friend had also added some extras of their choice (some cold cuts, cheese, extra salads) and we ended up having a great time.
  When I asked my friend (who got all the food basically) what each of us owe them, they told me an amount of money that was a bit extra and when I asked them what costs so much, they told me that their preferable extras that they added on their own were included in the split expenses.
  I felt it was a bit unfair and rude of them to ask everyone to pay for something we never agreed on. They invited us to their house and they decided to put extra stuff on the table and they asked us to pay for them? Yikes. Since they got ironic when I said that I didn't expect to get charged for things I thought were a treat (like my pie for example, that I hadn't charged anybody for because I wanted to treat my friends and I thought that this is what everybody would do as well) , I told them that I am going to charge for the wine at least. They were like ""we don't care, go on and charge us for the pie and the wine. You could have said that you had financial troubles and that you can't contribute so much to the table"". I ended up charging the wine and some amount of the pie and I still feel bad for charging my friends for something I just wanted to offer. I wouldn't mind paying if we had agreed on those extras as well but I just thought it was rude of them making choices of their own and then charging us for everything. 
Idk, iata for ending up charging everyone for what I got? (One person of the group doesn't even know what they got charged for, they just gave the money, the other one agreed to pay to avoid the conflict and the last one was on my friend's side because they actually live together so they agreed on the extras together). 

TL DR 
A friend invited the squad to their house for new year's eve. We agreed to split the expenses on the agreed food choices. I brought extras as a treat. They added non agreed food and charged everyone for that. I told them it was rude and they got ironic. I ended up charging my extras as well. Aita?",0.71
"AITA for losing my temper and snapping at a friend for what she said to me about my ex? This friend in question is someone I always clash with from time to time since we both have big personalities. The ex is from the same city as my friend (I was travelling abroad at the time) but they've never met, the only link between them is one of my friend's friends, who kind of knows my ex from a distance albeit having never spoken to her before. 

Without going into too much detail about the relationship, I felt unhappy and decided to break it off. I took a long time to heal and work on moving on after the break up, and I confided in said friend throughout that process. 

The conflict with her started when she shared me some meme about someone getting too attached after a hookup. I laugh reacted to it and asked her which one of those people I'm supposed to be (the overly attached party or on the receiving end of one?). She claimed I'm the former, and upon being asked to elaborate shared some pretty sweeping judgements about the nature of the relationship and how my ex (according to the friend of hers who knows her from a distance) didn't seem as interested in me as I was in her. 

Now, she defended this by saying that she was told it while I was still in the city, I.e when we were still going out. From my perspective, I couldn't fathom why it would even occur to her to share this information when she knows full well how long I'd taken to heal.

Not only that, but that her friend's judgement was so ridiculously speculative as to have zero basis in reality. Sure, you can make an informed judgement about the quality of a friend's romantic partner and people do that all the time, but based on some whimsical ideas you got second hand from someone who doesn't even know them themselves?? 

I was furious with her, not just because of this incident but because I felt there'd been a string of examples of her not respecting or supporting me as friends should. She's a very insensitive person and finds it hard to empathise with people, cutting people off for being too emotional because she sees them as too much of a burden. The classic hubris of avoidant types, acting like they're superior because they conceal their emotions from the outside world. 

I don't usually do this, but with all that rage built up I asked her straight up ""what the F does your friend know?"", and with her telling me to calm down suggesting I was overreacting, told her to F off. That was it. She ended the conversation telling me that she didn't feel comfortable talking to me and that it would be best if we don't stay friends.

"AITA for accidentally feeding my muslim friend a pork product? Using an Anonymous account for personal reasons. So I have a work friend, let’s call him Ryan, who is a muslim. Now I had him over for dinner and we were having burgers and fries. Im from the U.S. south and cooked everything in bacon grease cause Im unhealthy and the burgers were a hit with everyone there. Ryan especially loved them and ate like 4 burgers (they were slider size). After we were done eating he asked how I made them And I gave him detailed instructions. He immediately blew up because he can’t eat anything pork related because of his religion. I am not religious at all and had no idea this was the case. I felt awful and tried to apologize but he wouldn’t accept my apology and acted like i was trying to poison him. If I had known he had dietary restrictions I would have not used any pork products at all and I feel I should have asked.
The next day at work I get called into HR and they tell me I have to switch teams (we work in a call center where every supervisor has a team of 10-15 people) because Ryan had submitted a complaint that I am islamaphobic and if I cause any further issues I will be terminated. I tried explaining it was a mistake and I felt awful but the HR department basically just shrugged their shoulders and told me “if someone has a complaint filed against them for any reason that person needs to switch teams” this sucks because I had a great relationship with my team and supervisor and we are the highest performing at my job, but they put me on the lowest performing teams, and the way the team performs affects your monthly bonus so now I am making $300 less per paycheck and there is nothing I can do about it.

Although the pay is good I don’t agree with him working with his friends because I dont know them and I want him to work somewhere different.

"AITA for keeping my end of a deal? I (17f) have a special needs 15 year old sister. I'm rather punk and tomboyish, and she is girly and pink to an obsessive degree. She consistently asks me to ""play with her"", and I always say no. But one day, I said if she did what I said for 2 weeks, I'd play with her. And she did what I said for two weeks with no hiccups whatsoever. So I agreed to play with her.

She got ecstatic, and took me to her room where she put me in this hot-pink dress that I can only describe as ""1950s housewife style"". It had white stockings, mary janes, a pink ribbon belt forming in a bow at the back, and finished with a large pink bow matching her own that she put on the back of my head.

It was a day, she mainly had me pour tea at a tea party, but also took me on a walk, and swung with me at the playground, which was humiliating, but when she hugged me and said ""I love you sissy"", all my complaints were suddenly gone.

My mom saw me in the dress, I explained what we spent the day doing, and she got upset at me for making that kind of image of myself in public. I said we had a deal, and it was only fair. She said I'm supposed to be the responsible one, I said i was, and she sent me to my room. AITA?",0.14
"AITA for Cancelling a Trip to See My Friend? One of my best friends just came down hard on me for not making more of an effort to visit him.

We’ve been friends for 6 years, but we moved away from each other 4 years ago. We talk on the phone about every other week to catch up, and we have a lively group chat with a third mutual friend that has been active daily for the past 6 years. I enjoy his friendship most of the time.

He’s been pressuring me to come visit this month while our mutual friend would be visiting him, and I said I would try to make it out to him in OR (I’m on the East Coast). He has visited me 3 times in the 4 years we’ve lived on opposite coasts, but I’ve never visited him. Today I told him (with 3 weeks notice) that I wouldn’t be able to visit like I had hoped due to schedule constraints and cost.

I have 50% custody of my two young kids on the East Coast, and on the weeks that I don’t have custody, I live with my husband in CA. So I am back and forth between coasts a lot, which is tiring and expensive. I have not been on a vacation since my husband started working in CA. I basically only get to see my husband 12 days a month, and I can’t get comfortable sacrificing 2 of those days to go visit a friend right now.

When I tried to explain to him why I just couldn’t swing the visit with him, he said I was neglecting our friendship, deprioritizing him unfairly, and failing to set healthy boundaries with my husband by not insisting that my husband quit his job in CA and come home. I would LOVE it if my husband worked close to home, but I haven’t been able to convince him to do that, and I don’t want to pull any dramatics to force him to. I would also LOVE to visit all my friends more, and it sucks that I feel like I can’t.

"AITA For cancelling dinner reservations on my sister (which cost her 50 dollars) I (25F) went home recently to visit my parents and my sister (25F). For Christmas, we were planning on doing “event gifts” — she was going to pay for both of us at a nice restaurant and I was going to sign us up for a painting class. 

For some background, I have had a lot of difficulties with my relationship with my sister. We do not have all that much in common. I am much more introverted and do not like loud or crowded activities, while she is the opposite. Basically the three activities we usually do together is go to movies,  go to restaurants, or go out drinking. The latter can be a problem because I like quieter places where you can talk and she likes clubs/loud bars/karaoke/etc. 

One repeated problem is that when we go out, when I am ready to go, she will refuse to leave the bar/club/whatever and then won’t come home. This happened the first time in London when we were 19 — she wanted to stay out and I wanted to leave, and after I went back to the hotel she did not come back until the next afternoon. This was scary for me because we were in a different country, I was alone, and she did not return my texts until hours later. She did this again when she visited me in college and then again when she visited the state where I work. I have mixed feelings about going out with her — on one hand, it’s when we learn the most about eachother and gives her a chance to vent, on the other, if she refuses to leave and then doesn’t come back, I feel extremely anxious.

In the present day, on my trip back home, the first couple days seemed great and we got along. She has been having a rough time and recently quit her job. I felt like she might need to vent and we decided to go out. Around midnight after we visited a couple places, I did not want to go in to the louder clubs/bars that were still open and got an Uber back to our parents house. She said she wanted to stay. I was tired from previous experiences of arguing with her and wanted to just go home, so I did. She was gone for the next day and a half (from midnight to around 11 the day after). Her disappearing made me worry about the restaurant we were going to — it was downtown, the plan was to get drinks and maybe go other places. I did not want her to randomly disappear twice on what was supposed to be a vacation for me, so I cancelled and explained that her not coming home made me anxious. She got mad because she had to pay a fee to the restaurant for the reservation and said it was a mean thing to do. AITA?",0.4
"AITA for ""being a bully"" to girls objectifying me because of my looks at school? This got removed for being too long, so im being a bit choppier with my explanation and leaving out some random details i had added before, because itll be a easier read than the super long thing i had typed out lol, ill answer questions in the comments as fast as i can though.

I, 16F, am new to a very rural tiny school in a tiny farming town surrounded by other farming towns. Im goth, and i hang out with people that arent goth because thats literally all there is really, and i get along with them very well and i love them.

&#x200B;

 Ever since ive moved to this tiny (like 20 kids in the highschool grades) school, these two girls who are sort of outliers, discord furry kind of weird girls, keep badgering me about how im so cool and “emo” and how theyd look so cool hanging out with me, and that I dont belong with “basics” and just a bunch of really cringy things. They badger me almost every single day, and essentially objectify me. I hate it, it makes me feel like they want me to be a silent accessory because every time they approach me its about my appearance or its insulting my friends. We would not get along at all, from what theyve spoken about around me I honestly despise these girls and i hate them more for how they treat me like a glorified purse despite how hard i try to get away from them and stay with my own friends, and they insult my friends so damn much, talk about how i dont belong with them and how its so sad im turning “basic” whenever i show up to school in something comfy and not a super gothic outfit like i do sometimes. 

&#x200B;

My friends have seen them take photos of me multiple times, and even send them to a discord chat once. They sit there across the room and just discuss my outfits, my hair, my makeup, etc loudly as if im a doll and nothing more, and take photos of me like my privacy doesnt matter. I told them firmly to stop, that i didnt like them and they made me wildly uncomfortable and tried to point out how wrong it was to treat someone like that and got suspended for a day for “bullying”. So ever since then, me and my friends have just been straight mean to them. They come up to me, i tell them i hate them and walk away. They badger my friends, i tell them theyre the basic ones and leave. I groan loudly every time they approach me and i just try my hardest to show them i DONT LIKE THEM while taking out my frustrations on this situation by being rude back, but i keep getting in disciplinary trouble for bullying, and so are all my friends. Im honestly sick of this, and my mom thinks im in the right but every teacher thinks the poor girls just admire me, even though i didnt sign up to be worshipped by freaks.

"AITA for not telling anyone what my mother wanted at her funeral, as it would have been so expensive? My mother wanted a very particular funeral, and only communicated this with me. When she passed, I didn't share her wishes with her partner as they were very extravagant and I knew he would want to do all of it. We planned a beautiful funeral for her, but it wasn't exactly as she had described to me and a few features were missed out.

This was months ago, but I recently accidentally told him in conversation that she had told me she wanted something at her funeral. Something that he was unaware of at the time, and something that we didn't do for her.

He blew up in a rage and has said my mother must be turning in her grave to know that I didn't act upon her wishes and do what she had asked. He is livid with me for withholding this information from him and hasn't spoken to me since.

"AITA for telling my SO he and his friends can’t drink in our baby’s room? For reference, we live in a humbly sized 3 bedroom, 2 bathroom apartment. One room is our room with an attached bathroom, the other room is my daughter’s room (she’s 10), and the last room is a shared space being a nursery and my SO’s office so he can keep an eye on baby while he works late on his projects. 

Well, lately he’s been having his friends over and they always end up hanging out in the nursery/office. Which isn’t what was agreed upon or mentioned but I’ve let it go. Until last night when he had his friend over and they were drinking from midnight to almost 0400 in the nursery/office. 

Now, baby isn’t here yet. She’s due in March of this year. But because I’m a high risk pregnancy I run the risk of delivering early so we’ve been working on setting out baby’s area just incase. 

My SO is very strict about everyone needs to respect each other’a spaces in the apartment including shared spaces like the living room, kitchen, nursery/office, etc. 

I got frustrated today and let him know I am not okay with him and his buddies drinking in our baby’s room. He said it doesn’t matter because baby isn’t here yet so that’s his room until baby is here. Which …goes against the notion that that’s mainly baby’s room with a shared office space. Not an office with a shared baby area. 

So … with all that being said AITA for being frustrated that he and his buddies are treating the baby’s room as a hang out/drinking area?  Because according to my SO I’m being irrational and ridiculous for being upset about that.

To add more info:

My daughter and I have been told that room must remain clean and well kept because it’s baby’s room. We’re not allowed to eat in it because he said baby could choke on the crumbs … baby isn’t here yet and crumbs can be cleaned off. But also that’s a shared office area between him and I. I’m allowed to do work in it because it’s, “also your office.” 

We’re also not allowed to drink any drinks in there that aren’t in a water bottle incase they accidentally spill … because him and his friends have cups and glasses of alcohol in there.",0.22
"AITA for Suggesting an Indian Bat Mitzvah for my Daughter? I(46F) was raised in in the Hasidic community in Brooklyn. I decided to be less religious in my 20’s when I met my husband who is reform and now we’re more modern orthodox.

Me and my husband couldn’t have kids naturally so we did IVF twice and decided to adopt our third and Hashem led us to India. We adopted our beautiful baby girl just over 10 years ago now.
 
We live in a super diverse community and make sure to stay connected to the local Indian community. My close friend who is indian got us into an Indian playgroup right when we adopted her and she’s stayed friends with all of the kids so she has a good Indian friend group as well as her Jewish friend group at her private school.

She will be 13 in August and her bat mitzvah date is in September, we love all the Indian weddings and events we go to and I suggested her bat mitzvah incorporated aspects of her Indian culture as well. Basically the ceremony would be Jewish but her party would be held in an Indian wedding style, very big, beautiful dresses, amazing food etc.

She loved the idea but we’ve gotten some pushback. My daughter said her Indian friends said it was a weird idea and she should just “be Indian at her sweet 16” and her Jewish friends were a little more into the idea but didn’t want to be culturally appropriative with the dresses. My aforementioned best friend thinks it’s a good idea as well but says I should be prepared for people to not show up specifically from the Indian community. 

I don’t know what to make of this. I didn’t grow up in this type of Jewish community so I didn’t really know this type of thing for adopted or bi cultural children wouldn’t be customary since I didn’t know any multi cultural people growing up. I don’t want to offend anyone and even if it isn’t inherently offensive I don’t want to put people off.

Yesterday was one of those days. I stopped off at a store and bought like $35 in snacks and took them home for my GF(29F) and I. Right now my girlfriend is on a diet. It's her resolution. According to her she's 45 pounds overweight. To her credit, she's stuck with the diet thus far.

When I brought home snacks, her attitude was "" I really shouldn't"", then it became, "" Oh it couldn't hurt"". So, we end up eating all of these snacks and by the end, she's pissed off, saying she feels fat. She claims I deliberately messed up her diet by bringing snacks home. I told her that I didn't force her to eat anything and told her it isn't my fault she lacks will power and feels fat.

She says I'm awful for telling her she lacks will power and she said I was out of line for saying "" fat"".

"AITA for wanting to have my wedding between two of my sisters weddings? I (22f) just got engaged Christmas Eve of 2023. My fiancé and I do not want a super  long engagement and are looking at a late May or early June of 2025 wedding. I am the youngest of 5 siblings and my oldest sister (30f) got engaged Easter 2023 and her wedding is September 2024(let’s call her Kim). My other sister (23f) got engaged September 2023 and is planning to have her wedding late September or early October 2025(let’s call her Kendall).
I asked my sisters and pretty much all of my immediate family how they felt about this date considering I know it is close to their weddings and stressed I didn’t want to upset anyone. I also stressed that everyone deserves their moment and I don’t want to hurt anybody but I also added that my fiancés grandma is ill and that my fiancé and I both want his grandmother to be at are wedding because it would mean a lot to the both of us. 
My sisters both gave me the same look when I told them the date range I want my wedding with their eyes wide open at first. (I talked to them all separately). 
My oldest sister Kim replied by saying that pretty much “you do you” but it comes down to all the things in between the weddings that you have to pay for and that I should really think about it and talk to my sister Kendall. 
Then I talked to another sister I have(26 f) who’s already married and currently pregnant(let’s call her Kourtney). Her response was more cut throat. She basically said i should have to wait til 2026 to get married. Also added that I would feel like shit and my sister Kendall  would feel like shit if some of are up north  relatives came to my wedding and didn’t come to hers. This response from Kourtney made me feel very sad and upset especially how shitty her tone of voice was about it.
I then talked to my mom about it and my mom basically said to me that my fiancé and I should do whatever we wanted to do. My fiancé says the same things to me.
I then get around to talking to Kendall about the wedding date ideas. My sister Kendall is completely shocked and upset. She said my wedding would be to close to hers and then talks about relatives not coming to hers because they came to mine. I bring up my fiancés grandmother and her condition and she said “ so your gonna wait til 2025 but can’t wait til 2026”. I quietly just say “it’s just an idea” about the date because I was shocked from how upset she was.

"AITAH for not no longer wanting cats in the dorm? Freshman in college in a small dorm with one other roommate. We are not allowed pets unless registered ESA. We get along well, but last semester she said her parents were giving away her cat and that she was really upset about it. I sympathized and said that I wouldn't mind the cat coming up for a week or so if she wants to find a new home for it herself so she can make sure it goes to a good one.

One night she said that after winter break she was bringing her cat up, didn't ask, just that she was bringing it up. And when I was taken aback, she threw in a ""if it's ok with you."" I'm not good at confrontation at all, especially since we didn't know each other beforehand and I don't wanna piss someone off when I have to live with them in the same room for the next 5 months. I laid some rules down but ultimately said that as long as she took care of it and ensure we didn't get caught, I was hesitant but ok with it.

Well, winter break ends in a week and she texts me ""hey don't be mad, but I might actually be bringing 2 cats."" What. I said that in that case, she'd have to change the litterbox like everyday, and also, she visits home every weekend, how the heck is she going to transport them? I'm not gonna be responsible for the cats, and sometimes I go home on weekends too. Not to mention if we get caught with the cats we can possibly get evicted.

I just think it's bad planning and inconsiderate, and slightly unfair to the cats, while we might have bigger dorms than some colleges it's still a small space for just 2 people, without 2 other cats. Also I have no clue what the cats are like, are they gonna like me? Are they gonna get into my stuff or pee on my stuff?

It has been great but the last 2 months Jane has been really pushing my buttons. It’s all little stuff that is irritating me but it’s all just adding onto each other. Jane has been super rude with every conversation we have. It almost sounds like she tries to make me look stupid with every conversation we have. She always tries to make smart remarks to me that are unnecessary. The last 2 weeks she has been making comments about how I parent my kids and how she can do it better. When she attempts to try and do it better the situation goes exactly how I said it would and she makes some stupid remark about it. She pays minimal rent $200 a month and this includes everything. All utilities, water, trash, meals, wifi( my husband and I pay these). She even uses our Netflix and Hulu. She doesn’t pitch in towards groceries. She eats majority of meals I cook unless it’s something she doesn’t like then she orders out. If we eat out she will ask me to order for her while I am on the phone placing an order. She tells me what she wants last minute and I order it for her. When I tell her the total she pays me very little of it or never at all. For example we got take out 2 nights ago and the total was $67 and her share of the bill was $35 she only paid me $10 of this total. She rarely helps with shared chores like dishes or cleaning the kitchen and leaves it to me. My husband helps cook but I do most of our cooking and then dishes as I go. It’s exhausting, we all work full time and we have came up with a schedule for laundry. She does hers on Saturday and mine on Sunday. She sometimes forgets to do laundry Saturday and then pulls my wet clothes out of the washer and dryer to do hers on Sunday. She moved out of college and straight into my house. She has been acting like a moody teenager and being disrespectful. In our state recreational weed is legal and she is a big smoker. She constantly is just smoking weed when she is home I don’t care how she spends her past time but it affects the way she helps around the house and how she treats me. I want to sit down with her and discuss my thoughts and issues with her and see how we can change our living arrangement where she is helping out more?

"AITA for “bullying” my coworker and getting the whole office to ignore him? (20f) did a  year of low paid volunteer work. The place where I worked was great at first. We were four people who were working in the office space and I got along great with the other two women there (about 30f and 17f). Sadly my third coworker (about 60m),who was actually supposed to be my mentor, acted really hostile to me from the get go.
He messed with my work, publicly humiliated me multiple times for small mistakes, made racist and sexist comments towards me and coworkers, as well as sexually harassed and body shamed a 17 year old. I can give examples for every behavior I listed but I have to watch the character limit.

My last straw was when he screamed at me and physically intimidated me because the whole team put up a set of office rules which he didn’t like. I tried to calm the situation down while he screamed for 20 minutes and ranted about “how nobody values his hard work”. He actually screamed at me and got closer to me until I started crying and locked myself in the bathroom out of fear. He then lied to everyone and said he never raised his voice but admitted to it after being face to face with me, only to proceed to say that I somehow manipulated him into screaming at me and was therefore at fault.

We always reported his behavior but management always found excuses for his behavior. He never even once got any backlash for how he acted and never faced any real consequences. Even after the last incidents they did nothing. Here comes the part where I might me the asshole: After the last mentioned meeting I started completely ignoring him. I didn’t make any eye contact tact with him and didn’t answer him when he tried to speak to me. I always just told him he should write an email if he has anything to say to me. The others quickly followed my example and soon when he entered the room he was just met with dead silence until he left. I know this is harsh but we just couldn’t handle his behavior anymore. I got away from that place about 3 months ago but the situation has not gotten any better and I’m feeling horrible for my female coworker who is still stuck with him and I’m honestly scared that he’ll snap one day and actually hurt someone after his breakdown in front of me.

"AITA For not helping my dad with the barn? I (nb 19) have 4 horses I take care of and show, my dad (m67) is a carpenter and has built most everything around our property including our barn however there is one flaw in the barn, it’s a dirt floor barn and it floods, heavily. We managed to get the flooding under control but now because of the water the dirt floor was rock hard and very uneven, I’ve been asking my dad since may of 2023 if he can help me fix the floor and level it and he’s said ok I will later since may and still hasn’t been able to help me. Come to today, the weather is miserable rainy and cold but I can’t bring the horses in the barn cause I can barely walk across the floor without twisting an ankle so instead I just make sure they have plenty of hay and leave them outside (side note there’s also a run in shed in the pasture they were so they can still get out of the rain). My dad saw they were out and got furious that I refused to put them in the barn, I reminded him of the floor situation and he got even more furious that I, a 19 yr old Afab kid with no knowledge of how to fix it , didn’t fix it earlier so in his rage he went to his workshop built some kind of makeshift rototiller and fixed the floor. He didn’t tell me he was building this tool nor did he tell me he was working on the barn otherwise I absolutely would’ve dropped everything to help him. Now my mothers gotten involved and informed me my dad fixed the barn and went to rural king to retrieve shavings and is furious I didn’t help him! I didn’t know I was supposed to. I laughed and informed my mother of everything I’ve told you all and reminded her I’ve been a voice in his ear about this for months and it’s not my fault he waited to the last possible minute and didn’t communicate to anyone about it. Me and my father aren’t currently speaking and my mom agreed that his communication skills are horrific but that I was just supposed to know to help him. I’m lost. AITA?",0.21
"AITA for telling my husband he spends too much money on his family? My husband and I have been married for a year, and we were in a relationship for a decade before that. He has always been the financial support for his family, taking on the role of a big brother. Unfortunately, his dad passed away when he was a child, and his mom remarried but has been separated, he has a sister and two step-siblings. What concerns me is how he manages expenses even now that we're married. About five years ago, they purchased a family house and a car. My husband covers most of the costs, around 2000 USD a month, with some assistance from his mother and none from his siblings. This amount is substantial in our country. Despite earning enough, he works multiple jobs to sustain it, and I feel sorry for the strain it puts on him. Firstly, the financial commitment is significant, exceeding what we pay for our rented apartment. We've chosen not to move to a larger space as it's unnecessary. Secondly, the siblings are all working adults who lives in the house, enjoying a lavish lifestyle, yet they contribute nothing to the expenses. I think because they have expected my husband to cover for them. When I discussed this with my husband, he perceived it as an attack on his family. AITA?",0.69
"AITA for telling my friend to shut the fuck up? Okay so context. I (20F) and my friend (18F) go to music conservatory together, we’re both singers. There was a weekly jam session in the concert hall so we went. Later in the evening after everyone was done playing, everyone just hung out with some drinks and some background music played. Suddenly a song comes on that my friend knows so she starts singing a long VERY loudly , to the point were everyone around us turns around looking irritated as fuck and moving to tables further away. I politely asked her to be a bit quieter since people didn’t nt appreciate it. Instead of doing so, she started singing even louder , practically screaming. Im embarrassed at this point and asked her 2-3 more times to stop nicely. She refused and continued to the point some people even walked out. Now im irritated as well so I just blast out “can you shut the fuck up?” She didn’t take it so well, called me a bitch and said i was ruining some harmless fun and stormed out. Am I the asshole after Everyone else was clearly annoyed and i already politely had asked her multiple times to respect the room? Let me know",0.02
"AITA for yelling at a kid and his family (random people) when the kid kept taking my food? Yesterday, I got a busy at work to the point that I skipped lunch. So after work I went to my fav Mexican restaurant around the corner of my place to eat. I ordered a rice bowl, 3 tacos and nachos. There was a family that already there and the kid kept running around the restaurant. So the kid came to my table 3 times: The first time he took a piece of nacho out of the blue, the second time I saw him running toward me so I gave him another piece, the third time he came back I told him I can't give him food since I didn't want him to come back again and again. He tried to reach his hand out but I took the food away before he could take it. (His parents didn't seems to care and he only tried to take the food from my table only)

Then I got up to refill the drink and this time the kid did a snatch and grab one of my taco. I chased him to his table and told him to give it back (did raise my voice a little). His parent was like why are you yelling at our kid? He just like to play so let him play. I pointed to the fact that he took my food but they said just let it go. At this point I just couldn't take it anymore and started swearing at them, things escalated to almost physical altercation between me and the dad before the owner stepped in. He told me to be calm, offered to pack my leftover and asked me to leave (we knew each other so I know he just try to cool me down). 

AITA here? I knew that I lost my temper but could probably handled it better if the parents at least discipline their kid or apologize.

"AITA for not signing my friend's Permanent Residence support letter? For context, There's 3 parties involved:

1. me
2. my gf (we'll call Janice)
3. my friend (we'll call Fred)

Fred is looking to get permanent residence via spouse/family sponsorship (as per our country's PR guidelines) and asked Janice and I to give supporting letters that he and Shannon are living together under common-law.

They really aren't, but he's individually asked us each to write a letter for him.

He asked Janice first as they were work-friends before her and I got together, and then asked me afterwards.

Janice and I talked about it and we both said no: we feel it's lying on what could possibly be legal documents and don't want to assume that risk.

Fred said all his other friends signed the documents and offered him extra help with the letter.

Now he's upset at Janice because he supported her with her decisions and disappointed how she's not showing up the same way and says to not get involved in his life.

To be fair, I refused to write any supporting letter because I felt like he was asking specifically for the common-law angle. Me, being very risk-adverse and abide-by-the-rules, saw only the legal implications (perjury), which is what led to my refusal and my gf to follow suit.

Looking online, I've seen examples of support letters that don't even mention marital status. I guess I jumped the gun with my decision and didn't do any research, and now here we are.

So... am I the asshole?

Edit 1: forgot to mention that Shannon is Fred's gf and a citizen of our residing country, so she plans to sponsor Fred's PR application as a common-law partner, which our country allows, as long as there's proof of there being a common-law, such as a rental lease agreement with their names on it, joint bank account statement, or even a driver's license showing the same address, to name a few pieces.

For some additional info, Fred texted me saying he ""needs a letter from a friend for common-law"" and that he'd write it down using AI for me to check before I sign off on it. I said I wanted more information about the common-law process, to which he replied he just needs a letter from a friend that shows him and Shannon are dating.",0.11
"AITA for telling my good friend (f20) that if she wanted to lose weight, she had to eat healthier and exercise? Basically, my friend and I have been friends since middle school. We are all f20.  We survived all odds of public school with each other lol. I need to give initials to the story to make sense. So the girl I’m speaking about, the one I told this too, we can call her H. My best friend, who we hang out with often, we can call her N. H has a long time boyfriend that we can call B. 

  So basically, H has always been a bigger girl. Since getting to be adults, I would say she is 60-80 lbs overweight, just for context. She is a pretty girl, very likeable, like I said my best friend. Weight is the last thing I ever notice about her. 

  Except for the fact she brings it up. All. The. Time. 

  I mean all the time. 

 Beach, shopping, over text at night, group chats discussing birthdays, you name it, she’s mentioning her weight in a negative light. B, her boyfriend, has expressed to me before privately that her weight doesn’t bother him, but her constant complaining about it does. She cried to him often about it. Now, H is active. She goes to the gym semi regularly and used to be very active in CrossFit. But she eats horribly. And I don’t mean to be rude but she really does, fast food for at least two meals a day, large portions, all that. 

  So the other day, we are at the beach, and she points to our other friend, N (who is stick thin) and says “I wanna be like you how did you lose your weight?” Because N used to be heavier than she is. Not overweight but she had gotten skinnier. N admits that she lost a lot of weight very unhealthily and that she shouldn’t do what she did. 

  So H points to me and asks what I do to stay in shape. I tell her that my job is 80% active, so it helps, but other than that I run and try to eat healthy. Which is true and she knows that. I said “H, if you are serious about losing weight, come run with me at my gym! I’ll also show you what I eat because I have a few low calorie meals that are actually pretty good. It’s 90% your diet if you want to lose weight and I can show you how to get a better one?”

  H lost her shit. Crying, offended, and hadn’t spoken to me in DAYS. B, the boyfriend, said that I was extremely rude to her and it seems like H is twisting the story to make it sound like I was meaner than I was. 

  I genuinely wasn’t trying to be mean at all and have apologized multiple times. AITA for this?",0.25
"AITAH for “taking money from a friend” Don’t want to make this too long so it’ll be short and sweet. 
My inept friend (call him J) asked me to borrow $200 last September to cover his portion of a bday dinner tab. I kept asking for it and he kept telling me “I’ll get it to you” or “give me some time to get my shit together and I’ll get it to you”. I got tired of asking and after 3 months I learned that J is owed some money by another friend (call him C) who is also a good friend of mine. I decided to be petty and told C to give me 200 from the money he owed J and to give him the rest and that J said it was cool. C believed me and gave me the money. Now J is mad at me because he is down 200. I told him to suck it and haven’t spoken to him since. I know lying was a dick move but I don’t really feel like an asshole. So, AITAH?

"AITA for networking at bars? TLDR: AITA for networking at bars while my friend picks up men?

I (29F) am a real estate agent. My company has been around for decades and gets a lot of business primarily in the commercial and multi family home markets. For the last couple years I’ve been assisting and learning the ropes. Now that I have a license of my own, I want to build my own client base and start earning commissions.

I am already a member of several local professional clubs, but they don’t seem to be yielding any business prospects. My goal for 2024 is to find clients— aka wealthy people looking to invest in rental properties.

My friend (30f) Amy is single. She’s successful, beautiful and educated. She doesn’t want to use the apps, but isn’t sure where to find eligible bachelors in real life.

We decided we’d team up and hit the happy hour circuit at swanky bars downtown. The theory is that this is where we may have some luck finding business men and women. She’d look for a husband, I’d look for clients. 

My husband (31M, Richard) thinks this is disrespectful. He says I’m using business as an excuse to talk to men. He says it’s not a question of trusting me, it’s a question of respect.

"AITA For not initiating after a female coworker rejected me? M26 So about a couple of months ago there was this new chick who started working at my job. We would talk quite often and at first I wasnt sure if she was aporoachable then I noticed she gave me the textbook ""Look"" where a woman stares at a guy she likes then darts her eyes away with a smirk. She did this more than 4 times and previously outside of work when this happened combined with being smiley and forthcoming towards me the woman was into me and we always progressed. So I decided to ask for her number, she said her phone was off (obvious lie) but instead of confronting her I just said ""Oh.....ok"". 
I figured since she rejected me in that way she didn't  anything to do with me so I took the L and accepted I did something wrong and tried to distance myself to avoid making her uncomfortable. I would only talk to her if she talked to me. I did this for about a week and there was an instance where there was a cashier that would be right next to her and I would chat with the other cashier and not her. After a week she confronted me and said I was being distant and "" we never talk anymore"". I blew her off and dismissed it. Its been a month now and she always comes around to my department to chat but I keep it short.I can tell it makes her really upset which is not my intention but I'm not trying to get accused of harrassment so it is what it is.",0.71

I've been called a redneck a few times since I wear a cowboy hat, like fishing, hunting country music etc. I don't really like the term but whatever.  

I was driving my girlfriend's friends back and forth after we went tubing down a river, I have a large van so I could transport multiple people and tubes. There was like 30 of us, most of them are people from my girlfriend's group. While I was driving them I had my music playlist on and it played the ballad of the Alamo by Marty Robbins. After the song finished a guy in the car, who is my girlfriend's boyfriend said ""are you going to play anymore racist music or is that all?, do you have an issue with Mexicans or Latinos? you know we live on stolen land right?""

I responded back ""I am a Tejano, I am an 9th generation Texan, I've had family here since 1800, my family sided with the Texan revolutionaries, alongside many other Tejanos because the Mexican government was a tyrannical dictatorship, shut your fucking mouth there is nothing racist about that song, its my car and I can play any music I like and If you don't like that then you can shut your fucking mouth, I don't want to hear anymore of this bullshit woke crap""

"AITA to ask my BF why his son was on his phone before bed ? Hi !

Little context here.
I (32f) have been dating my BF (30M) for almost 4 years. He has a son who is 12yo (let's call him Liam).

There has been some problems in our family (mainly because of Liam's mom) so Liam has had trouble going to school. We went to a therapist who made Liam agree to a before sleep routine where he had to stop screen time 1h before bed and read a book or a comic instead to help his sleep. (English is not my first language so I hope you understand what I mean)

It did not last one month.

On Sunday, before bed, I saw Liam watch a video on his phone as he was trying to sleep. I asked my BF and he said that it was ok because tomorrow he began school later. I asked if he decided to stop what the therapist suggested and he said no.

So on Monday, when the same thing happened, I asked again the same question to my BF and he told me I was annoyin (he thinks I nag too much at his son but I did not nag Liam, I only talked to his dad about it).

I don't think I'm annoying as it's my way of being concerned about Liam's wellbeing...

"AITA for keeping an infidelity a secret? For context, I (20 male) found out a couple of days ago that my friend's (20 female) boyfriend has been cheating on her. There are many reasons why I haven't brought myself to tell her the truth, which my friend who happened to be present during the moment we realized it, finds not valid at all and says I'm an asshole for not telling her. 

We have been friends for a year now and we met in college, we have been through a lot together since we share the same classes and we are majoring in a very difficult career. There was a time when we liked each other and kinda had a little something, nothing serious tho, it didn't work out. I know how hard things have been for her when it comes to boys matters, so I was happy for her when she found her (now cheating) boyfriend. 

Now that you guys know a little more, you might think about all the possible scenarios I have created in my head of things that could happen if I tell her, and all of them go wrong, for starters, I don't have physical proof of it, it'd be my word (the word of a guy who used to like her) and the voice of the guy who she currently trust and love. 

also, for context, this is how I found out; I was at the supermarket right behind the campus when he got in with a girl and she asked him if he had a girlfriend and his instant response was no, he doesn't. When he saw me and my friend he realized he kinda fucked up, but he thought we didn't hear it. Now he's planning to propose to my friend (that's what he's been telling all her friends) and I'd feel HORRIBLE if she says yes to someone who doesn't value her and neither respect her, but I don't feel like taking that risk for obvious reasons.

"AITA for Clashing with My Boyfriend Over Wedding Size? I (25F) and my boyfriend (25M) have been together since we were 15, and recently, our discussions about marriage took a sharp turn due to conflicting views on our wedding size. I prefer a small, intimate gathering with close family, while he insists on a large, traditional Indian wedding. 

He argues that I'm just a loner who doesn't understand the significance of a grand celebration and the importance of human connections in our culture. While there's truth to it, My aversion to large crowds runs deeper. I've never explicitly shared my anxiety with him but im sure he must have noticed. I mean he has known for more than a decade after all.The mere thought of being on a stage surrounded by thousands of people makes me nauseous.

Besides i ha've witnessed relatives causing delays or even bringing weddings to a halt, creating chaos that I find incredibly distressing. And there are aspects like dancing that don't align with my preferences. I've expressed these concerns to my boyfriend, who dismissed me saying that I create ""stupid reasons"" to support my side of argument. He suggested that I come up with more creative arguments if I'm trying to make a point. My bf is adamant about having a large celebration.

Even if I were to compromise, the social expectations would likely make the experience overwhelming. Considering my boyfriend's wild social energy, people would be put off by my closed off energy. I'm Certain that I'd have people asking me to loosen up. I absolutely don't want to hear those on my wedding day. 

Moreover, we have differing priorities regarding family orientation. While he is very family-oriented, I prioritize our relationship above all else.

It's been two nights since our last conversation, and we haven't spoken. He usually drops by my apartment, but that hasn't happened recently and I haven't reached out either.

We were talking about how expensive the housing market is and he said he was looking into buying a home. I asked him how he is going to afford the house he wanted (which was around $500k) and he said ""my parents are going to give me the money for the down payment and I'm pretty sure my grandparents will help me with the mortgage because they're old and don't use their money"". I asked him how he was going to get a mortgage without the income to afford the home/mortgage and he said he was going to have his parents cosign. On another occasion he invited me to this event and I said I could not afford to go. He said ""it's only $60"". At another point he went on vacation while unemployed and I asked him how he could afford to travel and he said his parents covered the entire cost of the trip for ""family bonding time"". He will waste food at restaurants and when I ask him if he is going to wrap it up and take it home for later he will say it's trash and won't eat it later. His father worked in a pretty high position for a company and so he has gotten many jobs due to association but has lost them all because he knew the right person but did not have the right skills. When he was unemployed he said his parents were paying his rent and he was waiting to find the ""perfect"" job and was in no rush to just take what he could find in the meantime. His parents also fully paid for his university and he wonders why I cannot afford weekly $60 outings due to debts. 

At one point I was unemployed and took a minimum wage retail job to make ends meet and he asked me ""why can't you just ask your parents for money?"" or ""why can't you just move back in with your parents?"". I finally told him that I am happy for him that he has the safety net that he does but not everyone has that and he sometimes acts out of touch with the things he says.

"WIBTA for telling my dad to do his own laundry I'm 15F & my dad is 44M, I do my own laundry and have since probably like 10 or so years old. Most if not all of the time I do all of my washing myself  
  
a few weeks ago i put his washing in a basket and put it in his room. Later when he got home he noticed I had hung up my washing and asked me what I did with his. I told him it's in his room & he asked me why his washing wasnt folded in an irritated tone, I told him I didnt think I had to,he said he had mentioned this to me before & he raised his voice telling me it's polite and I should do it bc he does it for me out of the kindness of his heart so I should do it for him (he doesnt  do it for me, I srsly cannot recall a single time within the last year that he has taken my laundry off of the line for me and then folded it for me as well), I told him I had been busy that day & he told me i needed to ""make time"" to do it. If he asked me nicely I wouldnt have minded but its the fact that he expects me to do it, it's not like I don't already have chores, i have assigned days set the days I dont do chores are days i work and especially since being off of school I do all of my chores on my days. If he was rlly busy and needed help I'd understand but he wasnt busy, he got home from work, complained abt the laundry & then played video games. he also had 2 laundry baskets in his room alr that weren't folded & had been in there for who knows how long (this was like 2-3 weeks ago...the baskets and clothes are still there).

This is not the only instance where he basically expects me to be his slave but I won't go to to much into detail about that in this post (expects me to parent my 5 yr old sister more than he does, etc), but I'm getting sick of it because if I don't do his laundry for him it'll result in screaming matches, and I'm not overexaggerating he will begin yelling at me if I try to explain why he should be fully capable of doing it himself & if i try to defend myself it will result in me trying to talk to him and him yelling at me then me yelling back to get him to hear me which inevitably ends in screaming at each other.

I understand this isn't healthy but I'm 15 & most of the time my emotional regulation is way better than his & I'm sick of having to be the responsible one, having to be the one to walk away, having to be his 2nd housewife because other wise it'll end in a fight &I just don't have the energy.

Last time I ended up just folding it for him while he was at work bc i was too tired to deal with his bs. When he got home and saw my laundry up he asked if i had folded his,I said ""mhm"". He never responded no thank you no nothing.  
Next time I have to do my laundry I'm debating telling him that he's old enough to do it himself and it's not my responsibility, how I'm not his slave & he hasn't even done it for me and even if he says it's ""out of the kindness of his heart"" that's total bs bc it's not bc he wants to be kind, it's bc he wants something in return, for me to do it for him.",0.07

When I got home and saw it, I took a picture of it and texted it to her saying “Girl ew….that is HIDEOUS lol.” Trying to semi-playfully but also honestly I express my feelings so that she would get the hint and take it down.

She then proceeded to ignore my text, leave it on and leave the house.

I went out and turned it off and texted her to let her know I turned it off and to please decorate her room with it if she wants but I am not comfortable having a human heart shaped sign on bright, full display on the front of my house.

She texted me back saying “It’s a heart and it’s a dumb funny thing. On a smart timer like the rest of our lights. You can dislike it but like we had a pink Christmas tree and a blow up alien and it feels like you’re personally offended by a neon sign and instead of just like talking to me about it you tell me ew it’s HIDEOUS.”

And she’s right. I always let her do whatever she wants - hot pink Christmas tree, alien inflatable in the front yard for Halloween - but that’s just to keep the peace and because she was going to do it regardless.

The human heart led sign was where I draw the line. That’s why I told her it was hideous. She thinks I’m the asshole for calling it hideous instead of her being the asshole for not consulting with me now (or ever) about our decor in our shared living spaces and outside the home.

AITA here?

Edit: Just for a bit more context - before we moved in, her and I created a joint Pinterest board of decor for the house and discussed at length what we both wanted and were into. None of what I wanted or suggested has ever been taken into account since moving in. The entire house is how she wants it to be.",0.79
"AITA for refusing to pay a late fee on Rent So I am renting from my Family member, whom im very close with since childhood, My Brother and his wife. For the first time since Renting to them for about 2-3 years i was late on payment 0 backrent ever owed, it was during the hectic holidays, and i just plain forgot, and i believe they did too because no reminders or anything where done, I literally saw them at new years and nothing was said.  I should mention we are also Neighbors! it's a duplex. Anyways i got sort of an annoyed texts from my sister in law(his wife) regarding rent, and to text her right away. alright Np Ill just walk rent over real quick write a check quickly. Well when i got there I got a whole lecture about how it's my responsibility yada yada, after failing hard to joke it off by saying,"" haha yeah i guess we both forgot over the hectic holidays"" Anyways we got into it a little bit about the late fee, I was absolutely not going to re write that check. It's unfortunate too because we got a Hangout sesh scheduled with Family and friends in a few weeks, and it's been made extremely awkward over 30$ now.   


Big bro seems on the fence on whether he wants to charge me, Sister in law has gone stark raving mad about it though, and i assume he doesn't want to upset or disagree with her about it.  AITA?  


Tldr: I think im an excellent tenant, and i don't think family should sweat 30 bucks.",0.6
"WIBTA if I responded back to my estranged mother with go f yourself instead of hearing her out? I (30f) have been a estranged from my mother(56f) for a little over 3 years. I made the decision after therapy and really thinking about how toxic our relationship was. She is the type to deny or make less of bad situations instead of ever apologizing or even acknowledging, they happened. It’s pretty obvious to me and the people around her, the most that she has some sort of mental health issue that she is not taking care of and instead of reaching out for help she uses Christianity as a clutch to do absolutely insane things. I’m talking not taking a small child to the hospital who’s having an allergic reaction because she believes that God will heal that child kind of crazy. throughout my adolescence, she constantly verbally and physically abused me and my siblings. There’s just so much to unpack when it comes to all the horrible things she did to us growing up and when I went to therapy and talked about some things, I realize a lot of it was just plain old child abuse. I have tried over the years to have some sort of a relationship with her, but it would always end the same because of who she is in the fact that she is never willing to acknowledge that she really fucked up our childhood and some of her young adult years as well. anyWho, she has basically left me alone for the past three years. However, today she decided to send me a message, including a picture that talks about giving chances and forgiveness but in the text that she sent me was nothing about an actual apology. It was just I love you and I hope to talk to you more than the new year to summarize what she said. Now I have talked to my friends and partner about what to send and we’re all on different pages. My partner thinks I just should reply with a “nah” short and simple. Some friends think I should open up a line of communication. I personally want to send this,  

 
“ I don’t know why satan’s mightiest warrior is disturbing my peace before the new year even gets going. Whoever sent you that post isn’t your friend, chances to get forgiveness? you have to actually apologize for that babe. Be miserable, get therapy 🫶🏽❤️ “

"AITA not liking love you versus I love you. 

For context we’ve been together 2 years now, we’ve only ever said I love you never ever love you. At the beginning of the relationship I had said I felt like the saying “love you” was more of something you say to family and friends as it’s not as intimate and sincere as “I love you”. Which he had said he understood and it just randomly started. When I asked him why he has starting just saying love you he just he just is. No explanation and when I expressed my feelings about it I was met with just attitude. I’m kind of lost on how to feel/think about this situation!

"AITA for asking my husband to stay home? My husband enjoys hockey, as most Canadians do. He plays in a beer league and  refs from time to time. On the last day of his holidays, someone asked in a group chat if ""someone"" could ref a game for them. He decided he would at 6:45pm. I protested, saying that it was his last night home before his holiday ended, he would be home too late to help with the kids bedtime, and they wanted to spend time with their Dad as we had been busy in the morning and early afternoon, and he had just gotten home at 5 from his regular 2hr gym session. He went anyway, despite my disapproval.    
  
Today is my birthday. Birthdays have always been kind of a big thing for me. I've always enjoyed them and until recently, I declared January my birthday month because I'm special in my house. I basically only stopped because he thought it was stupid. He thinks birthdays after like 10 are silly and if you're not a kid you don't get a birthday. Which I have always objected to. He has beer league on Tuesdays. I, silly me, thought my loving husband would stay home with me, ON MY BIRTHDAY, but no. He left at 8. Again, before helping with bedtime. The kids always complain about him leaving too, and he says I'm ""poisoning"" them by making them so whiney. This is not my doing. It's just kids wanting their Dad who has been gone all day to stay at home with them and play.

"AITA for using a racial stereotype to help someone see they’re wrong? I was having a conversation with a girl and Africa was brought up. I was born and raised there so I was interested in what she had to say. She said Africa was mainly desert and it’s always hot, one of the many stereotypes unfortunately held by people in America. I tried correcting her but she insisted she was right even tho she’s never been there. Well she finally looked the topic up, and i thought she’d realized that she was wrong. She apologized and just when we were bout to move on from the topic, she said she knew all along, she’d just forgotten because apparently she’d done an assignment on Tanzania in elementary or sumn. That was when I exploded and asked her why she was trying to justify a mistake she made. She tried to explain further that that’s what she’d heard. And I asked her “I’ve heard all African Americans love watermelon, is that true?” And she tried to bring up the fact that that was a racial stereotype and all she did was talk about Africa’s weather. I tried to get her to understand that it’s the same thing because why was a desert and hot weather the first thing she thought about an entire continent. There’s no such thing as race in Africa so every stereotype held against the continent is also affects it inhabitants and vice versa unlike America where there’s a specific stereotype for each race and ethnicity. I called her ignorant which offended her quite a lot and I asked her why she’d just blindly believe whatever was told to her about other cultures when people from every other part of the world try to read and educate themselves to better understand her and her country.

"AITA for kicking my friends dog down the stairs? So I was out my new friends house for the first time and she warned me her dog doesn't like new people. Anyway I went inside and there is some stairs to the basement near the door where the dog was. It really didn't like me and started trying to bite my legs. I'm totally not for violence against animals, that's not cool and I don't do that but I didn't want it to hurt me so I kicked it away and it fell down the stairs. Turns out it also broke its leg and needed surgery for it. Now she wants me to pay the vet bill because it was apparently my fault it happened.

"AITA or always asking for gifts? Hi, I'm using a burner as my boyfriend uses reddit as well. So I guess for context me (20F) and my boyfriend (23M) have been together for 4 years, our first two years together we're really nice, our first Christmas together he got me a bunch of stuffed animals and candy, our second year together he got me more stuffed animals, I always try to get him similar things. Our third year together I asked for a used PlayStation 2 for Christmas as I like retro gaming, and when we exchanged Christmas gifts I asked for that and candy, he had asked for pajamas and candy. Since we lived together at this point (and he's not good at hiding gifts) it's like 2 weeks before Christmas and I notice he hasn't gotten me anything yet, I like at him and ask if he's gotten it yet, he told me no, a few more days pass and I get worried because I'd be a little sad to not get to open anything on Christmas so I bugged him again, at that point he told me I was entitled for thinking I deserved anything for Christmas, I ended up crying and the next few days I begged him for it. looking back I shouldn't have acted so childish, but 4 days before Christmas he ended up buying me one and it came 2 days after Christmas, I ended up really liking it and I still use it. 
This Christmas just came up and I had asked for a big fruit spread, ex dried figs, candied oranges, chocolate oranges. I really like candied fruit and stuff and I thought it would be fun to have one on Christmas, I'd also thought it'd be nice if I could share it with him and other family, he ended up telling me it was too expensive (60$) and I'd have to pay for half and set it up myself If I wanted it, I didn't mind and I did. I gave him a 40$ pair of shoes he'd been wanting for Christmas. 
Now my birthday is coming up as well as Valentine's and I told him I'd really like my nails done and dinner, and if he can afford it a new stuffed animal, I know it's a lot and would probably be over 200$ for dinner, nails, and a stuffed animal but I was hoping maybe he would do it. He ended up telling me all he does is buy me stuff and Im entitled for expecting so much on my birthday. I don't know if it's wrong to ask for things on Christmas or birthday as I'd always directly tell my parents what I'd want when holidays came, and when his birthdays come I always try to do something nice for him, ex for his 23rd birthday I bought us tickets to the zoo, ice cream, and dinner. My parents stopped giving me gifts and stuff when I turned 18 and I don't have many friends so maybe I'm just asking him for too much.",0.83
"AITA for fighting with my SO to get her life together? So some background, my SO (30) has been 'sickly' her whole life. She had had kidney failure from a young age and received a transplant.
In high-school, her transplanted kidney failed again and she was on dialysis for 7 years until she received another transplant that then failed in 2021 due to Covid. I have supported her throughout all of this and been by her side.

We've been together for going on 15 years because I can't afford the lavish wedding that she wants.

Skip forward to last night where I had enough and put my foot down because she refuses to get a drivers license and look for better employment.
She shut down entirely and just sat there twiddling her thumbs, refusing to speak or anything.

I am frustrated because she earns 1/6th of my income (which isn't that great to begin with), has no ambition to better her self, and expects me to just support her and drive her everywhere.

I must emphasize that I did not once scream at her, I told her how I feel and that's what caused her to shut down.
She's now gone on this tirade of telling her whole family of how much of an asshole I am because I refuse to drive her anywhere anymore and support her other than the medical bills (which is 1/3 of my income).

I feel as if she wants to be a housewife but whenever she's at home, she does nothing and just watches TV the whole day or plays games on her phone. I'm just exhausted having g to work constantly to carry us when she going be doing so much more to help better our situation.

But otherwise we are not sure what we are. But we look fucking white. Are family things her bio dad is a very tiny bit black. And recently Lola has made being Asian and black her whole personality.

I was hanging out with her and my friends and she turned everything I MEAN EVERYTHING into race and said if I said ""girl ur white"" she said no I'm fucking Asian and black. Also her mother had a baby who is tanner than her still white and she said she wished to be black and have his skin and that black people are racist against her. I've never seen that happen.

My bf (36M) slept next to me, so after long thinking and around 8:20 am I decided to wake him up and communicate I need him, I have tough time, I am panicking( I need to go to work, he does not). I said I have bad thoughts (tw subject) and his reaction was ‘but you were okay two days ago and went to work’…
And I lost it. I went it to meltdown mode and now I cant even look at him, and he is freaking surprised, claiming that he just asked wrong question. But for me its just the last straw.. We are together 6 years and I feel invisible, like I am annoying him because I am not a nt person.

"AITA for not giving warning my friend is going to come hang out For some context me 20f by boyfriend (D) 20m have been together since February of last year, we spent almost every second we had free together, since we had the same work schedule it was a lot of time and it was all honestly the best part of my life so far. 

We ended up getting our own apartment in July (a bit fast but i had a really bad home life and when my mom gave me a second degree burn all over my back he got us an apartment) it’s been really great and I have a place I can be happy and comfortable, however over time I’ve noticed that we only ever really hang out with his friends which I’m fine with and they like me so it’s not bad we have fun. Though I from time to time miss my friends including my best friend Sky (20m) I have known him since we were both in middle school and became close friends in highschool where he confided in me that he was gay. Me and Sky throughout the pandemic and up until I started dating D spent every day together and saw the bigger group weekly. Ive only seen him maybe 8 times since February. So today me and D got up around 1pm and Sky had texted asking if I was busy, however D went to get ready for work so I told sky I wasn’t but he’d have to go dashing with me if he wanted to hang so I could still make money. Sky lives maybe 3 minutes away so I went to tell D but he was busy using the bathroom and he was on his phone so he wasn’t listening to me. Anyways when Sky rang the doorbell D was sill just in his boxers, when I said don’t answer it’s Sky he got really cold towards me and wouldn’t talk to me and just abruptly left without saying goodbye, when he got to work he texted me saying he didn’t get why I couldn’t give him more of a warning but sadly my friends all work full time jobs and rarely have a day they can just spend hanging out so i get as much warning as he does, on the other hand we see Ds friends every week and can commonly just go over to their house whenever and they’ll be there to hang out seeing as they have part time jobs and maybe work one shift a week but in the morning as me and D both work 5pm till 1am shifts I asked him if we could talk about it when he gets home but we’ve had this talk before and he simply doesn’t understand that I really can’t give him a days warning when our plans are not guaranteed as he can be called into work at really an point 

Anyways I just wanted to know if I am the asshole  for accepting last minute plans to hang out even when he won’t try to be friends with my friends and won’t be available to babysit us

Before is a summary of our text convo verbatim.


Friend:   I’m not entertaining anyone.  And you think you know me. Lmao.  It’s 100% platonic. I have zero interest in white boys.  Although, he speaks fluent Spanish!  I have zero desire to entertain a guy in that way.  I friendzone them all.  They try, eventually, to get past the friendzone.  I lost interest or something I dunno.  I’m still on the dating apps, but I might as well delete them bc im not using them effectively.  I match, and then delete. Or occasionally chat and sooner than later, unmatch. Delete. lol.  I prefer to meet people organically and see how it plays out.  My man is in Spain.  Fuck American men.

Me:  You're wasting their time though

Friend:   I’m not wasting anyone’s time.  They not fucking married to me.  They matching with a ton of other chics too.  That’s how it works.

"AITA for planning a surprise? My partner has been complaining recently that we haven't had a nice long weekend away for a while. I remembered there was somewhere that we both really wanted to go. We live in the UK and this was a nice log cabin that looked really nice. We both had next Friday and the following Monday off work so I thought it would be a nice surprise. 

Before I booked anything I asked her if she had any plans at all for that weekend and she said no. I told her good and not to make any since I thought it would be nice for us to spend the 4 days just the two of us and she agreed. 

I booked the cabin and the transport to get us there. i knew I would have to tell her in advance since she would need to know what to pack etc so I told her I had a surprise for her and then showed her the cabin and told her I had booked it. her reaction was not great. 

She called me irresponsible for just booking it without asking her and without making sure she actually wanted to go. 

I told her that would defeat the object of a surprise and pointed out that she is the one who has been complaining about having not been on a weekend away in a while so I thought it would be nice since it's somewhere we looked at going last year and never gotten around to it.

She just said I shouldn't have done it since I shouldn't be telling her what we're doing and that she should get a say in it instead of being told what to do.

"AITA for not helping? AITA? There's a competition at my school called Shakespeare's day, and I wanted to join. But so did my friend. He's been nudging me to go with him for weeks. 

Before Christmas break I told him I don't want to go with him because it's the 1st time I'm attending. Another reason (that I didn't tell him because I thought that would get him to stop) is that I wanted to go alone because then I would only have to worry about what I want to do for it. 

Right after school break, he's back at it. And even the teacher was telling me to go with him. Yesterday she straight up asked me in front of the whole class, and I was already scared to say no to him in private because I hate confrontation. So I said yes. 

I still thought it wouldn't be too bad. We would pick a poem, learn it and it would be done with. But he wants us to write a STORY a represent it. Like a play. I told him it would be easier to just learn a poem because I'm scared to present it, even if we we're just reading it nd I would probably stutter and mess up (and I have a bad feeling I'll get so nervous I might cry).

About an hour ago he pulled out his laptop and started writing the story. I'm working for stuff for our game Dev class, and everytime he asks me something I shrug or day I don't know, because I didn't want to do it in the first place. I like him, and he's a great friend, but he's getting on my nerves with this. 

Obviously I'll help him later, I'm not gonna be a b. But I'm not gonna pretend I'm happy about it. Because I tried to not write him off completely.

"AITA for being mad about my husband planning a boys trip For context, we have two young children (3 and 4.5 YO, one of whom is suspected of being neurodivergent and is frankly hard work).

My husband has told me he wants to go on a boys trip next year overseas that will cost roughly ~$5k. In full transparency, I’m not saying he doesn’t deserve it. But hear me out.

We’ve been together 10 years and used to travel frequently before kids, often together and rarely seperate. We both travel occasionally for work but when I do, I prep meals for him and the kids for the week etc. 

Before our oldest was 1, I moved abroad to his country so we could be closer to his family. BIG adjustment for me. I have an incredibly demanding full time job and am the breadwinner and frankly take on most of the work at home (he is happy to contribute provided he is given very specific instructions and also is allocated “rest time” which is frankly another story for another day).

I think what’s really eating at me is that I’ve been desperate for us to go abroad as a family (we haven’t and mostly for financial reasons). We simply cannot afford it right now between our mortgage, increased cost of living and support our child needs and it’s left me pretty gutted. He’s well aware of this.

 I couldn’t imagine saying well I’m going to plan a trip with my friends that will cost $5k. Why do they get it when I have been asking for YEARS?! It just feels selfish. Again he’s a great, engaged dad but I don’t know how about you put that towards your FAMILY vacation first or even god forbid a few nights away with your wife (we have had exactly one night off from kids together in 5 years).

His closest friends have considerably higher salaries than him and wives that work part time or stay at home. Again, I don’t think it’d bother me as much if it wasn’t SO much money (could fly our family of 4 somewhere abroad but closer).",0.33
"AITA for ""stealing""my sisters horse I 20F started online side hustles 1 year ago and I have made a pretty good income since. My sister always wanted to have a horse and I also loved horses. I bought one for myself about 6 months ago. I called her Reina and I have to admit I don't always go horse riding. I told my sister 22F she could ride whenever she wanted and she started taking lessons on her. My sister loved Reina. At one point she tried changing her name but I did not allow it. After a while she started calling her ""My horse"" and she would frequently invite friends to ride her. I would hear it from the stable owner. I didn't think much of it until recently.

My sister came to me and said she wanted to move Reina to another stable. I asked her why and she said she wanted Reina in the same stable as her friends horse. I didn't like the idea but after all she is frequently riding on Reina and the other stable is also closer to home so I said sure. Then she said she had already arranged everything because she knew I'd say yes. I got annoyed but just let it slide. So last week I went to visit Reina and wanted to ride. Turns out my sister also wanted to do horse riding. I haven't been on Reina for 2 months or so while my sister rides like 3/4 times a week. I told my sister that I only have time that day and said she could rent a horse for that one lesson on my costs.

She then told me that I should just get off of her horse and rent one for myself if I want to ride that bad. We got in an argument and she literally yelled at me for everything. She said that I am a bad sister that I don't care about her that I am a brat and I don't deserve anything. Now our relationship always has been bad and she has always had anger issues but this reaction really pissed me off. I told her that Reina was not her horse in any sense. I pay for all her expenses. I paid for the horse and my name is the name on Reina's passport. I told her that from now on she is not allowed to ride Reina and she can either buy herself a horse or rent one but she needs to stay away from mine. My sister kept yelling and said that I am stealing her horse and that Reina doesn't even know me. She said that I am the worst sister ever and told our parents. My parents think that I am right but that I am overreacting because my sister has always had anger issues. They are saying that my sister really loves horse riding and she loves Reina. I told them she should have thought about that before disrespecting me. So AITA?

&#x200B;

Update: I see a lot of people who actually think I ride her once in 2 months. That is not true. I used to visit her 1-3 times a week but those 2 months I have been very busy. The first month I was with her really really often to create a bond and Reina knows that I am her owner. When she saw me she was really happy and did not go to my sister but she came to me. So she definitely knows who her owner is. Besides get my ass off? I have explained this in so many comments. I have been busy with work and didn't even have enough time to sleep. I love my horse and I always try to visit her but in the last 2 months I did not have any time. My life has been full with work and study. I had to travel a lot for work as well to meet new clients or projects etc. I have been doing schoolwork on airplanes. I have been working my ass off to keep up with this life and I pay thousands of dollars for Reina to be taken care of.

"AITA uncomfy bf/client relationship I (21f) have been dating my bf (22m) for about four months (long distance). My bf is into weightlifting and goes to the gym 5-6 days a week. He recently decided to start coaching for experience. He works at a health store and Lauren (20f) came in unhappy with her current coach and asked if he knew anyone who coached or if he did. He said he’d recently started, but was a beginner and that was that. She dmed him (found insta thru company) asking if he would coach her. He agreed.

I had no issue with this. However, I became slightly uncomfortable with the situation when I saw how frequently she was texting him (on snapchat, instagram, tiktok & text message) and her messages seemed overly friendly. She didn’t outright flirt with him, and I don’t necessarily understand coach/client relationships. I mentioned it and he said he understood, but she had only ever treated him as a friend. I said okay and we moved on.

Since then…
She texted him she’d gotten an extra bracelet, and wanted him to wear it to match at her upcoming meet. I voiced my concern and said I was uncomfortable with him continuing to coach her. I know he has a professional obligation to coach her until her meet, and it would be wrong for him to abandon her. He agreed and would drop her after.

She texted him and asked if he was gonna be at the gym that night. He said no he was in the city, I then texted saying “it’s my girl’s 21st birthday…out celebrating with her friends”. Maybe it’s petty, but I don’t feel it was a weird reply. Her response was okay w/ a laughing emoji.

Tonight he saw her at the gym and said he couldn’t coach her bc his girlfriend (me) was uncomfortable. She said she wanted to meet me to sort things out and he agreed. I didn’t let him finish and hung up. Since then he has kept reaching out. I have not responded to anything yet.

It feels as though his relationship with Lauren is more important than my own feelings. On top of that, I’m hurt he’d try and throw me under the bus as to say “I want to continue, but my girlfriend won’t let me”. I think this hurts more bc of previous issues.

Previous situations have involved him telling me the women he snaps are solely friends, yet several have turned out to be previous sexual relationships, flirting, wanting to hookup, etc. (before we dated). He’s said that he’d still seen them as friends, so he was maintaining a friendship. I told him this has really hurt the trust in our relationship and it feels as though he is trying to keep a backup plan incase we don’t workout. He denies this and has happened a few times and he’s always removed them.

I love him a lot and he treats me well, this has been the only issue. Am I in the wrong to be upset with the situation with Lauren (given his issue of female “friendships”)? I understand I may have read too far into Lauren and her actions towards him, but I still think he was wrong in his discussion with her.",0.6
"WIBTA for letting the guy I am seeing know I'm disappointed he didn't do anything for my birthday. To add we have only been seeing each other 2.5 months. With out being prompted  he bragged to me about how he spoils the women he is with.

We spent Christmas day together I got him a few gifts small little thank you for him buying and cooking Christmas dinner. All very thoughtful and they brought him to tears...he apologized for not getting me anything and I explained dinner was his gift to me. 

I did make it clear last week that my birthday was this weekend and although he worked that day I was excited for what he had planned when we saw each other on his day off. 

I showed up nothing...no gift..no nice dinner (chef by trade so him cooking certianitly a gift in and of itself)...no going out to dinner...just hot dogs and a movie... 

I'm torn on if I should say something I really feel like I should though. As his birthdays in less than 2 months and I have absolutely no desire to do anything for him.",0.2
"WIBTA if I(41f) tell my bf(43m) that his daughter's cats have to go? 
My(41f) bf(43m) has an 18 year old daughter who does not contribute to the household in any way, shape, or form. She has 9 cats, 7 of which live full-time in the house that he and she share. I am severely allergic to cats so I don't go inside. He wants me to move in. I told him there is no way, I would go into anaphylaxis and die. He said he would get rid of the cats and remodel and deep clean the house. I have been living in an rv (that purchased for this particular reason) in his driveway for over 6 months so we could start renovations on the house and I am helping find homes for the cats. I found the first home with all the stipulations that daughter put forth and NOW daughter is saying she's not giving the one away that someone actually wants. She was on board and now she's not. I have been trying to explain to both of them how unfair and unhealthy it is to the cats to have that many living in such a small unkept area. The cats are always sick and the house never gets cleaned, she only empties the litter pans once a week and NEVER scoops. Daughter doesn't have any income so, never helps with cat supplies such as litter, food, medicine, etc. I'm cool with the outdoor cats and, if all the cats wanted to live outside, I would be ok with that too. I would never make him choose me over his daughter but I really want to tell him it's me or the cats. I don't want to live in an rv the rest of my life and before all you ""pets are family too"" people come after me for wanting to re-home the cats, CPS would be in your home if you allowed 7 children to live like these cats do. So, would I be the asshole if I told him it's me or the cats?",0.32
"AITA for calling my sister bitter and telling her she should examine her parenting instead of going off on other people? My sister and I had our sons around the same time. My nephew turned 7 in October and my son turns 7 next month. I was 20 when I had my son and this was a big deal with my sister. She's 10 years older than I am and really had no expectations when it came to me as a mom. She predicted I would end up single and my son's dad would bail and that I would give up within the first year. Instead we are married and we had two little girls after our son.

We are very different parents. My sister is very strict and regimented as a mom and has a lot of rules and ""swift, harsh punishments"" for bad behavior or any subpar behavior. My husband and I would probably fall more into a gentle parenting kind of deal. We teach our kids how to act in public but we do so in a very different way to my sister and her husband.

My nephew can be very challenging and he's an angry little boy. I suspect it's because his parents are often angry and he is picking up on that and building resentment which has made his behavior worse. Our parents have brought this up to my sister in the past and she has told them it's not true and claimed my son behaves far worse despite them saying it's not even close to the truth.

Our parents had both boys on Saturday and my sister and I arrived at the same time to pick them up. Our parents elderly neighbor approached my sister and told her that she should have a word with her son because of how rude and disrespectful he is to others. My sister told the neighbor that she had the wrong sister and my son was the kid who gets into trouble. The neighbor said she knows the boys apart and knows who the mom to each is. She told my sister that my son was very sweet and showed no disrespect the way her son did. My sister was furious.

The neighbor told her that thanking someone (my son) for picking something up for her does not warrant being yelled at and cursed at by a small child. Apparently my nephew got an attitude and told her nobody has to help her because she's old and can't do anything for herself. My sister went off on the neighbor and said her son is so much better behaved and accused her of spreading lies.

The neighbor walked away mid tirade and then my sister started to turn on me and instead of letting her I said she needs to stop being so bitter and examine her parenting instead of going off on people who complain about her son's behavior. I told her I would not let her take it out on me that she was wrong about me as a mom and that I feel like a lot of her anger comes down to that. That she hates that I don't get the same comments. She tried to yell at me but I just got my son off our parents and left. My parents asked me what happened and I told them. They said I did nothing wrong but my sister and her husband are both now coming for me for what I said and they told me it wasn't my place to say all that disrespectful stuff. AITA?

ETA: My parents are supportive and it was my sister and her husband who told me it wasn't my place. I realize now I did not make that super clear in the end!",0.1
"AITA For being honest about how I make a living to my in laws? throwaway account. English is not my first language so excuse any mistakes.

My boyfriend (M27) and I (F25) spent christmas with his family for the first time this year (been together for 6m). The thing is, he is a little bit embarrassed about my job and always asks me to lie about it to his friends.

I'm a veterinarian, and currently I work in a slaughterhouse. My tasks as a health inspector are to examine the animals before and after slaughter, to ensure the meat is safe for human consumption. Personally I don't think there's anything wrong with this job, but I see how some people might be offended so I don't mind lying to his friends about it. I usually tell them I work with cats and dogs, since is a crowdpleaser job.

Now, with his family it's different. I don't want to lie to them, because the truth might come out one day and damage the bonds we have. So, when meeting his family members I was honest about my job, but my bf wasn't very happy about it.

She is the only grandchild on either side, my parents are disappointed but have said it is our wedding our choice, and I expect that to be the end of it on their opinion.

"AITA for telling my friend who struggles with body issues that he looks good?? lol title sounds crazy I know but let me just make sure I’m not tripping or maybe I am. Basically my friend (30M) and I (28M) were on the phone chatting while also watching this show together and randomly he brings up how he’s been working out and has been pretty consistent in the gym. Mentioning how his abs, his chest and basically his whole upper torso area are all more defined and chiseled. Then he sends me a pic that takes me about a minute or two to look at because I was caught up in what was going on in the show.  Which I guess annoys him a bit because he says: “you still haven’t looked at the picture I sent you.” So I go to look at the pic he sent me thinking it would be a shirtless picture so I could see everything he mentioned (abs, chest etc.) but he sent a picture of him in the gym with a dark shirt on where you can’t really see anything that he wants me to see outside of his arms.  So I say: “oh ok I can’t really see your abs and chest and stuff because your shirt covers it but from what I can see you look good.” 

But apparently this compliment wasn’t good enough I guess. He felt I was being passive and told me “it’s funny how when you have something negative or an insult about my body you’re loud but when it’s time to give a compliment it’s silence and no applause.  

(Which for context: the “insults” he’s talking about were from 4 years ago when we would joke on each other or sometimes get into arguments and I’d say your “square shaped ass” or “you built like a fridge” and he’d respond with “and you built like a stop sign” or “no shape ass” lmao

He has since told me back when I said those things that those original comments bothered him because he struggles with body dysmorphia. So I apologized for it back in 2020-2021 when he brought that up to me and haven’t repeated or commented on his body negatively since then so I thought he’s forgiven me. But now it seems like he’s upset again because of those original comments and are applying them to this situation 3-4 years later. Which has started a debate and caused friction in our friendship. 

He honestly feels and said that he had to pull a compliment out of me because i wasn’t enthusiastic in my response and that he had to explain that his chest and arms are more full in the picture before I said “you look good.” Which is true because again i could barely see anything he wanted me to see in that damn pic!! Idk i guess my compliment wasn’t good enough or something? He was so upset that he threatened to end our friendship of 6 years. 

So I apologized to him if i came across as if i didn’t care because that’s not how i meant it but he is firm that I was being passive aggressive and shady when tbh I feel like he’s 1.) harboring on those old negative comments because he’s insecure with his body, 2.) never really got over them and is taking it out on me again after all this time, and 3.) was fishing for a compliment and didn’t get the immediate response he was looking which of course triggered him. 

So AITA?",0.04
"AITA for telling my friend I wouldn't care if she's sad so I've always tried my best to be there for her and I hated to see her struggle, but lately she's not putting any effort into the friendship which is really hurting me, I told her how I felt many times and asked her to change it but she never did, she wouldn't even do the bare minimum in any friendship,  
  
still I try to keep being the good friend and this one time she seemed really sad so I talked to her and asked her what's wrong and told her I'm worried etc, and it ended with us fighting because she said she hates it when I pressure her and I only make her feel worse.  
  
And I do get that, sometimes when I'm sad I don't want to talk to anyone too, but there were hundreds of nicer ways to say it, especially when I'm already pushing myself.  
  
similar things happened and when I'd tell her she looks sad even when she denies it she would say hurtful things like ""work on your trust issues"". so one thing after another I got fed up and while we were having a conversation she mentioned how I've been cold to her and I said that I don't care anymore, and I wouldn't care if she's sad.",0.71
"AITA Roommate edition My roommate and I moved into a house around the beginning of November. I’m 28 and she’s 25. This is the first time she’s lived on her own and I’ve been living on my own since I was 17.  She has 2 dogs and I have a cat and a dog. When we moved in I agreed to take the upstairs bedroom and she got the master bedroom because she told me her dogs aren’t good with cats, however her dogs and my cat have got along great. At first to prevent any problems I kept the litter box upstairs in the bedroom right next to mine but after 3 days of that I realized it was a bad plan to have it on carpet and it began to smell pretty bad even with cleaning it daily, so I moved it downstairs. Her younger dog had started to get into things such as the litter box and chewing the carpet and walls in her room. I suggested kenneling the dog while no one’s home but she got mad and said she’d never kennel a dog. I bought a new heavy litter box/table for the cat and pushed the box up next to the wall but she didn’t like it. She called me on the phone and told me I would need to put the litter box in the extra bedroom next to my room and deal with it. I tried to reason with her and come up with a better plan that would keep the dog safe and both of us happy, but it escalated into a huge screaming fight and she has been going out of her way to be petty such as take back a dog food container she gave me 2 months ago and remove me from the streaming services but still continues to use all the things that I’ve brought into the house.

I guess the part that really got to me is how disrespectful she talked to me in the first place on the phone. I have no problem working together to solve a problem in a way everyone can be happy since we both pay equal rent and found this place together, but when you’re demanding and unwilling to talk without yelling that’s where I draw the line. I moved it upstairs after that first phone call then took a few days to myself before talking to her which led to her immediately screaming, calling me names, blaming me for all her problems and saying I manipulated her into moving her which is completely untrue. She and I had been planning to move in together for months before that and I had asked her if she was sure she wanted to move since she was saving money and her parents took very good care of her.",0.36
"AITA For partying all night after Michigans win? Monday night I went to a Michigan Washington watch party with our local alumni chapter where I live.  My wife came along.  I communicated to her that I would be focused on the game and it wasn't a date night even though we were out at a bar.

"AITA for not keeping my promise for a good reason? 
I (40M) do photography. And once my girlfriend (36F), who is not into photography, cameras, or lenses, and I discussed the weight of the lens. She doubted that it weighed as much as indicated in the specifications. I told her I would weigh him the next day as I was already in bed.

The next day she reminded me of this, but I had already left home, so I didn’t do it either. On the same day I sent her characteristics from the Internet. She commented on some other description details, but not the weight.

A few days later she again reminded me of my promise to weigh the lens. I asked what was the point in weighing, since there is official information on the Internet. She replied that it happens with other things that they lie about the weight and do not take into account some details of the construction. 

She also said that “jam tomorrow”, even trivial one, stresses her out. And that she's disappointed since she had beilieved I was man of my word.

My girlfriend says that I myself made a promise (she didn’t ask for it), so I must fulfill it no matter what: it doesn’t matter whether she needs the result or not. But I don't like it that I have to do something just because of her principles and fads.

I once again sent her data from the Internet (from another, authoritative and independent source), but she was again not satisfied with it: “You promised to weigh it.”

I replied that out of my principle I wouldn’t weigh it, because she wasn’t really interested in weight. And she just wanted to make fun of me. I have an incentive and desire to fulfill promises only if I see that a person is really interested in it.

Last time I promised her to find some course.I think she was also not interested in the search results, but only in the very fact of fulfilling the promise.

If the promise was about something important I would have kept it. But this one is about something she's not even interested in.

I told him this after we had finished the movie and he asked me why so I explained I wasn’t a big fan of the tropes and he got upset and said that I just hate what he likes.

Recently we were chatting with some of his friends over discord and he brought it up in front of them saying things like “yeah I need someone to watch this with because my gf hates it” “She hates everything that I like” it made me embarrassed to have it brought up in front of everyone so I defended myself and he privately texted me that he didn’t know how to talk to me without me getting upset and that it was just back and forward finger pointing. 

I guess I just don’t understand I really do try to watch some of what he likes. I don’t enjoy superhero movies but we go and watch every one that comes out. I played his favorite game with him for about 2-3 years but he would get upset if I said I wanted to play I game I liked instead (even if I said I’d play it alone) and when he did join he would say the game is bad and he doesn’t know how I play a game like this. Then he would proceed to complain that the it’s the only game I want to play and when I would bring up that he doesn’t have to play it with me he would say that he loves me so he will.

"AITA for not telling my dog off more? This only just happened, so sorry if my writing is not the best im still a bit frazzled. I just came home from school and when i got in my families new puppy, a mix between two large dogs so shes the size of a baby pony or something and will be bigger, was obviously excited and all, jumping up on me and running about. The jumping on me while im standing is something i don't mind and actually find quite comical. All was good until i sat down on the couch and, after my mum was done petting the dog, the dog ran over to me and jumped up on the couch, i didn't mind until she scratched me on the face, i started crying then, out of a bit of pain but mostly shock, she even began biting at my hand (which was gaurding my face) and was over all moving quite fast and jumping all over me which was freaking me out. my mum quickly grabbed her and told her off but then turned to me and began yelling at me. How i need to use my ""big girl voice and yell at her 'no'"" which is a conversation we've had a lot, but i always remind her I'm not a yeller. I was responding back while crying about how i understand shes a puppy, im just not used to dogs. (I've only ever grown up with cats my entire life, and we only got this puppy two months ago) but she kept yelling back at me, once appologising that shes sorry for yelling shes just stressed out from doing all the house work. Which i understand, but i feel her stress doesn't excuse her yelling, it just helps me understand her more about why she is. Idk, i have no hate towards her or the puppy, but i feel like i really didn't dissurve to be yelled at for freaking out a bit. But thats up to you guys, AITA for not telling the dog off?

And the circumstances in which we got this dog was in a really mean way so i am sad to say, i dont love our puppy, but i treat her the best i can, and give her treats. Even if how we got her still makes me a bit sour.

Fast forward to December 2023, we decided to start fresh and make things work.  

We don’t normally post with each other on social media, but I thought doing this could represent a new chapter. Therefore, I started posting a few photos with him and was thinking he would do that too. He doesn’t have an issue with posting a photo of us per se, but he doesn’t seem to want that.  

I feel that he is afraid that the girl he connected with might see the photo and think badly of him, even though he told me that he explained to her that he wants us to get back together.

"AITA for continuing to make things my wife deems as smelly? I used to make things like french fries or fish sticks as an after school snack for my daughter and I pretty often; something to hold us over until dinner. My wife would always come home and complain about the smell. I stopped making those things as often, maybe from 3 times a week to once a month. I started washing the pans as soon as I transferred the food and would light a candle to help with the smell, something my wife asked and I happily obliged. I'll also try and make these things several hours ahead of when she will be coming home, to help the smell dissipate.

Yesterday my daughter asked for french fries and so I made them. I had gotten a message from a coworker and I forgot to wash the pan and light the candle. Unless I'm in a call for work, I always go up (my office is in the basement) to greet her. As I open the door I can see the look on her face, that she realizes that all too familiar smell and zooms right by me, ignoring me completely and throws her stuff in the room and starts doing the dishes like a race. She didn't yell or anything, but I'm someone who doesn't need to hear a single word and can feel everything they're thinking. I've been a little upset about that since and she keeps blowing it off like no big deal. This is where I'm running into an issue with my thought process, because it feels like I do a lot of compromising for her, but when it comes to me I'm just expected to deal with it.

She's insisting that I need to buy an air fryer for the garage and cook those things out there. She has self diagnosed herself as hyperosmia. I feel like I've already compromised a lot here: no deep frying, oven only, I've stopped making the foods that bother her nearly as often, I make sure to clean up directly after and do what I can to stop the smell from lingering (99% of the time). I don't feel that I should be forced to be in a cold garage to enjoy the foods I want as I've already made a lot of changes for her.

We've been together 15 years and this is something she has always complained about, but only had made it a serious thing more recently.",0.4
"AITA for complaining about my neighbor parking a giant truck in front of my house all day every day? Across from my house is (or was) a public greenspace. The land slopes up from the street. When I moved in 10 years ago, it was overgrown with natural vegitation.  
That is city land.  The rest of the neighborhood is zoned residential. People have always parked on the street there. No problem.
My neighbor up the street runs some kind of freelance freight hauling business.  He has started parking a large truck there.  It's right in front of my house, he parks it up on the slope which is tearing up the vegetation and eroding the hill.  Now it starting to collect graffiti (which he does clean promptly). Since he hauls freight at night, waking up my kids, I have to look at it all day.
I talked to him about it, and he essentially said he was not going to do anything differently.  He basically said, this is how I support my family.
I understand that this is his income and he also has a family. I haven't complained to the city because of that. But he is also known in the neighborhood as ""that guy"" in ""that house.""  I have heard screaming at his house and someone yelling ""Fine! Call the cops then!"" So I'm also a little concerned about my safety if I complain.
I am concerned about the graffiti, my property value which is basically my entire retirement plan at this time, destruction of the greenspace (which is public, but it's across from me and I enjoyed it before it was destroyed), and disregard of residential zoning.
The city law on businesses in a residential zone is pretty weak, but it does talk about nuisances like extra vehicles and traffic. There is a city portal to submit land use complaints.
I don't want to mess with his finances a income, but the way I see it, he is messing with mine.  My plan is to sell my house and leave the city as soon as I can afford to do so, but this is potentially impacting my sale price and the quality and timing of my retirement.",0.09
"AITA for not helping my husband with finances?   
My husband and I are married for 8 years now with a child and we both work. At first we used to split every between us and were helping each other out when it came to finances , household and our child. However, my husband got this job offer that paid him 2x more than his initial job. Mind you, his initial job was already a good enough payment but he wanted to earn more. The problem was that the new job required him to be at work from very early in the morning to very late. I told him that getting this job would make him an absent father and husband and that we don’t need it we are good enough. He insisted on taking and he did.  


  
So I told him since he decided to not be present so much in our lives he shall also pay alone because what’s the point of double the amount of money if I still pay with him yet he doesn’t work with me in the house? I told him that this means that he’ll also not be with his child as much so I’ll be making up for that too so it would only be fair if he made up for my financial part too. I was saying this honestly to make him go back on his decision but no he agreed on paying alone. Now I am the one who takes care of the house and our child alone and he pays for everything (I still work too).

  
This been our life for 2 years until now he is saying I should pay too. I said I am down on paying if he is down on doing his husband and father duties. He said he “can’t” because of his job but I told him that I warned him and that he choose to ignore so now he either bare the consequences or search for another job. He doesn’t want to because he really likes the big income and wants me to pay so that he would save more. I told him that’s not happening I won’t do my AND his duties all alone while he just pays half the bills. 

  
We’ve been going back and forth into this and I am not backing down.",0.4
"AITA for telling at the school nurse and making her cry? My 8yo son Leo splits his time equally between me and his mom. His mom is married to Zak. I got no problem with either one of them. Leo is with me this week. I went to pick him up from school and he was not there. I freaked and was told Zak picked him up.

I called Zak and asked why was Leo signed out by him. He was confused. He said the school nurse called him to pick Leo up because he got sick on the playground an hour before school ended. He assumed both my ex and I were contacted but didn't pick up. We weren't. Just Zak.

Zak picked up Leo, gave him a bath and put him to bed. I asked to speak to the school nurse to figure out this fuck up. She said that she didn't mean any harm but thought Zak was more available. I asked what made her think that and she said she wanted to ""give step parents a shot"" and that everyone usually appreciates that.

I said Zak isn't even listed as a primary contact. He's secondary. You didn't even follow proper protocol. She just stared at me. I was hoping for an apology and realized I wasn't going to get one. Now it's complicated because my kid is at my ex's when he should be with me. 

I told her she was a total moron and I will tell everyone what you did so they replace you. There were a lot of people in the office who overheard. I left.

The principal did call me to say he didn't like me talking to his staff that way and don't do it again. However he will have a talk with her and let her know she did mess up. I told him a simple apology would had mitigated the situation because I don't want it to happen again. He laughed and it won't because she's too scared of me now.",0.39
"AITA for not wanting to hang out with a work client who’s in town for 2 days? A few years ago, I did some freelance work for a friend of a friend who lives across the country. He’s a nice guy, but very socially awkward. I’m also pretty sure he has a crush on me (reacts to all of my selfies that I post on my Instagram stories, double texts me when I don’t respond for 30 min, and seems intent on talking to me despite me not responding to some texts for months).

He lives on the east coast and told me recently that he would be visiting California to attend a convention in SF. Then, he said he was going to book a flight to Los Angeles where I live so “we could hang out for a day or two” before he went home. I agreed because sure, might as well meet someone I worked with for a year in person, why not. He offered to cook me dinner for one of those nights so he could “do something nice for me”, which I thought was strange and respectfully declined.

I ended up meeting him for dinner at a local restaurant and it went exactly as I thought it would go- half the night was him telling stories that he thought was the craziest thing he could tell a person, whereas I felt like I was just listening to a very normal event (like somebody not planning a trip well because they were high on weed) and trying to react like it was crazy. The other half was just listening to facts about some obscure event that Los Angeles was known for, statements that felt like judgements about California (“your state is always on fire”), plots of movies I’ve never heard of, and a weird sense of pride for not knowing anything about 21st century pop culture (he’s in his late 20s, btw).

None of this is particularly bad, and he didn’t make any moves on me although I still feel like he’s into me, which makes me uncomfortable. When I got home, I felt like I wasted my night and felt upset. He wants to go to downtown LA with me the last night he’s here, but I really can’t fathom spending any more time with him or making the 45 drive down there. Am I the asshole for not wanting to see him the only other night he’s in town when he came to LA pretty much because he wanted to see me?",0.07
"AITAH for not planning my Mom’s vacation for her? Brief background; throughout my entire life my family has never once been on a leisure vacation together. Every time we traveled was to visit family for a family event. All I remember during my childhood is my Mom constantly bitching how she never gets to travel anywhere, but her and my Dad could literally NEVER plan a vacation. It would end in screaming matches because my Mom would list off 100 places she didn’t want to go but would never provide insight into where she actually wanted to travel. Anyway, we don’t have to dive into that trauma today but this is to paint a picture of what family traveling/planning has always been like. And no, they did not avoid leisure vacations due to finances. My parents have always been well off, my Dad has always had hotel points, and I saw them throw away over 300,000 air fare points because they let them expire before choosing a trip. 

Scenario: I (30F) recently traveled to Arizona with my family (Mom 66F, Dad 68M) for my sister’s (34F) wedding. The wedding was in Phoenix and then me, my boyfriend, my sister and brother in law made plans to stay in Sedona the following week. My Mom said Sedona has always been her ‘dream vacation’ and decided she wanted to go too. Unfortunately her schedule only allowed us to drive up to Sedona for a day and enjoy it but I was still happy to drive her and enjoy the experience together. 

We had 11 months to plan our vacations. I spent months and months researching and booking everything in advance for my week in Sedona. Excursions, tours, hikes, hotel, and every single dining reservation I made in advance. I kept telling my Mom to book stuff ahead of time because Sedona can sometimes take 1-2 months of booking in advanced during tourist season to eat at the popular restaurants. Throughout these 11 months, I even sent her all of my itinerary to help her decide what she wants to do. I’d constantly ask where she chose to eat, what we’re doing that day, etc but she never responded or put anything into action. Three weeks before we left, she still hadn’t planned anything.. so I decided fuck it and stopped worrying about it. 

The day comes and we leave around 10am for Sedona… we get to Sedona around 12pm. My Mom asks “so what are we doing? I’m hungry, where are we eating?” I looked at her and said this is your vacation, I didn’t plan or book anything. You decide what we do. She got furious and proceeded to yell at me. She ended up giving me the first panic attack I’ve had in over 5 years. She was angry for the remainder of the day. We walked 0.5miles at cathedral rock and walked around the tourist trap stores. 

So… this has been bothering me as she continues to guilt trip me. AITAH for not booking anything in advance for her day in Sedona?",0.12
"AITA: Mental Gymnastics in Co-parenting  

My husband (36M) and I (38F) separated four months ago and I'm having issues with my ex relating to extracurricular activities for our daughter (4F). History: our child participated in dance and gymnastics when she was younger (3 y/o) and didn't take to either; she's shy and slow to join in activities. She expressed interest last week in trying gymnastics again so I signed her up.

Naturally my ex got mad. His concerns are: I didn't let him be involved in making the decision; I'm purposely excluding him from her life; I'm not communicating or co-parenting effectively because I ""should have known"" he would want to be involved. He wants to be involved and given the option to be there for ""firsts"" and events as he sees fit. He requested that I not exclude him if there are ""things I would normally be a part of or might want to be a part of (and you know what I mean)"".

The facts are:

1. This class was not a first for our daughter. We discussed her starting classes 1.5 years ago, because he lived in our house and I was telling him about options I found in our area. He forgot that she did gymnastics before because he said she's only ever done dance and this class was a first that I excluded him from attending. I've always registered and taken her to classes, appointments, etc. Side note: Since COVID, the studio is still not allowing parents inside during classes. I take her to the door and wait in the car, he's not missing anything.
2. I didn't ask him about starting classes. The class is during my time with the kids (I have primary custody). I didn't ask him to help pay for the class nor to take her to the class. I let him know that she was going on Monday and would be super excited to tell him about it.
3. Historically he expects me to know what he wants and to include him all while accusing me of trying to get back together with him when I invite him. He made the decision to have an affair and subsequently separate, pending divorce. He knew what he was giving up when he made those decisions. He will miss firsts and he will not be there for every important moment, not by my choice.

It seems like he wants to be in control and I’m always the bad guy. He wants to dictate our communication (how, when and what we talk about), what I can do with the kids, what he wants to be involved in with them, and everything else all while continuing his affair, being dishonest, ignoring my communication attempts, and not being forthcoming about his intentions going forward. If this were a major decision like education, religion, medical, etc. I would consult him. But for her re-starting gymnastics, I don't think I need to discuss it with him. Am I missing something? AITA?",0.06
"AITAH if I want my married daughter to start paying her bills by now. Ever since my daughter was 17 she had a newer car to use. When she moved south we gave r her a new Pathfinder for her and her family to use. We paid for it and the insurance for about 2 years. 
We traded that down to a used cheaper model after a bit. We still paid for it and the insurance.  When her husband joined the military we insisted they start paying the insurance at least. 
Fast forward to now they have a 2 year old SUV which we still make payments on and owe about 20k left. I want to trade it in and have them get a cheap used car for them to pay for.  My wife says no. They just bought a used car at over 20% interest rate because their other vehicle was totaled. Her husband has 2 toys one is paid for he could sell and then take their tax return and pay of that SUV.  My wife says no.  But they insist that they can afford the toys. We buy a lot of clothes and other things for our grand kids as well.  Which I don’t mind doing at all.  As I see that as being real help.  What should I do?",0.1
"AITA for restricting my brother's time with my cat? I (20yo) have wanted a cat for a lot of time, years even, but it was only recently that I've been able to adopt a tiny little guy I've named Morfeu (the portuguese version of Morpheus, which was an incredibly fitting name since all he does is sleep, haha).
My brother (12yo) has also been very excited to get a cat, and enjoys him very much. The thing is, I'm a private person. I enjoy having my room, my safe space, for myself and breathe with no external pressure. My brother started expressing discomfort with the fact that he is staying in my room and was really sad that there's no toys in his room for the cat to play, and asked me if I would buy some. I complied with letting my brother keep the cat in his room for some time everyday, under the notion that he lives in my room and would need to come back soon to eat, drink and use the sandbox. 
Cut to today, which is therapy day, so I left the house for at most an hour and a half, and came home to the light in my room turned on and panicked for a second thinking I left everything on. I opened the door and my brother was in my room. I overreacted a bit, having just left therapy where I talked about feeling invaded with so many people in my room for longer than ever before and it felt like a slap in my face and I DID NOT want anyone in my room while I wasn't there. I asked him to leave a little more harshly than intended (something like ""excuse me!"" with an accusing tone and rushing him through the door) and did not let him take the cat to his room. I think part of the whole reaction was the consequence of swallowing my discomfort for having them in my room the last couple of days, commenting on the state of it (like my mom saying I should sweep every five minutes), coming in without knocking or announcing entry (which was always an issue, but its been bothering me more since it became more frequent) and staying longer that I'd like (like my brother, that still hasn't gotten over the ""I'll sit here and watch him sleep phase).
I immediately felt bad and as soon as I got comfy in my room after taking off my outside clothes and doing my normal routine, I took the cat to his room and told him as clearly as I could that I was not comfortable with him being in my room without my permission specially without my knowledge, and that he should've asked.
Now I'm in my room alone and feeling immature. I still don't want people coming and going from my safe space freely and without my knowledge and part of me feels bad for what I assume is, for the cat, a tiring trip from a room to another everyday like a commuter; but another part of me thinks I'm just making up excuses to be selfish and I should give some slack to my brother because, at the end of the day, he's 12 and I'm the adult; and it's a cat, not private property, and me taking care of it doesn't mean I get to monopolize the cat since we all live under the same roof.

"AITA: Am I an ungrateful b****? My boyfriend and I have a very tumultuous, on again/off again type relationship. A lot of it is due to the fact that he's an addict, and it has caused him to act out of character frequently. He has lied (A LOTTTT its almost pathological at this point) and cheated on me in the past, so we've been dealing with trying to patch things up. He's an addict (f3nt/m3th) and so he struggles with that a lot.

Over Christmas, I've spent about $700 on him trying to shower him with gifts to show him how much I love him, because a big part of what fuels his addiction is intense feelings of worthlessness. He got me about $100 worth of gifts, which I was fine with.  They were nice things. I didnt expect him to match me dollar for dollar on what i bought him. He makes less money than me, so i was totally understanding on that. We went shopping and he just got me everything I picked up. It was really nice. The only thing that sort of bothered me is that he didn't pick any of it out. But it's OK, I'm not good at picking out gifts really, either.

Well, my birthday was several days ago, and we were in the middle of fighting so I didn't celebrate with him like we planned. He kept asking me to come over and let's make up and he can give me my gifts.

Long story slightly less long, I got totally misled about the ""gifts"" I thought he said he had a gift, flowers, and a card. But then he tried to say that my gifts WERE the flowers and the card. And he hadnt even filled out the card yet, even though he had almost a week. Then he gave me a cheap makeup brush his mom picked out for me (which he told me was her gift to me first, then switched up later and said he paid for it).

I got really pissed off because it's like is that really all you can do? He said he was short on money but it's like, you wouldn't be short on money if you would stop buying drugs. It sucks to know that's where the money is going. He also had been promising a gift for like 3 months that's coming in the mail but then he had to get his money back because it never came, etc. It's part of 2 gifts he wants to give me together. It just feels made up. He says the real gifts he got me are coming next week. I don't know.

But he called me ungrateful for getting pissy for being mad that I got so little. What think ye?",0.89

"AITA For Not Wanting Another Cat So for background my fiance (24F) and I (25F) have been together for a year, living together for 6 months. We have a blended family of pets, my one dog and her two cats and a goldfish we got together. 

Before we lived together she lived with her sister. They adopted cats together & raised them together. The sister fell on hard times and had to move in with her Aunt recently and gave the cat up for adoption. The lovely family that was fostering the cat had circumstances that led to them having to return the cat to the shelter. Sister works at the shelter and notified my fiance the cat was up for adoption again. My fiance wants to adopt the cat and I've said no. 

I am not a cat person, but I love the two cats we have because they came with my fiance as a package deal & I respect that and love on them the same as I do my dog. I just don't want another cat to provide for, clean up after etc. My fiance wants to adopt the cat so she can give the cat back to her sister when she moves out on her own again. But her sister won't be moving out until this time in 2025, and I don't wanna commit to caring for this cat for a year. I also don't know her sister & if I can count on her to take the cat when she's ready or if I'd be signing up for another cat forever.

I thought this was kinda out of nowhere as he’s made a few remarks about him before but never got seriously mad. So then we got into a pretty heated argument as I didn’t think it was fair that he gets to control who I’m friends with and i told him that he shouldn’t project his insecurities onto our relationship as his last girlfriend cheated on him. I then stormed out of his place and haven’t spoken to him since and I’m not sure if I overreacted. I feel like it’s not fair that he’s mad at me for maintaining a platonic relationship with a close friend but then maybe I could have tried to listen and ease his concerns better.

"AITA if I don’t take my kids to a show they were gifted tickets for? My kids (3 and 4) were given tickets to a show by some extended family for their combined birthdays. The people who gave these gifts are not local, and therefore can’t take the kids, so I would have to take them. 

I don’t want to take them to this for several reasons- it doesn’t start until 7pm, which is when I usually put them to bed. We would be home, at best, 2 hours after their regular bedtime *if* I left early. I would also be dealing with both kids by myself, and there is no parking at the venue so that would involve walking in the cold and dark several blocks from a parking garage (I know kids who live in walking-friendly downtown areas are likely used to this, but we live in suburbs where this is not common, so this would be a whole other ordeal for my kids). Due to other family circumstances I’d rather not get into here at risk of providing too much info, I am constantly overwhelmed by parenting in general lately and I just know this night would stress me out and I’d likely have a mental breakdown at some point.

"AITA for wanting to ghost a friend? First: I hate ghosting. I'm the kind of person who prefers to openly talk about things, so, even thinking about that makes me feel like a total a-hole...

But, I guess I should start somewhere else.
I met P pretty much 6 years ago in an MMO. It's a long-distance online only thing.
When we met we were both in a bit of a tough spot for different reasons. We helped each other out a lot during the first years. 

Over time it became gradually more distant, which is pretty normal among adults, so that isn't the issue.

So, if that isn't the issue, then what is?
Well, it's his LI, Y, whom he met a year and a half ago. Which is great, he's a good guy and deserves someone who makes him happy. If only that were the case. My problem is... he's struggling and unhappy, I want to help him, but I can't.
Because my entire family is one or another personality type of the ""dark triad"". I've been on the receiving end of narcissism and similar behavior my entire life, and whenever he's telling me about his woes with Y, it's incredibly triggering for me, because her behavior is one red flag after another. I've refrained from downright screaming ""SHE'S A NARCISSIST, RUN WHILE YOU CAN!"", because first: I simply don't know enough about her to be sure, not everyone who shows certain narcissistic traits is a full blown narcissist, and because I know, that if I'm brutally honest about it, I'll just push him away and cut him off from pretty much the only friend he has who does understand him the way I do, who also wants to (or can) be there for him. 
Unfortunately he, of course, always justifies her behavior. Don't get me wrong, I understand that. Love and rose tinted glasses and all of that. 

At one point I told him that I'd love to be there for him, but that there are too many things that trigger me and that I know that I might be wrong about it, but that this doesn't change anything about how it's stressing me. 
After that he refrained from sharing things about her with me.

Now, you might think: but that's great, problem solved... if only. Because his ""relationship"", together with his high stress job has started to affect his health, he's behaving increasingly strange on the few occasions he does show up every now and then, and it's tearing me apart. I know he's suffering. One of the last things he told me was that he's feeling very ""friendless"", at which point I tried to get him to open up more again. I thought ""f*ck me being triggered, let's be a god darn adult about it, helping a friend is more important"", but he wordlessly vanished again and doesn't react to anything. Well, he recently wished me a happy new year and told me he's been resting a lot. Which is good, but something's rubbing me the wrong way. I don't know what exactly.

I want to help but can't. It stresses me out and yes, a part of me just wants to pretend he doesn't exist... But as I said, that makes me feel like a total a-hole.

"AITA for not wanting my bfs blind sister to live with us I (17 female) have been with my boyfriend (18 male) for 2 years. My boyfriend lives with his grandmother and his sister. His sister is (16 female) named grace. My boyfriend’s grandmother wanted to discuss what would happen when she dies and who would be taking care of grace. My boyfriend said that we would take her in. I was listening to this conversation. After the conversation was over, he went into grace room and asked her what she thought about this plan. She excited agreed, and was making all these plans on getting a German shepherd service dog. Since me and my boyfriend want to move out when I turn 18 and move to Texas to get a little apartment, a big dog is out of the picture. To also mention that grace can see from 4-5 feet in front of her, she doesn’t know how to take care of herself( her hair, since she is black). I am white with silky hair and my bf has white boy hair too. Grace does not know how to clean up after herself or do the dishes. It’s not that she can’t do them, it’s that my boyfriend’s grandmother babied her (and still does). Grace was my boyfriend’s grandmother’s last child to raise so she got coddled all her life. I will not baby Grace. I don’t want the responsibility of taking care of Grace. When Grace should be her own person/adult. My bf is constant that she moves in with us. And if this were to happen, we would have to take time out of our work schedules, to drive Grace around or take her out. It would be different if he would be paying all the bills but we are going 50/50 on this. And what if we decide to have kids? My point is Grace cannot live with us, especially because this would be a permanent placement. Me and him have been going back and forth on this for the past week. I decided to ask my grandma for advice on if I was the asshole or not and she said I was because I should be teaching her how to take care of herself. I feel that it isn’t my job/responsibility to! But I also feel I am the asshole because I should be more open minded about letting her move in with me and my bf. Am I the asshole?",0.67
"AITA for getting engaged months after my daughter's death 7 months ago my (27m) daughter(7f) died from a tumor, it was incredibly hard on me and my ex wife (29f), she has/ had a drinking problem (i don't know her current state) most of the time she was in the hospital she was at the bar a few blocks down, my girlfriend (Brandi, 28f) was there for me the whole time and was one of the people that helped me get through it. After my daughter died and seeing how Brandi supported me I decided that she was the person I wanted to spend the rest of my life with, and I a couple nights ago I proposed to her and she said yes, she made a post on her Instagram and my ex wife saw it, she sent me an angry voicemail saying ""What's wrong with you, getting married not even a year after my daughter dies. You probably didn't care about her, you can say how much this is affecting you but all you care about is yourself and that whore, you can both go to hell, "" obviously I was upset and I texted her back, ""Your daughter? She didn't feel like your daughter when you were drinking yourself to sleep every night, while I was by her side trying to convince her and myself that everything would be alright, she didn't feel like your daughter when you were at the bar and I  had to comfort her before and after every single operation, she didn't feel like your daughter everytime I had to pick her up from your house after you left her alone and got another DUI. And for the record that ""whore"" took better care of her in the 4 years she was in her life, than you ever could drunk or sober."" This morning I woke up to a bunch of calls and texts from her friends and family saying that she was just dealing with it her way and it was just too painful for her to be in the hospital with her, and agreeing that I should've gotten engaged so soon afterwards. I talked to my parents about it and they said that I was an asshole for saying that stuff to her, and I have to understand that it's hard to see me in such a good place after Skylar's death (our daughter), and I should also take into consideration her alcoholism and that she could be jelous of Brandi cause she didn't get a real wedding (we only got married cause she was pregnant and it was quick at city hall) and to consider apologizing to her.

"AITA for outing my friend’s new boyfriend? Am I the Asshole for outing my friend’s new boyfriend?

I (22M straight) told my best friend (23F straight) that her new boyfriend (23M ?gay?bi?) is gay. 

My friend told me about her new boyfriend, whom I used to be friends with. Our friendship unfortunately ended because he confessed his feelings for me, both sexual and emotional, and would often try to initiate sexual acts, which i’m not into. 

Months later, my friend tells me she’s in a relationship with this man. He (very recently) has tried to rekindle things with me, and I’m aware that he is sleeping with other men. She is/was under the impression that he is purely straight, and also not sexually active (he told her that he’s a virgin). 

I told her everything about what he tried to do with me, about his encounters with men, and showed her his active Grindr profile. I would want to know if my new partner was lying to me, and I also think it’s important to know in terms of sexual safety (STIs etc). She isn’t going to say anything to him so he will never know she knows. 

Am I the asshole for sort of outing him to her?",0.05
"AITA for frequently nagging my nephew to take up a job, after he quit his old one? I (42F) am the sole guardian of my nephew (16M), and have been raising him for the past 8 years now. His parents just aren’t interested in being in his life, and I care for my nephew as if he’s my own son (I don’t have any other children). 


Right now, although we’re not low-income, we are definitely feeling the pinch, and we’re just barely getting by. So, ever since the summer of 2023, my nephew has graciously taken up work at a restaurant. He has never really liked it, and his older colleagues used to bully him and his managers wouldn’t do anything about it. Back in November, he kind of snapped, and he impulsively quit the job in order to focus on school and preparing for college. And although my nephew didn’t make too much money at his restaurant gig, it was enough to make a noticeable difference for us. So ever since he quit, I’ve been nagging him to take up some other job, if only so that he can afford his own food and buy cool stuff he wants (my nephew is really into the guitar so he’s always looking at fancy equipment to buy). Also, to be totally honest, I just liked having the apartment to myself, while my nephew was gone at work. I’ve never noticed it before in the 8 years that I’ve had my nephew living here, but it’s kind of stuffy sharing my apartment with another person!

"AITA for trying to make sure my son eats? Hello! I'm a long time Lurker and I believe I've finally found the first thing I want to post here. So quickly I'm going to give a run down of the players. Me (29M), Wife (35F), My Son (3M), and my Father-in-Law (61M) who I'll be calling Greg for the rest of the post. I apologize in advanced, this is going to be long because of everything you'll need to get the full picture.  


Important background: 

We have a happy little boy who is mostly healthy. But we struggled a lot with him trying to eat since he was even an infant due to a tongue tie and lip tie. But when it was time to move to solid foods he struggled. So we went and saw a Gastrointestinal Doctor, ENT, and an Occupational Therapist. We've found he has a pretty rough time with Acid Reflux and Texture/Sensory issues with food on top of that.

Due to this he only eats yogurt; while drinking milk, juice, and water.

Important to note EVERYONE and I mean EVERYONE in our families know about his/our struggles. I'll admit too, my family is very outspoken about their thoughts. But Greg, he has told us on many occasions how he worries for our son and we've even see him cry over this. (We stress out about this enough and don't need this piled on. But I digress.)

Onto Tonight:

So, tonight rolls around. My wife picks up my son from Daycare and brings him home. He's not in a terrible mood. But you can tell he's not his normal bright and cheery self either. We find that he's hungry because like always he didn't hardly eat at daycare. But this time he was sent back his thermos full of milk. So he hasn't had much of anything out side of water. (Also important to know this kid will drink a pools worth of water if you let him.)

So obviously this little boy comes home hungry as all get out. He comes home and drinks and drinks and drinks. He refuses food at almost every turn. But, while at dinner Greg calls and my wife answers. They talk and then my son asks to video chat. We always let him. But, hearing throughout the call we are having a rougher night he decides to play the reverse psychology game with him. Which either riles my son up or my son is at least a little amused.

But  tonight it doesn't land. My son yells and low screams. He tries again, and I say loud enough to be heard ""Let's not fight over food tonight, so he can eat something."" To which my wife cuts her eyes at me. Greg says, ""I didn't hear him."" (He does suffer from some hearing loss due to military life when he was younger.) My wife tries to play this off three separate times. But he keeps asking what I said. So she finally repeats what I said while glaring at me. He gets short, you can almost feel his feelings through the phone, and ends the call. This causes my wife and I to have palpable tension in the room. My son finished the yogurt and now I want to know, Am I the A-- Hole for wanting to make sure my son eats something at dinner?

"AITA for ruining my friend’s bachelorette party? I (25f) went to my friend’s (24f) bachelorette party in PCB. There wasn’t a lot of planning beforehand and I asked the MOH two times before this for some kind of details or plans. Fast forward to a month before we’re supposed to board a plane to get there and we have still received nothing. I reached out again to ask what the plan was because I was going to have to ask off of work and make arrangements to ensure things were in order. 

A big thing I was worried about was transportation around the city. When I asked what our plan was about transportation while we were down there and they said we were going to Uber everywhere because renting a car for the 3 days was going to be $1000+. I thought that was ridiculous and I said that ubering will definitely be more expensive and that I could rent a car. Another girl going really wanted to rent a car too because Ubers make her nervous. I looked it up and it was going to be $35 each when we split the price of the rental car for the 3 days. We went ahead and rented a car because for us, we felt it was worth it. When we got down there, the other girls were mad that we got the car and when we told them that it would only be $35 they refused to participate and chose to take their, now even more overpriced, Ubers. 

One night they decided that they wanted to go to a seafood restaurant because it was lent and one of the bridesmaids was newly catholic. Another friend and I were ready to go to dinner at 5:30, but everyone else took their sweet time and they weren’t ready to go out until 7:45pm. Once everyone was ready, they said their Uber was there and we got in our car and left to meet them at the restaurant. When we got down there, we messaged them to ask where they were and they said they ordered the wrong Uber and they were waiting on the new one. We asked them if they wanted us to get a table and they said no because the restaurant closes at 9 and it was now 8:15 and they were still waiting on their new Uber. We quickly searched up some other places and they said “you guys just do whatever you want, we’ll meet you later”. This really hurt my friend’s feelings and we felt ditched and hungry so we ate at a longhorn without them. 

While we were eating, they texted us to let us know that they were at Margaritaville and that when we were done, we could sit with them before we all went out to the bar. My friend and I decided that we didn’t want to sit there and watch them eat and we were tired, so we left and went back to the airbnb. 

We didn’t stay up and go back out with them. We were mad, so we deliberately went back and fell asleep.

After the party was over, our friend told us that we ruined her bachelorette party and we were being difficult before the party and during. I don’t feel like we did anything wrong and I don’t feel bad for asking questions prior to the party because we were spending $600+ each to fly, pay for the airbnb, food, etc.",0.04
"AITA for expecting my parents to give me money to invest? Upon graduating college I moved to an expensive city where I was able to find work and support myself. Nothing special there. However, it was pretty apparent that I would be unable to buy a home in the city without the support of my parents. Well, I approached them and the answer was “no”. This was slightly upsetting as my parents are wealthy and could afford it, but I'm in the same situation as most other people — who cares, move on.

I continued working in the city and they eventually offered to help me purchase a home. When I took them up on their offer they surprisingly said “no” again and told me that I should move to a region that I could afford. A little upsetting and confusing but fair enough.

Needless to say, after a few years I moved to another part of the country that I could afford on my own. Very far from my friends and family — but economical.

This is where things go awry. While I moved to one of the least expensive parts of the country, my sibling moved to an expensive city to start pursuing their career. My sibling had difficulty finding a property to rent, so my parents bought a property valued at roughly a million dollars and gifted it to my sibling to live in.

I understand that no one is entitled to anything. I did however find this very upsetting. Far more upsetting than the “no” I heard before because it felt like my sibling was getting extremely preferential treatment.It was not until my parents bought my sibling a home that they offered to help me purchase a home. Here’s where I’m wondering if I am the asshole. I told them I moved across the country to a place I could afford independently because they made it very clear they would not assist me financially and I don’t need their help buying a home. Instead I would like money to put away into long-term investments as a retirement fund. I was also hoping to do this with their assistance as they are very financially savvy. It’s also worth noting that the home they are offering to buy me is something I can buy myself and maybe 20%-30% of what my sibling's home is worth. Lastly, I’m not particularly certain I will continue living in this area which is another reason why buying a home does not make sense.    


They have said “no” to the idea of investing money and are calling me entitled because I got upset when they informed me of their decision. I’m really confused here. The definition of entitled is when someone feels they are owed something, and I do indeed feel as if I am owed something. I would never have felt this way if my parents didn't buy my sibling a home. However, at this moment I’m really upset with them and feel they are picking favorites. AITA?",0.39
"AITA for telling my fiancé I don’t care if she takes my last name? My fiancé (30F) and I (30M) recently got engaged.

I walked in on her signing her name a bunch of times the other day and asked her about it. She excitedly said she was practicing w her new last name - my last name - and asked me what I thought of the ring of it. 

I asked her if she was sure she wanted to take my last name. She looked confused and asked why she wouldn’t want to. I said I just figured she would want to keep hers plus it’s so much paperwork and a tedious process to change it. 

She asked me why I didn’t want her to take mine. I said that I really don’t care either way…but I hope she isn’t doing it for me or out of obligation. 

All hell broke loose afterwards. She said ofc she’s doing it for me. She was really angry then really sad that I didn’t want to “claim” her or was embarrassed of her. 

If I’m being honest, I would prefer if she kept her maiden name. My mom kept her maiden name and it was a real source of pride for her as she began to accomplish more in life. And in turn it made me proud to have 2 surnames I could also be proud of. I want the same for my fiancé and future kids too. But truthfully, i really don’t mind what she decides in the end. 

I tried to tell her this but she still seems caught up that I said I didn’t care what she did and is quite upset.

"AITA for being disappointed in my boyfriends Christmas present? I really hope this doesn't come across as ungrateful and maybe I am which is why I brought it to reddit- weeks later after thinking if its even worth bringing up.
Basically, I feel like My boyfriends(25M) Christmas present has zero effort put into it. He knows I (22F) love sentimental, well thought presents that scream 'me'. I also love a good surprise which he knows well. I always think a good gift is something that perfectly matches the person or they've hinted at it but of course its okay to get it wrong, no ones perfect but I can't help but feel let down. 
For context, for our anniversary earlier on this year he got me a perfume which i always wanted. Then... For Christmas he got me another different perfume. I Never mentioned I needed one (have mentioned a lot of things I need) and already have a lot of perfume left I got from him for our anniversary. I was surprised when I opened it. It smelt nice and I thanked him. Then he immediately launches into why he chose it. He said he asked his female co workers what they should get ME. This bugged me a bit.They don't know me, I've never met them ever and a few of them are new and don't even know him that well. They went for the classic perfume idea and he settled with that. They all recommended the same popular scent. He bought it that night. They probably didn't even know he already got me a perfume earlier on this year. Something about that made me feel like he put no thought about what I personally love and need. It was his female co workers who know practically nothing about me, my taste, my vibe who put thought into the present- a trendy perfume, not him. It was all they could suggest but they don't know me like he does which is what disappointed me. Its a nice perfume and does smell nice but I'm not even sure if suits me. Also important to note that he ordered it online and admitted he never smelt it in stores just trusted his co workers. Anyway, am I being ungrateful and an asshole for thinking this way? He still got me a present but the thought wasn't there which matters to me a lot more. I haven't said anything to him. Please let me know because my mind is conflicted about if my feelings are justified.",0.61

"AITA for causing a sweet old librarian’s mental breakdown? Hey so I never post on Reddit, but after all this happened I thought the internet might find it as crazy and I did, and also I could use the advice.

I (27F) recently started a new job working with kids at a local high school working with kids. I was situated in the library and worked very close to the librarian (65ish F), who is a sweet and friendly older lady. I was nervous about fitting in but she (let’s call her Susan) made me feel comfortable right away. We would chat sometimes when it was quiet and after a month or so I felt comfortable enough to ask her questions like: “Hey Susan do you think I should set up a desk in this corner?” Or “Susan I brought this little cabinet so I have somewhere to lock things up.” She seldom complained or criticized, and when she did (like when I kept forgetting I can’t eat in the library) she was always polite about it. I thought we were on friendly terms. I was wrong.

A few weeks ago I overheard a Susan and a student talking about book recommendations and, in an effort to be outgoing, I joined them. Susan pulled the student away, and I got the message and sat back down. A minute later Susan approached me and she. Just. Exploded.

I was shocked. The kind and friendly librarian was in my face, aggressively calling me inappropriate and unprofessional. She said I “didn’t belong” and to “sit at your desk, work with your students, and leave everyone else alone.”

I learned later that she went home and broke down. She called the principal crying because she didn’t want to go back to work while I was there. She said I was terrible to her and I was ruining her job by being in her environment. In the end I was almost fired before somebody actually asked my side of things. 

So now I am just. So confused. I just can’t reconcile this version of me with my past behaviour. I like Susan and I genuinely thought she liked me. But while I thought we were getting along, she was staying up all night crying about how much she hated being around me. I work in the hallway now because Susan can’t stand to have me in the library anymore.

"AITA if I snooped in my past three boyfriends phones WITHOUT ANY red flags but discovered they all cheated on me? I know this is a grey area, but I really need to get some consensus on if what I’m doing (and did is right or wrong)

About three years ago, I snooped on my first boyfriend’s phone out of simple curiosity. He said he had to do overtime at work, and I just felt like checking for insurance to see if I was being lied to or not. Well, while he was sleeping, I put his passcode in and low and behold he was having sex with other people.

I wish it stopped there, but over the couple years I had two boyfriends after that and the need to periodically snoop just grew. Whether it was them saying they were stuck in traffic, running behind from an appointment, meeting with friends, etc — I just took it upon myself to do my own checks and had similar terrible discoveries. They also had sex with others and had been actively cheating on me.

I have full faith that I was really a good girlfriend and wasn’t the reason why I was subjected to abuse and gaslighting. However, I also violated their trust by breaching their privacy to have my own self preservation.

"AITA for playing a role in my cousin's BF being suspended from work? There's a few moving pieces to this, so bear with me.

**My argument with my cousin:**

A while back my \[31F\] cousin \[27F\] and I got into a very heated argument. The short of it is: my cousin announced that she's trying to start a family, and I questioned whether that's the wisest decision, given that neither her nor her partner are even capable of being functional adults, let alone parents.  The argument ended in her disowning me. We haven't spoken since, and I don't intend to ever speak to her again. 

Since then I've learnt that my cousin has fallen pregnant. 

**I consult for a company that my cousin's BF works at:**

For the past six years I've been consulting for a client in various capacities: first as a lawyer, then as a lobbyist. The client and I have a *very* strong relationship. Put it this way: last Christmas, my client's CEO even invited me down to her beach house. 

My cousin's BF \[20s-something M\] is employed by the client in some IT role. He's been there for a few years.

**The altercation:**

Last week I was working on-site when I bumped into my cousin's BF in the cafeteria. Quite literally. He purposefully rammed his shoulders into me as we passed. When I looked back at him he said, ""watch your back, mate."". 

I reported this incident to my client's HR department, and shortly afterwards, my client's CEO reached out to ask about the incident. When she asked me what I would like to happen, I told her that I am happy to defer to her HR department and what they believe to be the more appropriate way forward. 

My client's HR department decided to suspend my cousin's BF pending an investigation. 

This has caused multiple members of my extended family to be very upset at me. They said I shouldn't have escalated internal family drama externally. And now that my cousin's BF's job is on the line, that's causing her a lot of stress, which is—apparently—impacting the pregnancy. 

Let's be clear: I didn't do anything. I didn't start a fight with my cousin's BF. Nor did I affect his suspension. That was his HR department's decision. So, from where I'm standing, I'm completely innocent. Am I wrong?

"AITA for speaking out against my cousin who makes fun of my skin color? So first things first. I (18M) am a brown Filipino guy, while my cousin (22M) is fairly white (still Filipino). Over the years, he has made tons of remarks that poked fun at my brown skin. Which was the reason why I am insecure about how I look until this day. A few days ago, I, a Christian, referencing the Psalms, posted in Facebook about how I was fearfully and wonderfully made by God and how I won't let colorist statements affect me. I have every right to appreciate myself. Of course, I didn't mention him by name. I just labeled him as ""A cousin"". I said that ""I had cousins who made fun of my brown skin but I won't let that affect me""  
  
Now, on an unrelated note, I have had my own fair share of faults against him. I once threatened him  during one of our fights years ago. But that isn't related to his anti-brown skin remarks.  
  
Here comes his mom, my aunt, defending him. She said that I was the one playing the victim. Both she and her son said that I was the real bully because of the threatening incident. That was literally only one time. He made fun of my brown skin so many times in the past, which was the reason why I felt insecure about myself for my whole life.

Me (16f) and my brother had just gotten into a fight and we took the matter to our dad so he could solve it, as my dad was hearing my brother side of the story, he told him “women will always be annoying, you just have to deal with it”.

"AITA for not giving my friend/maid of honor a plus one for her boyfriend of 2 years? I’m getting married in a few months and have decided not to give my friend/maid of honor a plus one. For the record, I’m completely open to changing this! I’ve talked to a few friends but I need an unbiased opinion because unfortunately, they’re no help.

So here’s the backstory. My friend and her boyfriend have had a very rocky relationship. About a year ago she called me crying, asking me to go over pretty late at night. Of course I went no questions asked. When I got there she told me they got into an argument that turned physical and eventually led to the police being called. This wasn’t the first time something like this had happened so I asked her what she wanted to do. She decided that she wanted to break up with him because aside from these incidents, their relationship wasn’t working out. I agreed and stayed the night and the next day he moved out. Well, spoiler alert, they got back together. I made it very clear how I felt about him that night so I’m pretty sure that’s the reason she barely told me a couple months ago that they got back together and he moved back in. 

As I mentioned before they got into arguments that turned physical multiple times. And while I don’t support their relationship, I will always be there for her when she needs me. 

I think it might be helpful to say every time I’ve witnessed an argument between them there was alcohol involved. The wedding will be open bar and I just really want to avoid as much drama as possible especially when it can be prevented. I feel like I might be the asshole since they’ve been together for a while but I’m really not sure.

So I'm an film maker and I am currently working on an action thriller film that is set around christmas time. It is an remake of an very popular Liam Neeson film about a father and son being on the run from hitmans on christmas eve. I recently started production around mid november and there were a couple of incidents where I became ill and I had to halt production for about two weeks during december. Now that I'm recovered and feeling better, I am wanting to start up production again. My film is currently about 40 percent complete and so I need to keep my christmas lights up for another month or two. My parents are not happy about it and they are telling me that I need to take them down before the Home Owners Association complains about it. I don't understand why they would complain about it as I did the same thing last year when I was working on another film that was set around christmas time. My previous film was about the Quad State tornado that hit in December 2021. I left the lights up until mid April which is when I took it down. My parents were upset but they couldn't do anything about it. I'm planning on doing the same thing again except until mid March. I talked to my friends about it and they said that I'm in the wrong. They've told me ""You do this every year where you leave it up past christmas for like 2 to 3 months, no one who is sane does that and your just making your parents house look tacky. You better take them down before you get a complaint and get sued by the HOA."" I told my friends that if an HOA person comes to my house and complains, I would just tell them to suck my cholo and slam the door on them. My friends call me a raging asshole. I don't get why no one understands why I need these lights up in order to make my film. I can't and will not take them down cause I need it for my film. AITA for refusing to take them down ?? ",0.86
"AITA for telling my friend she’s weird for wearing her ex’s engagement ring? My (27F) friend (26F) has recently started wearing the engagement ring her ex proposed to her with. Their relationship ended over two years ago and they don’t talk anymore, and she has been in several relationships since then but is currently single. I could almost understand if she was wearing it to an event or out somewhere that she didn’t want any guys’ attention, but she’s been wearing it every day and on her left hand. She’s also an aspiring influencer on social media and has flashed the ring in several of her posts. 

I finally said it was weird she was wearing it. I thought she’d given it back after the engagement ended and told her it wasn’t appropriate to be wearing it like it’s any ordinary piece of jewelry, especially on her left hand. It could also be offensive to her ex’s current girlfriend if she came across the photos and knew it was the ring he’d bought her. She got offended and said it’s her ring and she can wear it however and wherever she likes. AITA?",0.67
"AITA For refusing dirty looking money. I work in a coffee shop. I both make coffee and other thing containing caffeine as well as work the register. That includes taking payments and handling money. 

A lady came in earlier and ordered a drink. With out giving to much detail, she was gross. Smelt like cat poo and kitty litter. I didn't comment on it at all nor did i show any indication that it bothered me, as i use to dealing with this sort of thing form time to time.

The problem arrived when she went to pay, she dug in her purse and pulled out a wad of ones stuck together by who knows what and a few gunked up coins. 

Now, I know money in itself is dirt. But this stuff wasn't worth touching and I had full plans on sanitizing the area afterwards. 

I told the lady i couldn't except that money and asked if she had any other way of paying. She did not. She got belligerent with me telling me it was real money and i had to except it. My problem is, I wouldn't tough that money if i were wearing gloves. It was exact change though. 

I ended up compromising the situation by sliding the aside with a stir stick and giving her the coffee. My plan was to slid it into a large cup and washing it later. 

She didn't like that I didn't add it to my register and called me an asshole. Snatched her money off the counter and chucked her drink on the floor before leaving. 

So AITA for not excepting gross money?  ",0.88
"AITA for Being Mad at My Family for Interrupting My Boyfriend and I? So, for context, I (21F) live in a trailer with a lot of people. I used to share a room with my sibing, but the water damage in our room made it so that I cannot sleep in there so I now sleep on the couch. My two brothers share a room (M27 & M29) and my parents share a room (M56 & F54). 

I am currently home because I had a lot of financial issues, and I do not pay rent. However, I take care of my Dad and brother who both suffered strokes and have a job. 

Now, getting to the point here, my boyfriend and I are long distance. We talk on the phone mainly at night from around 12:00a.m. to 2:00a.m.. It is the only time I request privacy in the living room.

So, tonight when my boyfriend got home from work he called and we were supposed to watch the new episode of fargo together via video streaming as it’s been our ritual for the past few weeks to watch the new one when it’s out on Hulu. However, people kept coming into the kitchen and making food, getting drinks, etc… for around an hour. It’s now 1:20a.m. and my boyfriend fell asleep, so now I cannot watch our show which is the one thing I was looking forward to after a long day. 

I told my family about why I was upset and their response was “it’s the living room, people are allowed to live in it.” and my brother even told me I was being a selfish brat. 

Am I the asshole here?

EDIT: It’s more so the fact that my family isn’t quiet when they are making said food/drink, I only ask for privacy because I know they will not be quiet. My dad will purposely say things while I’m on the phone to embarrass me and my siblings will just start talking to me out of no where while I’m just trying to watch something. ",0.32
"AITA to blame mom's divorce and her family for my emotional issues? I am 27m currently working as a software engineer, doing good financially/career wise. 
But I struggle a lot with establishing emotional bonds with people, I barely have 1-2 decent friends, rest all are 'professional' connections and it's not like I am introvert or shy! Nothing like that, it's just I don't even feel to open up with people.

Context : My mom(49f) got divorced when I was 2, dad was alcoholic. She was pregnant when she left with me(aborted later) so I am a single child. Mom shifted in with her parents (my maternal grandparents) because she didn't have enough money to live separately. But when mom's brother got married and his wife came in, Things went south, she didn't liked my mom living and taking resources from her parents, things escalated to court, mom struggled, eventually after few years we had to leave that house because of moms SIL. 

Struggled with lack of money, mom did odd small jobs, I got bullied at school a lot initially, ""Fatherless"". I didn't had any male role model in life growing up, learned all manly things from internet on my own.(It's now I realised how badly it affected me) I constantly tried to idolize sports starts, wrestlers, TV personalities because I didn't had any real life big bro or male figure. Mom has always been very emotional, she cried a lot. 
I developed a lot of insecurity complexes, Identity crisis like I don't matter, no one cares for me(Its even worse when you are poor) But I managed, cried a lot on every festival, when I see others my age happy, with family, having money. I never had that. I never went out on any family dinner etc. mom's family already disowned her because of SIL .

Now that I have money, I do good financially, I also financially support mom.(By the way, mom never Re-married or dated after divorce, she pretty much stayed or choose to live a single life, never asked her why) I've bought my own apartment, mom also lives with me. But still, the mental pain, emotional instability is there, I just don't feel happy usually. 

Is this all because I am raised by single mom? Or because I've seen separation all my childhood ? Any advice? Would it all be different if mom had Re-married again? AITA?",0.14
"AITA for yelling at my brothers? I(16F) weighed myself for the first time in ages last week. It popped up that I'm 223 pounds and keep in mind I'm 5'6. I in hindsight made the poor decision to not only tell my brothers( 21M, 23M) but ask them to help me lose weight, help me exercise. I asked them because they're very health conscious, they run marathons.

Their idea was that I go over to the 23yo's place and do push ups and sit ups. I thought it was pretty uninventive but, not the worst starting place. 

They asked me to do 10 each. I got to about 4 sit ups before I was gassed, and couldn't do one push up.

Rather than at least give kudos on 4 sit ups, they proceed to lecture me on how this should be a wakeup call. I told them to be quiet. They told me to be quiet and told me I should be very alarmed that at 16 I cant do push ups and can barely do sit ups. They hoped I saw the consequences of my over-eating. I told them again, yelling, to shut up, stop lecturing and just focus on help. They called me lazy and hard-headed.

"AITA for not giving my friend a ride because her mom was too busy doing her nails My F18 friend didnt have a ride afterschool her mom was 40 mins away doing her nails and I F17 have a car and license. I take my boyfriend home he lives like two minutes away from the school and i pass that way either way so it doesnt bother me plus i get to spend more time with him. My friend lives about 10 away from my house so its a bigger detour. My friend has another friend (lets call her B) who also has a car and license but yesterday she left early and told her last minute so my friend didnt have a ride. My friend doesnt really like B, she just uses her for the rides home so she prefers me to take her. I have taken my friend home a few times but dont want it to be come a habit plus she has a mom that is able to pick her up. 

I feel like its more of a conflict between me and the mom cus to me it seems like the mom just relies on other ppl and doesnt want to pick her daughter up. There has been occasions when shes at home but just doesnt want to pick her daughter up so B take my friend home. 

The problem though is that my friend got mad or sad that i said i didnt want to take her home and now is giving me the silent treatment. I know it might be a little harsh but i think i am in the right to not want to give everyone a ride. I just think it’s ridiculous and now i have to endure her silence.",0.8
"AITA for wanting to travel without my family? I own my own business and I work from home. I can work from anywhere with an internet connection.

My wife is an attorney and could work remotely as well, but prefers to be in the office. She works 9-5 and really does not like to take more than a couple days off at a time.

This has been a point of contention between us for a long time. Anytime we plan a trip we always argue about how long to go for. I always argue that it’s not worth spending the money and a whole day traveling in each direction if we are only going to stay somewhere for a few days. She just doesn’t want to take time off work.

So recently I said I want to start taking trips by myself, or at least extending my trip so we travel together and she goes back alone or with the kids and I stay longer.

I even floated the idea of renting a place somewhere for a month while the kids are out of school for the summer and just living and working remotely from a new place. She looked at me like I had two heads. I said what if she and the kids come for two weeks, and I stay an extra two weeks.

So she got all bent out of shape about this and told her parents, who said I was selfish for leaving the family behind. I said I would love to have the family with me and even keep the kids if my wife wants to go back early, but I shouldn’t be anchored to one place just because of her job and her refusal to take time off.

"AITA for not wanting my parents to join our vacation? (Please excuse any errors or typos, English is not my first language.)  
  
My wife and I are planning on a seven day vacation over the Easter holidays. We're both working very hard and can only ever travel during the school breaks, because my wife is a teacher. We try to spend at least two weeks of the year in our favourite little sea side town as a vacation. I have known the place since my childhood and my wife grew to love it there, too. We've been looking forward to this vacation for over half a year now and we really need it, just some time for the two of us with no thoughts about work, family or home.  
  
Enter my parents: They had the brilliant idea to book a vacation too, in the same hotel (it's our ""family hotel"") and our stays there are overlapping. They'll get there on day five of our trip. They're not many restaurants around, the spa area is rather small and they'll have breakfast every morning, too - which means that we'll see each other pretty much all day. I love my parents, but spending too much time with them can be exhausting and also, is some private time with my wife too much to ask for?  
  
I told my mother that I am upset about this and suggested, that we will have to reschedule our vacation (which is, as mentioned before, not easy for us because of work). I was hoping that she'd maybe offer to reschedule their weekend trip, as she only works part-time and my father is already retired, so they're way more flexible with their schedules. But no, not a chance.  
  
I feel bad for telling my mother off like that, especially now that is hasn't changed anything. I still don't know whether I am in the right here or whether I am just overreacting. I'd love to hear your thoughts on this, but please stay respectful, as this is already stressing me out.",0.06
"AITA For removing my son from a sleepover Hi I'm 37F. I have a 10 year old son. I'll call him Sam. 

My son was invited for a sleepover from one of his classmates, lets call him Taylor. Because I don't know his parents very well, we got together a few times so we could get to know each other. We eventually set up a date and the other mother which I'll call Lady for now on, insisted on hosting the event. I agreed and later dropped my son off, telling him to behave and all that jazz.

Toward the end of the day around 9-ish, I got a call from my sons phone. He has a basic flip phone for things like this. He was upset and wanted to come home. I asked what was wrong and he told me that Lady wanted to put him in a diaper. 

I told him to put her on the phone and she answered it in a huff telling me my son wasn't being stubborn and misbehaving.  I could hear my son in the background saying he just wanted to go home.  So I told her I'd be there in a few minutes and hung up. 

When I got there i was let in by her husband, he apologized for the trouble and I went to find my son. He was still upset when I found him sitting at their kitchen table along with Taylor. Asked him what was going on and he explained to me that because Taylor wet his bed Lady wanted him to wear a diaper as well. I turned and looked at lady and told her Sam doesn't wet the bed and didn't need to put anything extra on for bed. 

She argued back that it wouldn't hurt him and would make Taylor feel better. To be honest I kind of understood where she was coming at and even considered asking Sam if he'd be willing to do it for his friend. 

That was until I saw the thing, I was expecting a pullup. But this was what looked like a thick adult diaper meant to fit kids. Then the shocker came when my son told me she tried me make him take off his pants and lay on the floor so she could put it on him. I turned back to Lady and told  how inappropriate this all was and collected his things to leave. She got belligerent and said Sam didn't have anything she hasn't seen before.  

So we left, Taylor the pre boy looked crestfallen. Not that a blame him at all. But my problem and the reason for this post is do to the fact Lady put what happened on facebook. Most of the commenters are on her side.

"WIBTA if i tell my boyfriend he has to pay a larger share of the rent if we move closer to his work? So we have been looking into apartments, or rather *I* have. No big deal since id rather be the one doing it anyway. I know the prerequisites that both of us want/need in a place. My boyfriend seriously has something against driving a ""long distance"" from work. Like he would complain if its more than 30 mins away. I was trying to find places in the middle as i drive about 45 mins to work, now i dont really mind it since i live rent free atm and i myself am not going to throw a kiniption over having to commute a bit. 

The thing is its hard to find places that fit the criteria within the budget. We both make about the same, and my job is kind of specialized so its not like i could easily find one in a new area. Same with him plus hes been there for like 7 years and im not going to ask that from someone. 

So i guess to cut the story short, i found some places veryy close to his work that check all boxes. Im talking less than 10 mins away. Now i would be okay with that, but I'd almost expect him to pay a bit more because of that. It will be cheaper for him vehicular wise, and he will get more free time with that short of a commute. I feel like that satisfies my justice complex, but it could also come off as shitty or bossy, i dont know. Just looking for outside perspective on if i would be an ahole for expecting that.",0.5
"WIBTA if I canceled on taking me child nephew out for a birthday dinner. Updated at the bottom of the post.

My (30M) nephew (7M) turned 7 on Saturday. We have always been very close, as I spend a lot of time babysitting him while his parents work.

He turned 7 on Saturday and the whole family got together for dinner, and slowly filtered out towards the end of the night. By the end I was the last one left and we did some drawing together, and the last interaction we had was ""love you lots, bye"" and a big hug, like usual. Before that we agreed I would pick him up from school to go out today for a birthday dinner and some cake, just me and him.

Since then something has changed. I have seen him 3 times and he has completely blanked me. Not everyone, just me. He makes a point to talk to other people in front of me and doesn't even look at me when I'm talking to him. Even to the point of he was asking for medicine for his cough but didn't even acknowledge me trying to give him any. I've tried explaining this is hurtful, asking why, and I'm getting nothing in response. He is his usual self with everyone else.

I now won't see him until later today and honestly, part of me is hurt and doesn't want to spend the quality time together and just take him home to the family, but *mainly I'm concerned about taking him out and being completely ignored out in public which to me seems like it could become a safety concern*. I also don't want to reward bad behaviour. 

I'm worried I might just be justifying punishing him for having my feelings hurt and also not being understanding of his age, and I don't have my own children or experience with 7 year olds as he is my only nephew. I also don't want to make things worse by not taking him and having him resent me for it.

Thanks.

EDIT: My current plan is as follows:
 
I will be picking him up from school and, instead of going straight out which was the plan, taking him home first and try to talk to him again, where i will explain that he is being hurtful and that he doesnt have to tell me why but if he wants to he can, but if he wants to just move on he can change out of his school clothes and we can go out and have a good time, but if he wants to proceed ignoring me we will leave it until another date.

I have also made my MAIN concerns about safety bold as nobody seems to have addressed that, with some people straight up saying i am too worried about my feelings being hurt, when my point was specifically that i want to clear up that that is not why, in my mind i was thinking this, but wanted to be clear i wasn't just excusing myself.",0.1
"AITA for not stepping up as a father to a child that isn't mine? 
*Throwaway*

    About 4 years ago I (M17) had my first child when I was a senior in highschool with my girlfriend at the time (18F) Once we graduated we got married as I had both turned 18 and my child turned 1 and my parents got me and my Wife a house. About a year later my wife got pregnant again and I was excited. However, I found out that she was cheating due to dude she was sleeping with telling me he thinks he was the father of my children.

     I confronted my wife and she confessed which broke my heart. And she crying begging me to forgive her. I got a DNA test done on my 2 year old which came back that I wasn't father. To say I was hurt was an understatement. We had an argument and I told her I wanted a divorce and she basically begged me to stay. However, I decided to move in with my parents for the time being. 

    While I was there for maybe 2 weeks? My mother and father kept insiting that I should still play a fatherly role in the child's life. My mother told me that she knows it must hurt to know that my child isn't mine but even though the child isn't biologically mine, I'm the only father the child has ever known, and my name is on the birth certificate. My father told me he was disappointed in me for abandoning my children and he raised me better than that. 

   That was my last straw so I called my friend and asked if I could move in with him. He told me yes and I lived with him for 5 months before I got myself an apartment.

    Now, 2 years later (21) my ex-wife and parents  have gotten in touch with me through one of my ""friends"" giving my parents my number. My parents and ex wife basically called me and told me that I need to come and see my child and practically begging me. They said that they are sorry for how things ended but I'm the only father he knows and know his brother is without a father and I need to step up and be a man. I blocked them. My girlfriend says I need to go see ""my"" children while my friends said since I already pay child support for the now 4 year old I'm doing more than enough for them. I can't bring myself to go back. Whenever I saw my child who I thought was my child I keep getting reminded of the lies I was told and how my wife was actively cheating on me and led me to believe both my children were mine although they weren't.

"AITA for not agreeing with my sister taking the family house? I (F), 37 years old, married with 2 kids have been dealing for the past 2 months with all these uncomfortable discussions around who takes what after our father passed away some months ago.

My sister (28) and recently married is proceeding to taking over the sole family house that we ever owned as a family (my mother is still alive and living in that house).

According to my father’s latest statements and due to the fact that he didn’t manage to give my sister the same amount of money as he did to me (\~55k euros), he wanted the family house to go to her since he always believed that it is worth around the same amount.

However this is not the case as it is valued at \~80k euros.

Last week I spoke to my mother about this, telling her that either way I see it, (financially or sentimentally) I feel left out and I would like them to consider me taking a small portion (1/5 or 1/4) so that I can have something from my parents as well.

AITA for wanting to discuss this with my sister who is a step away from signing papers (although I also have to consent so that my portion goes to her)? I am stuck and do not know how to approach this so as to avoid frustration and possibly bitter feelings.

"AITA for ignoring another teacher and telling them I'm busy in front of my class? I (30M) have been teaching at a school for 2 years now. I am in my 7th year of teaching. I’m  good at it, students like me and do well in my class. 

The other teacher of my subject, Mr D (53M), has been at the school for  20 years. He is very particular about how he wants things done. Majority of students hate him because he is extremely rude and has anger issues. Many students have told me they think he is bi-polar because he goes from being overly friendly to aggressive at the drop of a hat. I always shut down these conversations. A student was talking about him and said “he has a specific expectation of what he wants you to do, but doesn’t tell you how to do it, and then gets angry when you haven’t done it the way he wants.” This sums him up perfectly and is relevant to what’s next.
  
Ever since I met him, Mr D has been extremely rude to me – ranging from  passive aggressive comments to outright rudeness, to saying negative things about me to students. I have always brushed this off. My Head of Dept has even told him TWICE that this is unacceptable (I did not ask them to do this, they only told me about it after).
  
Several months ago Mr D flipped out over something  minor, and came to my class while I was teaching and demanded I talk outside. He attacked how I teach, how he thinks I’m not teaching the students properly (by his standards), and how “this isn’t good enough”. This is incorrect, and I tried to get a word in but he wouldn’t let me. 
  
This went on for a couple minutes as I stood there stunned. I turned around and looked in the room, and about half the class was listening to our conversation. I told him the conversation was over and went back inside. I literally could not speak I was so angry. I had to leave and go to the bathroom to collect myself. About 10 minutes later he sent me an email apologising. I emailed him back the next day  and he apologised several more times. 
  
Since then, I have ignored him beyond the only most essential communication, which I try to keep to email. He has noticed this, as he keeps coming up to me and trying to be nice and speak to me. I don’t give him anything beyond a one-word response and walking away. 
 
  
The other day we had an assembly, and some students sang infront of the whole school. After he came up to me and said how nice it was, and I said “uh huh” and turned and walked away. Next period, he came to my class to speak to me again, and I said “it’s pretty obvious I’m busy right now, send me an email and if I have time I’ll reply”, turned my back on him and continued speaking to a student. One of my students saw this and said that they saw me walk away from him during the assembly (I have no idea how they saw this lol). They were laughing as they said it but said that I was being rude to him, which they found very funny because they don’t like him. I spoke to another teacher and they said that I was being rude and should be nicer to him.

He is leaving me  bc I allegedly slapped him in the face twice after he spat in my face repeatedly during an argument? Btw he did call the police and file a report, I was not arrested as there was no proof of the accusation. He says this is unforgivable, and he is moving out when he starts his new job on Feb 12th. Fast forward it’s been over a month since the incident, we are starting to get back to normal until I show him screenshots of a girl he cheated on me with insinuating they were still talking. He lost it accused me of being toxic and everything went back to him treating me like he hates me. Then right before Christmas our car gets totaled . I worked and ought w the insurance for coverage and am waiting for about $10k in settlement money all coming in my name (car wasn’t worth much ). I had thought we reconciled, and he spoke about to moving back in the room w me. But then he got in a heated argument this past Sunday night and when he kept telling me how he didn’t want to hear my voice, I told him to sleep in the other room. The next morning he proceeded to pack all this stuff and ask his friend to come get his stuff, meanwhile I am begging him not to blow up our future and plans. We have an investment idea for the 10k.  Again bc he didn’t leave, and he spent all his time in our bedroom w me talking about our future together I thought we reconciled. Until yesterday morning at 9 am his friend calls him and asks to hangout and says he can pick up his stuff. He hops up proceeds to tell me he is taking his things and we started arguing. After he insists he is really moving out I told him I can’t afford to invest thousand and pay this rent all alone. He then proceeded to tell me I am threatening him with money and he can just leave rn. So he took almost all his stuff besides a few outfits and left. He came back last night and proceeded to tell me he is leaving not bc of anything but me and he’ll never forgive me for beating him and putting hands on him. He keeps saying I never can fix this and he is leaving no matter what . Then he will say nothing changed and we can lay together and there is the smallest possibility he doesn’t leave me . BUT he basically already moved out , and it telling me if I don’t help him get a car then he will block me and never speak to me again after he leave but if I help him he may still be there for me when I call. 

What do I do?

"AITA for being annoyed with my colleagues/friends? Me (M24) had worked in the same company for 2 years. In December, my contract expired and I did not renew it.
Many folk have joined and left the company, to which it has always been fine and when you joined you got a welcome drinks at the end of your first week, and when you leave you get a leaving event/party/do of some sorts to say thanks and goodbye.
I decided to mainly organise most of the leaving events, as I had a few connections within the city so could get discounts etc.
It's custom to not organise your own leaving do, so a friend/colleague (who I see outside of work regularly) agreed to take over organising it... they tried and I commend their efforts, but 90% of folk said no to the dates proposed without offering a suitable date. So we agreed to do it in January as Christmas can be expensive and time etc etc. So I thought that was fair.
However....
I am the only one who has left the company without a leaving do, and now someone else is leaving (after I've left) and they're getting one. She posted in the group chat her goodbyes, and everyone jumped on it saying ""leaving party"". They all still messaged me asking if I was going to her leaving do. So when one of them who asked (in what I felt was a patronising tone) why I didn't go to the recent leaving do for (we'll call them Gwen), I kicked off a little (not angrily) but just a firm point of how I felt. To which the responses were rather blaming me than accepting responsibility. Stating I'm in the wrong for expecting a leaving do at this time and I should organise it myself, but all I wanted was to sit in the pub across the street from the office and have a drink or two and be on my merry way. This Gwen who left after me, and the 14 others who've left before me got bowling, pool, dinner at Italian restaurants etc etc (which I organised 12 of them). Worst of all, management have paid for most of these events, and yet not a single offering for me. Like the beeping hell??
More people are now leaving, it's just how the organisation works. Some do 3 months, 6, 12, 18, or 24. So a few leaving dos are getting organised and paid for.

Am I the arsehole for not going to any of the recent events or leaving dos or for not responding to messages? Am I the arsehole for remvoing them from LinkedIn? Because I feel like my reaction is pretty tame, yet I've been made out to be a massive self entitled d*ck.",0.9
"AITA for demanding that my husband and I split our tax bill proportionally to our earnings? We are in our 40s, generally happily married. My husband is generally lovely but i’m having a little hard time dealing with him when it comes to finances. I work as a teacher and earn about 25000 less per year than my husband. He also gets a bonus on top of his salary which can be around 10-20% of his yearly income. I don’t get a bonus or the 13th salary (we live in Europe). Our last year tax bill is quite large (last year was the first year my husband worked through 100% after being unemployed a couple of years before). We decide our bills equally (my husband cooks once or twice a week therefore I think it’s sort of fair as I cannot cook) however I disagree with my husband that I should pay 50% of the tax bill if i earn much less. His argument is that i get lots of holidays as a teacher and travel more often than him (I visit my family in another country or travel with my colleagues)

Am i TA for refusing to split the tax bill equally if there is more than 30% difference in our salaries?",0.14
"AITA for not wanting to have a birthday dinner with my family, over a cake I 16F wanted to have small birthday celebration on the day of my birthday with my family. I wanted to get a cheesecake from a shop. I couldn’t get the cheesecake because I didn’t have the money for it. I was waiting on my mom or brother to send me the money and neither of them did. I know that my family is having a rocky financial situation. I couldn’t get a cake that was 13 pounds and it occurred to me I’m going to have a dinner on the weekend that would be around 200 pounds. (Approx. 10ppl coming) It would be wrong of me to have a dinner when I couldn’t get a cake. I don’t care about the birthday dinner because everyone in my family kept pushing me to celebrate my birthday when I didn’t want to. I literally wanted to do nothing for my birthday and they kept pushing the idea, so I caved and made a plan. Now that I didn’t get the cake, I decided that I don’t want to have a birthday dinner. I told my mom, my decision and she started arguing with me, then called me selfish, unfair and an ungrateful bastard because I’m upset about not having a cake. She said I hate her and I don’t like her because if I wanted the cake she would have given me her credit card. I wouldn’t want to use her credit card because obviously we don’t have the money for a cake, so why would I want to go to a restaurant and spend 200 pounds when I couldn’t get a cake. I cared more about the sentimental value of having a cake rather than going to the restaurant. So AITA for canceling my birthday dinner over a cheesecake ?

Extra information: My mom paid for my wig and my nails for my birthday. That on it’s own was around 200 because the wig was expensive. I am grateful for that and all I wanted was to share a happy moment with my family with a cake on my actual birthday.",0.11

"AITA for trying to return my ex's keys without telling my partner? A few weeks ago my (27F) flight got cancelled and I had a hotel for the night in the same city my ex (31M) lives. Our relationship ended around 4 years ago, it was an abusive relationship, emotionally and sometimes physically, and we were both addicted to heroin. I went into it knowing he had a problem and then I developed the same one and became the worst version of myself. We were together for around 5 years, but I think the whole thing has had a pretty lasting effect on me. I am clean and in a new relationship now, we've been together around 3 years. He (26M) has been kind and patient but I think I am still recovering from everything or maybe it's just that I'm seeing myself more clearly. I am not good, I am often defensive and overemotional. When I get angry I go way too far. We talk things through a lot, sometimes I think I'm getting better at communicating but often it feels like I've fallen huge steps back. 

Back to the story, it was weird to be back in the city, I felt a bit off. I still had my ex's spare keys in my bag, it hadn't been a clean break and I honestly just avoided giving them back. I didn't want to see him, I didn't want to send him my new address. At one point he broke into my icloud and started messaging my cousin to try and get the keys back. At that point I just kinda said fuck it and forgot about them. They were spares anyway. But when I was in the city again I wanted to get rid of this extra weight, so I reached out. The conversation was weird and I pretty quickly understood it was a dumb idea. He basically said I had to ask his new girlfriend for permission because they were out and then told me that he still feels very upset with me and that I was foul and abusive to him. I used to fight him back. He would get really mean when he was drunk. I don't really know what I was thinking I just wanted to get these keys out of my life and I guess maybe I thought if I did this thing I would get better. That that part of my life would be closed. I don't know what I was thinking. He said he already got the key situation fixed so I could just do whatever, throw them out or keep them in case of a zombie outbreak or something. 

I didn't mention this interaction to my current partner until last night. He feels upset that this still weighs on me. That if I had respect for this current relationship I wouldn't have even tried to open that up. That I could've just dropped the keys in the mailbox and never said anything. That I talk about this too much and its been too long. That I use these other things as an excuse to cover up my behavior. I feel like I really fucked up, but I also feel like somewhere in me the intention is to heal, but maybe I'm way too forgiving with myself. I feel lost. I feel stuck. I feel like I made a huge mistake for no fucking reason.",0.89

"AITA buying wrong brand? So my partner (35m) recently decided to give touch rugby a go, he wanted to improve his fitness and learn the sport as our son (9m) plays for the local team. 
After his first session he realised he needed new boots, he was slipping and sliding all over the place.

He's 6ft5 and has size 12 feet so I (31f) said I would go to a large sports chain store a few miles away to get them as i go to that town weekly for a blood test and it was on the way... I had seen a pair of Adidas ones on sale on their website and shown him a photo of a pair for around £45

It's very important to know that he does not like change, he can't handle plans changing or foods being different, yet he's very impulsive. I'm usually the one that has to go out last minute searching for things because he puts it off to avoid thinking about sudden changes, last time it was him telling me at 8pm the night before a funeral that he doesn't own a shirt (he has issues with buttons and even thinking of wearing the shirt put him in a bad mood) so I had to drive to 4 different stores at 9pm to find a long enough shirt and trousers set. For this reason i have to plan out every single aspect of our week so he knows what's happening and I always buy the same food etc. 

His shoes are ALL Adidas.  I tried really hard to get the Adidas ones I'd seen but they didn't have any in his size. I looked at others that were the same brand and his size but the cheapest pair were £100 (way out of budget) 
I spent 20 minutes talking to the guy who worked there and he was very knowledgeable, he suggested boots in our price range that had the studs needed, the right shape etc. However they were a different brand. They were £10 less than we had budgeted too.

I walk in the door and explained that I'd tried really hard and spent a long time trying to find a pair in his size and budget but they weren't Adidas, same colour and shape but not that brand. 

He then berates me for changing the brand without consulting him and asking why I can't just think about things before doing them, telling me I should have called him to ask as he would have told me not to bother, ""why bother showing me a photo if you werent getting them anyway!"" Etc . 
I got cross because I'd worked hard to find them and told him I'm sick of him never appreciating the fact I spent time out of my day to help him and he was rude to me, if he'd have said ""I appreciate the effort you made but I'd much rather they were Adidas, I'll just take them back and exchange them for ones I'd like"" I would be disappointed but understanding.

 Now he's being childish, I asked him to get some drain unblocker on his way home and told him which one I need and his response was ""so instead of the one you want I'll just get you the store brand instead, since you think that's alright"" 

I told him ""go screw yourself, I'm done helping you out. If you can't do these things yourself then I won't be held responsible""

"AITA for telling my younger brother to take all the credit? I (18 F) was getting my breakfast a few mornings ago when I noticed my brother doing work on his computer. When I asked his what he was doing he said he was doing his school project which was due that morning because his group members didn’t do their part. I sat down with him and tried to understand the situation, his two partners were fighting and instead of putting that aside they both decided they weren’t going to do any of the work. I suggested to my brother to put all three of their names on the front page of the slideshow and then put his name to the slides that he did. (Which happened to be 7/16) My brother told me no and that there’s no point he would get a bad mark for the group not doing it together. Now mind you his teacher is a total jerk when It comes to her classes but she’s not bad enough to mark the only contributor badly. I kept trying to convince my brother to put his name on his slides but both my sister and mom told him not to. I tried explaining to him that if he let this happen and let his group partners get away with doing nothing others in his class will see that and they’ll do the same to him. My mom told my brother not to listen to me and that it’s the ‘nice’ thing to do by putting his group members names on all of the slides.

"AITAH (21F) or does my BF (21M) have double standards ? AITAH(21F) or does my BF(21M) have double standards
For context me and my BF are long distance and have been dating for around 6 months.

 3 months into our relationship we made an agreement to not like topless/bikini pictures of other people on instagram. This happened after I had liked a photo of a famous bodybuilder and it made my boyfriend feel insecure. I understood and unfollowed the body builder and both of us were happy with our agreement. In fact my boyfriend has made many comments previously about how he would never like a bikini picture and how disrespectful it is.

A couple of weeks later i notice he had liked a girl’s bikini picture. It wasn’t anyone famous, they were mutual followers.I was mad at this as we had made an agreement. He said he hadn’t done this because “why would i like pictures of wh*res in bikinis”

 When i showed he didn’t think it was a big deal. He said it was a girl he had known for years, she was freelance modelling and he was supporting her as she needs instagram likes to get an agent. He said he didn’t remember doing it. He said him and his mum always support this girl, however while his mum is very active on instagram, i noticed she didn’t follow/support this girl at all, neither did the girl. To me none of this was important , i was bothered he had agreed to not do something and then done it.

My BF has made comments previously about guys and girls being friends, saying guys being friends with girls always has some sort of attraction/romantic reason and it is not the same way a girl is friends with a guy.
Recently , he asked me what i thought about no longer posting bikini pictures, as it made him uncomfortable . I  said i would stop, not that i posted a lot. 
I asked why. He explained guys screenshot  and send them to friends and do other ‘things’ with the pictures. He said his guy friends do things like this and speak in a derogatory manner . I asked him if he did this, seeing as he was friends with guys who did and he said ‘dont be ridiculous no, not since high school”

Later, he showed me a screen recording he had taken in January. At this time me and him spoke every so often, but were definitely not in a relationship or even close. At this time I had posted a bikini picture to my story and he had taken a screen recording of it.  I asked him why he had done this and he said because he liked the photo. I asked him if he’d sent this to friends or done anything else with the picture. He seemed appalled and upset for me even asking this, even though he had explained previously that’s what guys do. 

Since then i’ve felt a different kind of way with him. Im not sure why, I don’t fully trust him and i feel put off the relationship because of it, AITA ?

Bf doesn’t like me posting bikini pics as guys can’t be trusted . But he has shown this exact behaviour .",0.1
"AITA for cancelling with our videographer? 
I (25F) am getting married this year. We booked a package with a videography company that includes “1 Videographer, 1 Photographer”. 

We met with our wedding coordinator recently go finalize our vision. When it came to the topic of who will be our videographer and photographer, I mentioned the company I booked with, and she gave me a “look”.

She informed us how difficult this company is to work due to poor communication, doing their routine without consideration of what the couple wants. She stated “if they don’t get what they want, they will pack up and leave”. She suggested to book with another videographer (which videography is what I’m mainly looking for as I already have a photographer) to save the tears.

Apparently this company has a history of bringing more team members than what the contract states, and expect those extra heads to be fed.

We panicked and called the company the next morning to clarify how many people from their team will be working on the day of my wedding. She informed me that a total of 5 people will be there, but then corrected it to a total of 3 since she didn’t notice (until I told her twice) I specially asked for no drone coverage of my wedding. Plus, I didn’t receive an answer as to WHEN I would have been informed on the total number of team members to be there.

After the call I emailed them expectations of my wedding day, moments I wanted them to capture with their team, and the privacy I wanted to have with my main photographer (she would be using 35mm film which was very important to us). 

30 mins later, they called me back, stating that if I read the contract I signed, I was not allowed to have any additional photographers on the premise, family members taking videos or photographs/interrupting the flow of their team. If any interference happens, they have the right to pack up and leave. It is my fault for noticing that part of the contract. They also stated, the team reserves the right to film whatever they feel like, their routine is very specific; I can’t tell them to “not take pictures of me at specific times”. 

Emailed them to cancel, got this response:

“Thank you very much, we accept your advice. It's a matter of respect for our team. Our company is the one with the most productions in Miami each year, with over 500 annually. I believe it's because we are doing something right. And our team deserves respect. 
We will never accept that our team in one of our productions be merely a group of ""secondary"" photographers and videographers with ""restrictions"" just because there is another photographer who is called the ""main"". 
If you are happy to cancel, we are even happier; we are not an option or a filler. Those who choose us do so because they fall in love with our work. If that's not the case, and you only had us in mind for filming guests and outdoor scenes, we happily accept your cancellation.”

So I had to call my sister and I told her I’m sorry but could she at least give us half the cost of the tv because my husband was pissed and wanted a tv similar to the one we had. That way I could put the other half and replace the tv my niece (her daughter) broke. She said I’m being ridiculous and it’s been over 3 weeks since it happened so no.

"AITA for wanting to take a dog on a sailing trip My boyfriend and I (23F and 23M) have a group of friends from high school mixed with some new people. We have decided to go sailing this year (it would be a third trip in total. We were both on the 1st trip; I wasn't on the 2nd, but my bf was. Some people changed between the 1st and 2nd trips). It would be a week-long, living on the boat but staying in ports every night.

Someone made a group chat, and I sent a dog I will be getting in March (a very small one). I talked about taking him to the New Eve party with the same people, and the reception was fine. Everyone basically just said, ""Oh, cool,"" and that's all. The convo on the group chat went like:

* Me: ""Count him in""
* Guy1: ""Won't a trip like that be stressful for such a little guy?""
* Me: ""Totally serious - I would like to take him, but only if I manage to train him so he behaves well and if all of you are fine with that. I will not take him if he is going to be stressed and bark all the time of course""
* My bf: ""Also we will take him on a boat beforehand to see how he reacts""
* Guy1: ""I am only worried about his wellbeing, so if you prepare him for it, I am fine with that""
* Guy2: ""Works for me""
* Girl1: ""To be honest, I do not think it's a good idea""
* Me: ""He is not even yet with me, so we can revisit the topic later when we have more info""
* Then Guy3 and Girl2 made some jokes I can't translate but were totally positive.

So, from my perspective, we ended up with one girl not being okay with him and us talking about it after they met him, and I know whether I managed to train him enough. If she was still against him, I would just not take him, and it wouldn't be a problem.

It was yesterday. Today Guy1 messaged my boyfriend that no one wants a dog there and that I was an asshole for saying, ""Count him in,"" rather than telling them, ""Hi guys, would you be okay..."". He said that he knew it was a joke, but they didn't, and it's on me. 

I think that I am not the asshole since I said ***right away*** that I want everyone to be okay with it. I think they are in the wrong for not saying anything (only Girl1 did, and I appreciate that), and then rather than talking to me, they went to Guy1, who then went to my boyfriend. We are all 23-25 so I was expecting a more mature communication.

"AITA FOR EXPECTING STEP DAUGHTER TO SLEEP IN HER OWN ROOM My fiancé (M/29) and I (F/31) just started living together 6 months ago after finding out I’m pregnant. He has a daughter (5yo) and I have a son (3yo) both of which were only children before this. Both his daughter and my son are used to sleeping in bed with us when we were single as we both lived in one bedroom apartments. Both kids now have their own room in our new home. I’m currently 36 weeks pregnant and expected to give birth early. My son has had no issue sleeping in his own room throughout the night with the exception of getting up and asking to use the bathroom but will go back to sleep in his own bed. His daughter however will not stay in her own room unless he sleeps in her room with her. After getting her to sleep he will typically get up and come in our room to sleep or sit up with me as our quality time is few and far between. His daughter will get up multiple times a night if he doesn’t stay in her room. It’s hard for me to sleep as is being this far along, but she will come in our room 2-3 times a night and eventually he will let her lay in bed with us. When this happens she still will not go to sleep. It’s bad enough already to not have room in my own bed; but she will toss and turn, pull blankets, whisper “dada” multiple times (she does have speech and learning issues) get up and explore the house, and return to our room instead of her own. It’s gotten to the point that my fiancé may sleep next to me one night out of two weeks. I know that with a newborn and with breastfeeding as I plan to do, sleep is fleeting. I also know that if his daughter continues to do what she has been at night time that none of us the newborn included will be getting any rest whatsoever. When I mentioned this to him I hardly get a response other than “well it’s bound to happen” or just simply getting the cold shoulder.

"AITA for fighting with my best friend about her boyfriend because our friendship is being destroyed? Best friend of 3 years, living together for over 1. Since she met her boyfriend 10 months ago, our friendship has become strained. Most of our fights revolve around him.  
Early on, she broke our promise to watch Barbie together by watching it with her bf = weekend of intense fighting. I suggested potentially living apart for a healthier dynamic, as then we'd both need to make an effort to see each other.  
We reconciled but later her bf blocked and unblocked me on Insta. She believed his denial.  
Recently, I saw him on Hinge, which he denied too. She thinks someone else made it, initially suspecting me. After reflection, she didn't want to dwell on it, believing it wasn't him or me.  
Last week I purposely scheduled my flight for Friday to come to the city after we had discussed hanging over the weekend before she started her new job, not making concrete plans. Early last week, she explained she committed to spending the entire weekend at her boyfriend's place — ""staycation"", as part of his xmas gift for her.  
She suggested hanging out on Monday instead. I decided not to reschedule. I believe that by consistently accommodating alternative times, I reinforce a pattern where she pushes our plans to the side when convenient for her, without facing consequences.  
I've been distant since, feeling unappreciated in our friendship. Last night, we argued about all of the above, and I expressed feeling unheard and seeing our friendship decline. Regrettably, I mentioned doubting her boyfriend's honesty in past situations. Although she claims to believe both of us, I pointed out the contradiction believing she is saying what she thinks I want to hear to avoid conflict (she has avoidant attachment style).  
I don't see how she would still be dating him if she thinks he's lying. Imo she believes her boyfriend but tells me she believes me / “both of us”. I conveyed my feeling that she doesn’t trust me because of this.  
She denied being manipulated by him and almost ended the conversation, asserting she won't hear such accusations. I apologized. She wants to move on without further discussing these specific instances, and said that these fights are not normal in friendships. She has admitted that her boyfriend told her I am “creating drama”.  
My friend says I am the asshole for making her choose between them and bringing up these situations, but I think it isn't about choosing between us, it is about believing the truth. I am not naive enough to think that she would pick me over her boyfriend.  
I think my concerns are justified and my friend is in denial about the influence all of this has on our friendship. But, I think I might be the asshole as my friend is obviously very affected by this and I do push her too much in these situations; I feel frustrated that she usually sees the situation clearly but after speaking to her boyfriend, believes whatever he tells her.

But suddenly things took a sour turn and Amy started ranting at me over discord and swearing at me, at first I thought it was a joke because she was saying things like ""back off JP"" and let's be real I didn't think she was some psycho , but she wouldn't stop and hung up on me. I was confused and thought it was still a joke kinda thing so I rang her back but she declined. Atp I was even more confused  because I hadn't even done anything and this seemed so randomly aggressive. She didn't text me at all until the next day  , I was honestly pretty worried. Her texts were acting as if nothing had happened and when I questioned it she'd basically ignore the question which I was finding annoying  but Amy has always been my best friend so I was more concerned then anything.

She is high functioning, successful person with a good job, and has been in several long term relationships over the years. 

  
She now takes every opportunity to lecture everyone she can about autism, how the world is so unfair to autistic people. How we all have to change to accommodate them. She wears autism t shirts, has the bumper stickers and speaks at local schools. Nearly every conversation we have ends up being about autism. I have tried to steer away from the subject, and have asked her to change the subject when it gets too much.

  
She says she can't believe that I am not more of an ally to the cause because my son is autistic.  
Yes, my son is autistic, and has fairly severe symptoms, diagnosed when he was 4,  that I have been dealing with for many years, and will continue to deal with for the rest of my life, as my son will not be able to live independently. 

Prior to her own diagnosis she showed no particular interest in my son, or his issues.

Last weekend she told me she believes that she can help me understand my son better and improve his life.  I told her that while I appreciate her offer, I have been living in the autism space for many years, am managing my sons issues well, and don't need her help. She then told me that since I am not autistic there are things that I cant possibly understand.

  
I told her to get out of my house. She left in a huff.

  
My wife is pissed, and says her friend is harmless.

"AITA for not making it to my step son graduation for my friends birthday.   
4 years ago I married my now husband who has a son. His son is 24 years old and his university graduation was last Monday. My relationship with his son is not strong considering I married his father when he was away for university ,however, we are on good terms of mutual respect. I am always present at his important events and he was also for mine.   


His graduation was supposed to be not on this past Monday but the Monday before (so 2 weeks ago) but it got postponed for this past Monday. The problem was my childhood best friend whose literally my sister birthday was this past Monday and she was traveling the night of her birthday so we had the birthday af afternoon. I am also one of the party organizers and this girl is my closest person even closer than my husband and I couldn’t leave her at the same time it is the graduation that got suddenly postponed while I already had plans.  


Knowing this I texted my step son saying sorry that I will not be able to show up , congratulated him for his graduation and he responded nicely. My husband thought was annoyed at this and wanted me to skip the birthday to attend the graduation I told him I can’t and that it is not my fault the graduation got postponed. I also told him that we are hosting a graduation party for his son and his friends at the house and I am coming so I am still celebrating him just not on the official day but that’s because I do have my plans too and it is the graduation that got changed, if I knew before that the graduation was gonna be this past Monday I would’ve asked my friend to have the party after she comes back she wouldn’t have declined that at all because she wants me to be present as much I do. But we already organized everything and invited everyone we couldn’t just cancel last minute.   


His graduation party came , I gave him his gift and congratulated him again and he looked fine but his father and his mother too kept side eyeing me the whole night like I am a criminal for not throwing away every plan I had. My husband still gives me shit for it so AITA?",0.14
"AITA: My little brother is being ignorant. AITAH: My younger brother and his gf, 4mo,2yo, want to move back in with my parents. 
Well this house is disgusting! 
It's infested with roaches, there's an elder cat that uses the room as a toilet, and bed bugs in this house at one point. 
I want to call CPS if he moves in becausei dont want those kids to be put through this environment. My mom says that she'll kick me out if i make that call, am I the asshole?
**UPDATE**
Look, I (26yof) am stuck in this house because I can't move out due to financial issues. My parents know this place has gotten so bad that a deep cleaning would not help. The house needs to be gutted and receive a fumigation, I will lose 90% of my personal property because of my parents letting my siblings treat the house like their own trashcan.
I don't deal with the mess because I didn't make it, I live in my room, and I clean the shared bathroom weekly. I also eat out every night, since I work late, so I don't even contribute to dishes.
 Like a lot of you had said, we are all adults. My younger brother is 22, and his gf is 27. The kids are my only concern at this point. Because they no longer wish to pay what the gf's mom is charging for rent, and supposedly, they also get treated rather strictly.
 I get moving in would help them save a lot of money to move out, but at the same time, it's not a place for children. ",0.33
"AITA and selfish for putting my kids in the smaller room Hi. Help me settle this bit with my husband.

Tonight my husband, 31, has called me selfish, f 27, for moving our kids ages 3 and 5 into the smaller bedroom. We have 3 bedrooms in a one story. The now kids room is 10 feet by 15 feet and comfortably sits their two twin beds, book shelf, dresser, and a small lounge chair with plenty of room to navigate in. 

The larger room is roughly 15 by 25 feet or 20 x 30 feet I can’t remember which of the two was on paper. It’s a massive room. For visualisation, it now has my work desk and computer, a double sized bed, a dresser, and a sectional couch, with plenty of room left to play in and navigate in. It’s a massive room. 

Before this evening, it was the guest bed (the double sized) and my desk, two chairs for the desk, and the lounger in the smaller room. It was extremely cramped and I felt really claustrophobic and stressed. Almost swarmed if that makes sense. I’m autistic and if the room is tight and doesn’t “feel” right I get overwhelmed and move things around to fix it. 

So, tonight, now my husband has stated he’s irritated with me because he believes I’m being selfish and putting myself first by putting the kids in the 10 x 15 foot room. 

My stance is, I work from home, two very high stress jobs, I feel like the bigger room is a better fit for me. The kids have toys in the bigger room now, along with their room and the living room (so basically lots of spots for toys and playing). I stated they sleep in their room and that’s it. There’s no need for them when they’re so little to have such a massive room. Also, not really that it matters but we’re only living here for about one more year and then we can move to a more levelled place- in regards to room sizing and space.

"AITA for encouraging my nephew to be bullied? So my newphew (7) repeats a lot of shit he sees on the internet. Recently he’s been calling Asian people “Ching-Chong”. This has gotten him at trouble at school but his parents don’t actually care about, they only told him not to say it and not that’s it’s degrading and racist. When I brought it up to my sister that he still says it around family, she simply said I’m too much of a snowflake (ignoring the fact that she’s blown a gasket over “reverse racism”). So I’ve decided to teach him myself. At first I told him that it’s mean to say that to people because what if people made fun of him for being white. He said he simply didn’t care, however he is incredibly self conscious about his glasses so I decided to use that instead in a different way. Yesterday my sister asked me to pick him up from school and when I arrived at the pick up point, a group of Asian students passed by and he started pulling his eyes back and saying Ching Ching. I then said loudly “nephew, at least they can actually see without needing  big ass glasses!” And one of the students said “yeah my grandmas needs glasses too but they’re not as big as yours!” My nephew was visibly upset after this and on the way home, he cried and yelled at me. I told him now you know how those students feel but he wouldn’t listen. After I dropped him off home, I told my sister what happened and she got visibly upset and yelled at me saying that was too far and i shouldn’t have done that. AMITA?",0.14
"AITA for refusing to buy my friend a drink on her birthday? I (19f) have been going to pubs/clubs semi regularly (once every 2-3 weeks) with my friend Leah (20f) for the past six months or so. She’s in college and works part time while I’m working full time.

Whenever we go out, I usually pay for her drinks since I have more disposable income than her which I’m fine with, however I started to become frustrated with her. She always preferred to get the fancy cocktails, which also happen to be on the more expensive side. I’ve spent hundreds on drinks for her while she hasn’t bought me a single one. I told her I wasn’t going to keep buying every round and then she would need to pay for at least one round a night. She wasn’t very pleased about this. We’d only gone out once since then and I had bought the first couple of rounds and when it was her turn, she conveniently had to leave.

So fast forward a couple of weeks,She had invited me and a few others to a club for her birthday. We all got ready together and spirits were high but they started to go downhill pretty quickly when we got to the club. The other couple of girls bought the first few rounds for us and when they were finished, Leah turned to me and announced she wanted a strawberry daiquiri. I reminded her of what I told her before and I wasn’t going to make the same mistake of buying the rounds first. I told her to pay for this round and then I’d get the next few. She thought it was a joke at first but when she realised I was serious, she started complaining about how it was her birthday and I make more money than her. I still refused and she stormed off, ignoring me for the rest of the night.

The other girls think I was being petty and unfair but my parents think I did the right thing so I’m not sure.

"AITA if i want my bf to order food for me Hi I 21F dont mean to come off as a jerk but just want to know is it normal or not?
So it is a bit weird thing but I feel like my bf ( 22M) only shows off his money. He used to order food for his friends usually. And recently ordered food for one of my friends because he just asked him to order it for him.
Its been a lot of times when I am genuinely sick like I cant even walk and he knows that I haven’t eaten anything since the morning and am genuinely sick but he doesnt even bother sending anything unless I furiously argue with him that he just shows his money off to other people.
Idk it just seems weird. Also at the end of the day its me who orders it for myself, its not that I cant buy it myself but it just seems weird that he is just always showing off how much money he has to others but when it comes to me, he suddenly has to save money to give a gift to his sister, mom and dad.
Its not just food, I always go above and beyond for him, whenever he says he is not feeling well, I straight away order food for him and its mostly me who orders the groceries which cost me literally like 40 pounds per week because he eats a lot and Idk what to do really, should I talk to him and end the relationship because I genuinely cannot keep everything to myself and stay frustrated forever",0.84

"AITA for keeping my mom's art despite her wishes Low drama, just curious about what others think about art and ownership.  


This Thanksgiving with my cajoling my family tried painting for the first time My mom chose a reference picture of my dad standing by a pond to paint from. My dad's not dead, it's just a nice pic lol. In terms of technical reproduction of the scene, it ended up more interpretive, but I know my mom was aiming for photorealism. I really liked it and told her that I would love to keep it. We've talked before about how funny/sad it is that the things and memories we cherish most about other people are rarely the same things they like the most about themselves, and how it would be better if we could see ourselves through other's perspectives. In another context, I inadvertently spotted some bird sketches she had in her notebook once (she likes birdwatching), and told her how much I liked them--she insisted the bird sketches were terrible and were nothing to her but some scribbles Anyways, long story short, she kept insisting that her painting was ""embarrassing"" and she didn't want anyone else to see it, and she threw it out.  


Now I may be TA, because I later dug it out of the trash and kept it in my room. Recently she spotted it and was mildly upset that I did this. She insisted again that I throw it out, which I promised to do, but I haven't yet. I've buried it away in a drawer so no one else will see it.  
I mean, even if someone took a dump and I wanted to keep it on a pedestal that says nothing about the other person. I'm just the weirdo in that situation. Plus, it's not like anyone could identify whose it was from a glance. I do feel bad for lying though. I've definitely overthought this whole thing, but interested to hear other perspectives.",0.25
"AITA for spying on my mom and sibling? I know I'm not the favorite child. I have a younger sibling who goes to a great uni (I attend uni, but not with the same weight as his school's nametag).

It's a long story, but she definitely know it, I've seen her unlock it without asking her. 

I found out one day because she had whispered it to my sibling in the car. They thought I was listening to music. I haven't told them I know it, of course. The other day, I unlocked her phone while she was outside. There, a message asking my sibling to take a photo of my debit card was in sight.

"AITA - long post ahead A family tradition of planning surprise celebrations for members turning 50 turned into a complex situation during the preparation for F49's milestone. Given the geographical dispersion of the cousins, the decision was made to travel to F49's country. However, complications arose when F49's spouse's family became involved, introducing conflicting expectations and logistical challenges.

Initially, the cousins suggested meeting in a city, approximately 9 hours of driving for them and 8 hours for F49's family. F49's spouse agreed to help but suggested a different city, prompting a
 shift in plans. As accommodation options were explored, F49's spouse expanded the group by inviting extended family members, transforming the gathering into a potential family reunion. The number of attendees quickly multiplied to 27-30 people, overshadowing
 the initial intention of celebrating F49's birthday.

Concerns about differing preferences and comfort levels led to discussions about staying arrangements, with F50 proposing separate accommodations for each side. F49's spouse insisted on everyone
 staying together in one house, expressing strong preferences for specific birthday celebration activities.

Tensions escalated when F49's spouse accused the cousins of disrespect, detailing health issues, vehicle limitations, and demanding specific birthday celebration requirements. F39 responded, clarifying
 that the focus should be on F49, not her spouse's family, and expressing feeling insulted by the accusations.

In a separate chat, F49 expressed disappointment and anger at the perceived disrespect, outlining specific demands for her birthday celebration. The cousins collectively responded, expressing regret
 at not being able to meet all the requirements and deciding not to attend.

The situation took a public turn when F49's spouse posted on Facebook, portraying the cousins negatively and alleging mistreatment. Despite attempts to resolve the issue privately, communication has ceased, leaving the family in a state of unresolved conflict.

"AITAH for setting boundaries on how much to give my mom monthly? I am an 18 yr old female who recently started getting monthly payments from my dad's pension. My mother received hers and mine combined since 2020 and when I turned 18 on Sep 23, my payment was directly paid to me. 

Shortly before the payment she started saying I should give her about 80% of the payment right. For the first month I did, second month I explained to her that I had my own expense which is paying for a laptop loan for school I'd send her a less amount. She was angry and started listing all the money she spent on me since 2020 so I sent her money. Last month, I gave her money for groceries before I let for school.

Today she sent a text asking for money to fix our fridge which broke down. She knows I don't have the money and expected me to borrow from family members for me to be the one to pay it back.

"AITA for telling my husband he needs to stop his entrepreneurial pursuits? In the last three years my husband has been in and out of work and has had no joke probably 20+ business ideas that have gone no where. Literally never happened and amounted to $0 made. His longest job since we’ve been together was 14 months and he was laid off in October. It has been 3 months now and nothing has changed. 

He is still chasing probably 12+ business “opportunities” as we speak. He wasted the first month not applying for any jobs and trying to work with someone on their businesses. He no longer speaks to this person. I honestly just wish my husband would quit this and go back to his former employer who offered him a job a few weeks ago. This job was the most money he ever made but it was 12 hour days. I understand this is not ideal but I do not make enough money to continue supporting our family. 

His unemployment is just enough to pay for his car/insurance/subscriptions. Everything and I mean EVERYTHING else I have to pay for. We have an 8 month old son and I’m pregnant again. Our son has not been to the pediatrician since he was 4 months old because he lost health insurance when my husband lost his job. I am still in debt with my son’s medical bills from his birth and I have drained my savings in the last few months on home repairs and paying for almost everything by myself. I do not make very much. 

My husband tells me I am unsupportive and don’t believe in him while I am working full time, doing all the house work and childcare with the help of my mom while I work. He is gone all day “working” on these projects that have not made progress and when he comes home all he does is bother me with “small favors” I need to do for him. He constantly has me helping him with his work and running errands and doing things for him. He does not help me with anything. Our furnace and dishwasher are broken and there’s no money to fix it and he is talking about going overseas to meet with people regarding said “business opportunities”.

"AITAH for not picking up groceries? I've never done this, and have no idea what I'm doing, so, bare with me!

I (30F) and my boyfriend (34M) have been dating for a little over a year, I moved in with him after nine months of dating.

For context I work from home, 8hrs a day.  He drives for a living, his hours vary from 10-12hrs a day, he drives generally the same route/area daily.

I recently texted my boyfriend early in the afternoon on a Tuesday and asked him if he could grab two things from the grocery store on his way home , we needed the items for dinner (a dinner he had requested, might I add). He takes the highway home and it is only about 5mins out of his way to stop at the store.

He agreed to pick the items up.

Once he got home I thanked him for stopping. He asked me if my son was sent home from school today, I responded that he was at school all day. He then asked me why I couldn't have grabbed the groceries on my way home from picking my son up since I drive past a grocery store.

I was truthful and responded that I ""just didn't feel like it"" because I had a long day working, I caught up all the laundry, I had dishes to do and I had to cook dinner, so this was one small task he could do to help out.

I received no response from him. He just went on with unwinding from work. The rest of the night was relatively normal. He then proceeded to not talk to me for almost four entire days.

We lived in silence around each other.

I asked him what he was upset about and he stated that ""you're home all day, you drive right past a grocery store everyday, I should not have had to go out of my way to get stuff from the store after working 10hrs.""

My response was a simple ""I didn't think it was that far out of your way to go, it's only one exit, I was tired and did everything else that day, so I didn't think it was a big deal"".

It came down to him seeing me as working from home as ""being home all day"" and that I'm free to do everything, and then I can't even be bothered to go to the store after sitting around at home all day.

I just need to know, AITAH for asking him to stop at the store because I didn't feel like stopping at the one that I drive past?

Is it ridiculous that after doing all the other house duties that I didn't want to add this additional task to my day?",0.57

"AITA for holding back on authorizing my son to go on an out of state trip? I have joint custody of my 8yo son Jack with his mom. He will be with his mom tomorrow until Tuesday. She had asked of I would be okay with her and her husband going to California to do a surprise VIP experience at Legoland with Jack. She needs my written consent to take him out of state.

I said to email me the letter and I'll review and sign. She sent it to me on Monday. Well on Monday, she broke her leg and cannot move around let alone get on a plane. I assumed the trip was canceback.

Today she texted me and asked if I was going to send the letter back. I told her how is she going to get on a plane tomorrow when she's still immobile. She said she's not going. Her husband Logan is taking Jack.

I told her to call me.

I said this weird that you want me to sign this letter giving you permission to take Jack out of state when it's your husband. She said by signing it, I'm effectively giving her permission to allow Logan to take Jack to Legoland.

I said I have very mixed feelings about it. I don't know Logan that well and I'd expect him to be a part of this conversation. She got offended by that and said Logan is like Jack's best friend and Jack feels comfortable enough with Logan to call him into the bathroom and shut the door and drives him and his friends. She said nothing has changed. It's still a surprise trip made possible by a stepdad.

I said maybe I'll tag along. She said how about Logan texts you all the time and to let him have this time with his fucking stepson because she's not having anymore kids.

I still haven't signed it.

Edit: For the record, it's not that I mistrust or feel threatened by Logan. My issue is this guy wants to take my kid out of state for a mini vacation and I haven't heard a peep from him. I'm just hearing from the ex.

"AITA for complaining about a service fee I was never told existed? I live in NY. 4 months ago when it began to get colder, I turned on my furnace to discover it was broke. This happened before and it just needed a new filter. Unfortunately that didn't seem to be the case this time. With weekend weather expected to be in the low 40s, I called around to 7 HVAC repair companies that were open on the weekend asked about service. Each one advised that to come out on the weekend would cost me 79.99 - 129.99. I declined.  
  
I waited and called one on Mon., explained my situation and scheduled a visit.  
  
When the tech arrived, we went into the basement and he immediately said something along the lines of ""wow, this is an old unit"" and insinuated I should look into replacing it (it was between 35-40 years old). I told him that since I was unemployed I had VERY LITTLE (I stressed this several times during his visit) money to put towards this situation and asked him what the cheapest repair I could make would be to just get it running for the winter. He looked over the unit, opened up the front panel, played around with some things, tested a few things (spent about 15mins total looking it over). He told me he would have to go back and price out some pieces due to how old the unit was and he would get back to me with a price. I advised him I would be willing to use refurbished or even used parts if it would save me money.  
  
2wks later the tech called me and told me it would cost about $400 to repair the furnace (at this point I had not been approved for the new furnace yet) and I told him I would need to think about it. In the meantime I was able to get a new furnace through a NYS funded program for low income homes.  
  
About 4wks after that, I received a call from the tech again, asking if I was interested in moving forward with repairs. I told him about the furnace replacement I was already scheduled to have done in the next couple weeks and declined.  
  
About an hour ago (4 months after the initial phone call to them) a representative from the company dropped off an bill for 129.99 for a service visit. I was stunned, since at no point during 4 separate interactions with this company had they informed me that it would cost money or that I owed them.  
  
I immediately called the company and explained to the guy who answered about the situation and the bill and his response was something along the lines of ""well did you think we would do the work for free""  
  
We ended up going back and forth arguing for 10mins or so. We both got a little heated, but at no point did the call devolve into a yelling fight, nor was it ever disrespectful.  
  
He blamed me for not asking, I blamed him for not telling me about the cost.  At the end of the call, he told me that I was the ONLY customer that had ever complained about this, and that he wasn't going to change how he runs his business (ie. by informing customers of the cost of a service visit beforehand) that he has ran for 30+ years.

"WIBTA for telling my estranged brother who the real monsters are? I(33f) am estranged from most of my family, including my only sibling, Bro(29M). My family is driven primarily by hate, going as far as throwing parties when someone dies. They love sitting around and making up things that never happened, the meaner the better. They love ruining people's lives, including each other. This group includes siblings and cousins, aunts and uncles, grandparents, everyone. Both sides of the family. 

I never fit in and was one of their favourite people to hate, so I moved to a different province years ago and happily went NC. However, I've never been able to get over the fact that my brother is part of that toxic mess. He always has been, our father made sure of that when I was 7 and Bro was 3. There was an incident that none of us ever recovered from.

In the last week, I had to text Bro. We haven't spoken in years and my text wasn't mean at all, but his response was. It wasn't a surprise that he responded how he did, but I was surprised at how upset I got. I sat on the floor crying for half an hour or more. I had to think pretty hard later to realize that my feelings seem to be for two reasons:
1. I love my brother no matter what and am still heartbroken that he hates me.
2. I feel guilty that he was never told why I'm NC with our family.

I can't make my brother not hate me, but I'm actually pretty mad about the injustice of his hatred. He has no idea who I am, what I'm like, or why I'm not involved with these people. I want him to, at least once, be told the truth about me and also other members of our family. 
*I've been gone for over a decade, but only went permanently NC with our father maybe 2 years ago, and all of them were still sharing lies about me at that point.

I want to write Bro a letter that explains who I am and who our family members are. I'm not under the illusion that it'll change his feelings, but the truth is really important to me and I can't think of any other way to tell him the truth about everything.

I know the family would blow up if I sent anything. He would definitely show everyone and there are a lot of things that a lot of them don't know about each other. There would be no rumours or exaggeration, only things I know are true. 

My naive hope is that seeing the truth for once will make him pause and have at least one conversation with me that doesn't end in him screaming the B word or the C word, but more likely is that it'll just cause a huge mess with everyone that I'll never hear about, and it could potentially be really hard on Bro.

However, I'm at the point where I'm having a hard time caring about his comfort. My first priority has always been staying away so Bro is as comfortable and happy as possible, but I feel like I can't move on until he at least has a chance to see my side, and the only way he'll ever know my side is if I tell him.

WIBTA if I sent my brother a letter that explains things about me and other family members that he really won't want to see, knowing it could cause him problems?",0.05
"AITA for 'over reacting' after an argument? My (20sF) partner (20sM), now ex, and I had an argument. 

  
It was one of those probably caused by people being too tired, too cranky; could have been avoided had we walked away and came back when we were calmer. I'm not quite sure how it got there, but it ended with him calling me a 'stupid fucking bitch' and me walking out of our home.   
I have since broken up with him. I made it very clear from the beginning that I will not tolerate violence and abuse of any kind - no ifs, buts or maybes. One strike and you're out. So I broke up with him. At first he thought I was joking and told me to call him when I calm down - further infuriating - but when he came back from a work trip to see my things packed from our flat and my keys on the table, he blew up my phone for days, and harassed my friends and family after I asked him to leave me alone via text then blocked him. It's been 3 weeks and he's now resorted to talking to me via flowers. 

  
It's important to note that I won't be course correcting, no matter the verdict of you good people on reddit. I have never been treated so poorly, and I won't let him break the habit of a lifetime.   
However, people are telling me I'm over reacting, or that I should at least hear him out. This is where I may be the asshole: I don't want to. I don't care that I'm throwing away a 3 year relationship - better than wasting the rest of my life in my eyes. He emailed me a receipt for an engagement ring he's bought with the intention to propose - telling me I can't seriously end us after 1 silly little fight. I can and I did. Love and abuse cannot co-exist and my soulmate would never throw such hurtful insults to me, even in anger. I will die single before I tolerate such treatment from the person who's supposed to love me most. The only people supporting me are my parents, but even my own siblings - male - are telling me I've blown things out of proportion.

"AITA For Not Punishing My Daughter For Splashing A Girl With Iced Coffee And Hitting Her? My (15f) daughter has been having issues with this girl since the beginning of the school year. And when I say issues, I mean this girl is starting problems with my kid. This girl has been taunting her, spreading rumors about her, and can't keep my daughters name out of her mouth. My daughter has gone to the school multiple times but they've done close to nothing. 

It all came to a head yesterday. My daughter was trying to get to class and this girl pushes her and my daughter is just minding her business. My daughter knows how to fight, so she grabbed her head and hit it against her knee. It sounds brutal, but she was fucking around. My daughter also threw her iced coffee at her. 

Fast forward 45 ish minutes, the girls parents is talking about pressing charges, and I'm yelling at the dean for not doing shit about this whole issue. I do not blame my daughter at all for what she did, these white kids and their parents now who to to mess with. 

Fast forward 10 minutes, my daughter is suspended for 15 school days, and the other girl is suspended for a week. I think that's utter bullshit. I talked to her about it, and let her know it wasn't her fault and I'm not going to blame her for anything she did. 

My wife on the other hand believes she should get a light punishment for turning a pillow fight into a gunfight. I'm standing firm on my position, but I'm starting to feel hesitant on whether I'm doing the right thing, so I'm asking here. Am I wrong jere?",0.89
"AITA for causing a fight between my brother and mom? I (18f) am at home right now for winter break. My brother (21m) moved home around when my break started because he graduated a semester early, so we've been in the same house for the first time since I was in high school. We usually get along really well, but that's when we're not living together lol.

This happened the other day. I brought my dinner plate downstairs after I'd finished eating, but I still had a little bit of a sweet tooth, so I went into the pantry and got some tablet (Scottish dessert, it's basically crystalized condensed sugar and milk).

Now, tablet is SUPER sweet, since it's basically just sugar, so I only had one piece. But when I brought it out of the pantry, my brother (who was eating in the kitchen) got kind of like mad? Not even mad I guess just annoyed and rolled his eyes. Conversation basically went as followed:

Brother: Well I guess we know who's been eating all the tablet

Me: ??? This is literally the first piece I've had

Brother: Yeah, okay

Me: I'm serious, I haven't had any

Brother: Bullshit

Me (at this point getting genuinely frustrated): Dude I literally can't have eaten it all, I can't eat too much junk any more because of my cholesterol, my doctor said so

Brother: well maybe if you hadn't eaten all of it your cholesterol wouldn't be so high

Me (fully pissed): I didn't eat the fucking tablet!

Now. I did not eat it. I was literally not ALLOWED to have eaten it. The one piece I DID have was pushing it. He was literally just pushing my buttons, refusing to believe me, and making fun of my cholesterol for no reason, and it pissed me off.

But my mom, who was also in the kitchen, got mad at me for swearing at him. She grabbed my wrist and basically yanked the sweet out of my hand, said I couldn't have any, and forced me to apologize to him, which I did (not very genuinely lol). Then my brother starts talking about not swearing at him because it was 'unnecessary', which set my mom off again, so then they started yelling at one another because my mom was all ""you're just dragging this out"" and he was like ""we're adults are we not allowed to have a conversation in front of you.""

I just kind of backed off and ran up the stairs after that. The fight didn't last after I left, but I still feel bad for basically being the reason it happened. Idk. I shouldn't have sworn at him in the first place, and I kind of escalated it by being moody when I apologized. AITA? ",0.11
"AITA for kissing my crush when she was already in a relationship? So, here’s a situation I’m in, and I need some perspective. I (17M) recently kissed my long-time crush, Tori (16F), even though she's currently dating someone else. But before you jump to conclusions, hear me out.  
Tori and I have always had this connection, or at least I felt we did. But she's been with this other guy for a while. Now, here's where it gets complicated. My friend Dani (18F) has been, well, kind of manipulating me. She knew about my feelings for Tori and pushed me to act on them, saying it was now or never. I know it sounds lame, but Dani has a way of getting into my head.  
When I kissed Tori, it wasn't just some random move. I felt pushed into it, like I was being controlled. Needless to say, Tori didn't take it well. She's upset, saying I violated her trust and disrespected her relationship. I get that, but at the same time, I was in a messed-up headspace thanks to Dani.  
I feel terrible about the whole thing, but part of me thinks that being manipulated by Dani kind of outweighs Tori's reaction. I mean, I wouldn't have done it if I was thinking straight. So, AITA here for kissing Tori under these circumstances, or does the fact that I was being manipulated make a difference?",0.96

Which is in my driveway. I asked her before to move her vehicle, but got nowhere. Yesterday I had it. I was pulling out and as I was nearing her car she laid on the horn for at least two minutes. She got out and started screaming “If you hit my car ill sue you for every dollar you make.” Along with some insults. I had it.

"AITA for not letting my ex husband to bring his now wife to our daughters birthday party (I will be using fake names btw)

My ex husband (David) and I were married for 5 years and last year we divorced. We have a one  daughter (lily) who recently turned 7 this year.

Lily's birthday was around the corner so I was busy with decorations,  the cake and the invitations. I asked her who she wanted to attended her birthday party and she said she wanted her aunts , uncle's,  cousins basically everyone she knew from both sides .

I wasn't bothered with  lily inviting anyone from her fathers side because we were both familiar and comfortable with them . I called David and I told him about the invitations and he was cool with it until he bought up his wife. He told  me that he will bring his wife , he didn't ask me , he told me like he was forcing it because he knew I would say no and I did say no . 

I told that I was not comfortable with his wife especially her meeting lily and lily doesn't even know her that much   and I haven't even had a proper talk with her before she can see my daughter. The only thing I knew about this lady was that she did something wrong with my husband knowing very well he's married and has a daughter and I was supposed to feel comfortable with that. 

He then told me that I was making this about me and not lily , that lily is child , she doesn't even know anything yet and he really wants lily to meet his wife and she also wants to meet her . I said to him that if she really wants to meet lily then she has to speak to me first and see how she really is before I can trust her with my baby. 

He replied to me by saying that I was jealous and that I didn't want lily too see her new family and be comfortable with them and that i was hurting his wife because I wouldn't let her see her step daughter who is like her own daughter. 

I was done with him and told him if he didn't want to come then it's fine it's not like he payed a single dime for anything for the birthday party and he was crazy for me to say yes to a woman who ruined my marriage and is the reason why my daughter has to grow up with separated parents .

EDIT: The step mom does know lily and lily knows that she does have step mom but they haven't met which is not my responsibility and yes David does have visitation rights so I don't know why he doesn't introduce them to each other. That's reason why step mom said she also wants to meet her. ",0.5
"AITA for being “rude” to Midwestern colleagues? I work on a fully remote team, and am currently the longest tenured team member (3+ years). Everyone else is 1 yr but some are superior to me. 

I am from the city, born and bred. And my prior colleagues were also from the same demo and we got along really well. You know the type. Very go go go. There to work and grind and ambitious. I suppose we can be direct, but never rude imo at least. 

This new team is all from the Midwest and while I like them, I am finding it increasingly difficult to work together.

Meetings ALWAYS go over, which sets me back for the rest of the day. The meetings are often, MWF, when there really are no updates to talk about every other day. There is too much non related work talk, which is nice, I suppose, but at a certain point we need to discuss deliverables, strategy, timelines. One woman is so overly apologetic about the most pointless things and everyone then spends more time reassuring her it’s ok. Then the cross talk “oh u go, no u go, oh that’s nice of you to let me”. 

It drives me crazy. I do think this more my problem than theirs tho so I have been managing around it. I will drop off at time saying I have to run to my next meeting or will multi task.

But I recently got feedback saying I can work on being a team player in 2024. And my attitude has been perceived by some as “rude” and “disengaged”.

"WIBTA for making my daughter change schools? Last summer my family and I moved. At first my daughter Marie (16f) had trouble making friends but around October she was really happy and told me that she was hanging out with this one boy, Ezra. I met him briefly and he seemed really nice. She quickly was spending a lot of time with him and went from not going out other than school and the library to going out a lot. She even slept over at female friend's houses. I was happy for her, and it wasn't just Ezra she made some other friends after him. 

My daughter soon changed the way she was dressing. She typically wore jeans, flats, and a blouse. She's started wearing heels and dresses mostly. I asked her about it and she told me that Ezra said that this was better. I talked with her about dressing for yourself and not changing for a boy but she didn't listen.

A couple months after, my husband, Quentin, told me he needed to talk. He said that he had went through Marie's phone and found some concerning things. Before he finished I told him that he shouldn't have looked through it but he said I needed to hear this so I listened. Basically, Marie and some of her female friends have all been dating each other and Ezra. Some other things seemed weird too, just like off, but we weren't sure what they meant. We tried to talk to Marie and she yelled at us. I told her that Quentin shouldn't have gone through her phone but that she needs to talk to us. She refused to.

The next morning, Marie was gone. She didn't come back. When it was late enough we thought it necessary, Quentin and I ended up filing a missing person report. A few days later she was found at a friend's house. She was still really mad. She kept trying to run away and we didn't know what to do. We tried therapy and that is going no where.

"AITA For not dropping what I was doing to immediately carry Groceries out the Car that I said I’d grab when I’m free? Me and my Girlfriend live together and I’m noticing a pattern of lack of patient even for little things and unwillingness to communicate but I thought maybe its all in my head.

While I’m a Gamer and she’s known even before we got together. I’m not one of those “spend all my time gaming and not with my mate”. 

If I’m playing something I can pause and she calls me. I pause it and come see what she needs big or small. If I can’t I ask her to give me a moment to finish up and I’ll be right there, generally if I’m doing some type of ranked that I can’t pause it and I’ll be penalized risk being banned. But when I do finish, I come see what she needs.

Today while she was at the Grocery Store I was already in a Match for League of Legends Wild Rift. One specific game that I do indeed practice at and throughly enjoy and one I have spent a lot of money on. To me it’s important and I know dating someone who isn’t a Gamer they generally don’t understand.

I told her to leave the Groceries in the Car I will get them in a moment and to come upstairs and just come rest. She’s got a cold right now and I have it too so I wanted her to just leave there and I’d bring them in myself. We were closing out a match and it would’ve taken less than 2 minutes to close out said Ranked Match.

Instead she tells me that’s doing too much/stupid and decides to grab all of them herself and rush inside for no reason. Comes into the apartment and goes “Oh well nice to know thats more important than me cool” and she goes “I’m not talking to you”. Right when the match ended she came through the door which was 60 seconds or so after she hung up.

I tried to go “If I leave before its over I’ll be penalized and its a few seconds from being over” but she didn’t remotely listen.

This isn’t the first time. I’ve dropped everything I’m doing before to see what she wants or needs and I’m patient so I tried to think nothing of it. But now I’m noticing she always wants things done regardless of what you’re doing which is why I’m typing this is because I’m trying to navigate this relationship.

Now I might be being extreme. But I do not do the “Silent Treatment”. I’m huge on communication and talking like Adults. I understand having a long day but I don’t say things I don’t mean and if this the response over this who’s telling how it’ll be for other more serious situations.

She did say sometimes she isn’t gonna wanna talk even when she’s wrong so I’m giving her space and hoping that’s it. Plus we’re both sick. And maybe I just need to understand her way of communication. But how the Silent Treatment is used is whats alarming to me. 

It should never be used to punish someone and it was the shortness.

"AITA for telling my mom I didn’t like her gift? 
This year, I asked my family and close friends to donate to a charity in lieu of a traditional birthday present. This was a great plan for everyone and I appreciated the time each person took to find a charity that they thought would have a mission I find important.

My mom took this as an opportunity to donate to a charity that she likes the goal of but goes against what I believe (she’s very religious, and it’s a pretty conservative and religious charity). It’s a particularly conservatively-tinted charity and I have talked to her before about how I think charitable funds could be better used to address pressing needs.

So she donated money to this charity that she knows I dislike and that was my birthday present. It didnt go over well with me. I honestly assume her intention was to make some kind of point, but my reaction was not accusatory. I did tell her that I think she missed the mark and could’ve picked something we can agree on giving money to for my present. This didn’t go over well with her, and she told me that I was being disrespectful of the gift and that if I was going to be so judgmental of the choice she made for it, she’d rather I not ask her for anything. 

Is she right that I should just accept the gift and move on without saying anything? My sister told me that she understands my frustration but I should’ve been specific about what charity to donate to if I was going to complain about it later.",0.44
"AITA for not telling my boyfriend i'm bisexual? (Using fake names in this, no ones real name is used)

Me (19M) and my boyfriend Daniel (21M) have been dating each other for almost a whole year now. We're almost polar opposites in terms of personalities, but we would always get along. 

Me and him were having lunch at his apartment yesterday with my friend Eric (19M), and everything was going great. Me and Eric have known each other since we were in eighth grade, so we were telling stories from  highschool to pass the time. This was great until Eric made a joke about a girlfriend i had my junior year. She was my only relationship before I met Daniel, and it only lasted around 6 months. But anyways, Daniel started acting weird. He did a forced laugh and said ""Girlfriend?"" to which i just said ""yeah?"" After this, he was acting really strange. He kinda just got really quiet until Eric had to leave. 

He than started asking me a bunch of weird questions about said girlfriend, but the one that ticked him off was when he asked if we ever had sex and I responded with yes. He freaked out. I didn't understand the problem, and asked why this was so upsetting, to which he said ""If i had known you liked girls I would never have asked you out in the first place!"" This shocked me because 1. We've been together for a while now and I felt like this shouldn't change the relationship and 2. Whats the deal with me liking girls? I never thought to tell him cause it really isn't a big part of my identity. And besides, I'm very loyal. I've never thought about seeing anyone else but him in the time we've been together. So i asked him why it's such a big deal, and he straight up just said that Bi men give him the ""ick"". I felt like this was a really weird opinion to have, and a really immature way to phrase it. I asked why, and he told me that theres a bigger risk for cheating and that he just doesn't wanna date a dude who's had sex with women. After this, i just said bye and left. 

I haven't talked to him since, he tried texting me this morning saying he'd like to talk to me and try and explain the ""situation"" more, but I really don't wanna hear it.

"AITA for saying my ex’s girlfriend can’t come to our daughters ballet recital? Throwaway account 

Fake names 

I (f) have a daughter, Maddi 6, who has her first ballet recital next weekend. Maddi is really excited about her ballet recital and she’s been to a show before for her cousin so she knows how they work.

Maddis father, Daniel, asked me how we would get tickets to go. I explained the school would give me the tickets and I’d let him know how many Maddi had. I explained since it’s her first recital she’s only performing in one of the shows (they have all the younger groups perform in one show either on Friday Saturday or Sunday  depending on the group so that it’s not too overwhelming the first few years.) Her performance is Saturday. He said he couldn’t wait to go and I said I’d let him know more info once I knew. 

The dance school gave me 10 tickets. So I called Daniel and explained I had 10 tickets and would give him one of the tickets after work. Daniel then said he would need 2 (one for him and one for his girlfriend). I told Daniel that not possible and she’s going to have to sit this one out since there’s limited tickets. Daniel said I’m not being considerate of his relationship and that I should be giving him 4-5 of the tickets anyway to invite people since he’s her other parent. 

I explained the way I accounted the tickets. 
One for me, 2 for my parents, 2 for his parents, two for my sister and her husband who is Maddis godparents (he doesn’t have any siblings), 2 for my grandparents (Maddis only great grandparents), and one for him. 

He said I shouldn’t have given anyone tickets without talking to him first. I told him I was sorry but that that is how the tickets are being distributed and how I’m sure Maddi will be really excited to see him there. 

Usually we have a great coparenting relationship. And his girlfriend is very nice they’ve been together a year and Maddi likes her but these are people who constantly show up for Maddi and are her blood family. Maddi sees and FaceTimes all her grandparents and her godparents all the time. And I’m fortunate that her great grandparents watch her while I work and bring her to and from school for me.

"AITA For thinking of asking a volunteer of youth sports to not show up high off weed **I am not against weed. I am a regular user and a parent. It is legal in my area**

I do not smoke in front of my children and rarely parent while high. (There are times where mom is overwhelmed with work/life and needs to decompress before I can show up as the best mom I can be.) I choose to a smoke after my kids go to bed. 

This person is a fellow volunteer and a personal friend. Which is how I noticed they were high while at a sports meeting. They are great as a volunteer and seems to be that the children love the interactions/mentorship they receive. 

But as a parent, I feel like if you are choosing to devote time to children you should show up sober and ready to contribute positively to these children. If you need to smoke weed before than maybe you aren’t suitable to be a volunteer.

"AITA for telling my sister what do do for her wedding I (22F) told my sister, Penny, (27F) she can’t use green and gold as her wedding colors.

So in 2017 I got this book and the cover of the book was dark forest green with gold engravings and I thought it was the most beautiful color combination ever, and decided it would be my wedding colors. I said to Penny, “penny green and gold are going to be my wedding colors so you can’t use them” at the time I was 16 and penny was 21 and she wasn’t even thinking about getting married and she thought it was funny but I made sure to let her know I was being dead serious. So fast forward trends are changing and different aesthetics are becoming more and more popular im noticing that penny is developing an affinity for more woodsy colors like dark forest green and burnt orange and I always kind of half jokingly mention to her “you’re aesthetic is so pretty but no green and gold for your wedding” and she just found it amusing I guess

So fast forward to the present penny gets engaged and im so happy for her! Her ring is a really pretty emerald wedding ring with a gold band. It’s stunning I love it and I love her and her partner. We’re talking about her wedding and she kind of shyly brings up “so you weren’t serious about the green and gold thing right” Um I’ve been talking about it for almost seven years now, im pretty serious. We end up getting into a pretty big fight. She says that it’s not fair that I claimed those colors all those years ago. I say to her she can do green and another color or gold and another color but NOT green and gold. She says that green and gold would match her ring and her whole aesthetic so well (she’s getting married in the woods) I say that’s too bad bc I called it. She said that’s not fair bc im not even in a relationship and who knows if I’ll ever get married, but she’s getting married now. That kind of hurt my feelings not gonna lie. Maybe she’s right? Maybe it’s not fair that im gatekeeping these colors. But I’ve always dreamed of a green and gold wedding since I saw that book and if she does it then when I get married it’s gonna seem to all of our friends and family like I just copied her or they’ll be comparing us or something. I love my sister but I’ve spent my whole life being second best to her and I don’t want to seem like a pale imitation of her on my special day. What do you guys think?

I'm not FIDE titled or anything, but I play enough to know what those terms mean, and I'm one of those guys who hangs out in parks on occasion and will play anyone who wants a game.  
  
The other day, with some relatively mild weather, I went to hang out in the local park and set up my board for anyone who wanted to play. Along comes this boy with his mother, he looked maybe 8 or 9 years old. He said he played, and he wanted to play me. I asked his mother if it was all right, she said sur,, and we settled down for a game while mommy did something on her phone. I beat him pretty quickly and easily.

In this case, since it was so one-sided, it was mostly me giving the kid tips for not getting wiped out like that again.  
  
He listened to a few of the initial opening recommendations, but after about a minute or two of this he started getting really upset. Wasn't crying, but seemed not too far off. Realizing something was off, I asked if he wanted to stop the review and do something else, but he ran over to his mom and started saying that I was bullying him and calling him a bad player. Mom then starts laying into me, saying it's absurd that a grown man would go all out just to plaster a child and I should haven't gone full bore on him and then tell him about all the mistakes he made. I made a few perfunctory apologies and made my escape.  
  
I admit, analyzing a game after it's finished is pretty standard for the circles I play in. But the circles I play in are generally adults and all fairly serious chess players who have an eye on how to improve their games, not kids and definitely not casual players (Which this kid seemed to be judging from the state of his play). AITA for applying that kind of game-etiquette to an interaction with a child?  
  
TL;DR. I played a kid in the park and as is my habit, I went over the game afterwards, pointing out quite a few errors he made during the game with an eye to helping him improve. It very much upset the kid and his mom. AITA for having stuck with my habit here?",0.8
"AITA for trying to give my mom feedback on clothes she bought for my unborn daughter? My wife (28F) and I (32M) are expecting our first child this summer. This will also be my parent’s first grandchild. My mom is obviously very excited. She also LOVES to shop and buy gifts. It can often be overwhelming but I know this is the way she shows love. I would consider myself more of a minimalist and try to just buy and keep what I need. My wife and my two younger siblings are similar, my mom knows this, and it is often something we all joke about and tease her about when a care package with half of Marshall’s arrives and we don’t know what to do with it all.

Today a package arrived from her with about 20 different baby outfits in it. Some we loved, others we simply couldn’t imagine dressing our daughter in. I wanted to tease her a bit and give her some feedback on some of the outfits we liked and which ones we didn’t, while still being appreciative for the gift. I just know that this is the beginning of \*many\* more gifts to come throughout my daughter’s life and it just feels so wasteful to turn around and donate piles of unused stuff. I'm thinking ahead to birthdays and christmases and would really like to set some boundaries around gift giving with her. My thought was that if she could get a better sense of our taste / style, less would go to waste. The following texts were exchanged:

**Me**: \[Picture of one of the outfits we didn't love\]

**Me**: Mom

**Her**: You know those are adorable! \*kissing emoji\*

**Her**: Did you not like the cute outfits?

**Me**: Thank you for the clothes!!! Can we gently nudge you towards our style? lol

**Me**: If you won't be offended I'll show you which ones we really like and which ones... not so much haha

**Her**: There's a place you need to visit on Reddit. It's called, am I the asshole? Go there and post what you said to your mom who picked out a variety of adorable clothes for the first grandchild in the family. Sent with zero strings attached, only with love and joy for her son and his beautiful wife. Include some photos. Let's see what others think, because in my humble opinion, your response is so unacceptable, I simply don't know what else to say.

**Me**: Woah I'm sorry! We really are appreciative! Can we talk?

**Her**: I've had people who said nothing at all, that were more appreciative. That's ok- I'll just put cash in a card for you.

**Me**: Will you please answer the phone

**Her**: Honestly, no need to talk about this. I've learned my lesson. No harm no foul. I should have known better- It's on me.

I tried calling her a few times to clear the air but she didn’t want to talk.

I’m certainly willing to accept that I was the asshole here and after reflecting, I definitely could have led with showing more appreciation for the gifts and communicated more tactfully. I also could have just let it go, chalked it up to grandma being a grandma, said thank you and just donated the unwanted clothes.

AITA? What would you do in this situation?

**Edit:** Here's a link to an image of one of the outfits (the image I sent her): [https://imgur.com/a/pFL21vt](https://imgur.com/a/pFL21vt)",0.14
"AITAH for demanding an 11 y/o apologize for stealing from me? My husband and I (gay couple) have a memorial shrine in our home, the urns and photos of both of our fathers and dog are displayed. I kept a large paw shaped locket wrapped around my dogs urn, it was filled with a bit of his fur.

My brother,  his wife and 2 kids came over for burgers and hot dogs, soon after I found the locket to be missing.  We searched everywhere,  it was gone. A few days later  my brother calls at 9pm and I mentioned that the locket was missing. He casually mentions that he knows, his 11 year old had ""borrowed"" it.

I demanded it back, that he gets off his butt and return it immediately.  He said no, hes tired. I'm angry, go to his house and bang on the door until he opens it and TOSSED the locket at me. It had been opened,  my boys fur was missing from it.

I go home and get a call, apparently a neighbor saw me yelling at him and called the cops.  So my brother is mad at me, yet still wants to get together for another BBQ. I told him that he and his daughter will need to apologize to me and my husband,  my brother refused. Saying shes too young to understand that stealing is wrong and it would just traumatize and embarrass her.

My husband is super non confrontational and says I'm being an asshole for demanding an apology from a kid, that it won't change anything. The fur is gone and nothing will bring it back. My brother thinks I'm an asshole and 11 year olds dont understand that theft is wrong. I believe an apology is 100% needed, as she stole and damaged something precious to me.

So that's where we are. I feel shitty about this and don't know why. Yet I feel that I deserve a sincere apology.  

So redditors,  who sucks here?

Edit- Im calm,  I fully understand that I over reacted, should have waited to pick up the locket during the day time. I shouldn't have yelled at my brother where my niece (may or may not) have heard. Demanding an apology is somewhat pointless if it's not out of genuine remorse. Though I hope they realize they fucked up and do apologize. 

I'll still host the next BBQ, my brother is a shit but he's still family.

"AITA for wanting to take video of when I was a kid off the internet? I have played piano for many years. In the early years, my parents found a piano teacher that takes videos of her students every week. Now I want those videos of when I was a kid taken down, because those videos are public and I don’t want other people to find them. I asked my parents to contact her and have her take those videos down but my parents think I’m ungrateful for what they have given me. They also think it’s not that big of a deal and it’s

"AITA for disagreeing with wife over nudist sons? Throwaway. And the weirdest thing. Just weird.

  
M39 here. We have two boys, 16 and 14. They are good kids who never give us any trouble (mostly). They basically live in our basement. THEIR choice, they are not relegated there.

  
It's no dungeon (certainly no kind of punishment). It's finished almost as nicely as the rest of the house, almost like an apartment. Huge bedroom, game room and system, big TV, bathroom, tiny kitchenette, a couple of pieces of gym equipment. It's teen heaven really and they love it, I should have had it so lucky at that age.

  
For ten days over the holidays the boys went to my brother's family a few hours away to visit their cousin and for some kind of holiday sports camp (all three boys are athletes).

  
Well, I'll blame this on my brother's free-spirit wife but they are ""naturists"" as of the last couple of years... i.e. nudists. We warned the boys about it but they said they wouldn't care and wanted to go to the sports thing.

  
SInce they've been back unfortunately our guys have embraced this ""naturism."" They were always shirts-off or just-basketball-shorts boys, but now it is as George Costanza would say a nude-o-rama 24/7 down in the mancave.

  
It's something I just shake my head over, and my wife just rolled her eyes about, but I also don't want them wandering the house in their birthday suits so I made a deal with them ""Do as you like, but downstairs.""  So that's what they do. They even have 1 or 2 or 3 friends over.sometimes, playing video games or foosball or just hanging out or whatever, just as God made 'em. Gotta hand it to them, they sure seem self-confident. Nonchalant. Unruffled. 

  
The wife has changed her mind though. The laundry is downstairs and I guess she's tired of going down and getting an eye full.  She told me to put a stop to it. I refused. I told her I'm sure it's just a phase and they'll get over it, probably pretty soon, and they've adhered to the rules I set (they don't come upstairs naked anymore, always at least shorts) so I don't want to go back on my word.  She called me an asshole (although not in those words) and stormed away.",0.33

"AITA for not replying to my bf after my dad passed away ? Hey guys For context I’ve been dating my now ex boyfriend for 2+ years now , we met when I was 18 and he was 20 . In the beginning everything was going good I’m from California born and raised but he’s from Mexico and he came on a working visa ( this is important). In the middle of 2023 my dad got super sick and I had to travel to Mexico to go be his caregiver for a while and while being over there my ex decided to go and help me out since we were in the same state in Mexico. 

  My dad’s health was getting better but he still needed someone there with him so my sister decided to stay with him in Mexico while I came back to the u.s to work and be able to financially support them. So since I had to come back to the states my ex went back to his home and we had to wait until he came back to work to the states . While he was over there he didn’t have a job so I would financially support him as well it wasn’t much but I would send something maybe every week when I got paid. Luckily we didn’t have to wait a long time and he came back to the states to work but we are still far from each other. 
  
    Sadly my dad got bad again in December and we had to go and see him again and be with him in the hospital he was later on released and we got to spend more time with him but while being over there my ex didn’t want me to stay there he didn’t want me to be there because he said that I was “ alone “ . I wasn’t alone I was with my sisters and my grandpa I think he just didn’t like me being there. I didn’t grow up with my dad so having that time to actually get to know him was good. Unfortunately later on when I came back to the states he passed away and that was really hard for me because I was barely getting to bond with him. I was in shock and needed time to process I only wanted to spend time with my family I let my ex know what had happened and I let him know the situation. I didn’t reply to anybody I wasn’t on my phone I needed my space losing a loved one is really hard and only some people will understand. Since I wasn’t replying to him he decides to break up with me because I wasn’t giving him attention I explained to him why I wasn’t replying but he says that he does more than me in the relationship because I wasn’t replying so he was done with me . I think it’s unfair that he did that knowing the situation knowing what I’m going through isnt easy. What do you guys think Am I the asshole for not replying?",0.04
"AITA for being a passive aggressively shitty roommate? (sorry if this is rambling, iv never made a reddit post before)
I lived with my three roommates (I’ll call A, B & C for simplicity) for ~3 years 
In that time period, I regularly refused to do dishes, take the trash to the dump or even empty out the can, dust, vacuum, or EVER clean off the counters. I really mean ANY joint chores. just refused, and while none of them ever complained to my face, I do Know they were talking shit.
BUT.. if they would have cleaned up their own mess I would have been naturally willing to do my part, but I refuse to enable cesspits 
So I hope you’ll hear me out
Before moving in together, I had previously been with a multi year long abusive relationship with a hoarder (which all of them knew about) where I’d spent way too long cleaning up after people who wont appreciate it and so I have developed the mindset of clean up after yourself, anyone elses mess is their problem. I have made this mindset known, which is mainly why I feel justified.
I had known A & B since highschool & knew they were both messy people, especially B, but I had hoped (and theyd vaguely promised..) that moving to a new city, away from their families, with roommates (including C, who is…also not the neatest) to take into consideration.. that theyd grow up and pick up after themselves as they promised they would (I forgot to mention, but the ages range from 22 to 28, so these are not Kids I’m talking about) but this was clearly not the case. 
So when dishes are piling up in the sink, or general shit is piling up on the counters, when theres cat fur or piss or whatever all over (because they have 8 cats btwn the three of them, did I mention that? many of whom piss on the furniture or any clothes you leave lying around?) and I’m?? for some reason supposed to help out??? 
that pile of dishes has nothin to do with me since I hand wash mine ((disclaimer I Would occasionally forget or leave a pan or too to soak but I still don’t think that entitled me to dealing with that whole mess)), that counter IS a pile of garbage I agree, but none of its mine. And yeah I do walk on this carpet to go to & from work but not enough that I feel I should have to be part or cleaning all the piss & fur off of it..and obviously I do contribute to the trash, so I should at least help with that, right? I disagree. I was told that since I drink more than them (A & B in particular smoke more uhh.. grass.. than basically anyone but rarely drink) I had to take my own trash to the dump so the booze remnants didnt stink up their car? ok. so I always took my personal trash & (shared!!) bathroom trash to the dump myself. is the kitchen trash overflowing??? not my problem, sorry if it smells. 
I can tell I was being massively passive aggressive in refusing to clean.. but AITA?? genuinely? from my pov I made my stance on cleaning up after yourself clear and ALL of them chose to ignore… (for reference I’ve lived on my own for about half a month now and magically have had none of that mess piling up….)",0.86
"WIBTAH for refused to let my friend have guests over? I’m writing this on a phone, so I apologise for any formatting issues in advance. 

My (21f) friend (20m) has recently found himself in an awful situation. He’d been living with his parents still, and they have just divorced. His step-dad owned the house and also was his boss in an electrician job. His step-dad is selling the house which has left my friend both homeless and jobless. His mum is staying with one of her friends because her condo has been smashed in by a tree from a bad tornado we had sweep through and it will take 6-12 months to repair.

There’s not enough space at his mum’s friend’s place or elsewhere for my friend. So, myself and my roomies (my brother, 21m and my partner, also 21m) have offered him our spare room to stay in until his mum’s condo is repaired. 

He has moved all his stuff in completely now, and has been here for about 2 weeks. He’s applying to doordash and he’s expected to pay just a quarter of the rent while he stays.We won’t make him pay other bills like internet, water or electricity. 

He’s never lived as an adult without his parents, so that mixed with all the bad luck he’s just experienced has made us cut him a lot of slack. He’s only expected to start paying rent whenever he’s able to start working, regardless of how long that takes so long as we see he’s making progress. 

In hindsight, I realise we should’ve sat down with him and agreed on alot more things then just money. The most prominent thing so far being guests. 

Myself and my roomies are of the mindset that he is not moving in with us, and he’s not a roommate and we don’t want to live with him (and he knows this as he and his partner asked to move into our spare room in the past and we refused as we believe we wouldn’t mesh well as roomies. Some friends need to stay at a distance no matter how much you love them). We have offered him the room only cause he would’ve had literally nowhere else to go if we hadn’t. And as much as we don’t want to live with him, we will never turn our backs on a friend in need like this. 

However, he has started acting a little like he owns the place. He’s already invited a friend over twice without even letting us know let alone asking us first. My partner had a firm word with him the first time he invited the friend over about the fact that he can’t just go having whoever he wants over whenever. However it obviously has already happened a second time. 

My friend has now asked in these words “you don’t mind if I have my partner around every now and then, right?” To which I ignored because I was playing a video game on my day off with a headset on and in the middle of a very intense moment and he didn’t even have the curtesy to get my attention and wait until I wasn’t occupied first. 

So I pose the question to reddit: WIBTAH if I refused his request?",0.08
"AITA for refusing to let my husband sleep? Hi everyone, I’m struggling with a situation with my husband and need some outside perspective.

My (27F) husband (28M) has a habit of falling asleep during our family time. He frequently falls asleep while playing video games with our older child, while laying on the floor to ""play"" with the baby, or while watching TV together after dinner (these are just a few scenarios). It usually takes a significant amount of effort to wake him, if I only give him a gentle reminder he will fall back asleep almost instantly.

I've expressed my frustration several times, saying it makes me feel like he doesn't value our time together. Especially when it's just the two of us. He has apologized and talked about trying to get more sleep or seeking medical advice, but there hasn't been any change. I ultimately booked him an appointment with his primary care provider to discuss the issue. She referred him to a psychologist, who I ended up having to locate and book the appointment for, and also referred him to do a sleep study. This was months ago and he just booked the sleep study consultation last month.

We both sleep about the same amount, though I think I might sleep a little less considering I don't take micro-naps during the day. Our only real free time starts when our kids are in bed around 8:30 PM. After they're asleep, we both stay up late, about 1:00 to 2:30 AM, playing video games. He doesn't typically seem to have trouble staying awake for that.

However, I feel a bit hypocritical. On the rare occasion that I need to rest or nap, he's completely understanding and takes over handling the kids and household while I lay down. He will sometimes wake up early with the kids on the weekends and care for them while I sleep in. However, it's hit or miss whether I will come out to find the kids awake and in front of the tv while he sleeps in the recliner or if I will find him awake and engaged with them. I can’t help feeling neglected when he consistently falls asleep during the time we could be spending together and I worry the kids will feel the same as they get older and notice this pattern.

So, AITA for feeling upset and hurt over this and wanting him to change his behavior? Or should I just suck it up and let him sleep?",0.67
"AITA for making my parents wait to see their first grandchild For background we found out we were pregnant at about 5 weeks and told my parents we were pregnant the following week. Immediately there was an issue because my cousin’s wedding was the same day as my due date. My cousin is like a sister to us and my parents basically raised her so they consider her their child. They planned to attend the wedding (in another country) and prayed (literally) I would deliver earlier so they could be present at both events. 

For the months and weeks leading up to the due date I asked repeatedly if they would be present and they didn’t give me a straight answer. Finally in the last weeks leading up to my due date my mother admitted they were going to my cousin’s wedding and it was a shame the baby did not come earlier. I knew they had already purchased tickets etc because my sister told me. I also found out they would not be back until a week and a half AFTER my due date. 

Once my parents returned from their trip they called to ask when they can come over and we told them the pediatrician said they need to quarantine for 10 days(it wasn’t our pediatrician but that’s what the CDC advises). We have told all our friends who travelled the same thing. My parents basically said that’s ridiculous and we clearly didn’t want their help which is why we are making up these arbitrary quarantine times. When I told them we are actually so exhausted and would have loved help earlier in the process we were met with “you will not make me feel guilty for going to my daughter’s wedding”. They said the wedding had been planned for over a year and basically insinuated that my pregnancy should have been planned better. 

We were also accused of withholding information when in reality we have shared every doctor’s appointment and discussed in detail all of my concerns about birth. I ended up laboring for 72 hours of which about 60 of those were unmedicated. During this time we were getting photos of their trip and the preparations for the wedding. Even after birth we have sent pictures every day and one my sister’s visited in the hospital the following day after delivery and we FaceTimed with everyone. 

Additionally my husband’s mother (who lives with us and has dementia) broke her hip and was discharged early from rehab back home so we were caring for a newborn and an elderly person at the same time. No one acknowledges how difficult our situation is just that they say they want to help and then say we never tell them what kind of help we need. We are basically surviving each day. 

To add insult to injury my parents have not bought a single gift in anticipation of my child but somehow feel entitled to have me shorten this quarantine window so they can come over. We are still not even sure how excited they are about their first grandchild. None of my siblings are dating or married so this is currently their only grandchild.

"AITA for saying my aunt is more resourceful than you to my mother? Me, 23F and my mother 55F had an argument in the morning. She was helping my aunt (my mother’s brother’s wife) pay for the installation of WiFi in her new place. My uncle passed away two months ago and it has been hard on us all. We used to love together in what is our house. (All house paid my mother)

My aunt ditched and betrayed us by going to live in another house with her kids without telling us anything. The house was on my uncles name but my mother and my other uncle paid for the remaining amount for the house. 

My aunt left by making us the bad guy by saying we did not even help her when mind you we have been doing everything for her since the beginning. She said now her maternal side of the family will do everything for her since we never did anything for her.

Now that is all some background. So today she got WiFi installation done in her place and my other uncle called my mother, saying that she got it installed and wants my mother to pay for the amount. The amount is not the issue. It is the blatant shamelessness that she still dared to ask her for something financially when she clearly said her side of the family will do everything for her now. This has been a pattern that my other uncle and mother have been falling prey to due to them saying it is their brother’s last memory. His kids and they want to everything for them. The same kids who have don’t talk to me when I try to and said that my job does not require someone to have good intellect and anyone can do it.

"AITA for telling my friend I think he’s autistic By autistic, I mean I see the symptoms in him and I think he could get a diagnosis because I’ve noticed that he fits a lot of the criteria. I’m also autistic, and I see a lot of similarities between us.

So I’ve told my friend “Steve” (name is hidden to protect identity) several times I think he has autism and should get a diagnosis, especially since he was getting a diagnosis for ADHD as well. I told him this in front of our other friend, “friend 2”. Im only friends with friend 2 through Steve, and since I left my old school at the end of last year, friend 2 has been spreading rumors about me at my old school. I’m not entirely sure he’s credible for this

After I told Steve I thought he was autistic, friend 2 pulled me aside and said some people didn’t like to be called autistic and I should not have told him that. I thought it was unfair for him to speak on Steve’s behalf, but I have run into a similar issue that friend 2 had described with another former friend of mine. Steve has never said anything confirming or denying being uncomfortable about my comment, so I’m not entirely sure who to trust, but I’m terrible at social cues, so please enlighten me

EDIT: Since people are telling me that armchair diagnosing is not necessary and not accurate because I lack qualification, I suggested to one friend to get a diagnosis for ADHD and she is now medicated for it, and another close friend i have suggested to get a diagnosis for autism and she is getting assessed tomorrow.

"AITA for not getting along with my sister in law? I 25F and my husband, 26M have known each other for a decade and started dating eight years ago (now married for three months). I have seen all five siblings grow throughout the years. my husband’s younger brother 22M (Alejandro ) started dating a girl named Nayeli almost 4 years ago. When I met Nayeli, I thought she was a very shy and reclusive girl that never really talked and would never say hi to anybody when visiting my in-laws house, regardless of who was there. 

Suddenly, at a family gathering. Nayeli wanted to speak to me in private. I was very surprised for her request since we never really talked just a friendly hello once in a while.. once we were in a private room, she accused me of trying to” take her man” and that she found me bickering around” very flirty”. For me, this news was very shocking since it would never cross my mind to see in a romantic way the same boy I saw grow up from a little kid to what he is now. I responded that I thought it was very inappropriate for her to accuse me of something that for me feels like incest and impossible to think of. she told me I needed to respect her boundaries and to” please stop playing around with my man”. Once we stepped out of the room, I let my husband know what had happened with Nayeli and me. he knew Nayeli wanted to talk to me, but he never thought it would be something like that. 


By the end of the day we brushed it off and continued with our life. Since that day, I noticed that Nayeli would always give me Nasty glares and also to every female whoever got close to Alejandro regardless, if they were family members . Whenever I was around she would always talk like I wasn’t in the room and ignored me. I decided that if she was going to be very petty with me, I would also be petty too, and told my sister-in-law what had happened between us, and why we never got along. To make the story short everybody in the family found out why We never got along, and we just kept our distances. 

Now a year later, Alejandro and Nayeli are no longer together but she is pregnant with the first grandchild in the family. Although I’m very happy for Alejandro and this Baby joining the family I cannot seem to shake off The fact that Nayeli does not like me, and will probably not let me see my niece in the future. I have tried to talk with her and be civil, so we can work out our differences for the sake of the family, but she refuses to make peace. This breaks my heart because Alejandro and my husband are very close and are often together. I would hate to get in the way of their relationship just because Nayeli and I do not get along.

"AITA refusing to lie for my brother who is cheating on his girlfriend? So my brother(27M) has been dating this girl, we’ll call her Sarah, for at least 5 years now.  He likes spending time with her but has told me and everyone in my family that he doesn’t see a future with her. He doesn’t like her family and even once told her she had to cut off her parents if she wanted to keep dating him. He didn’t invite her to his birthday dinner with all of our family bc he said she has no social skills and would just sit on her phone. She is shy but the sweetest girl. He has said things like she has no drive or work ethic, she has no social skills, and countless other horrible things about her.  He started dating girls on the side, pretty much looking for a long term girl while keeping Sarah to fill in the mean time. 

About a year ago one of Sarah’s friends saw my brother on tinder and sent her screenshots of it. They ended up breaking up and my brother has run through so many girl since. He was even taking girls from dating apps out and trying to get a hotel room with them on the first night. He’s so such a slimy guy and no one in my family will acknowledge it. 

Fast forward to a couple months ago I was cutting my brothers hair and he told me that since he was getting ready to start the fire academy and wouldn’t have anyone to go through it with, he was thinking about calling up Sarah. I told him very straight up not to do that and to leave her alone. You know you don’t see a future with her so why would you waste her time?

Well a couple weeks ago my mom dropped on me that he and Sarah were dating again and didn’t want to tell me bc he was afraid of my judgement. I said ya well he should be bc I am absolutely judging him right now. She said I am in no place to judge him and I just can’t stand that my family is so ok with treating people like they don’t matter. I said ok well I don’t want to be a part of it so let me know when she is going to come and I’ll leave. She said ok. Well that night about 5 minutes before she showed up my mom said oh Sarah’s almost here for dinner. I had to sit at dinner and act like everything was fine. She stayed over at our house the whole weekend. Three days later I find out there is a new girl at our house. He had a girl fly down from another state to see him and stay at our house. She slept in the same bed as Sarah sleeps in and even was wearing the same exact hoodie he always gives to Sarah. I was so disgusted. I talked to my mom and now she told me that they are dating but not officially so he’s still dating around and that Sarah knows that. I believe she maybe know he’s going on dates but I highly highly doubt she knows he’s having a girl fly to see him and stay with him. 

My parents are completely fine with it and see absolutely no problem with it and are actually mad at me for being upset about this. He does absolutely no wrong ever in their eyes. I have a long history of problems with him and overall just think he’s a shitty person and I don’t really want anything to do with him. AITA?",0.02
"AITA for not wanting to take care of my boyfriends physical needs? I 31 yr old female have been with my partner 29 yr old male for about 8 years now. We have one kid together and one on the way. At the risk of sounding ignorant, I want to say up front that he has been a serial cheater since the beginning of our relationship. I was unaware the first 3 years and then after that I have done everything that has been asked of me in hope that he will stop. He does for some time and then goes right back to it. I’m two weeks away from giving birth and have had several health issues and I’ve been also dealing with regular pregnancy symptoms like heartburn. It has been difficult for me to engage in any sexual activity. Today I was yelled at for 5 hours straight about how I won’t put out and I never do. I tried to explain that I have problems going on currently and with everything that I’ve gone through with him it is extremely difficult for me to feel safe emotionally around him. After, he told me this was just an excuse I was informed that I do not do enough for him and that’s why he cheats. However, I do track our sexual history on my cycle tracker app to make sure I know conception dates if I become pregnant. It doesn’t matter if I please him 7 days a week or if I do nothing, he still cheats. This is not a good enough excuse for me, but it’s the only thing he can try to use against me especially at this point. Am I the asshole for not wanting to deal with him at all anymore?",0.29
"AITA for taking over a program & disrespecting my manager I (23M) got hired at an education nonprofit. My manager (28M) handles a program that teaches intermediate coding skills, and I'm an assistant with a BA in CS. He's done event planning, graphic design, some web design, but not professional coding.   
He has a pretty vague lesson plan. College 101 stuff that feels patronizing, but I don't argue, I'm just the TA. He's supposed to hire guest instructors, but we don't get many people.   
Two weeks into the program he gets COVID and has to take a week off. The lesson plan still isn't fleshed out & there's no guest speaker. The CEO (small team) steps in and we teach together. I override the 3-sentence lesson plan and come up with something new. It goes really well, CEO promotes me to instructor while my manager is sick.  
I really love teaching and take a lot of initiative. It's a lot of stress to create a program on the fly and at a review I say that I don't want things to go at this pace again. We agree to plan better for the next round.   
At the end of the program, we present the students' work at a big event. Manager's in charge, but everything is getting planned last minute & he often ghosts us about details. I critique him about it and say he hasn't improved, and our relationship sours.  
For the next version of the program, we clash on everything from flyer designs to curriculum changes. I want to take on a bigger role in the team, but he bars me from opportunities, even secretly asks another coworker to take over one of my duties on a project.   
The CEO tries to interfere but it's too late. We're months in and we hate each other.   
During a mediation session he lets it all out. I'm always negative. Always critiquing and never giving positive feedback. This is true. I've gotten harsher and pushed back a lot more. I never address the main issue that he doesn't know shit about coding, but the resentment's there and probably apparent at this point. He calls me unprofessional and wants me fired, but the CEO keeps me on the team.  
Another manager tells me that I've hurt his feelings & that I should be more forgiving. And I do feel bad because my perfectionism has hurt people before. I've been bitter about things out of his control and very passive-aggressive about it. I probably haven't said a lot of kind things to him and focused on his flaws. My instinct is to put my head down and work, and that doesn't make me a very sweet person.   
I literally took the reins of the program he prepared and did my own thing (not that he ever complained at the time). My recent actions made it clear that I don't respect him anymore and I think my judgment is better than his. I see how his ego has been damaged and I still think I was justified in my actions, but maybe not so justified in how I communicated.   
I'm not used to someone hating me this transparently and I've been feeling guilty about what I could've done better. AITA?",0.93
"AITA for trying to break up my friend and her bf? So, I have a friend 17F - G, and her taste in men in... questionable.

We have been friends for like... 3 years and since then I have had enough with her. She has had around 10 bf since we became friends. Around 3 of them were serious. 

I am the type of friend who is honest enough to say what's on their mind and when I am against something I always tell her + my reasoning for it.

The story is long, so get yourself some popcorns.

Everything started when she was 15, and got herself a 19M bf - V, who is a father of 2M. Their relationship was toxic as hell. He broke up with her TWICE. 3 to 4 months after they got together, he sent her a picture of a positive pregnancy test and told her

""I made a mistake"" - Like... side eye...

She got mad at me for making her break up with him, and broke our relationship for an year after.

We became friends again a month ago and oh boy... he has a new bf - 23M, who is in he ARMY btw, IV. They have been together for a year and she is very happy etc. 

You may ask why do I want them to break up.... well, he is worse than her ex.

I will list you some things IV had told her and let you judge on your own...

1- She can't wear a tampon cause it loosens up her vagigi (biology left the chat)

2- If they have a baby girl, he will leave it in an orphanage 

3- She sould give birth via C-section, cause she will look like a hooker down there (apparently)

They are currently trying for a baby and I am trying to talk her out of it.

I told her straight away that he is a red flag and I reminded her that he left his sex cause she has cancer. He left her not because of the illness itself but because her vagina smelled bad and sex didn't feel good 💀💀💀

Now she is mad at me and told me that I am a controlling bitch.

I am a real hard worker and i enjoy my career, in these 2 years i reached a pretty good pay for my age, which lead to the fact that currently i earn double what my bf earns.

We just started talking about marriage and finances, and i suggested that we should both wait until our total income is increased due to the fact that we live in a very expensive city.

I suggested that he should wait until his next pay rise which will come in 1 year or 2 due to the fact that we both work in IT field which is growing quickly.

He disagreed with me, saying that our finances shouldn’t stop us from anything and we should grow and build together, he called me a red flag materialistic for wanting him to earn more in order to get married. 

I do love this man and i do want to get married, but i am also a planner and i know how high it can cost to live in this city, i told him that i will be fine with waiting and I won’t leave him as we are both still young and there is no rush.

"AITA for not buying a bridesmaid’s dress for my friends wedding? I 25F have a friend Ava 25F. She is getting married and asked me to be her bridesmaid and I agreed. Her theme for bridesmaids was a sunset, so she asked us all to wear yellow/orange/pink dresses to match the theme.

I went to my brother’s wedding a few years ago and my SIL’s bridesmaid theme was a yellow dress. It is a beautiful dress and was very expensive for me as a college student. My brother agreed to pay more than half which made it a lot more affordable but that dress isn’t wearable outside of special occasions and I’ve only worn it once outside the wedding. 

I told Ava I had a dress for her wedding when we were out with a friend and my friend asked oh is it the one you wore for SIL’s and brothers wedding? So I said yeah and showed them a picture of me in the dress. 

Ava then said she would want me to get a new dress for her wedding as I’ve worn my yellow one before and people have seen it. I was confused by this as even if people have seen it it doesn’t matter? 

My SIL was the year above me in school so we do share mutual friends that I saw at her wedding and some of them will be at Ava’s wedding but I don’t want to buy a brand new dress. Bridesmaid dresses are expensive and I don’t get wear out of them afterwards so they sit in my closet. 

I haven’t been to many weddings though, only my brothers that I remember and a few cousins when I was much younger so maybe this is some wedding etiquette that I need to brush up on?",0.11
"AITA for telling my asian girlfriend she doesn't make asian food Straight to the point. My (36M) girlfriend (28F) and I have been together for 2 years. She's chinese originally but grew up here in the us with her chinese family. I'm just standard american with european roots. Our relationship is great, but yesterday we got into a fight that still annoys me today.   


I found her cooking rice with vegetables,  and somehow the topic of asian food came up, chinese food in particular. I laughed and pointed out that what she was cooking was not chinese food, but just regular food. She felt like arguing though (she's very opinionated), and insisted it was chinese food because she's chinese and it's her food. I told her to point out on a chinese restaurant menu what she's making then, and she couldn't. Exactly. So it was chinese food, just regular food made by a chinese person. She thinks I'm a jackass, but I've had my fair share of chinese food and I know what it is and what it isn't.  


Was she somehow right here? I guarantee what she was making wasn't on any chinese restaurant menu

"AITA for not ordering drinks during happy hour Boyfriend and I go to a restaurant for dinner (mainly for me because Mexican isn't his favorite) & before getting seated the hosts asks if we'll be ordering from the happy hour menu or regular. We weren't aware it was happy hour but didn't want to limit ourselves so we tell the host we might order from it. The host takes us to the bar area. For what it's worth we've gone to other locations of this restaurant and have been seated in normal tables for happy hour. The restaurant also wasn't packed or crowded. 

We get seated and are greeted by our server pretty quickly. She asks if we know what we want to order for drinks. We don't drink alcohol so we politely say we'll both get waters for now. She seems fine with it and after coming back with waters she asks if we're ready to order. I order tacos from the happy hour menu because it's a good deal and I couldn't pass it up - 3 salmon tacos for $10. The waiter then looks at my boyfriend and asks what he'll order and he tells her that he's not ordering and that it's just the tacos for me. She seems irked. I don't blame her but she also didn't make any efforts to hide it well. I feel bad and wait until she's gone to tell my boyfriend that maybe he should order something small like a soda or something. He says he shouldn't need to feel pressured into ordering anything and that he's just here for me.

The waiter then comes back after putting in the order for tacos and asks us if we're ""finally ready to order."" I'm confused and question if I ordered the tacos. She then reconfirms that she's put in the order for tacos but reiterates if we're ready to place an order. My boyfriend repeats from earlier that it's just the tacos for me. Things start feeling awkward and sort of tense. I wait for her to leave again and ask my boyfriend if he's sure he doesn't want to get a drink or maybe dessert so it's not just me ordering an item. He's very adamant that he should not have to get anything.

Fast forward to me finishing my food and being done. Boyfriend asks for the check and the waiter looks at us and slightly raises her voice and says ""that's it? That's all you guys are going to order? I can't believe it.""

I pay the bill and I add a 25% tip. I thought about adding more because I was feeling bad but my boyfriend was very put off by the whole thing and said I was already being too nice by tipping that much for the service we received. On one hand I get her frustration. More food/ drinks would yield to a higher bill which would increase the tip amount. If there were customers waiting to be seated I could also see an issue of us being a waste of space because of our low our bill was. However, no one was waiting and we were probably in and out 40-60 minutes in total.

flash forward two years and we’re thinking of building a house. My main problem is that it will be right beside his parents house. He knows I’m not keen on the location but we have land to build on so I feel like I have no other choice.

His mum is absolutely lovely to me and so kind but I can help feel disappointed when me and my boyfriend are with her. 

Two weeks ago I phoned him and voiced my concern about living so close to his parents after what he said. I also asked him if me and his mum did have an argument would he stand by me and support me as his girlfriend but he wouldn’t answer me and told me he would not be taking sides. 

Inside I feel so conflicted. On one side his mum is very important to him and I’m so glad to see he had a good relation shop with her but on the other side of we did marry I’d be his wife and I feel like I will always be second best.

"AITA for accepting free drinks even though I have a boyfriend? I 24F went out with my friends including Eden to a bar yesterday. Eden found out that her boyfriend had an affair and had been quite upset this past week. To cheer her up, a bunch of us decided to dress up and go to a nice bar. Eden approached a group of guys and started talking to one of them at the bar and he bought us a round of shots, and had them reviewed to our table before we could say anything. I also drank two drinks before that shot so I was nearing tipsy. I am a lightweight so I decided to cut myself off after another drink. Eden insisted on us all staying for another round and I don’t really remember how much I had after that. However, we all left together and I got my boyfriend Ted to pick me up from the station. 

Today, I told Ted about last night and included the guy who bought us a round and Ted got upset, as accepting the drink made it look like I was ‘available’. I told Ted that I didn’t speak to any of the guys at the bar and he bought the drinks for Eden’s sake, not me. I just want an outside perspective.

"AITA for repeatedly bringing up my brothers living situation? A few years ago my brother, Joe, was forced to move back into my parents house, prior to that he lived with some room mates but that fell through, he then lived with his girlfriend whom they ended up breaking up, which brings us to the current situation. When my brother moved into my parents he stated it would only be for a few months as he didn't want to get comfortable. After those few months he started stating ""well, the market sucks right now so I will wait until it gets better...blah blah"".

My brother runs a department at a major company with offices in multiple countries, so he's not hurting for money. My parents have also expressed to me that they want Joe out of the house. The issue is neither of my parents like conflict, so they will never tell him due to fear of starting a conflict. Joe also spends his money on a lot of recreational activities which involve flying to other states/countries for events. I also didn't mention, Joe is in his late 30s. 

While it's not my house, and really not my place to tell him to move out, I have been dropping hints ranging from subtle to not so much to get it through his head. In group chats I might drop info about a song I listened to, movie I watched, etc. and they always reference leaving home in some way. Sometimes I see posts on Facebook from friends, who are realtors, posting about a house and I'll share that in our group chats. 

The last bit of not so subtle hint was at a family gathering. My parents had a get together, Joe left the house, picked up his new girlfriend (we'll call her Amber), and brought her back to my parents. Through the course of the night, while drinks are being had, my wife starts a conversation with Amber. At one point Amber states ""Joe said he'll pick me up on the way to his parents house"", making it clear she has no idea he lives with my parents. I interject and say ""excuse me, you mean he'll pick you up and come back to his place."" You can see the confusion in her eyes, but after taking a second she realized what I meant. 

She asked Joe to take her home as she was ready to leave. For the next 30 minutes it was very calm in the house, my parents were concerned but I could see relief in their eyes. Joe gets back home and goes ballistic on me. Joe brings up how I constantly try to drop hints about moving out and it's not my place to say what he does with his life. Because I'm a bit tipsy after he rants some I just say ""I think you need to go to your room"". After some more arguing the night was over.

I do feel bad about essentially ruining the remaining part of my parents get together, even though my other siblings told me they were glad I said something. Joe started to respond back in group chats after a few weeks, but acts like nothing happened. Joe still lives at home but I am not aware if he is actively looking for new lodgings.

"AITA for not wanting to take part in an intervention? My (M19) long-time friend and roommate Eric (M18) has been in a relationship Lindsey (F19) for the past few months. Eric and Lindsey have an interesting relationship. When we were around 11, Lindsey had some sort of crush on Eric and he thought that for whatever reason this met he needed to pick on her.

It never got too bad, but he’d call her names, tease her, and was pretty mean to her. Lindsey was pretty upset with this but for whatever reason still liked him. By the time we started high school, Eric stopped picking on Lindsey and we didn’t interact with her all that much.

Fast forward to us starting college, and several people from our high school including Lindsey came to this school. Lindsey again for whatever reason started crushing on Eric again but this time he was receptive, and they started a relationship. I going to be completely honest when I saw, the relationship is completely one-sided.

Lindsey likes Eric way more than he likes her. She tidies our dorm, cooks for him, and is available whenever he hits her up. Lol, I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t somewhat envious. Eric on the other hand doesn’t do too much for Lindsey. He forgot about her birthday last week and pretty often brushes her off to hang out with me and the other guys.

While Lindsey has been ok with this (according to Eric) her friends have been seething. Two of them Maddy (F18) and Shelly (F18) approached me a few days ago and told me that they wanted me to help them break Lindsey and Eric apart. When I asked why they told me that Eric takes Lindsey completely for granted and that it wasn’t healthy for her to devote herself to someone who clearly doesn’t feel. They also mentioned that Lindsey seems to be becoming depressed at how neglectful Eric is but isn’t willing to part ways with him.

They then told me that they wanted to engineer some sort of plan that would make Lindsey leave Eric. I completely refused to take part in this. I told them that we’d be overstepping boundaries if we tried anything but then they accused me of being an asshole and keeping silent just because Eric was benefiting so much?

Jack has another main caregiver, we’ll call her Stacy. While I was working with my client stacy was on shift with jack. Although most of shift stacy had been gone somewhere with jack (super normal, jack loves to spend time outside of the house). I was cooking for my client around 6-6:30pm when I noticed jack hadn’t been home yet and he has medication at 6pm. I checked the counter where he keeps his meds and his meds were still there. I kind of disregarded it because it was only 6:10 and maybe stacy was just running late. It’s not going to kill jack if his medication is a few minutes late. Some time went by and it was around 6:30pm so it was getting a little later and I check his medication again and realized he hadn’t been given his 8am medication either. Both of his medications are important, one is a mood stabilizer and the other is for seizures. I then texted his mom, who I talk to often, and told her about it. Should I have gone to the other caregiver first before reaching out to the mom? I’m not super close with stacy and honestly in past experiences she has lied about little things.

"AITA For telling my sister that she doesn't understand ""being tired""? I care for our mum in every way imaginable. I bathe her, toilet her, prep her food, help her walk places, keep her spaces clean, all of that. I also generally keep on top of the house.

My dad works full time and my sister (15) does fuck all. She lays in bed all day doing nothing besides talking on the phone and playing roblox with her friends. Sleeps all day etc.

This morning I woke up to dirty litter trays, all water dishes empty, cats had no food - ten tonnes of dishes (not a single clean one), so much laundry the basket was overflowing - as well as all my personal bits (care wise). It was also wash day for my mum today.

I woke my sister up to come help as our dad was at work. It was maybe 8am and she only went to bed at 6am (according to her).

She complained that she's tired and didn't want to do any of the chores. I left her for a bit, attempted to do them myself, but was running out of time and energy. I went and woke her again to do the dishes. Thats it.

She huffed and told me she was tired and asked if I could do it. I might have lost it a little bit on her.

I didn't yell but got like, angry talk, you know? I basically said ""Tired? You don't understand the first thing about being tired. You've never experienced tired.""

I'm exhausted, constantly, but because I get paid to be a carer she never acknowledges the caring part of my life as ""work"" (and neither does my dad). I lost it on her because I'm overworked. Or something. Idk. 

I had a cry in my room, she complained to our mum about me, who told her to do the washing up (and also some other bits, so score).

When our dad got home he ""had a word"" about giving her a break. Our life is stressful yada yada. She has autism & adhd so we need to be nicer to her and more understanding. Then he had to redo the dishes because she hadn't actually cleaned anything.

Then she says that since she doesn’t live here, I should’ve been paying for half of the expenses because we took the master and the converted garage had items in storage belonging to me. 

Again, not keeping in mind how much we spent out of pocket for conversion to have a 4th room that was never part of the original floor plan. Property taxes didn’t even increase since that happened. 

I’m ready to cut my losses for that conversion and move away because this is just causing so much stress. She’s sending screenshots of bills like, huh?? I give a lump sum that’s 1/3 of the total monthly calculated average of expenses and mortgage included. What exactly is going on here? 
Told her I’m not paying more if the other person here doesn’t even pay their fair share and then she’s complaining she has to pay for two places! And making up this narrative that she’s somehow covering my expenses when she’s not. Because she’s covering for her own child.. which is my sibling <chuckles>… 

 AITA for telling her that? Should I just move? The other person, a grandparent, doesn’t make a lot any more and the house is in their name. So they can’t actually pay the mortgage on their own.",0.31
"AITA for not agreeing to my friends request on her birthday I (18F) knew my good friend’s (18F) birthday would be coming up within a week.

With the intention of doing something celebratory with/for her, I texted her to find out if she had any plans for her big day. She revealed that she had no plans at all and wouldn’t even be able to go out for her birthday as she had no access to her family car on the day (her family shares a car and they wouldn’t be able to lend it to her on her birthday). She said she felt sad because no one would be celebrating her birthday with her and that it would be very uneventful.

I asked her what her ideal birthday would be, and she replied “going to a karaoke place with her friends”. I said that I would be happy to go with her and that I could use my car to fetch us both. She got excited, and proposed the idea of picking her up, including some of her other friends, then going to a karaoke place at a mall 40 minutes away. 

I was hesitant with the idea of going to that specific mall as it required driving on the highway in order to get there. I’m not a confident driver yet as I had just gotten my license, and wouldn’t feel safe driving myself, nor other people across the highway. 

I told her about my concern, and proposed that we could Uber there, find someone else in the group to drive, or go to a  closer mall instead. She  started to get frustrated, saying that she would not be able to afford the cost of an Uber ride even if we split it amongst the group (a 40 min long Uber journey would be quite pricey). She also said that she isn’t sure if any of her other friends would have access to a car. She specifically wanted this karaoke place as it was the best karaoke place within driving distance, and told me I shouldn’t worry about my driving skills as she trusts me.

I still couldn’t say yes however, because I didn’t trust myself and was worried about safety, and again brought up the alternatives I had suggested earlier. At this point, she got mad and said that she doesn’t want to go out for her birthday anymore, and wanted to just rot at home instead. This is where the convo ended.

I felt bad for ‘ruining’ her plans. Nonetheless, I bought her a gift and planned to drop it off at her house. Then the day of her birthday arrived. She had posted photos on Instagram of herself and all her friends except me, at the karaoke place she had wanted to go to, at that mall 40 minutes away.

At this point I am hurt, because it seems like I was specifically excluded from her plans. However, I don’t know if I was being unreasonable/an asshole for suggesting to be the driver and then going back on it, which ruined her plans had they not been able to find another driver.",0.24
"AITA for making a joke about my friend’s new relationship? I 24F went out with a few friends last year and was flirting with a guy there and he bought me a drink. I then saw his ID, and realised he was 21, but I initially thought he was my age or older as he was taller and it was dark. I was 2 years older than him and declined the drink as he was younger than I thought but told him I was flattered.

I went back to my friends and told them what happened and one of them Sara 26F called me a cougar, jokingly. 

Me and Sara aren’t close, she’s a friend of a friend and while I took cougar as a joke she mentioned it when we went out again in a group of friends that didn’t know that story and told me to make sure I ask how old the next guy was that I talked to. I didn’t say anything but felt a bit weird as she said it in front of other people that I didn’t know as well, but took the joke.

We all met up again for dinner this time and I was sat opposite Sara. Sara told us she was now dating Dave 22M and that he was in uni doing a masters. I made a comment about welcoming her to the cougar club and Sara laughed. 

Afterwards, she messaged me saying she didn’t appreciate the joke and that I basically insulted her boyfriend???",0.5
"AITA for ruining my little sisters bond with my older sister? I 18F have a little sister Daphne 5F. I have an older sister 20F and I don't have a good bond with her. My older sister is mean towards me and my mom. She won't talk to us unless she needs us. And she has been the same towards Daphne. She never wanted her in the first place and she has been treating her the same as she did to me. I however love Daphne. I have always been there and I have always been the one to pick her up from school. Took her out to theme parks took her out to get food and ice cream. Today if she asks me to do something I'll leave what I'm doing and do whatever she wants. She has been amazing too. She came to my school with my mom because she wanted to surprise me after school. I always tell her no matter what happens I am always there and I'll never be mad at her. I spoil her as much as I can and still teaching her how to be humble. For example last week I took her shopping for toys. And she comes up to me with 2 of those little carts. I ask her what the other cart is for and she asks if we can fill a cart for other kids who need it. If I am home I always read her bedtime stories before bed and I always make sure she has breakfast if my mom has to work. Basically Daphne sees me every day and she loves me just as much as I love her. Whereas she doesn't see our older sister often because she is never home and if she is home she is in her room. Also our older sister yells a lot around the house. She would throw a tantrum because someone opened her window for fresh air or because we forgot to buy something she wanted while doing groceries. My sister basically has anger issues and when she was young my parents wanted her to get therapy but she didn't go and my parents did not force her. Whenever this happens Daphne will get scared and she'll stand behind me or come to my room. For the last few months my older sister asked to go out with Daphne a few times and Daphne did not want to go if I wasn't there with her. 

The last straw was yesterday when my older sister said she wanted to read Daphne's bedtime story and Daphne said that she is scared of her and doesn't love her. She said she wanted me and not her to read her stories. I went up with Daphne and told her that I get that she is scared but she should try giving our sister a chance. I told her that while she does have anger issues she would never physically hurt her. And all she wants is a chance to bond with her. Daphne then literally said ""But she is a monster and scares me"" so I did not push her any further. When I went back downstairs my sister got mad and started yelling at me saying I ruined her life and her relationship with Daphne. She said that she is done with me and wishes me to disappear because I keep stealing everything what is hers. I am wondering am I really blocking her to have a relationship with Daphne? So AITA?",0.23
"AITA for being a failed child to my father I would start my story, I would try to keep it short, only made this account for this purpose 

Me (26F) have a little brother (22M) who is gay, he is my only sibling and we were always close growing up. When he was 16, he came out, I was just so happy for him. But he only came out to me and my mom because my father is very conservative and against LGBT people. My brother have been dating his boyfriend (23M) for last three years and they will be married soon, and I am so happy that they are going to be together, I couldn’t be happier. Problem is that my father disowned him after he found out he was gay, so he moved out to my house with me and my now husband. As he turned 18, he started to work and earned a fair amount of income. He soon started to save up for his own place and moved out. 

He started to date his boyfriend in 2021, and now they are getting married. He and my dad don’t talk a lot, and last week we met, and somehow he got the news of their marriage. At the table, he told my brother that he should find a girl and stop with this, but this escalated to a huge fight, and my dad kicked him out. I fought with my dad about this over an hour. My mom and he are now estranged. Anyways, my dad he failed his both children and I was not his daughter, and he said I might have been a better person if I didn’t support my brother.

So AITA for not living to his expectations or just that I was a bad child to him",0.02
WIBTA if I left my boyfriend for our different stances on my son?? I 21F am living with my boyfriend  25M we will call him T. T and I have been together for 1 year and a half. I love him but sometimes his anger gets the best of him. I have a 2 year old son from a previous relationship. My son is my world and I would do anything for him. T has anger issues. He comes home from work and his first course of action is yelling at me that I didn't get this or that done. His second course of action is to yell at my son. I do not like the way he deals with my son. His was of discipline is locking him in his room for hours on end or purposely do things he know will make my son cry. Again my son is only 2 so he will do all the things that come with being 2. If my son is crying my boyfriend will yell at him asking if he wants a reason to cry and if he doesn't stop crying he will spank him and then tell him he's not allowed to cry after and it's an endless cycle until he sees it fit. I love this man I do. But my child will ALWAYS come first. He is always making me feel like I am not enough. He throws a fit if I don't give him what he wants. If I don't go to bed with him he throws a fit. He also expects me to clean up after the other 3 people who live here. I am okay with cleaning up after me my son and my boyfriend but when did I become the maid. I have brought up these concerns to him and he will take it to heart for about a week then go right back to it. I don't know what to do at this point. Am I iver reacting or are my feelings about this situation valid?,0.31
"AITA for asking my brother to hold off on buying a car? Brother wants to finance a car which I completely understand. I’m a car guy myself. However, we want to apply for a joint mortgage together in April and I’ve asked him to just hold off until then. We all know the story of lenders not liking credit applications in and around mortgage application time and buying the specific house we want has been a dream for our family for ages. We’re now in a position where we can do so but we need to watch outgoings for a couple of months.  Brother flipped out at me saying I have no vision and I don’t want him to have nice things and I’m a spineless, ambitionless idiot basically. So my question is, am I being unreasonable in asking him to wait? It makes sense to me but I thought I’d ask to see if there was another side to this that I’m not seeing? 

TL;DR brother wants to finance a car. I said wait till we apply for mortgage. He flipped out at me and proceeded to insult everything about me",0.35
"AITA for Repeatedly bringing up a sore point with my husband? My husband and I come from a middle class Indian family. My parents managed their finances well and don't expect anything from me financially. On the other hand, my husband's father was bad with money and sold everything he had. His birth mother died when he was very young and he was raised by his step mother. He has a biological elder sister and a step younger sister. Our earning are pretty much equal.

My husband is close with his step mother and a month before we were to get married bought a house in her name and is still repaying home loans. I was upset when he did it because he used up all his savings to do this when we were just about to start a new life together. It's been three years since that happened. He also sends his mother and step sister money every month to financially support them even though his younger sister is 28 and educated to find a job. It is expected that he will also pay for the younger sister's wedding whenever it happens. His father separately asks for small amounts as well. While I was aware of the monthly money he sends home, the home loan and the money he sends his father was new for me.

On the other hand, all my earnings go to the family which I've started to resent. He's bought a house for his mother, will pay for sisters wedding, sends money home every month. He had initially agreed to start mutual funds for our family in 2022 but ""forgot"" until 2024. I was visible irritated when I found out especially because I was saving for our family. We're 5 months pregnant when this blew up. He called his mother and told her I'm feeling financially insecure because he's bought a house in her name and wanted to get his name added in it (something we had discussed and he had agreed to do in addition to the mutual funds). Now his sisters are feeling offended and his mother started crying on the phone saying that I'm making him doubt his family's intentions. His elder sister is making things worse by making snide comments.

We were supposed to go to his parents place for the delivery (common in India) but I feel the environment is negative for me during a time when I will be at my weakest. In the meanwhile, he's started the mutual funds and contributed a little (it's still only a third of what I have in savings) and feels I should be reasonable now. He also told his father he's never sending him anything again and should learn to live within his pension. However I cannot stop myself from bringing this up again and again because (1) I'm dreading going to his house and dealing with the taunts and negativity (2) I genuinely believe I did nothing wrong. He should have started thinking about his family while getting married instead of making it look like I'm insecure now. AITA here for continually bringing it up with him even though I know it's a sore subject? I want to prioritize myself and my mental health here but I'm worried it's making me look money minded.",0.86
"AITA for putting a lock on my trashcan? I (26 NB) moved into a duplex a few months ago and my neighbor (57F) and her son (15M) keep using my trash can. Normally, I don't mind because I'm a single person who doesn't generate a lot of trash. However, the last month or so I've run into a few problems with them doing so. The first thing I noticed is that she dumps her cat litter straight into the can without bagging it up. Not only is it gross when I have to lift up the lid, but I'm pretty sure it's frowned upon by the workers who have to pick up the can because the litter flies everywhere when they dump the can. Secondly, she will forget to take out her trash before it gets picked up on Friday, and if I don't take it out to the curb for her, she will just let it overflow and then use my can and fill it up before the next week. Third, a few weeks ago I bothered to take both cans out (now something I do every week because of second reason) and when I pulled into the driveway the next day, she, or her son, only pulled up THEIR can, leaving mine out on the curb. You would think that if your neighbor is nice enough to help you out, you would extend the favor, right? Anyway, the straw that broke the camels back for me was today. Yesterday I took out the trash to my can at around 3-5pm, and I noticed that my can was only really about half full. I forgot to roll the can out to the curb last night, but had time to do it this morning before the truck got here. Before I rolled it out, I noticed that both cans were full and borderline overflowing, with my can being full of her trash. It was POURING rain this morning and yet I still pulled both her and my trash out, getting soaked in the process. My biggest issue is that if I somehow slept in or forgot and missed the truck this morning, both cans would be overflowing and there would be no space for either of our trash for the next week. It's not my responsibility to take HER trash out, but if I don't, she just fills up my can anyway. So today, I'm buying a lock for my can. I feel like maybe I could be overreacting and I could try talking to her first about it, however I'm really not a confrontational person. If she asks me about the lock, I'll explain, but I'm not going out of my way to ask her to be considerate because she's shown me already on multiple occasions that she doesn't know how to be. So, am I TA and overreacting?


UPDATE: thank you guys for taking the time to read my silly little post, and the advice you've given me thus far. I will say again, I'm not a person who loves conflict and I would rather avoid it all together if it were my choice. I think it was just how I grew up and what I've dealt with in my life that leaves me to be fearful when it comes to situations that might lead to hard feelings. You might get that, you might not. That's okay. Regardless.. my update. So, luckily a family member of mine happens to work with my landlord. One of the comments on here was addressing on if I OWNED the can (which I do not) and another regarding the fact that my neighbor may not be aware that one can is mine and it's not just for everybodys use. It got me thinking, that maybe, somewhere down the line before I moved in, my landlord had given ""permission"" in some way, shape or form that led to my neighbor believing that she had some right to use my can. I texted that family member ONLY to ask my landlord if that had been the case, because then I wouldn't really have the right to lock up a can I didn't own if she somehow did allow it. Then without me asking, the landlord took it upon herself to text my neighbor and clarify that it was NOT okay to use my can. Lemme also say, I was pretty unhappy with this outcome. I was, in no way, trying to get someone else to fight my battles because I am a fully grown adult, and if push came to shove, I would have stepped up and said something, even if its not in my nature to. Luckily, my landlord seemingly made it a generic message that she sent to all tenants, and not calling out my neighbor specifically. I'm not sure if it will work, but I'll give y'all another update on here if I have to. 

One final thing I have to say, in my own defense, is that I believe there is a very fine line between firmly establishing boundaries and asserting yourself in an unfavorable way. A kind reminder that I have to live next to this person for the unforeseeable future, and my lack of confrontation erred on the fact that I don't want this person to make my living here worse. I hope y'all can respect that",0.32
"AITA I want to rehome our dogs. I have 4 kids and a husband. We have 2 small dogs. ( dogs are 4 and 7 years old) I work part-time and husband works full time. Most of the childcare and house work is my responsibility.  Husband is great with the kids but not so much with house work. He is very involved with the kids in the evenings and weekends. He always gives me a break from the kids on the weekends. My biggest stress is our 2 little dogs. They are sweet and the kids love them. My husband loves them! The dogs drive me crazy every day! 

They are not well trained. They don't have accidents in the house, they know to go outside to relieve themselves, but...  they piss on anything new we bring into the house. Kids toys, a fake plant, a new door mat. They even peed on my Christmas tree. I was so furious. They throw up sometimes and I have to clean it. The kids will give the dogs some food they are not supposed to have then the dogs get diarrhea and I have to clean it up. The dogs are also very attached to me, right by my feet whenever I walk around. I cannot tell you how many times I have tripped or almost tripped coming down the stairs because they want to walk right with me. Often I'm holding the baby coming down the stairs yelling at the dogs to go away. 

I feel like I'm always angry . Everyday morning till night I'm just angry with the dogs. I hate it. They ruined our backyard door scratching and chewing at it. They never want to play in the backyard they always want to be inside. They get into the trash, the list goes on. 

My husband and I fight about the dogs a few times a month. He says he will train them better he will do more dog care , but he can only do that Saturday and Sunday. Mon-Fri it's me who has to take care of them. No one takes them for walks and the kids barely play with them. 

I feel like a dick.  The reason why I'm asking if I'm TA is because I'm the only one in the house who hates the dogs. The dogs are sweet with our kids, the kids are small all four are under 6 years old. (Yes four kids under 6 years old is crazy) when I bring up rehomeing the dogs with husband he gets sad and begs me not too.

"AITA because I told my husband I want to return my expensive birthday gift? My husband and I both have birthdays in January. We don't give each other Christmas presents so this is the only time of the year we buy gifts for each other.  Last year my husband really wanted to buy himself an expensive big curved monitor for his birthday.  I am not a tech person and don't care about electronics.  I thought it was stupid and a waste of money and I told him so.  I also told him to go ahead and get it since it's his birthday and it's what he wanted.  He floated the idea of getting me a Dyson Air wrap for my birthday (which would have been a comparable price to the monitor).  That year he was sick on my birthday so we couldn't go out to dinner and then when I opened my presents he had gotten me a few items that definitely came from Amazon that were aligned with my interests and would have honestly been good gifts if I hadn't been expecting something big like the Dyson he had floated to me.  I ended up getting pretty upset, which I am ashamed of, and he felt bad and it was not a good day.  Flash forward to this year.  He told me he wanted a towel warmer and sent me the one he wanted.  I bought it, even though I think it's stupid because it's his birthday and he can get whatever he wants.  I told him very clearly that if he needed an idea for me I would like some nice gold hoop earrings.  They didn't need to be expensive, I just wanted something that I can wear on a regular basis and not tarnish.  My birthday was this week and when I opened my gift, he had gotten me a big expensive curved monitor, similar to the one he had gotten himself last year.  He told me I would love it and went into my office (I work from home) and got it all set up for me.  He was really excited.  Today I tried to use my desk and I hate it.  I have a standing desk and the monitor is too tall so I have to crane my neck to look up.  I told my husband my new set up isn't working and he told me I need to get rid of my stupid standing desk and I never use it anyway.  I lost my temper and told him I like my standing desk and I didn't want the monitor and I didn't ask for it and he just decided I needed it even though I don't.  I asked if we can return it and he was clearly really sad. I feel like a huge a hole because now 2 years in a row I've been upset about my birthday gift and know he was excited to give me this gift but its literally making working at home uncomfortable and I liked my old set up as it was.

"AITA for wearing noise canceling headphones in my parents house that has zero insulation between the floors? I’m a 31F living in my parents townhouse till the end of the year. Through a series of unfortunate events, I had to pack my life up and take a hard pivot in my career. I’ve been living here in the basement since November 2022, and the house is small. There is no door to the basement so I hear everything on all two floors above me. Conversations, footsteps, doors opening and closings, zoom meetings, etc. When they walk across the house, it sounds like elephants walking, and when they drop something, it makes me jump. I’m in a very difficult post-doc research program, and it’s so stressful that I wear noise canceling headphones throughout the day and at night to try to stay focused (ADHD is kicking my ass) and even get sleep. Also, working from home sounds easy breezy beautiful but not when your reporting to over 8 different department and constantly getting emails, IMs, phone calls, alerts, etc. Again, ADHD kicking my ass and overstimulation is killing me. 

My dad thinks I’m being rude by wearing my headphones all the time when I go upstairs to get food or use the bathroom. He’s claiming I’m being unchristian (he’s a pastor and I’m just spiritual) and I need to reach out to them more.

"AITA for wanting to sit near my partner but also do my own thing for 5 minutes? So this isn’t the biggest thing, but I do feel a little crazy trying to figure out why this seems so unreasonable to my partner. 

I (30nb) came out of the office room after work last night and sat near my partner (34m) and we interacted for a bit, then I told him I wanted a few minutes on my phone to ask a new acquaintance about work opportunities because we are in similar fields. My partner kept trying to get my attention to show me videos and I kept saying I was in the middle of talking to someone and needed 5 minutes. He ended up leaving the room and said that he would leave me alone if that’s what I wanted. 

I feel upset about this because I wanted to be near him after a hard day, and an even harder month (lots of things are going wrong for us rn and we have both been sick for like a month straight), and I felt like it’s not a lot to ask to be near someone but not necessarily interacting for 5 minutes. It would be comforting to me. 

He says he doesn’t understand that at all, and that if he doesn’t want to interact with someone, then he wants to be completely alone and that he doesn’t understand at all where I’m coming from. 

Am I the asshole for wanting to be on my phone for 5 minutes while I sit with him before I am ready to interact? Is it normal to only be with people when ready to interact and I just don’t get it? 

I just want a broader perspective on this. We both apologized this morning, but I still want to understand for the future to avoid these situations

"WIBTA Extravagant Bachelor Party My male cousin (T) is getting married to a lovely young woman - they are a great match. My brother has been asked to stand as a groomsman; a sweet gesture and a role my brother happily accepted. My immediate and closely extended family are all planning on attending T's wedding.

Some background: T is marrying into marrying into an *extremely* wealthy family. His future father-in-law made savvy investments in fast-food franchising and the family's wealth has skyrocketed within two generations. T's future in-laws are wonderful people - but they live very lavishly. The upcoming wedding is no exception to this practice. 

This is a destination wedding, black tie, and takes place over multiple days. The venue is isolated and the only feasible lodging is the luxury hotel in which the wedding will take place. I am growing concerned by the amount of money my brother and the other members of our family are spending to ""keep up with the Joneses"", as it were.

So far...

- My mom and sister gave a shower gift valued at around $300.-

- My immediate family of 4 have booked flights and accommodation to the tune of 4500.- each

- This is a black tie affair, so my dad and brother have rented tuxedos and my mother and sister need evening gowns (I am not attending)

I understand that these things are part and parcel of accepting a wedding invitation and I'm providing this info to paint a complete picture of the situation, but it irks me how out of touch this all seems when I look at the bigger picture. I'm grateful that my parents can afford this and they've entered into it with full knowledge of the financial outlay required.

My hackles are raised, though, by what's being asked of my 30 year old brother as part of the wedding party.

As a groomsman he's been invited to join T's bachelor party. My brother is a good-time guy and I know that him being there is important to my cousin. It would be hurtful and disruptive to our family dynamic if my brother didn't attend. However, my brother just sent an itinerary of the bachelor party and I am gobsmacked at the amount of money he's being asked to spend.


Here's what T has planned for his bachelor weekend:

*T's Bachelor Party Kiawah*

*Golf*
Cougar Point - $195
Turtle Point - $195
Osprey Point - $195
Ocean Course - $525
Total - $1,110

*Transportation*
Van - $127

*Accommodation*
Charleston Hotel - $121
Kiawah Deposit - $166
Kiawah House - $1,100

*Travel*
Flight - $500

*Total*: $3,130

So, Reddit, bearing in mind my family's already considerable monetary contribution and the fact that the above total doesn't include food/drink/or the additional costs my brother will incur from the wedding itself (flight, hotel, tux, gift), am I the asshole for thinking that _the bride's wealthy family should be covering at least *part* of this bachelor clishmaclaver_? 

P.S. If you believe I'm not the asshole, I'd really appreciate your advice on how to broach this subject (if at all)",0.91
"AITA for telling my brother’s gf to break it up or at least stop coming to family events? My brother (m29) and his girlfriend (f29) have been together for about year and a half and ever since the beginning of the relationship they had issues. She kicks him out of the apartment at least once a month (he pays half the rent and everything), from month 5 they were going to couples therapy, and fight about bs on pretty much daily basis.   
I met her at a family event, which we do every so often and she did not make a good first impression.  
Since I’m very close to my brother and don’t believe people are bad after first impression I made the effort to get to know her and their relationship. So I became the advocate for them. I tried to talk down people in the family to try giving her a chance. After couple months they started to include me in their fights, she made hours long phone calls to me, talked shit about my brother which I don’t appreciate (I’m very well aware that he is nowhere near perfection but I don’t need to hear all that). I heard her and his side of things, money issues, sex issues, just everything - most of which I never wanted to know tbh. I don’t believe that either of them is bad, I just really think that they’re toxic for each other.   
Family events never got better either. When he was at them with her barely talks to anyone and is behaving like her little puppy. When he’s alone he blabbs about how bad it is so we all know how unhappy he is. Plus whenever it’s an event that collides with something of her family they go to hers and do what she likes.  
So coming to events of last night. It was celebration of my sister’s finishing of high school. It’s kind of like a prom but with families and friends, all dressed up and fun. Bro and his gf showed up 2 hours late after not picking up the phone all day and by the looks of it it was because of another fight.   
He spent most of last week sleeping on a friend’s couch and I refused talking to the gf on the phone, my cup of patience and understanding was overflowing for months already. She yet again made him to jump around her all evening, if he didn’t do something at the time she wanted she threw a fit and looked like she ate half a lemon. It was honestly uncomfortable for everyone and what pisses me off the most is they again made this event that we were excited for for months about their relationship. When they left for home (after she didn’t like the venue of the afteparty and made some sour comments) my sister started crying that she just wanted her brother back. That he doesn’t look happy and doesn’t even have fun with us or talk openly at all when she’s around. And that was it for me. I was done with that relationship. I texted both - my brother and his gf. I told them that I don’t appreciate how they make every event about their business and that I honestly think that the relationship is never going to work and should end it. Or at least stop going to our family events together.",0.2
"AITA for snapping at my friend who made jokes about my dad who passed away? I (16F) just lost my dad to cancer a few days ago. Two of my friends, A and B have been supportive. They’re both fans of dark humor. We were sharing some edgy memes, and A said that they had some dark jokes about me. In response I said “say it, I dare you” in response to insinuate that I didn’t want the jokes. However I wanted to see if they really had the nerve to say it, so I said “say the jokes”. The jokes were “dark humor is like dads, some people don’t have them” and then they said “hey at least you can get into any college now.” I got pissed and asked what she was thinking. I asked her to give me some space and we didn’t talk for a day or so. I discussed it with B, and then B talked to A about what happened. A apologized to me and said she was a jerk, that it’s hard to detect when it’s appropriate because I cope with humor, and that I didn’t deserve what they did. I responded with “I agree” but never specified what because I wanted her to interpret it. A sent B those messages and B messaged me saying that I went way too far, and that A didn’t mean anything. I was “asked” to apologize and speak to A, so I did and now they think everything is okay.  I felt like I was backed into a corner by two of my closest friends but I’m beginning to think that I was the bad person. AITA?",0.75
"AITA for refusing to remind my partner of his deadlines? My partner (28)M and I (30) F live together with our dog and bought our first house together almost 2 years ago now. 

A little background - my work hours are 9-530 and he is usually 8-3pm. I work in a people facing job and I have to answer queries and solve problems all day with the general public, and he works on his own in construction. I order all groceries, household items, and toiletries on a regular basis, I also hoover and mop, clean the kitchen and bathroom, do all the laundry and putting away and changing of linen in the house. He does on occasion empty the dishwasher and put the bins to the curb on bin day. 

Now. 

We both make a payment to one of my family members every month, this is to pay for money lent to us. I pay this monthly as I get paid monthly and he chooses to pay the same day as myself; although he gets paid weekly. For the last (almost) two years, I have reminded him every time to do it, and every month - yet I still get a message from my family member saying the payment is late. So, last month they finally exchanged numbers - my partner and family member - so I took that as okay, they have a line of communication no need for me to be nagging several days before I get paid and on payday (bare in mind when I do ask him I get fluffed off and he doesn’t seem to have any urgency or thanks for me reminding him). I get a text from him today annoyed at me because I didn’t remind him to pay his monthly payment, and i need to be a better part of our “team”.

I got this text at work, and if I wasn’t at work I would have LOST IT. The actual audacity. I know it seems like such a trivial thing but every month I have to nag him and it still doesn’t get done on time. I’ve asked him to create a repeating reminder in his phone calendar 10000000 times and he refuses. 

I’m at the point now where I’m so angry he doesn’t see that I do SO much head work to keep our home clean and running efficiently without being asked, but ONE task I ask him to take care of himself and I get this attitude. 

So am I the a**hole for refusing to remind my partner to pay his bill?",0.02
"AITA for not hanging out with my stepson?   
My husband and I were married for 1 year now and he has a son jason 19 in college. His son lives in dorms mostly and sometimes comes to our house and sometimes goes to his moms house. We have a pretty fine relationship not close but not on bad terms either like we’re fine imo for our situation.   
Now my husband asked me to go out for a hangout with his son and I was kinda weirded out? Like okay here’s a thing I know marrying my husband meant his family is now mine and all but I still see no reason for us to hangout alone. I asked my husband why he wants that and he told me so that Jason and I build a close bond like mother and son….first of all jason doesn’t even hangout with his own bio mother as much as I know he’s not a mama’s boy and let’s be realistic I cannot be a mother a boy who met me when he was 17 and didn’t even live with me + has a living mother.  
So I told my husband I really don’t like the idea and that me and Jason could get close through family dinners and events instead of setting up something for just the 2 of us specifically. Like I am sure jason would prefer a hangout with his friends or his bio mother or father before me. But my husband is saying that I am not trying to even involve myself in the family and is now mad.",0.2
"AITA as I didn't go home for Christmas break? I (18M) attend college four hours away from home. This is my first year as a college student, and during the first semester, I have come to the realisation that it's either I've been too reliant on my Mom and dad, or they've been ""overprotective"" of me. Before moving away for college, I relied on my parents for everything; I depended on them. I didn't know how to cook, clean, look after my money, or handle any situation I got into. I went to my parents to get me out of this. 

When I arrived for college, I didn't realise how tough it was to be alone; I always wanted my parents. I quickly realised I needed to grow up and be independent. I've now learned to look after my money, pay my bills, and stay organised. I'm in the process of learning how to cook, but I'm in the burning everything phase. Now I love it, I'm independent and responsible for everything. I live on campus and my college allows students to stay during breaks. Two weeks before the Christmas break, I FaceTime my parents and let them know I'm not going home for the holidays; they laughed for so long. I explained I'm serious and I'm staying. Since then I explained to them numerous times I'm not coming home for the holidays. This was my first Christmas away from my parents and I loved it. It's the first Christmas in ages that I enjoyed.

My parents were pissed at me for not coming home for the holidays, they're still pissed of with me and they're treating me like shit because I didn't come home even though I warned them plenty of times. Was I the asshole for not coming home for the holidays?",0.45
"AITA for not shoveling my shared yard? I (24F) rent the top half of a duplex, and my neighbor (60ishM) rents the bottom half. We live in an area where we get a lot of falling leaves, snow, etc., and we're responsible for jointly maintaining the sidewalk and driveway.

The problem is that my neighbor pretty much always does this stuff before I have the chance! If snow falls overnight I'll usually get up and shovel out before I leave, but I'm often at work for 12+ hours, and if there's less than an inch of snow I usually just leave it, planning to shovel it when I get home that night. Probably 90% of the time he's already done all the work, including my half, by the time I'm home to do my part. 

I've told him multiple times that he can leave my parts of the walkway/driveway until I get home (he'd still be able to get in and out just fine if my areas are still snowy), but he keeps doing it anyway. To be honest, he's also a little bit... chatty, and I feel kind of not great about the fact that I'm now indebted to him for doing all of this work before I'm able to get to it.

"AITA - my roommate says i should be the one to pay for a new trash can. i (21f) live in an off-campus house with two other roommates. this conversation happened between one of them (22f). 

a few weeks ago my boyfriend was over and he stepped on the trash can pedal to open the lid, and a piece of the plastic broke off. the lid now opens halfway. not all the way like it did before, but it still works perfectly fine. i told my roommate what happened and she insisted on getting a whole new trash can. i told her the one that we have now works fine, but if she wants to get a new one than i will pitch in on it. 

the trash can is just a regular step pedal trash can. she said that it was a few years old, it also has some rusting on it. it was bound to break at any point and one of us could have just as easily broken it had we stepped on it too hard. they’re not meant to last forever.

she sent me a $65 trash can that i thought was entirely too expensive, but ultimately i was willing to split it between the three of us (me, her, and our third roommate). 

a few nights ago she texted me and this conversation happened:

she asked if i could send her money for the trash can and said it’s $45. i divided this by 3 and sent 15. she told me that i was mistaken and i owe her $45. her reasonings for me paying this is because my boyfriend was the one who broke it and it was hers that she brought from her previous apartment. she said she was “being nice” for even offering to pay $15 for it. she also said that she wasn’t going to ask our third roommate to pay at all because it wasn’t her fault that it broke. she claimed that the one that we have now she paid $60 for, but i found the exact one at walmart for $35 so i believe this was a lie. 

i responded to her with my reasonings: i ultimately told her i will send her $15 more ($30 total) because that is what the value of the trash can we have now is. i am completing an internship and not working at the moment, so $45 is not something i want to spend my limited money on to simply throw our garbage away. i’d just be paying for an upgraded trash can that she would ultimately keep when we move out. i also don’t see why it’s not fair for our third roommate to pitch in if she wants an upgraded trash can, because it’s a shared item that we all use in the home. i could ask my boyfriend to send some money for it, but i don’t think my boyfriend should have to pay for it at all personally. at the end of the day, he doesn’t live here, and it was just an accident that happened from regular wear and tear to a trash can. 

i sent her the money but her and i haven’t spoken since this - she’s been ignoring me at home. AITA in this situation?",0.5
"AITA for not contributing more to a team pizza party? I (32F) am a supervisor in the healthcare field. I supervise a team of 12. I have a coworker who I'll refer to as T. T also supervises a team of 12 and we are under the same managerial umbrella with our manager, who I'll refer to as L. Between us we have about 24 employees, although some work remotely. We are fairly close knit and work well along side each other.  

there have been a lot of promotions and movement in our company lately, and recently a member from each of our teams were promoted to supervisor. It's a fairly small company so everyone knows everyone.  In order to celebrate and recognize this achievement for both our team members, T and L decided to order pizza for our two teams. We often do this kind of thing but we always collaborate and discuss it before pur heading or ordering anything  I was not asked or consulted this time until after they decided to do this, when T messaged to tell me they had bought pizza and did I want to participate. I replied yes, sure, since I knew that they had already ordered for both our teams and would be too much for just her team, both in terms of the amount of money and food. 

T goes out and comes back with 10 pizzas, from a nicer Italian restaurant. We ended up having about 15 employees present. It was so much food and we ended up having about half of it left over. During the party I sent T $25 via venmo to help cover the cost. I did not eat any, although my team did. 

When I got back to my desk I saw a message from T that I had not seen previously, stating that the pizza was $150 and we could split it between the three of us. I was surprised they had spent that much, as previously when we have done pizza parties we do a cheaper restaurant like little Caesars or Domino's.

 If T asked me before ordering I would have told her not to order from there and that it was too much to spend. However, she and L did all of this at the last minute without talking or asking me about it until it was done. 

Now I am wondering if I amTA here for not sending T more money to cover. I am really strapped for cash right now and honestly even the $25 was not something I had budgeted for. I could explain this to T and L but I don't want them asking questions about my finances, and it's also quite frankly no one else's business what I choose to spend money on.",0.64
"AITA - My (38F) boyfriends (36M) dad says horribly offensive stuff in front of my kids (7 and 9) and we had a blowout because of it. I honestly can’t tell if I’m over reacting or not but here goes. I have two kids (girl - 7, boy - 9) and recently I’ve started introducing them to my boyfriend’s parents. Now, boyfriend’s dad has no filter. There is nothing he will not say. They were over at our house yesterday and we were sitting at the kitchen table with my daughter before we left to go to a restaurant for dinner. 

 He was saying the most vile things. Terribly racist, homophobic, sexist jokes. Every swear word you can imagine, the N word, all of it. Boyfriend is laughing, swearing, going along with it. I end up taking my daughter out of the room and keeping her busy until we go out to eat.

 We get to the restaurant. He openly mocks my 9 year old son, tells him he’s a girl because he has long hair, and because he’s a girl does he wear a training bra. Makes jokes about my daughter playing hockey and how girls can’t play sports. Everyone is laughing except me, my son, and daughter. I’m desperately making comments to try and diffuse.  At one point he asks me to describe how tight the ass was of a woman who I had been referencing in a story… on and on with this stuff. 

I get home and I can’t sleep all night. I’m so mad at myself for not calling it out, for not saying something while it was happening. I texted my Bf, I said going forward I’m gonna keep the kids out of his families stuff, it’s not my style, I don’t want the kids around it… whatever. A huge fight follows, he says it’s just the way he is, that he has good intentions, he doesn’t mean anything by it. He says it’s my responsibility to teach the kids that different people exist, that they need to learn that that’s how some people are and that’s the way it is. I say no, it’s my job to protect my kids now, to show my daughter that she doesn’t need to tolerate “old creepy men” that say offensive things just to avoid making people uncomfortable. That my son shouldn’t have to put up with a grown man marking jokes at his expense and have adults laugh at him when he can’t defend himself.

 I ask him why he isn’t as mad as I am that his dad is saying that stuff so freely around kids. Why isn’t he angry that his dad is making horrible sexual comments to his son’s girlfriend. I say that any adult that says such vile things so freely around small children is a piece of shit. I know that it’s hard for my boyfriend to feel like I’m attacking his dad, but it makes me so angry and I really think he is a disgusting man. 

I’m very open to advice and opinions. We are on the verge of breaking up over this!

Edit to add: I’m quite literally reading every single comment and it’s making me emotional to have so much validation that I was right in setting this boundary.  I’m pulling pieces from each response and it makes me feel so confident in what I’ve done, and how I can move forward in conversations with my kids about what happened and how I’m going to fix things with them. 

I’m in a good position. I own my house and it’s just me and the kids. Boyfriend lives on his own and only sleeps over when the kids are at their dads. I have no problem leaving a bad relationship behind me, I think I was convincing myself that I was over reacting and crazy. Thanks to these comments I know that I’m not. ",0.17
"AITA for being insensitive to my boyfriend’s insecurities? I 20F have been dating Kai 21M for 6mo. We met via a mutual friend and hit it off instantly. I introduced him to my friends a few weeks ago, and we all got on. 

For Christmas, we got a couples quiz that we decided to do today that asked things to get us to be closer. When we got to the question of first kiss, I told him my first kiss was was best friend’s brother Matt. 

I had a crush on Matt when I was 14 and he was my first kiss after a game of spin the bottle. I don’t like him romantically anymore and we have been friends ever since and nothing happened beyond that kiss.

I see him occasionally when I got home for holidays or birthdays as he still lives in my town but I go mainly to his house visit my best friend Vera as we go to different unis and it’s hard to meet up otherwise. 

Kai’s ex cheated on him and he told me previously that has left him with trust issues. I empathise with him and understand that it upset him but he asked me to see Vera only and distance myself from Matt.

My spouse informs me that we're going to have dinner at his mother's house, and when I asked if it was her request, he said that it was not, but rather that we've been swapping (which in my mind, is purely coincidental). I stated that I prefer to see my mum last as my sister works as a nurse and gets off at 7pm, and I hardly ever see her, as her weekends for work is the weekend we visit (and we cannot swap due to personal reasons).

Along with this, one of her MOH’s dropped out and the decision on the bridesmaids dress were decided short noticed as well. I feel for my friend as she has had to cram 6 months of wedding planning into 1.

Sandra has a YouTube channel with cringey edits and capcut filters, and she has pathetic jokes and roasts.

Sandra told me that her (13) subscribers didn't like her character and wanted an anime-style animation with fire in the background. Drawing the animation was time-consuming and required over 100 hours of work. I faced constant harassment from Sandra, who texted me all day and night, constantly spammed me and sent notes in class.  
On the last day before the Christmas holidays, I had to go to the hospital for teeth removal, so I couldn't send the animation to Sandra. When I later checked my emails on my mom's phone, she sent me texts asking for the animation, saying her fans couldn't wait any longer (it had been a week since she last posted), and even changing the name of one of our group chats to ""Fuck you."" I deleted the animation in rage and later asked one of my other friend to ask Sandra unblock me.  
The next day, I asked her to unblock me, and she did. I told her that I wouldn't draw for her anymore and that her hate towards me over a drawing was pathetic. She promised to do it herself (and later deleted all her videos. lol)

So in my family, onsens (bath houses) are an extremely important part of our culture and they are something I have never got to experience before. My mom and sister tell me how amazing the experience is and how relaxing these places are. 

There is just one issue, you can’t wear any clothes at all and the majority of these baths are public. This would not be an issue for me if I wasn’t trans (MTF). My Mother won’t let me use the women’s onsen because of an incident that happened in my hometown in California with a public bath house. 

So I would have to use the men’s onsen which I am terrified to use. For more context I am well into my transition and I think the sight of me, someone with breasts would not go well in a men’s bath house.

"WIBTA if I don’t tell my roommate I’m keeping my stuff? My roommate and I do not get along. We were friends, then she started acting like a bully and did not like being called out on it/generally treating me like her maid and chef. 

I am moving out soon, my roommate knows I am actively looking for another place with my boyfriend. 

I am excited to move in with him and finally feel less anxiety around coming home. 

The problem is idk if I have to tell my roommate I’m keeping my stuff, even if not having it would make her life hard. 
My boyfriend says she didn’t contribute to buying it, so I don’t have to tell her I’m keeping it. 

My stuff includes all kitchen appliances , dishes, pots and pans, silverware, etc. except a keurig and a cheese grater, a few mugs and a plate and bowl.

 Literally everything else that would go in a kitchen is mine. 
Dining table and chairs? Mine. 
Trash cans? Mine. 
Shower head? Mine. 
All cleaning products? Mine. 
Paper towels and toilet paper? Mine. 
Rugs? Mine. 
Wall art? Mine. 
Cat tree her cat uses in a shared space? Mine. 
Cat toys I bought for my cat that hers uses? Mine. 

I also don’t feel I need to tell her, but my reasoning is every time I try to clarify something with her she just rolls her eyes and says “I figured”, so idk if I need to? Obviously if she thinks an item is hers we can talk about it but I also outright own all of the above. 

So wibta if I just don’t tell her I’m keeping stuff? And just let her know my move out date and take everything?

Edit:  the WiFi is fully paid for by me, in my name. She does not contribute to it at all. I pay WiFi + half of electric/heat. When we first moved in, I took the shitty shower head off and put a better one on. I wouldn’t leave her with no shower head. 

I tried to tell her 8 months ago that I was keeping my appliances/pans when I moved, and to please be gentle with them, and she said “we’ll see about that.”

The reason I’m asking is because I genuinely believe she thinks she’s keeping some of my stuff and gets upset when I try to clarify anything so I’m kind of stuck. 

A couple of you have said it’s shitty to take the WiFi and I don’t understand how if it is literally mine. I pay it by myself. She laughed when I asked to split it. 

Edit 2: I’m not leaving her showerheadless, I’m putting the original back up.

so since i do not have my own car yet we go basically everywhere together, we were going grocery shopping when i was picking out a few meal ideas for myself since my mom uses the reason “i don’t get your baby bonus anymore so you need to start supporting yourself a little bit.” 

so i do as she says and start doing my own grocery shopping whenever she goes to get her and my little sister groceries. 
Fast forward to my mother and I going to checkout and she reaches into my cart and puts them in hers, i ask what’s she’s doing and she replies with “i’m helping you” (she’s never done this before) but i immediately know she means she’s going to help me pay for my groceries, i push down my surprised reaction and say thank you, we finish our grocery shopping and go home.

fast forward a few days and i come down to her making dinner, i peak around and see that’s she’s cooking the meal she took out of my grocery cart and paid for, i ask why she’s cooking it when i picked it out for my groceries and she simply replies with “i paid for it.” which i know she’s right but does she even have a right to? considering i was going to pay for it myself and no one would have even touched it.

"AITA for asking one of my teachers to close the window alittle because i was cold? So I was sitting in class (where I sit is in front of the window) doing work and today was really cold and I get too cold way to easily. The room was nice and warm so I didn't mind it until out of the blue I was shivering and felt too cold and I saw one of the windows open, so I asked one of my other teachers that I'm getting too cold can they please Close the window alittle so I be too cold. They said yea but as soon as they almost did it one of my main teachers complained with some of my classmates that is too hot.  But here's the thing they all had sweaters on and again the room wasn't hot it was warm so I had to sit there extremely cold while doing my work",0.17
"AITA for making my students feel uncomfortable or “forced” to do something in my classroom? I, 27 F, am a high school acting teacher. We have been doing a project where I am preparing my students to audition for a college/professional audition process. I act as a judge, and each day a few students choose to perform. The rest of the students in the class who are not auditioning that day sit against the wall and act as an audience. Today, things were a little shaky. At the beginning of the period, I noticed one of my students had something in his mouth (for context: I told them not to eat during this process) and I asked him what it was. He is one of my best students, so I was surprised that he would be disobeying the rules. He responded that he was chewing gum, and I told him that he could not do that and I made him spit it out. He reached for his pocket, saying he was getting a napkin, to which I told him do it over the trash can. He shuffled to the trash can on his knees, and I said “do you not have legs?” I understand that this might seem rude, but we have a good connection, and also, it was inappropriate during our “college auditions.” 

Then, we got through about two auditions smoothly before something else happened that students got upset about. For auditions, we play characters to simulate the reality that you will most likely not know the people you audition for. My co-worker, 38 F, another acting teacher, was playing a laid back, male, tech intern. It was between auditions that “he” was talking to the “audience” and jokingly called one of them “hot.” This erupted a roar of laughter in some children, but I could tell some kids were uncomfortable, as that student was only fifteen.

The third and final incident that upset people today was that I “forced” someone to do a trick. Today was the last day of performance auditions, and next class we have dance auditions. Deciding to get a head start, we allowed the children to show off a special physical skill. Lots of them proceeded to come up and do cartwheels or tricks adjacent to that. One of my students did a very good trick and started to return to his seat. He is also one of my best students, and very good friends with the student who was chewing gum. I am also pretty close with this student. Knowing that he was adept at a certain trick that he chose not to show off, I stopped him and asked if there was anything else he would like to do, while staying in character, where I didn’t know him. He proceeded to say no, so I continued to ask until he did the trick. To be fair, after he did it, I responded “oh… okay.” He returned to his seat and mumbled something to his good friend. I asked him what he said, and he replied “I just said that I’m nervous, but it was obvious that he was covering for something.

"AITA for tossing a girl im dating a piece of gum instead of handing it to her? Title nearly explains it all. I (M20) have been going out with this cute girl (F21). She grew up much different than me and I am still getting to know her. She once explained how when she grew up it’s customary to offer someone else first bite and whatever you’re about to eat before eating yourself. I’m not sure how much this helps but she is Mexican-American and I’m African-American. 

One day we were hanging out and I whip out a pack of gum then ask her if she’d like a piece. She says sure and I tossed one her way. I have always been “playful “ (?) with girls I’ve dated or been in serious relationships with it’s just my personality but she gave me the stick back saying she doesn’t like things being thrown at her.

Confused I took the gum back and offered to hand it  to her and she still refused so I just put it away. Later on she tells me that was a turn off for her. I felt like she was over reacting but I acknowledge she grew up in a “no-nonsense” household and I very much did not. AITA?",0.07
"AITA for not being calling my PARENTS by thier job titles? Before I even begin, yes, they're my biological parents, unfortunately. Although I resemble almost no one from my family, somehow, I'm related. Not sure tho I never took a dna test??

Simply put, they think me not adressing them properly is absolutely disrespectful, what did I address them as? She or he.

during and argument, if I mention anyone of them as she/he, I get told I'm being absolutely disrespectful, example, if I'm talking to my dad, and I call out mom as ""she did this/that"".

Now I do call them mom/dad, but pronouns slip as this has always been the way I communicate with ppl? But if I do so with my parents, suddenly I have to call them mr/ms, or by thier job titles like dr.

""It's your mom/dad"" or ""We're your parents, how dare u call us this way, she or he? Did we not raise you well enough?"" I'm sorry? Listen I may be living under a rock, lacking in the head, or something but idk the sick new parenting ways parents got. BUT THIS. THIS. ticked in a place I didn't  know I could be TICKED, I don't like it and you HAVE to stop IT.

They stir the argument towards that always, rather than discussing the actual point.

I can't be the only one thinking this is too much, and idk if I'm the only person running thru this issue. Do other parents do this? I'm not even talking to them, well I can't completely do that, but I avoid them as much as I can. I almost never leave my room.

Am I really mannerless? I find it hard to believe.

"AITA for lying to my boyfriend so my boyfriend asked me to throw away my dildo. It might sound really bad but I fully understand where he is coming from. This is our first proper relationship and obviously that will come with many insecurities and jealousy issues. But when he asked me to throw it away I was really hesitant and I decided to keep it. I had told him I threw it away when in reality it still lived in my top drawer. About a month and half later he wanted to grab something from the drawer and he opened it, the dildo was the first thing he saw. He grabbed his jacket to leave but I stopped him and I explained that I kept it due to a joke me and my friend had about the dildo (the joke has nothing to do with my boyfriend) and how sorry i was. I felt horrible about lying to him but now he is apologising to me although I really dont feel like he should be the one apologising. I understand why he didn't feel comfortable with me owning one and now I feel like an asshole for not throwing it away sooner.",0.2
"AITA for being upset when BF doesn’t stick to his time frame? So me and my bf been going back and forth about this problem for a while. Me and him usually see each other at least once a day, to eat together, hang out, etc. He has a habit though, when he goes out with his friends or goes to work, he’ll tell me he should be done by a specific time so we can hang out after or go out to eat. Sometimes he’ll say he’ll be be done in a hour or two, sometimes he’ll tell me a specific time. However, more than half the time he’ll always go beyond the time he told me. If he says one hour, it’ll actually be 2 maybe 3. If he says 7:00pm, I’ll end up seeing him after 8pm. Like today, he left with his friend around 4:30. At 6, he said he’ll be done in a hour and we will go out to eat. He ended up picking me up at 8. I told him I hate that he gives me a time and makes me wait longer, but he feels like I shouldn’t take the times he gives seriously. Most of the time I’m waiting for him, expecting for us to go out to eat like we always do. However, when he ends up being later then the time he gave me, I’ll tell him my frustrations on how I’m hungry and it’s messed up to always give me a time and never stick to it, but he feels like I shouldn’t expect him to show up at the EXACT time he says and I should expect him to be later then the time he said. And that if I’m really hungry, I should just eat without him. I personally don’t like that, especially when I’m hungry waiting for him to pick me up expecting for us to eat together and have quality time but a hour or more goes by and he’s finally getting to me. He makes it seem like I’m wrong for feeling some type of way. AITA?",0.08

"AITA for not telling my wife I haven’t healed yet Just as the title says. I [29M] have been married to my amazing wife [28F] since we were 23 and 24. She is the sweetest soul ever and I was blessed to meet her. The problem is, I- as much as I hate to admit it- struggled, and still do- with same sex attraction. About a month into our relationship, I made sure to tell her about my struggles so that she knew going into it. I felt as if it was only fair to tell her. I mostly stayed at home, but slowly felt myself getting hard at the thought of men again. I don’t want all this “it’s okay to be gay BS” I get that, I just don’t want that lifestyle. You do you. My wife has been asking recently that we try for a baby, but I am absolutely, unfortunately mortified of getting in bed with her.

"AITA For getting frustrated with my wife for being late for dinner every night I cook So my wife thinks I'm being an asshole for getting frustrated because she's always late for dinner whenever I cook. I love cooking and I usually put quite a bit of effort into cooking and try to have dinner just coming off the stove right around the time she comes home. Every time it's 20 minutes late, sometimes an hour, sometimes 10.  Usually it's time sensitive stuff where I don't want it to get cold like a steak because they don't reheat well. 
She will always tell me the time she's out of work and it's only a 15 minute ride since we live in rural Maine with no traffic. I give myself a half hour window to have it ready. Shows up 30 minutes later because she stayed late, talking to someone. 
Tonight said she had to be out at 8:15 so I had dinner ready at 8:30. Get a text at 8:45 saying she just got out and was shooting the shit with the manager and will be home at 9. Cooked some really nice ribeye steaks and let them rest. By the time she got home everything was cold. 
It's not the end of the world for me but I feel like she's dismissive of how much it bothers me and the reason is bothers me so much is because I feel like she doesn't give a shit.

"AITA for telling my niece to ""keep it together until you can get the hell out""? I (42m) parted ways with my brother (42) a while ago based on differences of opinion, but he called me recently. He saw a video of his daughter (16) ""slandering and insulting"" him on her friend's podcast. Apparently she had been going behind his back and hanging out with people he didn't like for years. 

I parted ways with him when she was 5, and at that point she already liked me a lot more than him, and he wanted me to talk to her about respect. Before I was about to talk to her, he showed me the clip from the podcast in question, and his daughter said.

""Oh yeah I fucking hate my dad. Trash human, no like. He's kept me from learning about being a mechanic. He says a woman doesn't need a degree, just an apron and a cookbook.""

I asked if he really behaved like that, and his answer boiled down to ""Well, yeah.""

I said nothing, and waited until I met his daughter.

I told her: ""Move out as soon as possible. Your father is an absolute fool, and I wish I'd been here to correct him. When you've escaped, I'll support you as much as I can.""

"AITA for pranking my friend? My best friend since Kindergarten (15F) recently got mad at me (14F) for doing a prank where I texted her random pictures from my camera roll, sent a text that said give me 500 dollars or I will leak these (none of the pictures were of her, they were really random like a picture of my math notes) and then texted her from my friends phone that I lost my phone, so that she would think a random person had my phone. I ended it pretty quickly and told her it was a prank, but she got really mad at me, saying it wasn’t funny to her, and if I knew her then I should’ve known that. Except I didn’t know that. I found it funny and I thought she would too. She’s been ignoring me, even in group conversations with our other friends, and avoiding me in the halls. Since I couldn’t talk to her I apologized over text and she left me on read. We’ve never fought before, and I think that’s because i’m a very chill person who can take a joke and thinks pranks are really funny. I guess she’s a little more serious, and a he has said some stuff that, looking back on it wasn’t the nicest, and if I had said or done to her, she would get mad. Is this a double standard, or is it okay because we just have different personalities?

"AITA For Wanting The Higher Cut? My friend and I just had a small argument on how the payment for a job should be split.

She works for a restaurant that is in need of some content creation and social media management. She came to me for help, proposing that I take on this job. It's a decent chunk of cash and more than likely would be a recurring (monthly) check. She liaised with her boss, I created a proposal which she passed on and it seems like we're about to draft a contract with him.

My friend would like a cut out of my pay for the job and I don't mind, especially since more than likely, she would be the one passing instructions to me and not her boss. She wanted 50% because if it weren't for her, I wouldn't have gotten the opportunity. I acknowledge that but at the same time think it's a bit high. I know that she needs the money though, so I told her 35%. She was disgruntled but accepted. I thought I was fair since I will be doing all of the actual work.. content creation, design, video editing, monthly reports/analytics, while she would just be passing along instructions.

"AITA Nightmare MIL/Mom Hey y'all. 

Joint posting here from (27)M + (27)F married couple. 

This is a long one that could date back years but i'll try and stick to key details. Husband's Mother (i'll call her Jen) has been controlling and emotionally abusive for years. Husband does his best to reign her in when he can but nevertheless she persists. 

When we were going to get married Jen threw a temper tantrum over our honeymoon choice (husbands pick-- common honeymoon spot) because he picked a location that they promised to take him and his siblings to 10 years prior for a HIGH SCHOOL graduation present. Jen harassed us for months and yelled at wife about wedding over the holiday. 

A lot of her actions are rooted in insecurity. We are pretty confident she could be a diagnosed narcissist. Jen and her husband are still married and he enables her so he can have an easier life. 

Skip to now, said trip has been planned (probably out of spite) and is said to be ""their last hurrah"" with their kids (2 daughters and 1 son) despite the fact that they are all fully grown adults married with spouses and careers. Since planning this trip, which all children were reluctant to agree to, there was brief peace after a bumpy beginning of attempted boundaries (we get private rooms, we are allowed to get dinner as just a couple, price, etc). 

Now, a few weeks before the trip we are being harassed for (we kid you not) picking our seats on the plane. We paid an extra $200 to sit at the front of economy. We are still in the same section as everyone, just toward the front so we could have more leg room. They are now going behind our backs to change our seats negating the extra $$ we paid. They are texting harsh words and have called to scream at us. 

This has escalated into other avenues and we have been repeatedly told to essentially ""shut up and take it"" because ""this is our vacation so you get no say in how it goes."" Jen also said that we are not allowed to talk about our honeymoon at all on the trip because it would take away from her experience of experiencing it with us. 

They mentioned sitting together one time months ago but never followed up. We picked seats because the email sent to us prompted us and wife was sitting alone while most of the family sat together (unintentional so they say). Will add that Wife also didn't want to sit with them because Jen has been known to harass and corner people when they can't escape. 

If they force us to sit with them, should they reimburse us?

We are paying $4K for this trip, which we have insurance on.

Are we being the assholes for not being sensitive to them for a sentimental trip they wanted to take/about the seats?

AITA for telling my sister I won’t attend her wedding if I’m not a bridesmaid So my sisters getting married in two week and ever since we could remember we promised each other we would be each other’s bridesmaids. So i had already had my wedding 2 years ago and she was my maid of honour. Fast forward I’m 31 and she’s 26 Getting married soon. I assumed I was going to be a bridesmaid because we had talked about it so much when we were younger. We were both at a cafe recently and I asked about the wedding and that’s when she told me list of her bridesmaids and I wasn’t on it. I asked about it and she said that I wasn’t on it because she wanted all her bridesmaids to be in there 20s and I was too old. I told her that’s ridiculous that I’m not a bridesmaid because I’m not in my 20s. She got mad at me for saying it’s ridiculous and stormed off and left. I texted her later saying I was sorry and was wondering if she could make an exception for me since I was her sister. She said no because she didn’t want to ruin the “aesthetic” of the wedding and I could come as just a guest. I was done with her at this point because she cared more about the looks of her wedding than her own sister. I then told her that if I wasn’t a bridesmaid I wouldn’t come at all.

John and Olivia both have cats and I only had one pet up until three days ago(a dog). The pet In question Is an African Lizard Gecko. Also we all have our own rooms and are all on the lease. 

Our lease states a three pet limit, but I spoke to landlord and reptiles aren't considered pets which means I could get one. I did not think I needed permission to get a reptile which would stay In my room 25/8.. but apparently I did. I did speak to them about It two weeks prior and they didn't seem to care, but three days later they now what to express why what I did apparently wasn't ok. 

They couldn't even get me a reason why my lizard Isn't ok other than ""I didn't get permission"".. They didn't even see It once. I don't see the problem. She stays In my room the entire day and she doesn't smell at all. Also the cats aren't affected as I don't even think they know about her..

"AITA for refusing to pay the property taxes? My brother (41m) & I (33f) inherited the family house in upstate NY from my mother 9 years ago.   When my mom became ill with a debilitating disease, I was living outside SanFran finishing up my 3rd year of school.  He had just married SIL, was expecting his firstborn, & living in Dayton.  

I dropped out of school & moved back to help her with her ADLs etc, getting a job in a deli to pay the bills.  My brother wasn't able to help because of 'professional obligations' as a HS teacher. After 3 years, Mom got a transplant but didn't survive the surgery.  Her only assets were the house (175k) and a 401k retirement fund w/ a 250k balance. Her will specified that the house be divided between the four of us (My brother, me & my two nephews, now 12/10) & my brother was the sole beneficiary of the 401k & will executor. 

I moved out of the house & almost immediately restarted my degree (chemistry). Circumstances for my brother changed; he found a new job & so moved into the house about a month after I left.  Because it became his primary residence, we didn't sell it. 

I was happy that it was to remain in the family. My great-great-great grandfather (on my mother's side) built it in the 1880s & it sits on a beautiful rural acreage overlooking a small lake. We agreed that my brother would pay for the insurance, upkeep & improvements & we would split the property-taxes 50-50 (which are substantial- NY y'all)

Fast-forward to this year. I've got a good job in San Antonio & am financially stable but in a very demanding position that leaves little time outside of work. I haven't been home in about 7 years. My brother & SIL spend all holidays with her family in Ohio & the few holidays that I was able to get off were spent with them there. 

They are struggling a bit financially & so I agreed to pay the property/school taxes this year to help them get back on their feet. I had explicitly told my brother that I planned to declare the taxes on my tax return to offset the burden. Declaring the payment would give me a $3500 tax break. 

Well, my brother called me out of the blue in November, frantic, because he impulsively paid the taxes & didn't have enough money in his account to cover it.  I told him that he was an asshole for doing that but venmo-ed the money nonetheless so that he wouldn't go into default. I spoke to my accountant who told me that because I didn't pay directly, I cannot legally claim the payment on my own return. I am highly suspicious that my brother orchestrated this so that he could have that benefit. 

Now, we have about $4000 due next month for the school taxes. I told my brother that it was out of my budget because of the tax loss.  I'm on a 1099 not W2 and will owe at least that much in April. TBH, if I ate rice/beans for the year, I might be able to swing it but it'll be tight. He has told the entire extended family that I'm the reason that the family home will have to be sold & I'm being ostracized by everyone for being selfish.

"AITA for crying over a marshmallow? this is going to sound so stupid but it just happened to me, and i'm starting to think that maybe it's my fault for overreacting and if i should apologize. i (27F) have been with my boyfriend (26M) for almost 2 years now, living together for a year. to make things easier i'm going to call my boyfriend James (fake name). i have been fighting a binge eating disorder for about half a year now and i'm still in recovery.

James works part time at a shop where recently, they decided to sell their newly released marshmallows series. he's taken a liking to the strawberry filled ones that come in individual wrappings for each piece in a big bag of about 40. he brought 2 bags of the strawberry filled marshmallows back home and i was pleasantly surprised since i was looking for a small sweet treat to help me manage my sweet cravings without it being too much, so individual marshmallows were perfect for me! i mentioned how happy i was that i could have something to help deal with sweet cravings and work on not binging so much, and thanked him for bringing them back as they could really help me for my binge eating recovery. James emptied the 2 bags of marshmallows into a snack container for storage purposes and that was that.

about a day later after lunch, i was craving something sweet and i went to the container to grab a marshmallow, only to realise it was empty. i asked James if he'd moved the marshmallows somewhere else and he just nonchalantly replied that he ate the entire container's worth yesterday night when he decided to stay up all night playing video games. i was really shocked and upset, and maybe it was the eating disorder in me speaking but i burst into tears and said he was very selfish and inconsiderate for eating everything without thinking to save me 1-2 pieces, especially after i mentioned they'd help me for my binging. he said it wasn't a big deal and that i was overreacting, and gave a quick apology and offered to buy them the next time he went to work. this is where i may have been the AH; i mentioned about how this situation really hurt me, everytime i snack or happen to acquire any yummy food that i know he likes, i think of him and leave a portion of it for him to enjoy later on as well. i'm always thinking about him and it's heartbreaking to know that he doesn't return the same courtesy to me. it's not so much about the marshmallows that i was sad about, but more so of me feeling neglected due to him being inconsiderate and not thinking of me when I always do so for him. when i tried to communicate this to James after calming down, he just casually replied that if I'm craving something sweet there's plenty of ice cream in the fridge for me to eat instead of being pissy about the marshmallows. This made me even more upset because James knows that ice cream is one of the binge foods I struggle with and his reply felt very insensitive and dismissive. I feel bad for ruining the day now because of a marshmallow, so Reddit, AITA?

Update: I apologized to him for my initial outburst and tried to explain how my eating disorder affected my way of thinking and how I would try to work harder on it, but he dismissed my apology and told me to be a normal person and quit having an eating disorder, it's not that hard. He got more angry when I told him that it would be nice if he could be more understanding and kinder when speaking about my ED, and lashed out at me and called me a burden. I think he's quite upset still, so I'll try approaching this conversation when things are more cooled down. Thank you for all the inputs so far, I'm aware I did overreact 🥹😅",0.88
"AITA this situation has me so down I have been married for the past 6 years and my life has been on a rollercoaster as of late. We are 32M she is 29F. My Marriage has completely imploded about 2 years ago and I have just been surviving it because I messed up. My wife called me while I was working a long shift repeatedly saying she was divorcing me and she is done. She packed up and left for about 3 days and I never recieved Divorce papers. Within those 3 days I used social media to vent off to other woman like a dumbass about my situation because I was so down on my Luck. I did call my wife a few times to no avail during that three day period ao I thought it was truly done. I get a call on the third day of her saying she went through my snapchat and Instagram and saw messages of myself and another girl from my job, no nudes were sent, but a lot of what-if conversations we had were shown. Since that day my wife came right back and we tried working it out again and still going for about 2 years and a half ago to now. She controls every aspect of my life from no social media, I cant hang out with friends and its still not enough because she said I cheated. My hobbies are now going home, getting yelled at for being a piece of shit and reading books. Ocassionally getting hit during intense arguements (rare that I will get slapped or pushed but it happens). She wants me to pick her or my family and Im just fueled by anxiety every day going to work in the office, and drive home to our apartment in the city. I have tried everything to fix what happened during those three days, but I am just so tired. I perhaps deserve to get hit and yelled at everyday for breaking her trust. Also, my family is so pissed at me because I have lost contact with so many of them the past few years, I have even had some die and I couldnt contact any of them. I feel alone with my crime books, but its all I have. I have never ever touched another woman but she is convinced Im a huge cheater and thats not me.

We have known each other for total of five years through our job where a mutual friend/coworker convinced us to start seeing each other. With Covid and how hard it was to date anyone, we decided it was the safest thing to do. We were already seeing each other at work all the time so might as well. We have very different families, very different lives and hobbies, but I truly can’t imagine my life without him. I’ve never been in a relationship that I wanted to put so much time and effort into improving. it has been more real than ever recently because I’ve introduced him to my very strict family who have their own very strict religious beliefs, and they have embraced him with open arms because he makes me so happy. I forgot to mention that aside from being employed at the job that we met at he also plays music, which is one of the only things that we have in common, and our love of music brought us together. He currently plays in a band with two girls and one of them I don’t like and the whole situation makes me very uncomfortable. I have told him this multiple times, and every time his response is the same, he tells me he loves me and that I’m the only person he wants to be with and this is a side job for him. The specific girl i’m talking about also has a crush on him which I found out about through a mutual friend, but my boyfriend just won’t stop playing music with her. I have asked my friends what they would do if they were in my situation but came up empty. SO AM I OVERREACTING???",0.89
"AITA for not allowing my parents to take away my sister's computer & track her finances? Disclaimer: I am not a native English speaker, so I may make mistakes here. All quotes here are translated to English.

Here's the issue. I (19M) am a college student who lives with parents and has a part-time job so that I have no need to ask parents for money. My younger sister recently turned 16, and she really wanted a new computer for her birthday. She was saving up for a new computer for a while now because she wants to do some gaming and her current computer is very old and slow.

When she asked me to help save up money about a year ago (since our parents have ""forgotten"" a few times when she gave them her money for safekeeping) and since she is still a minor, I opened a separate bank account in my name and gave her authorization to deposit and withdraw money when she needs it. She had saved up some money, but not enough for the computer, so I proposed an offer for her birthday: I would pitch in 50% of the computer cost as long as she contributed the other 50%. She was very happy with the offer, so we bought the computer and I helped her set it up.

When our parents saw the computer, they became furious. They demanded that I return the computer to the store, and I refused to do so as I believe that my sister needs her own decently fast and private computer. Now, they are threatening to throw the computer out of the house. I told them that I would agree to reasonable parental control restrictions and would in fact help set them up, but if they took it away, I would consider that theft. They also realized that my sister was using me as her safekeeper so they are now demanding access to the account I opened for her so that they are able to track the money. I immediately refused the request and told them my sister has a right to entrust her own money to anyone else and have money which is not trackable by them. Here's the moment where I think I might be an AH: I told them ""Maybe if you didn't 'forget' about her money and weren't control freaks, then she would trust you more"". My parents have told other relatives about the story, and most of them claim that I am the AH for disobeying my parents.

"AITA for cutting my bestfriends I cut my bestfriends because they told me I am being selfish for not hangging out with them.

It happened last year around January of 2023, but before that I quit my job because it is requiring me to work on site and I have 3 kids and its imposible for me to do that because unlike other countries having a car here in my country is luxury and the commute is so hard. I was so depress because I really wanted to have my own money and help my partner with the bills.

Because of this I avoided talking to people I always felt that I am not happy that I am alone even if I am sorrounded with people I love and who loves me. So I focused taking care of my family and bonding with them. I rarely go out and I am not on socmed that time.

We have a group chat and I felt its time for them to know what going on. I messaged them I poured my heart and the reason why I dont talk to them and that I felt sorry. One of my friend says that you need more people around you so you wont feel like that. I explained that I dont need people because even If I have people I felt alone. I explained that I needed time to process and heal because its overwhelming for me.

She kept on saying I needed them to the point I told her to back off and she doesnt have the rights to tell me what and what not to do. Then her last message is it okay not to be friends with me anymore.

I reached out to her and I said sorry but she answered me the same. Fast forward after a month I messaged her saying I miss her and she told me to fuck off I was hurt that i never talked to her again and eventually other friends we have because I just felt they like her more than me.

We are in one circle of friends out partners are friends since college, he even asked me if I am willing to talk to the person I told him damaged has been done. I dont want to associate myself with people who do not understand my mental struggle.

"AITA for Being Angry at My Sick Best Friend Several days ago, my best friend, Hannah, asked me to reschedule our hanging out from Sunday to Wednesday. Since I had no agenda, I agreed. 

On Tuesday, Hannah replied to my message on WhatsApp. We chatted and joked around. There was nothing wrong with her. She didn't tell me anything. 

On Wednesday, I decided to leave my home 2 hours early, because it is rainy season in my country. I left with motorcycle. If I didn't leave early and the rain fell, I would be late.

(For cultural context, I live in a country in Southeast Asia, so motorcycle is a common transportation mode)

Around 1 hour before meeting, Hannah texted me. She said that she was in severe pain since yesterday and asked for another reschedule. I was mad. I told her that while I understood her situation, she should've told me since yesterday. I mean, we literally chatted and joked around. 

Hannah apologized to me and said it was her mistake that she assumed she would get better. But, I said that it was not about assuming she would get better or not. It was about communication and telling, ""Hey, I am sick, can we reschedule again?"" while we joked around on WhatsApp a day before. I am no psychic who can read someone's mind.

Now, she won't talk to me.

"AITA for treating me the same way my boyfriend treats me during arguments and potentially causing a break up? im going to preface this by saying that i do feel bad for the original thing that caused the argument and that im using a new account cause i dont want anyone i know to see this.

last night my boyfriend (M21) and i (F20) were talking and i was seeing a lot of content online about men saying stuff like ""if my wife gets fat im leaving her"" which just made me concerned, so i asked my boyfriend a similar question being ""if i was \_\_\_ would you not have dated me?"" he kept tiptoeing around the question and not answering it and so i kept pushing and said i wouldnt be upset if he said no. he said he loved me as i am and i should of left it there but i kept asking and he snapped at me, swearing and told me to shut up and that when he tells me to stop i stop. 

i kind of found it silly to get mad over such a small thing and so i used one of the same tactics he used on me before where i just use humor and said ""whos a grumpy man"" he got pretty annoyed by that point and threatened to delete me off of social media which i said i wasnt going to argue with him over something so small and that if he wanted to talk to me about it he could, but i wasnt going to argue with him. he then proceeded to block me. 

he called me 10 minutes later and started talking about how terrible i am for not respecting him or his boundaries. i laughed at him and told me that he literally never respects any of my boundaries either, he promised me a long time ago that he will stop swearing at me and blocking me whenever there was an argument, i even tagged messages from  a few days ago where he literally was swearing at me and calling me a bitch or telling me to ""fuck off"" and how when i was really upset with him and blocked him once a while ago that he told me how i ""crossed the line"" and that we promised we wouldnt block eachother anymore when he does the same exact thing to me constantly over the smallest argument. even at the be beginning of our relationship i asked him to promise not to constantly threaten a break up after an argument and yet he still does it.

i brought this all up and told him he was acting like a hypocrite, he then blocked me once more and sent me a message on an alt account which i am blocked on too where he in a nutshell said that im using things from the past to try to paint him as the bad guy, i was acting spiteful and malicious and that i need to start acting like an adult or we are over. i sent him a message over the phone on something i wasnt blocked on and told him that i was sorry for overstepping his boundaries but the way that he acted towards me was horrible.

ever since then he hasnt messaged me or responded to any of my messages, i know that he is online cause i can see him playing games on his steam account but i have a feeling that he isnt going to message me back, it just seems silly to argue over a question when yesterday we were discussing moving in December",0.81
"WIBTA for booking a different MUA to the one the rest of the bridal party is using? Hi all, throwaway because my friends know my main. 

One of my school friends is getting married in March. We are all very happy for her and I hope she has a wonderful day and a happy marriage.

She asked me to be a bridesmaid and she’s actually been accommodating of my preference to remain covered so my gown is definitely more conservative than the other bridesmaids.

The problem comes last weekend when she took us to do a trial for the makeup. She’s kindly offered to pay for the MUA in part because she wants a uniformity between the Look.

The problem is that I am the only south Asian in the group. The MUA completely chose the wrong colour for me, and only me. It’s way too light and the undertone was quite pinkish. As soon as I saw it I was actually really upset because I looked awful.

She also put quite a lot of contour on my nose to I guess make it look thinner and more English?

I felt like a clown and I ended up washing my face in a toilet in the shopping centre when we went to have lunch afterwards.

I thought maybe I could ask my friend to let me choose another MUA - one who knows how to work with my skin and my features. I’ve already reached out to some people and gotten quotes from them. I’m even happy to pay if she prefers that.

Would I be TA for making a stink about this? One of the other bridesmaids said that I’ve already been accommodated in the outfit and I should realise it’s not my day.",0.02
"WIBTA if i confront my friend for not getting anything for my bday after i gave her 100$ So I (18F) became friends with a girl (18F) and was invited to her bday at a club.

So me and my other friend (18F) showed up to her birthday for 30min and left. We didnt drink we just took pictures with her and left. As a gift i gave her 100$ cuz I heard from her other friend that apparently she expects 100$ from people for her birthday usually and if she doesnt get 100$ she doesnt consider the person as her friend. 

This was September. Then for my birthday in December, she didnt get me anything and only wished me a happy birthday through text. I was honestly expecting a gift from her as i gave her 100$ and I honestly believe birthday gifts are give and take.

"AITA for eating my sister’s sandwich knowing she was saving it for herself? I’ve never actually used Reddit before so sorry if there are any mistakes.


So, I (14f) have an older sister (19f) who we will call “Ella”. Ella is staying at home with me and my parents for university until she graduates or finds an affordable apartment for rent.

Anyway to give a little context my family is pretty busy. My mom is a nurse so she is gone very early and isn’t back until sometimes very late and my dad also gets up early as well. (I’m not exactly sure what he does but I know it has something to do with finance) So because of this I have to get myself ready in morning. Since my parents aren’t here in the morning I’ve set up a routine. I’ll usually pack my lunch, snack etc the night before and put it in the fridge to take it to school the next morning and it works out great. 

UNTIL my sister moved in. For a little context my sister is also out of the house before I wake up and I’ve started to notice that she would take my lunch, leaving me with nothing to eat. I just assumed she didn’t know it was mine which was a little annoying but I just told her to stop taking them. She agreed and all was well until last week Friday.

Friday morning I was supposed to go to school and she took my lunch AGAIN and I had to buy myself something small with pocket money and I had enough so I decided I was done. I woke early on Saturday morning before she was awake and just took her sandwich. (For more context cause I know people will be confused, she goes to the library with her friends on some Saturday’s and that’s the only time she’ll actually pack her own lunch) Anyway I took it and started eating it for breakfast. Needless to say when she came downstairs and saw me eating her food she got mad.

We got into a fight and I ended up telling her that this was how I felt every time she was to lazy to make her own food and ate mine instead. I went back upstairs and by the time I came back down she was gone.

My parents weren’t happy when they found out what happened and told us to figure it out ourselves so now I’m kind of feeling bad.

"AITA for yelling at my grandma? I, 18 F, yelled at my gma back in December and it led to a major falling out.

I've had problems with my grandparents (mom's side) since I can remember. My grandfather often let his anger make decisions for him. Without going into details, he could be abusive at times. My gma loved playing favorites, it was always about who helped her out the most and when I went to college she replaced me with my cousin.

My brother is severely autistic and is prone to meltdowns, due to this my grandparents banned him from their house a year or two ago and they've not bothered to check on him since. So we were already on thin ice with them as it was.

This December, I realized I hadn't talked to my grandmother in a while due to stressing about college and decided to call her while I was wrapping presents.

The topic of her annual Christmas Eve dinner got brought up and she said she didn't know who all was going since last year we didn't go (due to my brother being banned and me not having my own car at the time). Before I could tell her that I had been planning on going (since now I had my own car), she began listing off her guest list.

Her and my grandfather (obviously), my cousin, his mama, another cousin, and my aunt.

Here's context on my aunt without too much detail. We do not talk to her. She did and said some very unforgivable and horrible things, and went as far as to say that we were all dead to her and she was leaving our family.

So we had not spoken to her for nearly two years at this point.

Due to what my aunt did I had to get extensive therapy and it took months of working on myself and healing to get my life back together. Everyone in this family had been told that if they ever spoke to her again they would no longer be allowed in my life.

So I immediately hung up the phone and lost it. Not only was I brought back to every horrible thing she had done before, I was thinking about everything that was about to happen. My world fell down around me all over again. I called my mom, who was Christmas shopping a few hours away with my dad, and told her the situation.

And then I called my gma back.

Before you say ""You shouldn't have called in anger."" Or something like that, let it be known that had I taken the time to calm down, she would have manipulated me and I would not have held her accountable.

So I called her back angry.

I told her to put me on speaker and I yelled through the phone that if anyone in that house had anything to do with my aunt then they could stay out of my life, and then I hung up.

I was expecting texts, mainly from my gma trying to play the victim.

I was not expecting my grandfather to cuss me out, threaten me, and then do the same to my mom after I blocked him.

My gma texted my mom first, and when that got her nowhere she texted me.

I told her off again and reminded her that her actions were repulsive and I didn't want to hear from her again unless she was willing to choose me over my aunt.

"AITA for not inviting my husband's pregnant former coworker to my baby shower because I don't want her to steal the spotlight? Hi, I (30F) am pregnant and due in April. My husband (35M) and I have a baby shower planned next month to celebrate with friends and relatives.  This event is very important and meaningful to me as I have not publicly shared the news with my friends and family on any social platform (i.e. Instagram, FB, the usual). My husband is super excited to invite all his friends from work and other social circles to the baby shower, most of whom I generally like and get along with--except for one. Let's call her Sharon. Sharon is my husband's former coworker and she is also pregnant (a few months after me). 

I never saw Sharon as a real problem up until last week, where my husband and I attended another good friend's baby shower (where Sharon was also invited).  Prior to attending the event, my husband told me to make sure to wear a jacket and keep my baby bump as discreet as possible, so that I don't steal the spotlight from my friend, which I completely agree and respect.  

I was shocked  when Sharon showed up wearing the tightest maternity bodycon dress one could ever imagine. Her baby bump was extremely prominent and shown in such a way where it essentially forcees the conversation on her pregnancy. This was almost everyone's FIRST TIME seeing her baby bump; some people didn't even know she was pregnant! It was incredibly uncomfortable for me as I watched the energy shift from my friend to Sharon. People were more interested in Sharon's baby, asking the usual 20 questions people are keen to ask when they find out someone is expecting. And the worst part is, Sharon seemed to bask in the spotlight and gleefully answered everyone's questions. 

After witnessing that debacle, I no longer wanted Sharon at my baby shower. Her selfish behavior and attitude made it clear to me that she would try and pull the same exact shit at my baby shower. My husband tells me that not inviting her to my baby shower will cause unnecessary drama, since she is friends with the people who are attending. He also told me that we won't be invited to Sharon's baby shower and that it will start even more drama, etc, etc... I do care about my husband and the connection he has to his friends, but at the same time, I am hurt that he is not taking my side and understanding why I feel so strongly about this. It just infuriates me that he won't even acknowledge that what Sharon did is wrong and in poor taste---in fact, he is making me feel like I am being overly sensitive and that I am overthinking everything! 

I have no one to turn to and I feel that the only course of action for me is to take this girl off the invite list. I am too stressed to think about the consequences this may have on the social group, nor do I have the bandwith to truly sympathize. I just want to be selfish and thiink about my baby. AITA? ",0.29
"AITA for calling all of my cousins Mary? My(F15) granny always dreamed of having a daughter named Mary but instead she got 6 sons and no daughters.

When my baby sister(2months) was born my granny decided that she is going to call her Mary eventhought that's not her name. My parents are very annoyed because of this but they believe in respecting elders so they won't say anything.

Granny was upset and my cousins and uncles started telling me that I'm being rude and it's just a name and it's no big deal so I decided that since it's no big deal for them I will call all of my cousins Mary, even the boys.

I called them Mary all day and at the end one of them snapped and told me that I'm not funny anymore and asked me to stop. I told him I'm not trying to be funny Mary but I won't stop until you apologize and admit that it is annoying to be called something other than your name.

"AITA for yelling at my brother and sister-in-law & calling them ""bastards"" for giving us cow meat for dinner? My son is nine-years-old, and we're Indians who are living in the USA. There are various items which are prohibited in the 'religion'. It includes cow meat.

Recently, he talked to me about some of his friends were talking about how they have eaten beef, and that he wants one as well. I refused, and in the end he agreed with it.

We recently stayed at my brother's house. My son informed him one day, that he wants to have cow meat, but that I would not allow that. My brother agreed to help him have it, and also told him ""As they did not give it to you, we'll also make a plan to make them have it as well.""

Yesterday they said that they were making meat for dinner, and I said sure. When it was served, I noticed that it tasted somewhat differently, so I asked him about it. He laughed and said ""That's beef. I want you to taste it as you're so against it. Fuck your controlling attitude."" 

I was shocked, and a really huge argument that ensued. My son was continuing to have it, but I asked him to stop, and in the end my brother was yelling at me himself and that he wanted to teach me a lesson. I called then ""back-stabbing bastards"", and in the end I left the house. I also gave my son a well-deserved dressing down and he's now grounded for a month.

My friend has asked me to visit on multiple occasions and each time I have said no because honestly I am a student and even though I could technically pay for the flight, I really just don't want to. I work while in school and I am trying to save my money for when I graduate, but that's not exactly why I feel like I might be in the wrong, I think I just don't want to go. 

Don't get me wrong, she has been one of my best friends since 2020 and were inseparable before she moved, but I feel like since she left, all she does it guilt me about not visiting. As early as 3 weeks after the move she was asking me to visit but the problem is anytime I try to explain to her I don't want to spend the money, she just guilts me by telling me to work extra hours and saying if I am really her best friend I'll visit. She also offered to pay for my flight but I am very against that because I don't want to take money from anyone, but that also upset her more. The whole thing has been off-putting to me and I don't think I even want to anymore at all. It's also important to know that I live down the street from her parents and she plans to visit home for holidays so I don't think it is that big of deal.

I  come from a military brat background and have been in this situation numerous times, but this is the first time I've had someone get mad at me for saying no but then again, she is the first non-military friend I've had who moved away so maybe I am just insensitive because I went through it so much.

"AITA For Not Informing My Coworkers I'm Ordering Lunch? So, for background, I (24m) work as a direct support professional (DPS) for the mentally and physically disabled. All my coworkers are women but the two that are involved in this are 54 and 34, we'llcall them Jane(54f) and Dana(34f). If it matters at all, they are both married with children and I am single. Dana is my assistant supervisor and Jane is the same position as me. This all happened yesterday.

I would sometimes order ubereats for lunch because I don't drive. Dana has been asking me questions about ubereats here and there and I don't usually think anything of it, but she'll also make remarks like ""so when you gonna buy me lunch,"" or ""are you ordering lunch today,"" which I brushed off as a joke but when she kept doing it I would just always say no.

Now every payday, as a group we would get a work lunch all together, but as yesterday was not a payday, I just ordered for myself, which I didn't think anything of until Jane came over and said ""oh you ordered lunch, why didn't you tell us?""

I honestly didn't know what to respond, but before I could Dana said ""he's always doing that man,"" and then Jane said ""it would be nice if you announced to the group that you're ordering lunch,"" 

I just got annoyed, and as I had told Jane about ubereats too, I just said to them bluntly ""well then you can just download the app yourselves and order it,"" which Jane cut me off and said ""no we don't need your money, but it would be nice if you would tell us so we can give you money to order for us,"" to which Dana chimed in ""thank you."" 

Before I could say anything else, Jane said that she had her issue with me and not to get into it with her, so I just didn't say anything else. Jane then drove out and bought lunch for herself while Dana brought lunch from home.

AITA for not telling them I was ordering lunch? It made me feel selfish for not saying anything to them, but at the same time I just feel that if they really wanted it, they could have either said something earlier, or just have downloaded the app and ordered for themselves, but I have been wrong before so maybe there's something I'm not seeing?

EDIT: I did not expect this to blow up as much as it did. Thank you to everyone that left a comment, you all have given me new perspectives to look at this.

I wanted to add some info to this as I have seen some questions pop up multiple times:

1. I am the only one that does Ubereats/doordash as I currently do not drive (don't have a liscense but I'm working on getting it) everyone else drives, so they don't really have a need to do ubereats/doordash.


2. Other then Dana making the comments like I mentioned above when it came to me ordering, nobody else had made a comment regarding me ordering other than asking what I ordered prior to yesterday, so it's why I came here thinking I did something wrong or was acting selfish.


3. I work with mostly Haitian, Hispanic, Jamacian, and Phillipino women staff-wise. I'm not sure if this gives anyone an idea of how my work environment could be as the only way I would personally say that it depends on the day and how everyone is feeling.


4. I don't ask when using ubereats/doordash, but there are times outside of payday that we order lunch and that is usually when we are traveling off-site, and in those instances we do ask around depending on who the driver/monitor is that is going to pick it up (usually I am the monitor while the driver is different) 


5. I have not offered before to buy anyone lunch when I use ubereats/doordash, and when Dana would make a comment or ask  I would usually either turn her down or tell her that either I'm not ordering or I don't know if I'm ordering, but personally with her comments to me I usually don't want to order her lunch. 

Dana is the only person that does this, everyone else (including Dans) will either have their own lunch brought, have family stop buy to bring them lunch, or would share lunch among each other (yes they have shared lunch with me in the past if I didn't eat lunch or didn't order anything for lunch, but this was before Dana had joined our team. Dana will offer part of her lunch she won't eat due to her dietary habits when we order out or if she wants me to try her cooking)

"AITA for saying ""no!"" to my partner's friends staying overnight at our house after their birthday party? I (33f) and my partner (34m) were discussing his guests list for a birthday party at our house. 
(I don't want the party at our house but I digress).

He has a close circle of 5 mates who lives interstate. All men are in their 30s with partners and a house/ apartment. Some have children too.

He would like to enjoy their company and apparently this requires them to stay overnight at our house. What is the etiquette for this situation? Is it normal or not normal? 

I'm not sure why they can't leave when the after party ends (the after party starts when all family and other friends go home) and go back to their hotel to sleep before their domestic flight to go home. 

For example, my partner argued that when he went to his mates' birthday parties, it was at their place and he stayed nearby at mutual friends' house (Uber back to the friend's place at 3am in the morning before 10am flight home). 

We live on the city's borders and our acreage property has an outdoor patio, a swimming pool/spa, and a firepit area. The nearest motel/hotel is 2-4kms away from us. 
I am already concerned about having up to 35 people at our house considering we have a baby and a toddler but I'll learn to deal with it. However having people sleeping over is too much for me!?!!

My mother works very hard alongside my father to support us. My brother and I currently live with them. (We are young, but not children.)

My brother and I have issues. Lots of issues. Emotional, trauma, blah blah blah. Point is I'm telling you this so you get a semblance of understanding about us. This has lead into one or the other instigating days if not weeks of conflict and stressing out the entire house.

I moved the PS5 upstairs and went to ask him where the upstairs outlet was. I stood at his door, waving my hand to get his attention so as not to startle him. I said his name. I squint in the pitch black to see he has headphones on. So, I try whistling, rustling the cat food. No luck. Eventually I resolve to walk up to him, slowly, and waving my arm (also slowly) and getting slower the closer to his phone light I got. Eventually I put my fingers between his face and the screen.

He told me to fuck off, repeatedly, until I decided to pretty much (quietly) start moving stuff upstairs to find it (I eventually did).

I forgot my password.

So I go down and ask. He and I know each other's details in case we want to play a game or just have the other change one of our settings while they're playing so as not to kick them off.

I ask what it is. He said it's super simple and should not be forgotten and to fuck off. I tell him I don't wanna be down here and I'll leave as soon as he tells me. This lasted a bit.

Brother: Alright, that's it. I'm taking the HDMI cord since you fucking snuck up on me.

I start to get angry. I try reasoning I just wanted my password and had tried to get his attention as I got closer, figuring he might be irritated from being startled. He starts on the PS5, and I realize one of two things is about to happen.

1. An argument that will likely lead to extremely unreasonable behavior toward one another for days.
2. I have to wake mom so I don't go caveman brain and meet him head-on.

I chose #2. She was tired and resolved it peacefully, I said sorry for waking her and hugged her, went on to entertain my little cousin for a few hours and was bombarded with angry messages from my brother.

I could have just let it go... I feel guilty.

"AITA for throwing hot tea on my mother? Basically, I'm a teenager, that's no excuse of course, but recently something really traumatic happened to me where I was physically forced into doing things like drugs and stuff... it was literally the darkest time of my life and I didn't tell anyone, not even my parents. Every time I would cry back then, they would just mock me for it... recently, due to these past memories I've found it hard to go back to school where it happened... and I stopped going to school completely after accumulating exam stress and also friendship problems piled on as well.   
After like a month, I decided to tell my parents everything after my mother softened up a bit, so I trusted her and told her everything and she listened to me and understood how I felt. But then after a few days she started mocking me again for being in depression and for not focusing on my studies and by saying I have no right to feel bad about anything.   
I kind of expected this from her and it made me feel terrible but I ignored it. Then, this morning my mother was talking to my sister and saying how she would rather die than have my sister be as weak and emotional as me... I got angry at this and in a moment of impulse I threw hot tea on her. I feel terrible about this and I'm still feeling really really guilty although my sister said she deserved it.",0.62
"AITA for not admitting to sending a dick pic to my teacher? I (19m) got a new phone, new number, and a teacher at my school and my girlfriend (18f) have the same name, think of some generic Spanish shit like Maria Gonzalez, Sofia Martinez or whatever. Anyways during the winter break I was a bit drunk and my gf and I were sending naughty pics. I sent a dick pic and I unknowingly sent it to the wrong Maria Gonzalez. I opened up the photo album and clicked forward to maria Gonzalez. I have the old Maria Gonzalez because she was a chaperone for us 4 years ago on a field trip and we all had to take her number, I never texted her nor did I ever really know her, I only interacted with her on that trip, she never taught any of my classes. 

I woke up the next morning ot a text from my girlfriend saying ""did you forgot to send me the pic, I was waiting for you"" and I couldn't find it. Thats when to my horror I saw that I texted the other Maria Gonzalez and I was really scared. I texted her the next morning ""I'm really sorry, I sent this to the wrong person, I didn't mean to"" and left it at that. 

We had an assembly because they knew it came from a rugby player, I was wearing the rugby work out shorts and the logo was visible. The principal yelled at the whole school saying this was sexual harassment and they will get to the bottom of this to find out who did it and that person is going to have hell to pay for it. After the assembly they gathered all the people on the rugby team (excluding all the people whose skin is too dark to be the culprit, which led to some confusion when they told those people not to enter hte room) and they told us that basically one of the people in that room sent it, and that person needs to admit to it, we'll be here all day. Ididn't say anything and they literally prevented us from going to class saying we are not allowed to leave. AFter 10 minutes people in the room were arguing and screaming saying ""WHOEVER FUCKIGN DID IT JUST ADMIT IT SO WE CAN LEAVE IM DONE WITH THIS FUCKING SHIT"" among similar things. At some point the biggest rugby player siad ""im fucking done, I'm leaving"" and the principal tried to block the door but he walked through him, I along with many others followed. There was a group call in the rugby chat and the group chat had a lot of people talking about who did it while some say that someone did this to fuck with the rugby team (we had some drama with the other sports teams because the school gives us most of the funding because we always win tournaments while they lose). 

I feel really bad about this. People in the chat are callign whoever sent the dickpic and is too much of a pussy to admit it a chickenshit coward and asshole. however i feel if i ignore it it'll blow away. The teacher who received the pic also seems to not really care that much, its mostly the prinicipal who is losing their shit. The good thing is I bought the sim card from a gas station and didn't register with my name. I changed it afterwards before sending one more apology and explanation text. ",0.33
"WIBTA if i kick my band's vocalist out? so a little backstory: my best friend Ben and I started a metal band 6 months ago, him on drums and me on bass. We brought a vocalist, Joel. now Joel has problems: He's a chronic smoker, he doesn't take care of himself and his vocals aren't that good. After we brought him in, we brought in our guitarist, Nathan.  


Joel and I are good friends, he's like a little brother to me, but from the beginning I didn't think he was right for the band but decided that he stay in the band. 3 months ago, Joel said he was going to try to quit smoking, but he hasn't made any progress in quitting.

&#x200B;

Now in our rehearsals, he smells and I can smell him all the way from the amplifier I use. Along with that, his vocals don't fit the type of songs Ben and I are writing.   


now today, I talked to Ben, because after all it is his band as much as it is mine. he said I'm selfish, and not thinking about anyone else but myself, even though all I want is for this band to succeed. Ben also said that a band first and foremost is a family, and before the band is good, the band needs to work well together.

&#x200B;

Then, out of the blue, Ben's girlfriend, Amy, texts me and tells me how I'm out of line, because I wanted him out before he was even in, that I'm selfish for thinking about no one but myself.  Amy also said that every time before our rehearsals Joel is worried I'm going to kick him out, how he's really trying to fit himself into the band and that I should do the same.   


I'm not sure what to do, would I be the asshole if I kick him out even after hearing all of that?",0.2
"AITA for ""not checking in enough"" with my wife while she went to the hospital? My wife had a 48+hr headache from her period so she went to the hospital in the evening. We are long distance and I work 12 hr days, and I was on day 16 of a 17 day rotation, working every day since Christmas day. I was absolutely exhausted.

She went to the hospital in the evening and I asked her to keep me posted with whatever happens.
I woke up at 5am and first message I sent her was something like ""hope you're all good did the doctor recommend you to do anything?"" I didn't specific ask ""how are you"" because i knew she wouldn't be awake. 
I worked till 11am with no breaks then got a few messages from her so I knew she was up. First text I sent after this was ""how are you feeling?"" 
Then I looked at the texts she had sent and one was ""the headache is gone"".
So, based on this text, I assumed everything was all good and said awesome glad the problem was fixed, then I had to get back to work. Fast forward to the evening after I got off work I had to start packing to leave work the next day. I was going to call her before bed cause I was absolutely wiped from work, but I did not tell her this. Then she got extremely mad that I didn't call her right away after work and now it has been about 3 days straight of her saying I was an asshole for assuming she's fine and not checking in as soon as I could. Huge fight. She said hurtful things about our europe honeymoon coming up saying she won't even care that i am there. Am i the asshole, and how do i fix this?.",0.56

She also had loud music playing making me cover my ears. When we sat down she gave me a plate full of food I tried to eat it but I couldn’t. I started rocking and flapping my hands. She made a remark about how I must be a bother when we are in public. At this point in time I have gone nonverbal do to everything going on.

She wants me to open the bathroom window whilst I am showering to not let the bathroom get damp and mouldy despite us having an extractor fan. I refuse as we live in an a flat and the window opens to the communal stairs and if opened neighbours would be able to see me showering which would be embarassing. She got upset and said I am being unreasonable and if I leave the window closed the bathroom would get mould . I pointed out that we have a fan, but she says that it will be wasting money. I then propositioned that I can open the window after I shower so then people wont see me naked, she still denied that option, I said there is no way I am opening the shower window like that and she got angry saying that I don't pay the bills and I am making it harder on her by doing this.

"AITA for not wanting my son to be ""besties"" with his cousin? Me (28f) and my husband (32m) have a 2 year old son and a daughter due this spring. We both work full time and our son goes to daycare during the week. The issue arose yesterday with my husband's SIL who I'll call ""Tammy"" (25f). Tammy has a 1 year old daughter with my BIL. She doesn't work or drive. My husband also has a sibling with a child out of state. Tammy messaged me about getting matching outfits for our three kids for when the sibling comes to visit, which will be about a week after my baby is born. I told her there was no point, because we were not coming to a family get together right after my C-section with a new born. We will see everyone seperately, on our time. She has since messaged a few other times about buying matching outfits for random things, the most recent one being Easter. Her, her family and my in laws are devoutly religious, my husband is so-so, and I'm most certainly not. So they go to church on Easter and my family stays home to do an egg hunt. So we don't even plan to see them, as to me, Easter is just a fun holiday for kids, not a family thing. I finally broke and told her that we may do matching outfits with OUR two kids, but I don't see a point in matching the cousins unless it is a family event with photos for ALL of them, not just the ones in state. She told me that her first best friend was her cousin, she wants our kids to be ""besties"", and that we need to hang out more so our kids can hang out and because ""she has no one"". I told her that she shoots me down everything I ask her to hang out, and I'm not going to be the backup friend for when everyone else is busy or she needs a ride (those are the ONLY times she's asked me to do anything). I said that I don't enjoy playdates and our son gets enough friend time at daycare. If she wanted her daughter to have social interaction, there are playgroups or daycare. She also has only left her daughter with family once since she was born, and BIL won't take care of her without Tammy there, so adult time is not an option. I don't like having multiple loud children in my personal space, and the kids arent old enough to do much or remember fun events yet. She doesn't get it because she NEVER leaves her familys side and doesn't work. I work in law enforcement and need to recharge on my days off. I think I might be the asshole however, because she seems to have had good intentions, and because I told her that my husband and I are independent adults, and we don't need to be as ridiculously close with family as she does. I also told her that I'm not just going to hang out with her as the ""backup friend"" when she has no one else. She is now apparently pissed at me, stopped responding and posted a snarky Facebook status about her daughter having ""no cousins around"".

"AITA for forbidding my girlfriend's son from choosing a name for our child together? So, I (M23) have been dating my girlfriend (F34) for a year and a half. Six months ago we decided to get married, planning the wedding for August 2024, and five months ago my girlfriend told me she was pregnant. Also her son from her first marriage lives with us. He is still a teenager, he is 17 years old, and I think he is jealous of his mother for me. He was not happy that we were going to get married, and now that he realized that the wedding will be after the baby is born, he is even more upset for some reason. He seems to have a prejudice that children should only be born in marriage. 

We were discussing what we were going to name our future son, and as my fiancée and I went through several options, her son said he wanted to suggest a name too. Of course, we agreed, and he unexpectedly gave me the name of my girlfriend's ex. It wasn't the name of his father, who was too young when his son was born and chose to just run away, but the name of the guy my girlfriend date before me. 

The worst part for me was that my girlfriend said the name was beautiful and that she would think about it. I protested immediately. My girlfriend said I was overreacting and it was just a pretty name. I once again said no. Then my girlfriend's son suggested the name again, this time already his father's name. I sat there and saw him gloating while looking at me. My girlfriend didn't see it. I told my girlfriend that I did not want her son to be involved in choosing a name for our child. She said I shouldn't stop her son from expressing his opinion. Now she resents me.

I feel like as a fresher, I have done my part very well in being polite to people and have befriended a couple people as well.

Yesterday, when I was walking outside the campus, completely minding my own buisness, a student randomly told me, in her own words ""Go back to your country! You don't even belong here!""
I was a bit startled as no one had said such a thing to me before.
I didn't take it well, and told her ""Aren't you a god damn immigrant as well? I'll drop you in Europe while I'm at it"".

She looked quite upset and told me to F*** off and threatened to report this to the college authorities.

I told her to do whatever she pleases as she'll end up making a fool of herself.

"AITA for wanting nothing to do with my stepfather, even if he pays the bills? I (20sF) live with my mother (Mom), brother, and stepfather (Gus) (not real names)- though to say my stepfather lives with us is an exaggeration lately. Mom and Gus have been together for 14ish years. I've lived with them for the last 4.  
  
Gus works at a big store. 2 years ago the company asked him if he would be willing to take a position out of state. He took the job, which is about 3 hours drive away, and the idea was he'd come home every other weekend. He and Mom figured the increase in pay would be worth it.  
  
At first, everything went as planned. But he started coming home less and less. What was supposed to be a 6 month assignment has been going on 2+ years.  
  
He says all the time that he's coming home this weekend, only to go completely incommunicado for hours, even days at a time, and not show up. Eventually he'll say that he fell asleep, or that he wasn't feeling well. We gave him the benefit of the doubt the first dozen or so times, but now it's just what he does. He hasn't been home in months.  
  
My mother has had a lot of health issues lately, on top of her preexisting disability. A month ago she had a medical procedure that Gus was supposed to be here for-- but he wasn't. Thankfully I'd guessed this would happen and didn't go to work that day, so I could be at the hospital and take care of mom after. He didn't even check in til after the it was done. It broke my heart sitting in the hospital listening to her say ""how could he do this to me?"" I'm now the one who my mom has to confide in. Mom and I make household decisions together. I make sure Mom has eaten (she often forgets or she is too dizzy to safely get to the kitchen) and has what she needs. My mom spends so much of her time and spoons figuring out our finances.  
  
He continues to be awful about the most basic communication to myself and my mom. Once, he was supposedly on his way, and my mom didn't want to eat lunch because he usually takes her out when he comes home. He'd been out of contact for hours, so I convinced her to eat with me. Sure enough, he was a no-show. She tried to hide it, but I know it made her sad My mom deserves so much better than this.  
  
Anyway, I want nothing to do with him now, and I tell my mom this. I scoff whenever she says that he's coming home for the weekend, because he doesn't show up. Mom is angry at him of course and says she gets how I feel, but also gets annoyed with me for badmouthing him because he does still pay bills and support us, reminding me that if he does show up I have to be polite. Also, to be fair, as I am currently student teaching, I'm not contributing as much to the household as I was, and without Gus' money I'm sure I'd have missed a car payment or 2 by now. But I don't think money makes up for his complete lack of presence.

"AITA for complaining about chores? My gf of 3 years and I have been living together for 7 months and this is our first place together.

Since we’ve moved in we keep arguing about chores. It’s ruining our relationship to be honest, at least for me.
I do complain a bunch, I understand its frustrating so I have tried to tone it down but I still do sometimes ramble about chores especially in the morning which is annoying ik. I cant stand dirty stuff, especially with cats, the thought of poop and pee particles everywhere rlly grosses me out.
It’s important to note that she has been working full time for a year now, remotely, and she’s the sole earner in the household since I’m still a student

Obviously since she works I’m happy to take on 70% of the chores: I cook, take care of everything regarding the kitchen, I mop, I hoover the cats room daily as it gets dirty easily. She of course does stuff like hoovering once a week (the whole place), doing all of the laundry, takes the trash out often or swaps the bed sheets which is all I really ask of as its not daily things to do but more weekly/monthly. It works out better for us as she works the basic 5 days a week 9-5.

On saturdays we try to get all of our chores done. So like our agreement, she hoovers the place and I mop, I also cleaned out the cat litters, no biggie we alternate on this job. 
Anyways we both start our chores. The problem rose when I “hounded” when I asked if she could hoover the bedroom a few times whilst she was changing the hoover bag (she had told me she was changing it before but i had forgot). I was mopping so didn’t look up to see what she was doing and only asking to see if i could mop the bedroom because I had just mopped the un-hoovered office which pissed me off. 
I was already a bit annoyed bcs we were meant to do this yesterday, she only had to hoover but she put it off. She does that a lot, which I hate, but she has been doing better which I’m grateful for. 

So there is tension, I’m hurt more than anything because any discussion about chores she will see as an attack, no matter how calmly I try to speak or how softly.
She keeps hoovering and she finishes I move onto the living room to mop it, as I start the kitchen I see some specs on the floor. Ranging from food that fell, kibble, hairs, even litter somehow, are still on the floor, although not as much as there was earlier but still not clean enough to mop. 
Naturally I get frustrated by this and tell her that there is still dirtiness on the floor, that it’s gross and really not that hard to properly hoover.
She then gets really annoyed at me, telling me I do a poor job at mopping too. I show her the specs and she simply exclaims “I missed bits sue me!” 
This annoys me because we have a good hoover and missing this much warrants a visit to the ophthalmologist not lawyers.
Follows an argument where I’m the asshole because I pointed this out.

"AITA for telling my girlfriend that I don’t like her dad? Using a throwaway account for this post because she knows my main.

Me (21m) and my girlfriend (21f) have been together for almost 3 1/2 years. I love her very much and wouldn’t trade her for the world. I wanna marry her someday. 

Her dad (44m) is very protective over her. He doesn’t smother her or anything, but when it comes to relationships/dating, he’s always been tough. But she’s a “dad’s girl” through and through so none of it bothers her. 

Her dad does this thing where any boy she brings home, he pretends to not know their name because they’re “not important” yet. She’s done this with all of her boyfriends (only 2 before me) and I didn’t mind it at first when he would call me by the wrong name.

However, it’s been 3 1/2 years and he stills calls me by the wrong name. I know it’s supposed to be a joke, but I don’t find it funny anymore. I feel kind of disrespected by it considering how long we’ve been together. Along with that, he also is very tough on her in other ways and I think she fails to realize it because she’s a “dad’s girl.” He always thinks he’s right and that he’s smarter than everyone else. I’m polite to him and he is nice to me (other than this, of course), but I just don’t like him. 

We went to her house for winter break and stayed there for a week and a half. He called me the wrong name the ENTIRE time and that was just my last straw. I told her on the car ride back that I don’t really like her dad and she got very defensive. She just sees the whole name thing as a joke. I tried to explain to her that it feels very disrespectful, but she didn’t seem to understand why I felt that way. 

She’s brought it up a lot since then and told me that she’s still upset over it. She really wants me to try and get along with him but I can’t see myself doing that when he doesn’t even call me by my name.

"AITA for hating our dog at this point? (Me 24m mom 59f)

I never wanted a dog. When we got it (she wanted and adopted the dog), i told her that it is hers and its her responsibility, while my two pets (snakes) are mine, yet i keep having to take care of the dog or things caused by it. First i had to buy it food and meds multiple times and pay for its vet cost because she couldnt afford it at the time. That is no problem i financially help my mom every now and then, don't care. 

Then mom broke her leg and i had to walk the dog for two months, most of the time having to be woken up from my sleep to do so which increased my annoyance because i have a backwards sleep schedule and sleep during the day since i work during the night so having to be woken up to walk the dog annoyed me more

Then it killed my snake. A few months ago i had one snake, and one day it escaped its tank and we found it bloody. Also being harrassed by neighbours while walking the dog. And then there is fur being everywhere. No matter how much we brush it there is still fur everywhere and i am sensitive towards things like that and it drives me to an overwhelmed overdrive when theres fur on my things it even gets in our food

There's also being unable to go to most places. Its ok if we have to go out for a few hours but we cant leave the house for longer unless we can bring the dog there. It chains us to the house. And not to mention the dog kind of causing harm to my mother?

She has fallen and/or got injured a few times because of the dog because she is too weak to contain a 37kg dog when it jumps at a passing car. Which...is what happened the other day. It jumped at a car and made her fall and now she is injured with a bruised/crushed(?) diaphgram, in pain, cant breathe or move much without yelling in pain and now because of that i again have to be woken up from my sleep twice a day to walk the dog because she cant

I hate it. It is not my responsibility. I never wanted it. But there is nothing we can do because mom is too hurt for it. I am guilted into having to take care of it because she is in pain. The dog is not my responsibility and i am forced to be responsible for it

I cant complain about it either because there is nothing we can do about it, she already feels bad for making me take care of the dog, i have to keep this to myself to not make her feel worse.

And no, we cant hire someone to walk or care for the dog because it is hard to find people for it in here the only one person we found is both too expensive and takes very shit care of the dog

We cant give it away either because 1- mom loves it too much 2- it is an abused and abandoned dog so changing owners would put it into a severe depression

So... yeah. Nothing to do about the situation. I just ... i feel frustrated. I feel heartless and cruel for being annoyed and hating the dog though. I feel guilty for how i feel. But at this point, i do hate the dog. I feel bad and guilty for how i feel. I am so overwhelmed and lost. I feel stuck and helpless",0.13
"AITAA for downloading hinge again? So I(23M) met this girl (23F) on hinge. We we’re talking for 2 months before we went on our first date. We started talking august and went out october. First date went great, no kissing whatsoever cause she was really shy and I didn’t want to make her uncomfortable. We planned our second date on her birthday but I didn’t get a text back from her. Fast forward to today, I just realized I didn’t told her that I changed my number and I thought she ghosted me. Turns out she sent me a text message and she thought I ghosted her. I felt really bad so I texted her again and asked if I can make it up to her. We then went out again to grab dinner last monday and had a great time. Went out again last Wednesday and watched a movie together. I really like spending time with her and she said she feels the same way. She said she’s happy that I texted her. We’re texting everyday now and planning to go on dates again. I also told her that I like her and that I wanted to kiss her but was too shy to make a move. She also tells me she likes me too. 

I got bored the other night and downloaded hinge again. I did told her when we were having dinner that I already deleted my hinge. But the unexpected happened. You know on hinge where it shows your most compatible match? It was her. She was my most compatible match. She then texted me saying she saw me download the app again when she was going to hide her profile and that she feels confused. She asked me why I bothered texting her again and planning all these dates if I will only end up downloading the app again. But she also apologized because she knows we are not exclusive or anything, but that she’s just confused understanding what my intention is. She said “You always text me to come over and hang out with and you said you wanted to get to know me more but you downloaded the app again.

"AITA for calling my relative racist? I'm 18, m. I was at my grandma's birthday, and this relative was on some political rants.

I said ""Oh, you're racist.""

The following conversation ensued like this:

Him: Nope, just someone with pattern recognition.

Me: Nah, racist.

Him: Okay? Debunk me.

Me: It's not my responsibility to debunk racists, they already are. It's my responsibility to mock them.

"AITA for focusing on my future and (maybe) not doing enough around the house? I (19F) still live at home with my parents. For the longest time, I’ve wanted to move out because of the emotional baggage my parents carry and take out on each other or me. 

My parents were both abused when they were young and my mom has never had the time to heal from what happened to her (she had me when she was young). You can assume that I’ve been walking on eggshells around them for as long as I can remember.

Recently, my mom has been taking on more things at work and balancing work and home life isn’t easy of course. My dad works out of the house and doesn’t do anything around the house, even if he’s asked. He just plays Call of Duty and gets us takeout when we’re hungry. So of course, I need to take on some responsibility which I’m ok with. However, it’s annoying when the responsibility are cleaning my mom and dad’s clothes, having to discipline and parent my sister because she’s too terrified to tell my parents her feelings, and having to drop everything immediately when they ask you to or else you’re in trouble. 

I’ve been working on my own business and it’s going well. Of course, running a business is a lot of work so household responsibilities slip my mind sometimes but I always make sure to get them done. My mom rants to me about how my dad doesn’t do anything around the house but I always felt like she had an issue with how much I do as well. So she rants to me one day about how no one cares about how her day went and blah blah. I ask if she thinks I don’t care then proceeds to say I just play video games all day, even though I tell her what I’ve been working on. This made me upset so I told her what I’ve been feeling recently. I have anxiety trying to make sure everything in the house is ok so no one gets mad, I do more household stuff than my sister and my dad combined, and how I’m the only person who’s ever went of their way to show her love and tell her how much I appreciate her. I know what she feels like because I feel it too. I’ve never left her side.

Then she responds by saying my anxiety is bs because I have nothing to be anxious about. The final thing she said is, “Go live somewhere else if you’re so unhappy.” This broke my heart because she always told me she doesn’t want me to move out and live like she did (with friends or on the streets). I finally tell her how I feel and it goes in one ear, out the other and she gets all defensive. I wasn’t surprised by her reaction but it still hurt.

"AITA roommates GF mad at me for having to move from my only available parking spot. Hi guys first time posting here, got into it with my roommate when I brought this up to him and we got in a yelling match about it.
So new years night I’m out celebrating with friends doing the New Year’s Eve thing.
After I leave my friends house and drive home I notice my roommate texted me earlier that night asking if I was coming home, it was late and I was driving so I didn’t text back since I was on my way home anyways and this was from like 4 hours ago.
When I get home his girlfriends car is parked in my only parking spot (we both get 1 and they are assigned) I park next to her knowing this will block in my neighbors but I told myself I’ll set an early alarm and move it in the morning to not bother anyone about it since my plan was to play video games for a few and go to bed.
When I walk in the house she’s at the door of my roommates room waiting for me since she must have heard my car pull in (she does not live here btw but is here almost every day and night), she immediately asks “want me to move my car?” To which I responded “no it’s gonna be a hassle for you so don’t worry about it” she then asked again and I repeated the same thing, she then goes “I’m gonna go ahead and move it” looking annoyed with me, to which at this point I’m annoyed about it and I tell her to not worry about it and that my roommate should have not told her to park there in the first place and I guess this is the part they think I’m an asshole about it since then I followed that with “it’s not like I live here anyways” and that it’s not her fault and to not worry about it, she then got more annoyed an said “I’m moving it” so I grab my keys and go ok then. As I’m following behind her to move my car so she can move hers she proceeds to slam the front door in my face which made me upset but I didn’t say anything about it but almost told her to leave my house I kept it to myself until I could talk about it with my roommate , I opened the door back my car out of where it was to give her room to move and park on the street.
Since then she won’t talk to me and just gives me the cold shoulder.
I brought this up to my roommate asking what’s the deal with her and he defends her actions and thinks I’m in the wrong for saying “it’s not like I live here in the first place” I told him he should not have told her to park there in the first place, he said “I texted you about it” (all the text said was are you coming home tonight? No follow up) I said I didn’t reply back since I missed it (I didn’t turn off my do not disturb that’s set to start around when I go to bed since I normally have to wake up at 530 am) so why would you give my only parking spot that I pay for? and that I tried being nice and told her not to worry about it since it would be a haste to her several times before I got annoyed and said that.
I don’t think I did anything wrong and I tried being polite to not inconvenience a guest in our house that late but she insisted.

"AITA? Fallout with best friends Hey,

so it's about three of us I 27 (m) and then 30 (m) and 26 (m). We're renting a studio which we set up together and we pay equally for the rent. So I am taking care of the rent, collecting the payments and paying bills etc, and for some reason the boys have never been able to just pay on time, I always have to remind them, run after it, ask them to just set up a recurring payment with their bank, etc.

So this time I didn't have enough money in the bank to cover the rent and because of the past where there were issues with the landlord because of late payments I wanted to make sure that we had enough to cover the rent, so I had mine but theirs was missing. Turns out they had forgotten again. 

One of them also couldn't deposit it to me so he had to give it in cash. Thus to be able to pay on the same day, I asked 30(m) to just deposit the money to me (pay twice) and 26(m) should bring him the money. And then they got really mad, starting calling me a bastard and subhuman for talking down to them and telling them what to do, etc. This was over text but literally all I said was (30(m), just send me the money now and 26(m) go bring it to him later, we need to pay today). I didn't curse at them or scream or anything. Later on that day actually that's precisely what happened too I had to go over get the cash give it to 30(m) and then he wired it to me anyway so what I told them to do I had to do for them again.

Then there was another incident with 26(m) where we were just chilling at our studio and 26(m) has his nervous ticks where he thinks it's okay to randomly scream or just act really stupid and retarded. It used to be funny when he was like 16 or so but now at 26(m) I think it's getting annoying. Also he sometimes makes passive aggressive comments while gaming like dude you're such a selfish dude, your personality is by definition selfish, or he calls me ""Internet Explorer"" for being slow sometimes and not picking something up as fast. Just feels really disrespectful at times. Then he also just ended the game without asking me even though we were doing well and it really pissed me off that he wouldn't ask and just did as he liked. So I snapped at him and said he should stop acting like this and act more mature and not like a teenager anymore. 

So now they're both pissed at me and 26(m) doesn't want to talk anymore because he said I give off negative energy. He also wanted to launch his t-shirt business for which I created an entire online app for him but months later he still hasn't gotten the physical product so he could ship it. Now I think he doesn't want to do it anymore with me because of how I act because of money (he thinks I am stingy/dishonorable because e.g. of the rent thing).

AIT? I feel like I have been to nice so far and now that I stand up for myself and just say the truth about things I am getting some really adverse reactions from my friends..

"AITA for not allowing my daughter to have a friend over because her mother is overprotective? My (39M) daughter (15F) has been doing a charter school online and because they connect kids with others locally, she made a friend there. She uses mainly the internet for communication as neither of them have phones of their own. I'm happy for her since she does not have many friends.

Her friend lives about an hour out of town, but comes into town often and they hang out at the library or park.

The issue is that my daughter wants to have her friend over at our house to hang out. Now normally we'd be okay with this, but my wife (36F) tells me that friend's mother will only allow it if I am not at home. This to us felt like a flag. My wife has attempted to find out if she can't talk to friend's mother, but she refuses to do so. My wife can't even find out what her name is.

My wife and I decided it would be a bad idea to allow the daughter's friend over ever, even if I'm not there. This mother sounds like someone who could look for any reason to make accusations and even if I were at work, am I supposed to avoid my own house so someone (who I don't know and doesn't know me) doesn't accuse me of being a predator? We have 3 other kids and we don't think it's wise to take that kind of risk.

My daughter, however, thinks we are horrible and hate her for this and does not understand our concerns.

Are we being unreasonable? AITA?

edit: to clarify, when I say I can't be there, I mean me, the dad, a man cannot be there while her daughter is there.

  
edit2: update to story! After some thinking and at my suggestion based on reading comments, my wife made another attempt to reach out to her. My wife explained what she was told via her daughter and wanted to find a way to work it out. So my wife invited her to dinner and she reaponded positively! So that's good. Hopefully we can work all this out for my daughter's sake.",0.2
"AITA Boyfriend wants cats in bedroom at night and I don’t. We’ve lived together for a year and adopted two kittens five months ago. Before we got them I told him I was happy to on the condition that they do not go into the bedroom at night with us.  He agreed to this and everything was fine.

But now he is insisting and trying to guilt trip me into letting them into the bedroom. I work 12hr shifts I’m tired I get up early and I have very poor sleep on the best of nights so I do not want two cats who like to play a lot and move around in bed with us. 

They don’t have access to upstairs during the day and we don’t spend time upstairs during the day for them to be used to being in the bedroom with us so I don’t feel mean about this as it’s not something they’re used to. 

He try’s to tell me that he loves them and he wants to hug them when he’s sleeping and that I don’t love them and he feels mean. He says I’d rather not have them and also “they don’t wake me up so why would they wake you up”. (He knows this because when I’m working he lets the cats into the bedroom when he goes for a nap) 

He sometimes chooses to sleep downstairs with them, like tonight all because I said that they’re not coming upstairs.

"AITA for wanting to better my health? 2023 was a really hard year for me (27F) and my health both physically and mentally. I decided in 2024 it was finally time to make a change. 2024 IS going to be MY year. 

Since January 1, 2024, I have made it my mission to exercise daily, change my diet, and do at least one act of self care a day. I’ve been eating more protein (chicken) and greens (broccoli) and I also recently got an Orange Theory membership. I also got a lot of skin care products for Christmas so I’ve made sure to prioritize my skin care morning and night. With all that being said, I really want to approach my lifestyle change holistically.

Now this is where I need y’all’s help…desperately! My roommate (28F) has been acting so cold to me ever since I started my journey. I hate to say this, but I honestly think that she’s just jealous. We’re both single women in Nashville, TN where dating is already competitive. I love my job, I love my friends, I love my life. She however can not say the same. She struggles already mentally so this change has taken her by surprise more than I anticipated. 

I thought at first it was because I asked to use her crockpot for my meal prep, but it got worse when I started putting patchouli on my wrists and my neck. A friend of mine in the spiritual community suggested that it may be that I’m saving my period blood for my face masks (age reversal, I’m about to be 30 yall can’t blame a girl🤭😂), but I really don’t think that could be it because I keep it in a secure mason jar on my own shelf in the fridge.

"AITA for choosing one friend over the other? I was technically a loner during first two years of high school, due to struggling with social anxiety. Only in my third year had I actually started talking to people and made three close friends - S, K and J.

I got especially close with S. S dealt with a lot of stress and anxiety during all of her time in high school and recently revealed that part of it is caused by K. Now, K is not a bad person and is usually (for me at least) great to be around with.

The situation spiralled after K hit S from excitement, which they argued was intended as a friendly gesture. S felt really hurt and cried. I wasn't there and the situation confused me, but turns out it wasn't the first time S felt hurt because of K. To that moment, it hadn't occurred to me, as K seemed pretty chill most of the time.

S then told me about all the times she felt mistreated and undermined by K. But she wanted to leave it as it was, as this is our final year and she could wait it out. 

I insisted she talk to K about it, since it was really hurting her. However, S didn't want to, saying it would definitely end up with  her having to apologise to K.

One day though, K ask S if she hates them. S said she doesn't, but she won't put up with that treatment anymore, so either K starts respecting her, or their friendship is over.

From that moment, K started pointedly ignoring S every time she was around them, otherwise acting completely ""normal"". This put a strain on our whole group, it just felt like during a really bad divorce. And S was really distraught, she felt completely isolated, to the point that she would run away from us. Because of that situation she ended up seeing a therapist. She told K about it, at which they replied ""good, since you have so much problems"". 

See, I consider S my best friend now, and seeing her pain really hurt. But to that point, which I'm definitely an ahole for, I didn't do anything.
So, the day before, I got an angry message from S, telling me how isolated and uncomfortable she's been feeling. I finally got angry enough at myself and K, that I texted them and said ""we are tired by this situation, you are not acting okay, so either you start treating S normally or I must take S's side here"". 

It seemed like only logical solution, I and J tried to talk with K before, but they acted like they didn't care at all. After my message, K's tone changed to a ""fine, go fuck yourself and good luck while doing it ;)"" sort of vibe. I honestly expected them to care more, so I told them to do some  soul-searching and get off the high horse, and generally fuck them too.

My father died unexpectedly in an accident last year. He was only 50. 

My wife (30) has had issues with my mom for the past 3 years. While we were dating, my mom made the comment that she didn’t feel we were “right for each other”. Since then, there has been a heaviness around them. Mom has apologized and always says I love you. But my wife hasn’t really accepted and has not ever said “I love you back”. She doesn’t accept the apology and thinks it only came after we were married because she had “no choice but to accept [her].”

The weather’s a little dicey, so my mom called and asked if we could ride together. She could meet at our apartment, and then we could drive into the city together. 

My wife told me to tell her “no” and that she’s a grown woman and can drive herself. That giving her a ride we are enabling her “helplessness”. My father did everything for my mom including driving through bad weather and into the city.

I (16F) And my mom (35F) Have fought a lot since I turned 16. On my 16th birthday she wouldn't even let me talk, she would interrupt me. She would then yell at me if I tried to speak to my aunt (33F) which was talking to me first, My aunt seemed mad about this and started to ignore her. However my mom did not take this very well she made everything about her, and then talked about my autism, and  saying that is why collect plushies and some toys, which is not really the case I just think they are cool and never had stuff like that as a kid.

But she had the audacity to say that I made everything about me yelling at me and calling me a selfish bitch. And that she had to drop everything to set me up doctors appointments, or listen to me complain about something. Which is not true, a little background information. I have a weak immune system so I get sick a little too easily, so it was hard for me during Covid and stuff. I also don't do well mentally and even my mom has been told I need therapy but she hasn't even put me in it. She then went on about how I can't make everything about me, and that I  need to grow up. She puts herself and my two brothers (7M) and (10M) Before me, but says she has no favorites. When my cousin came to pick me up after I texted my aunt crying asking to stay with her because of everything my mom has said, my mom looked at my cousin (17F) and said ""I don't know why she had to go running to your mom because we got into a fight"" But just before my cousin was there she tried to make me change my mind. And got mad and stormed out of the house when I ignored her. I cam back a few days later, and she didn't change. She was still disrespectful towards me..

She did not change and in fact our fights got worse, like if one if my things went missing after i had it in a certain place after she had cleaned it she would have no idea where it would be at.

"AITA for asking my uncle to stop letting his brother come around? I (F17) have mainly been raised by my uncle, Niles (M37).

He was more pre-occupied with doing the typical 'teen' stuff, like going out with random girls and guys, getting drunk etc. As a result, I have more memories from childhood involving Niles, than my dad, Liam.

My uncle and Liam have a very close relationship regardless though, Liam is dependent on him. He always runs back to my uncle when something goes wrong (which is often), and Niles is always ready to drop everything for him. Niles even tries to convince me that Liam is a good dad, although he only is that to me when he feels like it. When things go well with Liam, he's a great dad, doting, caring spoiling me, but more often than not, he's angry or depressed and doesn't even want to see me.

The other day, Niles was helping me fill out my UCAS application so that I could start getting offers from universities. Not only that, but he was advising me on uni and stuff, typical dad stuff. We were in the middle of it, when Liam showed up, not in a very good mood.

His girlfriend had broken it off with him, Niles immediately left me to comfort him. Literally ditched me there and then, in the middle of helping me. He made him food, he watched films with him, he stroked his hair until he fell asleep on his couch. The only way my dad acknowledged me was by kissing my forehead when he said hello, and calling me 'his smart baby girl' for applying to uni.

After he left, I begged Niles to not let him come around again, because that's how it always goes. He shows up ranting and wanting support, and then it's all eyes on him, it was like that even when I was younger.

"AITA for telling this girl to get off a machine if she’s only talking on it My gym only has 1 lying leg curl machine and it’s a packed Saturday morning. I follow a program and have that machine on program. I noticed the girl sitting on it talking to someone so I go ahead and do another exercise. I finish and she’s still talking. I do another exercise and finish and go ask how much she has left.

She says she’s just starting so I ask can I work in with her since I noticed she’s only here talking while I’ve done 2 exercises waiting for her to finish. She says “No I can take as long as I want, it’s a gym” I get pissed and say “yea it’s a gym, not a social club, you’ve been here talking this whole time when there’s only one of these machines”. Some dude tells me to back off and leave them alone, so I try to say I’m trying to use this machine but can’t cause they’re just talking and he goes “i don’t care back off.”  And she says there’s plenty of machines to use at a gym. I set my bottle down and wait for machine. When she finally finished she says don’t disrespect me so I say “I apologize but-“ and she cuts me off and says “I’m not talking to you, don’t disrespect me ever again” so I just put my headphones on and continued my workout. 

AITA? Everyone near us was staring and that guy telling me to back off made it seem as if I was the aggressor when I’m literally trying to workout while they’re wasting a machine just chatting away. Really ruined my mood.",0.09
"AITA for telling my sister it’s “gold digging money” she’s borrowing from me Not in the US

I (33f) have a sister Sarah (36f). Sarah has always been good at studying and is our parents’ pride and joy. She got into a very good university’s engineering program on full scholarship and had a nice job offer upon graduation. We were all proud of her.

In comparison, I was a mediocre student. I got into a less prestigious university studying something Sarah said to our parents “won’t get me a good job” but my parents helped me pay my tuition nevertheless though I had to work for spending money and other expenses. Through work, I met my now husband. He is from a family of generational wealth with their own business. We married when I graduated and my sister said she was very disappointed in me for being a gold digger and that we women should not rely on a man’s money to get ahead in life.

Sarah left the company at 30 to start her own business with her now husband. The business was doing well until the pandemic. They struggled but managed to keep the business together until this year. Sarah confessed to our parents that she needs a large amount of money to keep her business afloat. My parents suggested she borrow from me.

Now, I do have the amount of money Sarah needs. My husband heads his family company and gives me spending money every month in addition to a credit card he takes care of. I don’t work—my days are spent looking after our two sons and, for a few days a week, keeping his mom company. She’s a lovely lady who’s still very active and enjoys taking me places. Every time we go out she always foots the bills, so I have a lot of money saved.

Sarah and her husband approached me in private a few days ago. They asked to borrow money from me, with detailed plan on how to pay me back though with much lower interest than from a bank and a contract.

Here’s where I may be AH. I wrote them a check and as I handed it to her, I looked her in the eyes and asked “You do realize you’re borrowing my gold digging money, right?”

Sarah went red in the face before she immediately got up and walked away. Her husband looked a little awkward but finally took the check and mumbled his thank and left.

Later, my mom called me and said I was being cruel to Sarah in her hard time. That there was no need to humiliate my sister like that. I simply told my mom she never said anything when Sarah called me a gold digger so she has no say in the matter. Still, I wonder if I was AH.",0.5
"AITAH for saying something that hurt my mother’s feelings? Okay, so.. for some background information, I (16F) have lived with my grandparents my entire life, and have never really considered my bio parents as actual parents. I don’t have much of a relationship with either of them, though I’m definitely closer with my mother, since she lives in my city, whereas my father doesn’t. My grandparents and I will occasionally go out to dinner with my mother, since she’s their daughter.

 Well, we went the other night, and I was rather upset at my mother for having asked for money from us again (she does this frequently and must owe us at least a couple thousand at this point, probably more, with no sign of ever paying us back. Money is tight, as well, which doesn’t help), and I said a couple of not great things. I brought up her asking for more money from us, which I don’t think she knew I really knew much about, cause she always asks when I’m not around; in reality, I’m the one who responds to a lot of her texts and sends the money most of the time, when she texts about it while we’re driving or when my grandparents are doing something and ask me to check the phone. I also basically said that she didn’t deserve my being nice to her (unintentionally, but that’s how it ended up coming across), because she said something about how I ‘acted so different towards the waitress’ when she had come over to take our order. She also called me fake because I was being polite to her, and I just said that I acted that way towards people who deserve it (meaning, people who deserve my being polite, such as wait staff who don’t need another crappy customer to deal with). 

There was some amount of argument/debate after that, and I basically ended up being told that I can never handle being wrong and always have to argue (which.. I don’t think is true, I just want to have actual communication). I was pretty fed up at that point, and ended up saying a couple more potentially hurtful things, although I can’t remember what I said, exactly, rn (I’ll edit this later if I remember, but I’m blanking atm). I think they were all on about the same level as the things I’ve already mentioned, though.

Anyway, I guess she texted my grandparents when we got home, cause they came in and told me I had hurt her feelings with what I’d said. I feel really bad now, but I’m not sure if I was really in the wrong or not. I just know that I feel like I might be, but want more opinions.
So.. yeah, thoughts?",0.78
"AITA for ditching a family and friends trip for my GF, who was only a little sick ? Okay so a bit of a tangent, and I’m really sorry for the wall of text but it’s a long story.

I’ve always been really insecure about the way I looked because I was bullied quite a bit, I hate looking in the mirror , I hate being in pictures , I hate being photographed. 

People in my family don’t know this and they always love taking pictures.

I was also born with this skin condition to be it’s nothing major just give you freckles all over your , but that thing also gave me a pretty sizeable mole on my face and I got it removed so everything

My sisters would say stuff like “oh you know he’s a great guy and I would set you up with him but he’s ugly”

And my other sister would be like “yea I work with this guy he’s great and I would date him but he’s ugly”

Which again, I do not blame them, they’re my sisters and I love em to death but in my head I’m thinking “oh shit, I’m the ugly guy girls talk about”

My friends know about it and they always take pictures of me despite knowing and sending it in the group chat but only because they’re the bros and I’ve known them all for 22 years so it’s bros being bros you know, it’s fine, I love em and I’d anything for them.

Girls would be rating my friends and I and always got rated like 2 or 3. They would get 7 ,8 , 9

I thought I was unwanted because I thought “man what girl would wanna put up with this, not to mention that my skin condition is genetic and it’s not always as tame as mine so my kids could have the severe version. So not only do I not looked good, it’s a 50% chance that my kid could have it, I thought no girl would ever wanna put up with that and she shouldn’t have to.   

let’s call her “Angel”, came into my life , she’s actually so nice , funny , smart , great personality and so cute. Cuz even my friends and family were impressed I pulled her, I don’t know what she sees in me but i wish I saw myself the way she sees me. 

I was thinking even if I got a GF she would think it’s red flag I haven’t had my first anything, but we’re literally each others firsts everything.😭

we’ve been together for like 8 months and overtime I told her about my insecurities and stuff she was so understanding, I thought she would break up with me after finding that it’s a 50% chance that our kids could have it and she said “we can always adopt”, 

I hate to sound cringy but she’s actually a healing presence and hugging her feels so could, I feel like I would cry.

And that brings us to now, our family and a few of my friends were supposed to take a family trip with my GF but she got sick and she really wanted to go but couldn’t , she was the most excited to go, it wasn’t anything too major and her parents were taking care of her.

Being that she couldn’t have fun , I can’t have fun knowing she’s stuck at home. So I chose not to go. 

My family and friends were livid because she’s only a little sick and I ditched everyone for her, even Angel really pushed me to go, including her parents but she’s my everything, I can’t just leave her.

So AITA ?",0.33
"AITA for not going to my boyfriend's friends' baby shower? My (29F) boyfriend (40M) of three months mentioned his friends' (straight couple, early 40s) co-ed baby shower that was coming up at the weekend and asked if I wanted to join him. At first, I said I would love to, but felt hesitant to intrude as it was a personal event and I had only  met the host couple once before. Let's call them 'Adam' and 'Eve'. My BF assured me it would be fine as it was at a local brewery with 50+ attendees. They had not (yet) personally invited me as a +1.

A few days later, I told my BF that I was uncomfortable and having second thoughts about attending because it felt like an inappropriate situation for me to be meeting the rest of his friend group for the first time. This came up in the context of a conversation we were having about 'Betty' (23F). 

*\[****Backstory****: Betty was my BF's rebound who he casually dated for a few months shortly before meeting me. He broke things off when she asked him for commitment but they stayed friends. Recently, I found out that they were still in regular contact and hanging out once or twice a week behind my back. My BF said she was pushing his boundaries and ended the friendship with her after this. It turned out that my BF had previously introduced Betty to Adam and Eve, and later also confided in Adam about the messy situation that unfolded between us (including an argument which my BF said Adam had thought could have been avoided as my BF should not have told me about taking Betty's calls and meeting up with her after ending their friendship).\]*

My BF said he wanted me to be there but that I shouldn't if I felt uncomfortable about it. 

On the day before the baby shower, we were having drinks at a casual gettogether organised by another one of his friends in the same group. Many of the friends who I met were also going to the baby shower and asked if they would see me there the next day. Adam and Eve were also there. I had spoken to Adam briefly early on, but not Eve. As they were on their way out, my BF called out to them and asked ""*are you happy to extend the invite for tomorrow to \[me\]*?"". Adam paused for a second and said 'yeah' with an upwards inflection, as if caught off guard. Neither of them addressed me. 

After we left, I told my BF that Adam was being a bit awkward and didn't seem particularly interested in my attempt to engage in conversation with him (compared to how he was the first time we met) and that I hoped it wasn't due to anything my BF had shared with him about our past disagreements. I also said that his 'yeah' response (in front of me and everyone else) sounded unconvincing and their overall energy didn't make me feel like my presence would be particularly welcomed. My BF thought it was all in my mind and that I was looking out for the negative because I was reading too much into the 'Betty' situation. He took my reluctance to go to the baby shower as a general statement that I wasn't interested in going to events with his friends.

"AITA for wanting my mother to not touch my spare money? \*\*All of this occurs in the past since it doesn't happen anymore, but I wanted to know if I were the AH for acting how I did\*\*  


Hi, I (22M) live with my parents and my brother. Sometimes when I get home from work I leave some spare money (coins and low-value bills,) on the living room table or anywhere in the house while I rest or change my clothes. She had an habit where she was picking up the spare money for her and even do it as a joke saying ""Now this is mine hehe!"". 

One day I woke up and got ready for work and I searched for my space money to buy maybe chips or a soda on my way to work but it was not there. I asked my mother where was the money and she started saying that she didn't know or maybe she had taken it as a mistake. My mother is not currently working so there is almost no chance that those coins and bills were actually from hers at the beginning.

I was already fed up with that and told her to not touch money that was not hers or to ask me first if she could have that money for herself. She always does that and I don't find it cool or funny and told her that grabbing money that was not hers around the house is like stealing. She then started to say that I was calling her a thief and went into tears since ""That was a small amount and you care more about the money and her not willing to ask me for money ever again (in a bad way)"".  


I told her that if she needs money (or wants, I don't mind) she could ask me for it, but I wouldn't accept her taking it without asking me first since it was MY money. She later told my father and my brother about it and they went mad against me for ""treating her like a thief for just some coins and low-value bills"".  


It is important to know that a good percentage of my salary goes to the house stuff, buying groceries, paying for something, going out with them, and I NEVER say no when my parents ask me for money, they are good and responsible parents, so when they ask me for a little or big amount I don't mind in giving them the money because I know for sure it will be well-managed and used correctly. All my life my parent were leaving spare money all around the house and I have never touched a single coin from them my whole life, even if it was just spare money or big amounts of bills resting on a corner to buy something.

"AITA for expecting my friend to be honest/upfront with me after I give them breakup advice? **Scenario 1:** A friend of mine (let's call them Sam) went through a nasty breakup with their SO (let's call them Taylor) a few months ago. Sam and Taylor live in different states. The breakup was a week-long affair that I helped Sam through, which amounted to nearly 10 hours of my time altogether (maybe even more). I helped Sam go through all the options (breaking up/staying together), and Sam asked me how to word things to ease the breakup MULTIPLE TIMES. At one point, it got really bad that I needed to do major interventions when Taylor went berserk and did not take the breakup well (we also had to get the Taylor's friends involved). All of us (Sam's friends) were afraid for Sam's physical safety at one point. 2 weeks after the breakup, I ask Sam how they are doing, and Sam tells me they're fine and trying to move on. Sam eventually confessed to me weeks later (when Sam had another issue with Taylor) that they got back together days after the breakup. In other words, Sam wasn't upfront about getting back together when I checked up on Sam 2 weeks after the breakup. AITA for expecting Sam to tell me the truth?

**Scenario 2:** Same friend as above. So weeks after Sam and Taylor got back together, Sam had issues again with Taylor (only reason why Sam fessed up to me about them getting back together). We talked about it over dinner, and Sam told me they wanted to breakup again with Taylor. I was asked to give advice, so I did again. I dropped Sam off after dinner and I told Sam to give me an update because Sam was gonna talk to Taylor about their issues that same night (I wanted to make sure they were ok after the craziness of the first breakup). No update came, and I figured they didn't push through. I briefly mentioned Taylor once in the weeks later, and Sam didn't say anything about it, so I didn't push because I was still upset about the lie in Scenario 1. Fast forward to this week (2 months later), and Sam has now gone public with Taylor on social media (for the first time). AITA to have expected an update that night when I gave them advice?",0.94
"AITA for punishing my daughter for being smart with me when I ""assumed"" something? My (45m) daughter (12f) recently made a racist comment about an Asian transfer student at her school. I corrected her on this and gave her a long and stern lecture on why assumptions are bad. I did not punish her but warned her that if I ever recieved a report that such comments were made at school or towards the boy she would be severely punished because assuming things about people is wrong

Last week my son (17m) was worried because for his team to get a higher ""seed"" another team would have to lose to an awful team. Apparently this happened and he was really excited last week, so I knew he would be this weekend to.  So, this morning I asked him if his team was playing. He said no but that the game today was going to be cold quote ""like -5 degrees or something and like -30 with windchill or something like that"". I was shocked at such temperatures and asked what teams were playing. He said Kansas City, so a team in Missouri, and Miami. I said where was the game. He paused when he was about to put cereal in his mouth and gave me an almost ""are you serious"" sort of look. After maybe 5 or so seconds, it clicked that the second team was from Miami, Florida and thus the game was obviously not there due to the temperature.

So I said, oh the Missouri place, and he nodded. My daughter, who was also at the dining table and asked why I ""assumed"" the game would be in Missouri. I said well Miami will propabalyl never be that cold. She said, yeah but you *assumed* that. I said no, I just know that Missouri is much colder then Miami, and Miami is hotter then Missouri but a cold game would happen there. She said, so you assumed. I said no, I know, it's a simple fact. She said how come my assumption wasn't then. I told her that that was it and I was taking away her phone for the whole week, even at school.

She said that that was unfair. I said that I had already warned her about making such comments and she was talking back. She yelled some unkind words, so I made it 1 week and the next weekend.

"AITA for telling my sister the real reason why my fiancee was absent from her wedding? I am a 30-year-old man. My fiancee, Shelly, is a 26-year-old woman.

Ever since I met Shelly, she has been open about one of her interests, which is Korean music. It's not exactly my jam, but I am always happy to hear her talk about it. I was not aware early in our relationship, though, that by ""Korean music,"" she particularly meant one specific male pop star. His name is Kai. 

Since we began cohabiting last year, I've also come to learn that it's less of an interest and more of an obsession. She spends an inordinate amount of time looking at his pictures, following his fan communities, and listening to his music. If I'm being perfectly honest it's a pretty huge turn off for me personally, but people will like what they like I suppose.

Last summer, my sister told us that she was getting married and we were super happy for her. We immediately RSVP'd for her wedding, which was on Friday, January 12th. However, in December, Shelly came up to me and told me that she couldn't attend my sister's wedding. When I asked why, she responded that she was going to be in South Korea around that time.

I figured that Kai was having some sort of a performance or fan meet and greet, but it was even worse. Shelly wanted to attend a fan-held birthday party event. Apparently his birthday is January 14th, which is today's date in South Korea. I asked if she was out of her mind, seeing as (a) she doesn't speak Korean (other than some of the lyrics of his she memorized), (b) she doesn't have that much money and lives primarily off of what I make, and (c) she was going to prioritize some random pop star's birthday party over her fiance's sister's wedding.

Shelly told me she was going and that was that. Before she left for the trip a few days ago (on my birthday, actually), she begged me to tell my sister that she couldn't go because she was sick. I really didn't want to talk about it and just told her ""OK.""

Well, yesterday was my sister's wedding. It was a lovely ceremony. My sister and her husband were confused as to why Shelly wasn't there, and I immediately fessed up that she was in South Korea for an event. My sister was a little upset, but I told her not to let it ruin the day for her.

After the wedding my sister apparently emailed Shelly, telling her that she wish she would have been upfront because she could have saved some money on her food for the event, and then Shelly emailed me furious about my telling the truth.

"AITA for preventing my lifelong neighbor from getting a DUI? This happened yesterday. I (25m) have recently been living with my parents. As I was arriving home from running errands (about 5pm) I noticed a car was parked in the middle of the road right in front of our house with its hazards on. After I parked I noticed a couple had begun helping this vehicle. I wasn’t busy so I decided to help out. After attempting to push it for a few minutes, the driver pulls forward and parks the car along the street right in front of my parents’ house. The couple and I all looked at each other with confusion because we thought the car had broken down.

The three of us walk up to the car and motion for the driver to roll down the window. At this point I see exactly who’s behind the wheel. It was my lifelong neighbor (Late 50’s M). Let’s call him Roger. My whole life Roger has been very friendly with my family. I’d consider him a family friend. 

Anyways, Roger opens up the car door. He silently looks forward. Car still running. The man asks Roger if he’s okay. Roger still doesn’t say anything. The man then says he’s going to call Roger an ambulance. That prompts Roger to turn to the three of us and point to each of us one by one and mutter some nonsense. At this point I KNOW Roger is FUCKED. I ask if he’s been drinking…“I’m so drunk. I’m fucked up”. I’m shocked. I’ve never seen Roger like this nor have I seen him drink anything ever. The man then proceeds to pull out his phone and says he’s going to call 911. I step in and say that’s not necessary because I know Roger, his house is right there, and I can walk him home. The man seems relieved to not have to deal with this anymore and leaves. I then help Roger out of the car, turn it off, then start walking him home. As we walk (he’s stumbling) he discovers who I am and begs me not to tell my mother (my parents are extremely religious). He invites me in. 

Idk why I agreed to go in but I did. He explains that he has been trying to quit this year but relapsed at his daughter’s 20th birthday party that he had just gotten back from. I tell him it’s one thing to drink but it’s an entirely different thing to decide to drive after that. I felt bad and wrote down my number and told him to call me if he ever needs a ride. He ends up crying and trauma dumping about his divorce and subsequent drinking problem and lays his head on my lap (Don’t ask me why). I asked if he had ever gotten a dui before and he said he got one in 1992. I told him if he keeps this up he’s going to hurt someone or himself and that he needs to get help. He agreed.

"AITA for squirting my friend with a water gun? For context, we are freshmen in college and were in a room in our dorm building when this incident occurred. 

Some close friends and I had just finished playing a game when my friend, who we will call Clark, said a specific phrase that's not important. The group had earlier agreed that the phrase needs to stop being said because it's stupid, and Clark and my girlfriend said that whoever says it will be brutally murdered. My girlfriend now jokes about retrieving a gun, and someone makes a quip about how the only gun she would have might be a water gun. I remember that there are water guns stored in an adjacent room, so I go to grab one. They are the cheap, long, syringe types that you would see a toddler hold at a pool. I partially filled it with some water from a drinking fountain. 

I waited till I knew Clark was away from any laptops and things that shouldn't get wet, then I reentered and shot the water at him, at shirt level. He looked very angry, then ran at me and violently shoved me toward some tables. Everyone was kind of confused, especially me. Clark left the room for a minute, and most others also decided to go back to their dorms for the night. When he came back, I apologized for the amount of water I used, acknowledging that I perhaps could've used less water. 

He didn't say much, but still seemed pissed. The I didn't know what else to say, so I left at that point. When I got back to my dorm, my girlfriend texted me that it was a dick move and she's sitting with him and he's really upset. She said that she was sure I would be pissed as well, if I were him, and that I need to give him a more genuine apology. I'm an reasonable adult, so I will obviously deal with the situation accordingly, and am not asking for advice on how to go about it.

However, some of this is just what I don't understand or agree with. I would confidently say that if my sweater got a bit wet I wouldn't be very upset about it. It wasn't even soaked, it was more like one spot around the belly button region. He also had a shirt on underneath, and it was late so I figured he was going to go change soon, anyway. We were also in our dorm building, so it was not as big of a deal as if it were outside or somewhere else. Furthermore, we are all very close friends, and him and I had been making jokes and doing perfectly fine all night.

Anyway, I just want to get some other opinions on this. I really don't understand being so upset about a slightly wet shirt, but I would like to know if there's something I'm not thinking of. AITA?",0.5
"AITA: Mother In Law Sick, feel like life on hold Husband and I met in 2019, 26F 41M
-Both plan on moving out of area (we live in a very rural area)
-Meet MIL: Now 73. Very sweet widow, lives alone in remote rural area. BUT very stubborn. Husband is only child. Husband doesn’t get mad, but does around mom. 
-2020-2021: Two years of Covid= two years to miss out on things together (concerts, travel)
-End of 2021: Husband proposes. 
-April 2022: MIL diagnosed with 3A lung cancer. Despite us telling her months before to get her cough checked out.
-MIL lives in an ever remote area of our county (closet hospital 1hr 30 min away) 
-We are lucky: family friends own home down street of hospital we could stay at. Large and spacious.
-Summer of 2022: Chemo and radiation for several weeks, didn’t look good, got better but very slowly..
-Wedding: July of 2023.
-MIL is mostly better but still struggling with health.
-Husband obviously worried about her, but she never listens to us.

Now: 
-MIL recently got sick, her local shitty hospital missed her phnemonia. 
-We recommended her to consider moving from her home closer to us. She tells us we are “far” (we are near all major stores and hospitals)
-we live 1hr 30 min away. Not easy for us to get to her. Husband works night shifts for several days in row.
-MIL has been admitted to the better hospital near us for a couple days. Heart issues, dizziness, gets fatigued very easily. This has been going on for some time since treatment. 
-Spoke with Case Worker: Suggests either she moves, we live with her, or she lives with us. As things have been getting worse. 
-There’s no home health or in-home support services that goes to where she lives
-I don’t feel comfortable her living with us because: I have a cat (she’s allergic) we live in a two story house (house part is upstairs, she has a hard time walking, it’s a small two bedroom home with no privacy. 
-I don’t feel comfortable living with her: Her house is cluttered, there’s no room or privacy. Husbands job too far away.
-Worried about her getting on our nerves
-worried about our relationship being affected

AITA: I love my husband, he loves his mother, therefore I love her too (or feel obligated to take care of her). But, my husband and I just started our lives together. I want to have children, but with the poor healthcare wear we live, I’m uncomfortable being in that vulnerable position. Plus, we have been planning on moving out of here. But, because my MIL lives alone in the middle of nowhere, I feel stuck here. We were planning on going on our honeymoon this year . But once again, I feel like “What’s the point of planning anything because of MIL?” I know marrying my husband of the unfortunate reality of when everything is happening. But, I want to focus on our lives but I feel like its stop-go with MIL. It’s not her fault, but she also doesn’t listen to us . AITA for feeling this way? ",0.41
"AITAH for fat-shaming my future Sil I(24f) was sorta obese as a teenager and was bullied and fat shamed by my brother, Matt (27m) and his fiance, Siera(27f) in high school. My brother and his fiance were highschool sweethearts.theu started dating when they were 16 and got engaged last year in June. 
I got into a college in another state and met my then bf, John(25m) when I was 21.
Matt's and Siera's wedding is in 2 months 
A week ago I went back to my hometown to meet my parents and everyone else as well as introduce them to John. Everyone expected to see the old fat me but I had gotten quite a glow up. Well that is because John and i used to go to the gym,library as well as basketball dates. Due to this he and i are very fit. I have gotten rather healthier both mentally and physically. And each weekend when John and i used to go out we used to eat our favourite dishes and food that would make us happy. Hence, he and I had gotten in a healthly relationship with food, exercise as well as ourselves.
Well my mum and dad were very happy to meet John and we're glad that I was in a good relationship.
Well, Siera had a bit of an unpleasant reaction seeing my current situation. Well as it turns out, the girl that bullied my for my weight herself had turned obese.
So yesterday, John and i along with Matt and Siera went out for dinner. It was weekend and I was quite hungry so i ordered some heavy food(I was gonna pay my share of the bill). While Siera only ordered a salad. when she heard my order she freaked out and started screaming at me that i ordered junk food and all just to make her jealous of my weight. And she started demanding that i change my order. 
Matt was also on her side and insisted that I just eat a salad for her sake. I told him that why doesn't he eat one if he wants to make her feel good about herself. They both went off on my about how much of a bitch I am and that how I am fat-shaming her. 
Then they said that neither me nor John is invited at their wedding.
John just simply called the waited and asked him to shift him and i to a couple's table and bring our order there

Matt and Siera told all of our relatives a twisted version of their story and everyone is mad at me for fat Shaming her

"AITA for defending myself against sexism? I (25F) have been recently looking for an apprenticeship as a farrier (someone who treats horse lower limb, applies and makes horseshoes etc.). My dad was a farrier his whole life, and he died last year. He taught me so much as a kid and teenager, and really built up my passion for the job. I used to help him sometimes, doing blacksmithing and handing him tools while he showed me what to do etc. 

Last year I was at university, but when I graduated, I decided to walk in my dad's footsteps instead of pursuing a bachelor's degree.

I asked at a local horse care store if they knew of anyone local taking apprentices, as I'm new to the area, and an awesomely sweet manager gave me a list of potential guys who take apprentices on. The top recommendation was for a man called Dave (not his real name, but want to protect his identity). She (manager) told me that Dave is her farrier, is the top of the field in the area, and often works on racehorses.

I messaged Dave yesterday asking if he was taking on any new apprentices. 

Today, he messaged me saying ""Yes depending on reference and experience. Who would it be for?""

I replied, ""Myself. No formal experience. My dad was a farrier and taught me a bit growing up.""

Without knowing anything about me other than my gender (my Facebook picture is me in my graduation uniform), he said, ""Please don't take this the wrong way. I shoe a lot of race horses and I would hate to take a young lady into that environment. I wouldn't want my daughter there at the track. I think you might be better suited for some who's shoes Ponies's. I hope you can understand""

I'm including spelling mistakes because I think it's important not to alter a story. I see a lot of people manipulating posts in AITA and that's not my intention. 

Anyway, I was extremely disappointed, but not that he said no. In fact, with minimal experience, I expected most people to say no, especially someone at the top of the field. What really got to me was his attitude towards women in the field. I'm not going to explain how his message is sexist, IYKYK.

I said to him, ""Oh I understand. Guess you're not the man I was told you were.""

He was professional about it and said ""All the best I hope you find someone.""

Unfortunately, his previous message had annoyed me to the point I made the stupid decision of lashing out. I wrote, ""Just wanted to let you know, I'm 25 and tougher than any of the blokes you've worked with. I was raised riding racehorses. I was recommended by an extremely sweet person who said you'd be the perfect fit, but instead you decided to be a sexist prick. Have a good life.""

I totally understand how wrong this was of me to say to when he was trying to be polite, but his reasoning is what bothered me. I fear I've ruined my chances in the industry by being rude, but I feel like I had to stand up for myself, as I'm sick of not being taken seriously just because I'm a woman.

"AITA for asking my SIL whether she remembered to straightened her hair? My(31f) husband’s sister (35f) lives in a different country. During summer she came to visit us after five years. She came with her kids but her husband didn’t come to our house- he went straight to his parents. They live 30 mins from us. 

When I saw her, her hair was really really messy. I thought that it’s because of the long travel with two kids and thought nothing of it.  

Then my husband sat her down and asked her why she hasn’t been coming home, why doesn’t she call much and why is she in such a state??. She broke down in tears and told us everything about how emotionally abusive her husband is. 
He doesn’t let her visit the hair dresser, doesn’t help with the kids then harasses her for not earning any money. 

My husband got extremely angry but she stopped him from confronting her husband. She just put her head in my lap and cried for at least 2-3 hours. And then my MIL requested me if I would help her detangle SIL’s hair. 

We both got to work. It took us about 6 days to detangle months of matted hair. Then I deep conditioned, straightened it and cut off quite a bit so that it is manageable for her. All this was at her own request. And MIL insisted that she must maintain this and never let her hair get matted ever again. 

She is back to her country now. So me, my MIL and my husband call her everyday since 4months. 

And she straightens her hair once every two weeks. Combs daily. Trims it herself. Is looking for a job and formulating an exit plan from the marriage.

Now yesterday I was visiting my parents and got on a call with SIL and she told me that she had an interview and I asked her whether she straightened her hair. She said yes and proudly showed my how she had styled it. 

My younger sister (24f)was in the room and after I hung up she called me a racist asshole, colonial and whitewashed for asking someone to straighten her hair. I Couldn’t even reply to her as I was so stunned?

So aita?

Note: We are all Irani. But my husband, his sister and his mom have thick curly hair and this is how they showed me they manage it.",0.02
"AITA for ""ruining our vacation""??? So this is my first Reddit post on here but I have got something to get off my damn chest😭😭 So basically rn, my mom (54F) and I (18F) are in vacation in Japan. My whole family is well aware of her narcissistic and entitled tendencies so I was already feeling a bit nervous being on vacation with her alone, but I tried to look past it because it's cool that I get to visit Japan!!! Anyways, i've been getting increasingly annoyed and embarrassed being with her here. It's as if she has NO social awareness and respect for the people here. She's the type to stop in the middle of a moving crowd to take photos, and guess what, she's done that SO many times here. I feel so embarrassed each time because I know that Japan is like a culture of respect so every time she does stuff like this, I just wanna hide, but she's the only person I ""have"" here, so, it's a bit difficult to simply ignore her. Another incident- We were at this store shopping for boots, and when she wanted to check for sizes, she just approached the sales lady from the back and rudely asked ""This one do you have M"" with like NO ""excuse me"" or whatever, and in a very mean tone😭 Moreover, when the lady finished assisting us, she didn't even say thank you😭 she just walked away. After that, I called her out on being rude and disrespectful to the people here. I basically just asked her to SAY THANK YOU AND EXCUSE ME. She then replied with ""Whatever. It doesn't matter. As long as I can buy stuff."" 😁😁😁 Oh my god. I continued to call her out and she YELLEEDDDDD AT ME in the mall ""THEN YOU DONT HAVE TO COME WITH ME. YOU'RE ALWAYS CRITICIZING ME"" ... Ma'am you bought the tickets a year in advance. This trip is also my birthday trip😭 Oh yea, my dad was supposed to come with us, but he got hurt and cant walk, so he couldn't join us. Anyways now i'm like not talking with my mom. I already told my sisters about this and she said to just walk away and shop on my own and meet with my mom after like an hour or something- Yea I'll probs do that but like i'm scared to shop on my own but it'll probs be better than shopping with my mom😭 And now she's all pissy and mad at me for ""ruining our vacation"" AITA🤬❌❌",0.18
"AITA for telling my roommates they’re just lazy employees? Basically, we had an argument as my roommates noticed I (25M) worked long hours/unpaid overtime and work way above my job description as a legal administrator for a law firm. I voluntarily taken on paralegal/trainee solicitor tasks on top of my role as an admin to gain experience as much as possible regardless of the title and pay; experience is my priority, and even if I get paid as a admin regardless of working as a paralegal every now and then, I’ve never had an issue and don’t care about title or pay at the moment as that will come along when I decide I’m ready to move up. My company has never crossed my personal life, and I have never had an issue when it’s come to my wellbeing.

However, my roommates badger me saying I’m just being used and exploited, and what I’m doing is basically pointless and won’t get me anywhere, to which I’ve told them that they’re just lazy employee and unambitious, and that they won’t understand as they’re not motivated.

"AITA: Navigating Tensions with My College-Grad Son Over Finances and Attitude My elder son, who is 20, graduated early from university and is home before he leaves for his first job in San Francisco in March.

I paid for his education, and note that he opted for an out-of-state university, which isn't cheap.

After the first year of dorm life, he wanted to move into an apartment with friends, and we paid $1,300 per month. So, I've been asking him to help me file that expense with his 529 account so we can get the money back. 

I asked him in December, and he said he would look into it.I asked him again three days ago, and he looked at me and said, 'Why is it my problem?' Obviously, I was mad and yelled at him, calling him useless, and stopped talking to him.I also froze his American Express card since he has his own account and savings from internships.

My wife tells me I'm the asshole because he's just a kid, and I should let it go, talk to him, and remember he's here for another month. However, I'm not just upset about this situation. I understand he's great academically, but attitude matters. He doesn't do anything around the house to help. Even when asked to help with groceries when we ask him to go get something, he makes a face! I even want to take him off the car insurance; it would save me $1,000 more. 

Please give me some honest replies; I'm really at a loss. I also take mental health meds and decided to keep away from him for his peace and mine as well. I don't know when I'll talk to him, but my wife tells me I should start talking to him right away.",0.38
"AITA for accepting the prize money for winning a game I didn't know I was playing? So I (21F) went to my grandads (80M) house last week and he handed me a jar full of cash with my name on it. He told me to count it and it came to £3200. I asked him what it was for and he explained the rules of the game he'd been playing with the whole family:

From the 1st of December 2023, to the 31st December 2023, everytime a member of the family visited him, he'd put £100 in their jar for every hour they spent with him. At the end of the month, the person who spent the most time with him would receive all of the money in their jar, and the others would get nothing. He obviously didn't tell anybody that he was doing this so that no one spent extra time with him to get the money. 

I won his ""game"" by £600, so 6 hours more than the person who came second (my uncle). 

At first I didn't want to accept the money, only because I didn't think it was right to play games with people without them knowing, especially not your family. But after a while he convinced me to take my prize money because I ""earned it"".

When I got home, I told my parents about the money and explained his game to them. I told my mum where she came on the scoreboard (4th) and she was understandably upset at her father for making us unknowingly compete with each other. Then she told the rest of the family via a group chat. 

So now pretty much my whole family is mad at my grandad for doing this, but also me for accepting the money. He is an old man and he's not exactly a millionaire, so they think that I should have refused the money and confronted him for what he did. I think that if he was willing to play this game then he obviously has no problem with giving the money away, and he did insist on me taking it. Also, he's always been a weird guy, so although I don't agree with what he did, I'm not too surprised, so I don't think I should have had to start an argument with him about it.",0.09
"WIBTA if I told my best friend to stop intruding on my situationship? I'm having this situationship with a guy (Luke) recently, starting around 3 weeks ago. We got really close because we like similar books and share the same opinions. We usually hang around on campus at college and have no interaction outside of that other than texts. 

The problem is that whenever I hang out with him, my best friend (Mary) tends to interrupt us continually. She calls me on my phone over and over and it creates a break in the flow of our conversation, and often demands that I leave him and accompany her for tasks I know she can do herself. She also doesn't have a positive reaction when I talk about Luke. 

I always make sure to hang out with her separately so it's not like I'm ditching her for a random guy, and I also don't talk about him that much when it's just me and her. It came to the point where in order to have a proper hangout with Luke without interruptions I had to ask Mary's permission beforehand.

I had a long talk with her about this recently, told her how it made me feel and that I know that it's not her intention but it ends up coming across as judgemental. She explained that its because she has had other friends ditch her for boys in the past, but also apologized and promised to act differently. Next meetup with him she calls me again twice on the phone.

I was a little pissed off but I let it slide. Recently Luke said some stuff that could be considered red flags, when I relayed this to her she had the biggest I-told-you-so attitude and remarked that even after this I would run back to him. I was really hurt and didn't expect her to act like this. Now I'm wondering if I would be TA if I confronted Mary again and told her to knock it off.

"AITA for telling my MIL she can wait to see my daughter Me (29f) and my husband (29M) have a beautiful 1 year old daughter. 

Backstory: A year before we had our daughter, we lived 2 hours away from each other. When I fell pregnant, we moved into my husbands place. I'm very family orientated, with 3 younger sisters who I adore and are my best friends. Last year, when I had our baby, my husband and I moved elsewhere (2 hours from his upbringing/family, 4 hours from mine).

I went back to work when my daughter was 5 months. My MIL travels two hours each week to and from us, to look after my daughter for 2 days a week. My husband minds our daughter the other 3 days. 

My mum has 3 kids under 15, with the youngest 2 being 8 and 11 - so she's unable to drive 4 hours to babysit obviously. However, without asking, she's happily offered to babysit at her place and come and stay with us during school holidays (12 weeks each year) to mind our daughter. Coming up to the holidays, it was agreed my family would spend Christmas and new years with us - and leave on 3rd Jan. on the 4th jan, I took my daughter to see my MIL, as I understood she would've missed her.

Current issue: for two weeks (8th-19th jan) work is extremely busy and I need either my mum or MIL here helping me with meals & looking after my baby. Obviously I would prefer it to be my mother as I don't spend time with her during the year - BUT I asked my MIL first if she wanted to come and babysit during those two weeks. She said no, so I asked my mum to (who said yes). 

It's the start of the second week and this morning my husband asked me if he could go take our daughter to see his mum. I was shocked and so hurt. (My mum barely gets to spend time with her and you want to take her away from me and my mum??) 

My husband doesn't like me spending more than 2 nights away from him, and as mentioned above, with the four hours distance and my mum having younger kids with school/sporting commitments my mum only sees our daughter during school breaks, compared to my MIL who sees her weekly in the school term. Because of this, my husband believes my MIL needs to see her more because she misses her and is more of a grandmother to our daughter.

My husband thinks I'm trying to hurt my MIL or play games with his mum/my MIL. I've told him that she can come stay with us next week, after my family leave. 

He thinks that his mum/my MIL deserves to see our daughter because she looks after her 2 days a week.

"AITA for going off on my fellow employee after she quit? This is a bit of a long story so we will start with names. My boss (56) will be called Donna, my employee (20) will be called Sarah, and my regional manager (probably mid 50’s)will be called Jenny. And I(Krystal) am 20. 

For the whole summer it was me and my boss at the salon and in the last week of September we hired Sarah. Donna worked with her for one day before she broke her foot. After that she was out till December 14th so it was just me and Sarah. Backstory on Sarah: she graduated cosmetology school when she graduated high school in 2021 this is 2023 and it’s her first salon job and so she has forgotten everything she learned. 

Anyway, after Donna was out I had to basically do the managers job and train Sarah. I personally don’t know all the things that I would’ve needed to train her in but I did my best with how young I am and the fact that I’m just an employee. 

The first two weeks I worked every day of the week because I would have to help Sarah because she can’t do fades. By the third week I was hoping she would do fine alone so I could recover from being burnt out and when I came back I was watching her and every fade she did I had to go and blend it better or basically do the whole thing. That’s when it started to bug me. The whole time she’s there she’s on her phone as well. Her whole time working here she took out the trash once. I took it out 4 times. 

And we are supposed to have a secret shopper come in and it’s an automatic fail if we are on our phones. By the time Donna is back I hate Sarah. In her first 2 months she took off 6 unscheduled days off leaving me alone on the busiest days which is Friday and Saturday. When Donna was back she wasn’t back full time. She has soft bone that is still healing so her foot is in a boot. Donna is gathering trash and I am cleaning up after a haircut and Sarah is just sitting in her chair on her phone and watching Donna gather trash. She does offer to help at all just watches. 

Then Donna asked her about 30 minutes before we close to fold the towels and capes. She was on her phone while she was doing them and only did half of them in 30 minutes she leaves right at 6. Never stayed to finish the job she started. I asked her in the morning why she didn’t finish them her excuse was it was my time to go. Then we all get in trouble for phones and it’s really only her. After that she’s still on it. She puts in her two weeks for “classes” which it was after she got told no for mopping in the morning and a week goes by and we leave her a note to take the trash out and it said “I expect you to take the trash out Krystal and I can’t be doing everything around here” signed Donna. Which I did write the note but after that she quit and didn’t finish her two weeks. The next day I find so much trash of hers that she had left for us to clean. So am I the ahole for going off on her after she quit?",1.0
"AITA for calling my aunt a bitch in our Airbnb in Hawaii AITA for calling my aunt a bitch in our airbnb while vacationing in Hawaii

Me and my aunt used to talk on the phone everyday . One day she was in a bad mood ( I was 13 at the time) and she went on a whole rant about how if I wasn’t in her life that she would be at peace and how I was a moron. She called my whole family morons and said that everything I do is worthless. I stopped calling her after this and blocked her. 

A couple of years later ( I was 16)I was meeting with some family and we all went to vacation in Hawaii. I didn’t know she was going to be there and asked my family if she was coming because I saw some text messages of her saying she was checking into the airport . My family lied to me and said she wasn’t coming because they wanted it to be a surprise. I then told my family about the fight we had and they sided with me but still didn’t tell me she was coming.

I went to bed the first night and I woke up to my aunt tapping on me to wake me up. I didn’t say anything and just got out of bed and stormed off. My family then explained why I didn’t want to talk to her and I started crying . She started raising her voice saying “ when did I say that , she’s lying “. I think she just truly forgot about what she said. She then told me to shut up and said “ yeah I was wrong I meant to say that you’re the only idiot in your family “. 

I called her a bitch after that. 

She apologized after that and I was nice for the rest of the trip and she told me to call her after that when I got home while we were all leaving . I said I would but I never did.

"WIBTA for not wanting to help ex wife recover from elective cosmetic surgeries? Editing this down because original was removed y moderators, probly cuz of unnecessary description of sexual activity.    


I recently discovered my ex wife is sexually active with a married guy in a very casual and lewd way.  We've been divorced for a little over a year and we never had a very physical relationship. So I get it, she's a human woman with needs and we're divorced, she can do what she likes and while it's a bit shocking and always kind of a gutpunch to find this stuff out, i can't complain or be angry.  
  
I have told her that I'm always willing to help do stuff around house or things she needs help with, like cleaning gutters, moving heavy things, installing appliances, fixing electric, heavy yardwork, etc. And if she needs help with something like recovering from an appendectomy or some kind of surgery, I'm 100% there to do whatever needed. That won't change.  
  
However, she recently told me she plans to get a series of cosmetic surgeries like boob job, tummy tuck, thigh lift, vaginoplasty, etc., and so she'll need lots of help while recovering, including with showering, meals, errands, etc. While I'll certainly do everything needed to care for our child, I think it's weird and simp-like to be helping her with cosmetic elective surgeries whose only purpose is to be more physically attractive to other men. I was planning to tell her for those types of things, she should be having whoever's going to be using the results help her, not her ex husband and father of her child.

I mentioned that the choice is completely up to her and she can choose to help out with paying bills or not. But if she chooses not to help out, then she should not expect me to do half the chores around the house. She says that her money is her money and my money is our money. So what does she want to do with her money you may ask? Spend it all on herself. Despite that, she wants me to come back home from work and still help her out with the house work. 

I explained to her that if we both go to work for 8 hrs, and there’s an hour drive there and back from work(2 hrs) then I’ve put in 10 hrs of work into this relationship since I’m paying 100% of the bills. Whereas even if she puts in 8 hrs of work, and 2 hrs of travelling time, she has put in 0 hrs of work into the relationship since that’s all money she’s making to spend on herself. And I also said that if there’s a lot of chores that need to be done, let’s say 4 hrs of chores total, now If you want to split that up, that’s 2 hrs of house work for me and 2 hrs for her. Meaning ive put in 12 hrs of work into the relationship, whereas she’s only put in 2.

I just want to put a disclaimer that we were talking about daily chores as in cooking, and cleaning, and other stuff. I still don’t mind doing the traditionally manly chores like throwing out the trash, fixing things, building things, etc.

It just seems very selfish to me that she wants to spend all of her money on herself and expects me to spend all of mine on the bills and her, then she wants me to do other daily house work too. I’ve also given her the choice for her to help out financially and then I can do 50% of the house work so she has that option, but she isn’t satisfied and wants the best of both worlds. So anyways, AITA?",0.21
"AITAH for not wanting to play with my siblings Hi so this happened a few days ago and me and my mom are still tense about it. My mom (39f) and I (16f) have a very close bond we used to be on and off sometimes but now I feel like our relationship is very tight. Wednesday though my mom asked me to play with my sister (mind you I played with her earlier we painted our nails and did makeup) I wasn’t really in the mood to play with her (my sister is 5 so there’s a really big age gap). My mother got mad at me and cussed me out saying I’m evil and that I never want to do anything for them and some other stuff. And when I was trying to defend myself saying I already played with her and you’re always taking her side when she’s a brat she looked like she was going to hit me. She took my phone and was continuing to cuss me out bringing up that I would hang out with my bf but not my sister(my boyfriend is the same age as me we have more in common so ofc I like hanging out with him). My mom was basically an only child bc her and her brother had the same age gap me and my sister have. I feel like I might be the ah because maybe I’m not the best sister, but I also feel like it’s not my responsibility to accommodate to her kids and if I wanna be alone I should be able to. So I just wanna know if I’m the ah",0.17
"AITA for asking my fiancé not to smoke near me or in the house? 
English isn’t my first language and I don’t use reddit often so please bear with me, but I (19F) and my fiancé (20M) have been dating for 2 years and been engaged for 6 months.

I’ve always had a lot of trouble with my breathing, like a lot and one thing I can’t tolerate is any type of smoke. I don’t have a diagnosis, may I add but I feel like my chest is tightening and almost suffocation.

My fiancé recently started smoking, we have a very healthy relationship and we know how to communicate and make compromises. I knew he’d started smoking due to the smell lingering on our bedsheets and on him in general and also his breath, I immediately told him that I didn’t have a problem with it as long as it stayed outdoors and he agreed.

He started smoking on our balcony which was fine of course and also got a tongue scraper and mouth wash so I wouldn’t have to smell it, it was fine. I don’t know why but recently, around 3 weeks ago he’s been neglecting this promise we made. It started with me coming home to the smell of cigarettes and when I confronted him he was livid, like actual bloodcurdling screams in my face. I was upset but let it go just assuming it was a bad day at work, until it started happening over and over and over again. Every time I came home I’d have coughing fits.

So, I decided to sit him down and explain how I felt and why I felt the way I did. He told me that he is a grown man and has full authority to do whatever he wanted, I can’t dictate what he does which is most definitely true but I was never trying to do that and recently he’s been ignoring everything and even pulling out cigarettes and smoking in front of me. I really want some advice, I love him and leaving him isn’t an option.",0.1
"AITAH for bringing up my boyfriend as a point of conversation with my parents? Ok so, I (f 21) and boyfriend (m 25) have been together for three years. He’s recently just connected with my father and step mom over 3 months ago as we just moved back to where my dad lives. So last night at dinner my stepmom asked us “did you guys have work today?” I said no, my partner said no, and then I mentioned that my bf hadn’t gone to work yesterday due to the cold. My stepmom agreed it was a good decision. Later my bf tells me that I shouldn’t bring him up in conversation because it is common courtesy. I could very well be in the wrong here and I am just looking for someone to try and explain in detail how, as the conversation we had with my stepmom did not include very personal or sensitive information.

"AITA - for expecting my partner to help with the child as soon as he comes home from work? For some background context I’m 26 weeks pregnant, suffering from excruciating pelvic girdle pain, and extremely low iron which causes me to feel fatigued and quite dizzy, he comes home from work and if I ask him to change a nappy or do something related to the child I always get the same comment of “I’ve just walked in the door!! Let me change and go to the toilet in peace first” like, I don’t have that luxury of going to the toilet in peace!

To be honest I was really looking forward to going back to work after I’d had the first one just so I could have scheduled toilet breaks and lunch breaks/ have some sense of routine again, but he wanted a second child, so he knew I’d have to be a stay at home mum for a while and don’t get me wrong I do enjoy it … most of the time.

 It’s just difficult running around up and down after a toddler, bending over and on top of that we have 3 dogs which I walk everyday obviously no problem doing that, they’re my responsibility and I love them loads, but it’s a lot to do when you’re heavily pregnant and just not feeling great! I just feel there’s no appreciation for how difficult I’m finding it and anytime I say anything he gives me a jokey comment like “it’s your job!!” Which makes me feel like the a**hole for asking for help. 🥲",0.23
"AITA for expecting decent study notes and “ruining a friendship” over it? I (20F) is finishing my BA this spring, with my friend (20F). We met at the first week of uni, and became very close. The first year we did everything together, but after that we kinda drifted apart. We didn’t have classes together, and she usually declined my invites saying she is busy. I somewhat get why, she works beside school and lives a 2-hour-traintrip away from the capital (where I live). But still, you can make time for what you want, and I offered to go to her town multiple times, which she declined, saying there’s nothing to do there. 

The conlfict starts when we met at the year opening ceremony, and discussed our timetable. We found out that we have 2 lectures together, and there is one I can’t attend, and the other she can’t. So we made a deal, that we will take notes on that class we go, and give it to the other, for the one we can’t attend. 

I put a lot of effort in my notes: color coded it, put in a lot of spreadsheets and explained everything with examples. I wanted her to have the knowlege of the lectures, like she was there. She got a A on her exam, and thanked me. 

She sent me her notes a few days ago, and it is a mess. Block of texts, no bullet points, random pictures of slides without any context, and every topic is in multiple times (for example once from the lecture and one from the book or smth). And it is 120 pages long. I started to edit it, but only got through half of it in one day, and the exam is in 3 days. 

I asked her if she has an edited version, hoping that she accidetally sent me a first draft, but she said she hasn’t. She also said, that she told me it needed some editing (she did not, I’ve read through our messeges) and that it’s that way, because she couldn’t go to the lectures, so she just copy-pasted the slides. 

I got pretty angry at that, and wrote to her that going to the lectures was why we agreed to do this in the first place, and she was going back on her word. She argued back that she is busy and didn’t have time to go, nor to make good notes. I told her what she did was unfair and dishonest, and she happily used my notes, while knowing of her owns bad quality, and saying. She told me that I’m entilted and that “Hope you’re happy to ruin a friendship over some stupid notes”. 

But I think it’s not just about that. It is about the principle of respecting the deal we made, and not kicking me under the bus days before the exam. Also she is an A student, she one of the best in our grade, so it’s not like I should have expected a bad note. And if she can study from these without editing it first, good for her, but I think it’s reasonable to think that’s not true for most people. So AITA?",0.82
"AITA for not wanting to potentially be snowed in w my fiancés stepdaughter? My fiancé has a stepdaughter who I just don’t click w, we’ve had so many issues and reasons why I just don’t really care for her to be around me in general. But being that he’s not her biological father there’s no set arrangement as to when she comes over. She never asks to come over (which my fiancé blames on me) and when she does come over (when he asks her to) she doesn’t seem to want to be here, as she’s 13 and the oldest we have in the house is 5, she mostly wants to go hang w friends that live close by than actually be here. He’s mentioned her coming over today and there is a good chance we’re getting snow that should last a few days. AITA for not wanting to potentially be stuck w her in my house until Wednesday or so? I just don’t feel like worrying about cooking something she may not like, my kids tend to bother her which seems to annoy her sometimes, I just don’t feel like dealing w the extra effort but he makes me feel horrible for feeling this way.

"AITA for not allowing friends to come over until my kids get invited to theirs? I have 3 kids aged 13, 11, and 9. They frequently have friends over and have sleepovers, which I’m fine with. But I recently realised that despite having friends over at our house all the time, my kids have never been to their houses. My eldest has went to a friends for a birthday party but that’s it. They never get invited over and they certainly haven’t had a sleepover. 

We do have a bigger house than most, and maybe more room to accommodate extra kids, but I can’t help but feel like my kids are missing out on sleepovers at their friends. I’m the only mother who works full time among their friends’ parents, and I often feed the friends or buy them snacks when I get something for my kids. 

It seems quite rude to me as a parent to send your kids to someone else’s house and never returning the invite. Am I being unreasonable to expect some invitations in return?",0.44
"WIBTA for not going to my friend's birthday party bc my girlfriend can't come? My friend's birthday is in 2 weeks, and I feel like I have been outgrowing the friendship for certain reasons. 

Context is, a bit ago she confronted me saying that she didn't like my girlfriend and said that she's not good for me and I shouldn't be dating her. I didn't agree with what she was saying but I understood where her point of view of some of the concerning behavior was coming from, but did my best to explain that those things may seem that way out of context but weren't true. I felt like her approaching me and her comments were inappropriate and I've felt a bit uncomfortable being around her after this.

Of course after this happened I told my girlfriend about it and she was understandably very hurt that she said these things implying a certain nature about her, and also that my friend went to tell me instead of ever communicating with her. She texted my friend saying that she doesn't feel like she can trust her anymore and she that doesn't feel comfortable being around her anymore. 

My friend never responded (which when confronted about it she said that the response was unwarranted and extreme), which in turn just hurt my girlfriend's feelings more. My gf doesn't even want to look at my friend or be in the same room as her anymore. 

I'm put off by my friend's behavior, but we all share a friend group. Her birthday is in 2 weeks, and obviously she doesn't want my girlfriend to be there (and my gf doesn't want to go either). I don't really want to go but I know if I don't then my friend will be very let down, and at this point it'll further push me out of the friend group too.

So I'm in a bit of a situation now.. WIBTA if I choose to not go to my friends birthday because my girlfriend can't come? 

Or, WIBTA to my girlfriend for leaving her behind? Our friends are all going and I know it'll make her really sad to be left alone. ",0.64
AITA for being unavailable when my friend’s dad passed away? my friend’s dad passed away 2 weeks ago due to natural causes. I’m quite close to her i’ve known her for 4 years and she is obviously dealing with her dad’s passing and is grieving with her family and close friends. Now i have a long list of many mental illnesses i tend to distance myself and become detached i have depression borderline personality disorder and derealisation. these 2 weeks have been uneventful for me i’ve been stuck in my home suffering from a derealisation episode i haven’t eaten or picked up the phone to see what’s going on in the real world. My friend has been trying to reach out to me so she could tell me about her father and have a shoulder to cry on.  just yesterday i snapped out of my episode and checked my phone to see 54 missed calls from mutual friends calling me an asshole and many texts from my friend calling me the biggest insensitive fucking asshole a horrible insensitive bastard and told me to never ever talk to her again. I done fully blame her my mental illnesses get in the way of everything all the time i really want to be there for her she’s my friend i love her so much i always want to be here for her and be the best version of myself for her but i can’t control when i have a depressive episode or derealisation one. I really don’t want to use my mental health as an excuse to be an asshole never ever. I honestly don’t know if im completely an asshole for this i feel like i am she needed me at her lowest and i wasn’t there.

"AITA For Being Upset with Relative For Disinheriting My Mother I, a 34M, confronted my 1st cousin, who made a real estate transaction w/ my grandparents, that they fully didn't understand, thus disinheriting my mother in the process.

People at Play:

My grandparents (Jim & Mary)

Their 2 kids: My Aunt (Sue) & My Mother (Dolly)

My 1st Cousin (My Aunts son) (John)

Jim, and the generation before him were respected local farmers, w/ over 600 ac. of farmland. By the time my generation (My brother and 2 1st cousins) came along, Jim was in retirement age and the farm business was all but gone.  As the years went by after his retirement, his money started dwindling, from bad spending habits. His response to the slow loss of liquid cash was to start selling the family land, which all of the family sat back and watch him do. All were bad real estate deals, with most of them being criminally sold under market value. 

Fast forward to 2024, he is now 84 years old, total land ownership is down 10 acres, metal capacity is super limited, has gotten lost in the hometown he grew up in multiple times, 2 long hospital stays. All in all, not in a state where he should be making any decision on his personal finances. 

His remaining land is broken up in 2 parcels, Parcel #1 being his house + 5 acres, and parcel #2 being barns and shops on the other 5 acres. His Will states that his oldest daughter (Sue) gets the house and the land that is attached to it (parcel #1), 100%. The other parcel will be split between Dolly 60%, and Sue 40% (Parcel #2).

My 1st Cousin, John, has never left the farm land town and does small farming activity as a side Hustle. Over the years, he has has free reign on Parcel #2, using the barns to store his tractors and other equipment, at no expense. 

Recently, John brokered a deal with Jim to obtain, what was supposed to be only (1)  barns on Parcel #2. His reasoning behind buying was it would ensure Jim & Mary wont sell off anymore land outside of the family. The settled on $10k for the barn on parcel #2. John, consults w/ no one in the family, has a deed drawn up, and transaction is done. Dolly gets notification that the deed is not only for the barn, but for ALL of Parcel #2. (Dolly's future 60% inheritance)

Jim & Mary are asked if they understood what they sold, both re-iterated that they indeed DID NOT intend to sell off the entire parcel in the deal. 

We call a family meeting and confront why he made this transaction w/o consulting w/the family about the deal. John immediately blows up because he is being accused of theft, and taking advantage of the elderly. Says he will not undo the transaction and says if we want to do something about it, we would have to take him to court.

Land in our area is currently selling for ~$20k per acre. So, 5 ac. + barns & shops, for $10k is a pretty sweet deal, right?

"AITA for asking my roommate not to invite her friend over? I (19M) have always been vocal about how I am not comfortable having girls coming to the room to my roommate 24(M). I live in a triple room with him and we had another roommate that left a few months ago. I have always said since the first day that I don't feel comfortable in the same space as other girls. 24(M) has always agreed with me about not wanting girls in the room.

 24(M) made a new friend that's a girl. He wanted to invite her over to our room and he asked me if it would be okay to do that when I am not home. I agreed and told him that he can go ahead. They also asked me if I ever met their friend if I wanted to hold a conversation and be friends. I told them that I wouldn't like that and would just keep it at a simple hello.

A week ago, 24M invited their friend for a short amount of time and I agreed. His friend kept talking to me which I found odd since I told 24M I am not comfortable with that but I brushed it off as them forgetting to tell them about it. Later on, I discovered that 24M asked his friend to talk to me so we could get to know each other. I got angry because it overstepped my boundaries but I was used to them always acting that way and I didn't want a fight.

This week, 24M asked me if I was okay with inviting their friend over while I was there. At the time we were having a conversation where he told me that his friend wanted to ask me a few questions about a subject I knew about. I agreed. A few days after they asked the same question and I thought that they would invite their friend when I was not home as agreed or when I'm home but for a short time. However, I recieve a text that his friend would stay for a long time while I am home so I tell them that I am not comfortable with that. 24M then told me that I never said I'm uncomfortable with girls and that he thought what I said didn't apply to them. I started telling him the situations where we spoke about this and how last week we agreed that the friend would come when I'm not home. I also told him that he could ask our previous roommate and he would confirm what I said.

24M ended the conversation by saying that I am a liar and a manipulater because ' I never said that I didn't want girls in the room and they never agreed with me ' and how it is their room and they should invite who they want. I understand that it is a shared room but it was something I've always been vocal about and something they agreed with me on.

"AITA for not comforting my girlfriend after she insulted me? 
I (26M) and my girlfriend (23F) have been together for 5 years, our relationship has always been good although it took a hit after my girlfriend got demoted at work.

I don’t believe I have any right to go into details as it’s her experience but Ill obviously give the necessary details, she got demoted at work not because of her job performance but because the consensus was there was another person better for the job. She never got fired, but that day she quit. My job is well paying, it’s enough for us to live paycheck to paycheck until she got a new job. I wasn’t going to argue with her about it as I understood being demoted really hurt her feelings, she’s always had a hard time facing criticism and has always prioritized her career.

For the next couple of days she would cry non stop, to the point where her entire face was swollen and I never cared about her appearance but it looked painful and whenever I’d try to bring her ice for her swollen face she would scream at me, berate me and tell me no one cared about me and I won’t lie it would most definitely upset me but yet again I love her so I never said anything. 

After around 6 days I decided to propose the idea of getting a new job, or maybe helping around the house as it was difficult for me to work my shift and come home to clean, cook and do both of our laundry. She agreed and wasn’t rude or anything of that nature although she never got a job and never helped around so a few days later I decided to help her look for a job yet this time she got in my face started screaming, like actual headache inducing screaming at me and calling me a bunch of insults.

This time I was really upset and mad, so I decided not to speak to her, I’d never insult a girl may I add so I never said anything I just walked away. The next day shes up again crying, I didn’t actually see it but it was loud enough for me to hear. I got dressed for work and left, when I got home she told me that it was hurtful for me to walk right by her and I was really confused as I thought she didn’t want me to comfort her as when I did it’d turn into her yelling at me, I tried to respond but she walked away. I’ve tried to talk to her multiple times, she’s always silent. Not a single word, I still hear her crying sometimes, and I feel bad yet whenever I try to say something it’s always silence or her throwing whatever is nearby at me. So AITA?",0.1
"AITA for refusing my daughter name her newborn after my brother My (53m) daughter (31f) recently announced her second pregnancy to the whole family who was delighted as she has been struggling since her first one.  
My brother died at 27, I was 21. My mom was always a very career oriented person, we own a family business which he was supposed to take over. We never talked about him, ever. One month after his accident she had already erased his name from all the official papers, got his belongings sold or given and took me as her successor in his place. I was angry at her for showing no empathy, at my dad for saying nothing and letting his son’s memory be scratched over like it was nothing, but still I said nothing.  
I got married to Jenna (55f),a good friend. She was there for me through tough times, when my brother’s absence was unbearable. We had three beautiful daughters before we got divorced amicably. We’re still friends to this day. I got remarried to Sam (50f) under my mother’s advice. We had kids and she took over my mom’s business as she was more fit than I in those matter.  
Everyone knows of my brother even though I never talk about it because I just can’t. I know I am at fault for not wanting to stop grieving, but I do not know how to deal with this loss either way. Helen is now fixed on giving her son my brother’s name, not because she wants to honor him as she never knew him but because it’s “pretty and unique”.  
Jenna told her it was not a good idea and that there was plenty of pretty names she could use. But she is making it personal even though she knows how painful it is for me. Sam is totally on her side as she find me irrational and stupid, she treats me like a mad man and told me I have no say in how Helen deal with her kids. I do get her point, but I find their behaviour cruel and the reason is straight up stupid. I could have understand if Helen was not so impersonal, like this name meant nothing. Just “pretty and unique”. Am I crazy for refusing to let her use a name that means so much to me, that bring so much painful memories to mind for a reason as superficial as that? I asked her and she brushed it off saying after so long it doesn‘t make sense to still associate his name with painful memories, instead of creating new ones with her child. I don’t understand how giving his name to someone else will erase the pain of losing him.  People grief differently and I was never one to talk about it. But just that one time I would like for them to let me be. Helen said I was being self centred as everyone found the name pretty and I was just trying to make it about me.  Her and Sam are not believing my pain to be genuine.  
They are now siding together and have been talking to my other kids who are taking turn to make me change my mind, I feel cornered and except Jenna, nobody is actually trying to see things from where I stand.

I habe been with these friends since primary school and we are now 21 so i grew up with these people and we all went to the same school but now i live in TX. I i normaly spend weekends at my girlfriends house because i work a 9-5 office job in the finance department during the week and she normally takes me home on the sunday so i can make my sunday sessions. This week MLK jr day is on the monday so im off on a week day for once. I wanted to spend and extra day with my girlfriend so i asked my friends if we could push the session to monday so i could do that. They said no and i said ""thats fine i can figure something out then"" so my idea was to play the session from my girlfriends gaming PC which frankly is better than mine. Here is where the asshole comes in. I let my friends know in our discord server that im sorry in advance for a lower mic quality since im not at my own pc witn my voice acting mic. The Dungeon masters response to this was

 ""Next time stick to it at home, the background noise is a nusance and the mic is ear curdling."" 

I said ""sorry im not going to make (gf's name)
drive me 20 mins each direction just so i can play dnd"" 

His response was to tell me he isnt letting me play the session.

I asked him why and he said ""i got better things to do than listen to yankee babble when im trying to host."" referimg to my texan gf in the same room as me.

I told him ""wtf, You know what. Im not gonna argue with you. You can do the session without me. Dont ever talk about my partner like that again"" 

He says ""Fragile energy if thats what yankee babble means to you. Do what you want, these are the boundries I set last time. not abiding by them is your choice not mine""

Id like to add here that he had never mentioned any rules about this before. He made this up during the argument. Id wish i was smart enough to stick to my word and not argue with him but talking about my partner like that is a fastrack to pissing me off and me being a scottish im not one to sit quiet and take peopes crap.

I told him come talk to me when u are ready to apologize to both of us for what he said.

He then tells me i owe him 4000 apologies for  all the other incidents i mentioned earlier.
That he started quite evidently.

He then decides to tell me he never said anything bad about my gf at all. And to this i quoted what he said word for word and said ""read what you type, you actual weapon"" and stopped talking to him.

"AITA for gym argument over machine? AITA

My husband (29M) and I (28F) went to our usual gym for a leg/back day. We started off using some leg machines while keeping an eye on the Smith machine, which we usually use for squats and sometimes hip thrusts. The Smith was free so we moved there next. We did a couple of sets of squats and a young woman came over and asked how many sets we had left. I said three (as we planned to do hip thrusts) 

She frowned and said she had actually been using the machine earlier and had left her water bottle there (an empty plastic supermarket one left next to the wall). I thought that was unreasonable but was willing to give her the benefit of the doubt so suggested we do one more set each and then we’d leave. She agreed. My husband (non-native English speaker) then asked if she wanted to just work in with us instead and she said ‘What?’, ‘What?’ rudely several times and that she didn’t understand him, even though he asked perfectly clearly. I told her don’t worry about, we’ll just do a set each and she can take it. She left and went to another area of the gym. 

We finished one more set and my husband was annoyed at me for offering her the machine as she hadn’t been there for at least 20 minutes before we started but was trying to reclaim it. I said she seemed aggressive and we could do our other exercises elsewhere no problem. 

We went to the squat racks opposite the Smith to do some deadlifts, leaving it free for her. Usually I tell people who have been waiting when we’re done, but as she had been quite rude in her manner, I didn’t feel like it and felt it was up to her to monitor the availability of the machine.

She didn’t come back and three teenage girls took the Smith. She came back 3 or so minutes later and started raising her voice at the girls that she had been trying to use the Smith ‘but a pair of fucking idiots had taken it from her’.

I go over at this point and say ‘Excuse me, are you talking about us? We finished one set and left the machine free for you.’ 

She complained I hadn’t come over to tell her or told the three teenagers not to use it. I calmly told her I wasn’t her gym servant and it was up to her to find and occupy machines. She then screamed at me that I was fucking bitch and that we had taken ‘her machine’ and that I was trying to intimidate her with ‘my man’. Husband was standing to the side cringing but not saying anything to her. I said it’s not your machine, it’s the gym’s. She called me a crazy bitch and said I should be embarrassed. I said ‘No, you should be’ and walked away. She then left the Smith machine (again!), came back with a friend and sat on the bench (occupying the machine) for at least 45 minutes, trash talking me for most of that time.

"WIBTA if i cleaned my stepsisters side of the room? Keeping it short. I (16f) share a room & bathroom with my stepsister (17f). Im currently rearranging my side, basically taking down my dresser to make room for a desk, and deep cleaning my side. In the past I’ve tried cleaning her side but she always gets mad Im touching her stuff. The issue is her side is quite gross, there’s towels and dirty clothes all in a pile, and so much stuff under her bed. Mind you our room isn’t all that big. I’m not gonna move ANYTHING of hers ( throw away), I just want to wash the towels and clothes on the floor and put them on her bed. I also need to vacuum and her stuff is in the way. She’s at her Moms now and every time she comes she saids she’ll clean it but never does. So wibta if I cleaned her side?",0.1

I usually stay in his bedroom and use his bathroom while he’s gone and clean it when its time for him to come back.
So i went to the bathroom just now to take a piss and my sister scolded mid-piss banging on the door like crazy she was like “are you f-ing kidding me?!” I was like “i’m just taking a piss?! Is my urine really that dirty?!” And she kept scolding me and made me clean the toilet after myself like who tf cleans a toilet after each use?!",0.17

"AITA for texting my boyfriend's roommate I (26F) am in a long distance with my boyfriend (27M). We've been together for a long time now. Last night, he called me after a drunk session with his friends while returning back home. He was significantly away from his home at late hours and seemed pretty drunk to me. For as long as he was in the call he lost track of things he was saying, and he didn't find any public transport or uber to go either. The way he spoke made me worried to I dediced to text his roommate that he was drunk and unable to find anything. 
To give it more context he constantly mumbled that he was okay and he might walk home if he didn't find anything (it was 2 AM) and the place is known to be unsafe. The way he was talking he sounded quite drunk and not merely tipsy. Somehow he got a hunch that I told his roommate because he called him to ask where he was. His friends made up an excuse that they were nearby to pick him, seeing that I told them he sounds angry that I told them about him. Mind it he was alone and quite far away from his home. 

Now he is angry that I contacted them behind his back and wanted to act like a ""parent"". He said that this was a breach of trust. He was vulnerable while speaking to me and this made him look like a baby. He is angry at his room mate for coming to pick him up as he thinks he was capable of ""walking back"" perfectly fine. He didn't need to be ""babied"".

My point is, if it was me he would have done the same. It's a simple matter of care and concern. Since we're living apart it's natural to be worried. I didn't tell him at first that I had told them because I had a hunch, he might get angry and not meet them. I didn't want to take that risk at that condition. And since he was drunk and out away late at night, something bad could happen, even if he thinks that he can take care of himself just fine. 

He told me that he can never trust me anymore because of that. And it's over. 

AITA for calling his roommate? How else could or should I have handled this issue being away?

Edit- a few grammatical and sentence errors. 

I would like to mention he doesn't indulge in drinking often and definitely doesn't have a drinking problem.",0.03
"AITA Upcoming Wedding AITA- my stepson got engaged last year under the premise that they would wait a few years for them to get out of college to marry. A few months after the engagement, they started looking for venues and moved up their timeline to this fall. My husband and I originally said at time of engagement we would give them money towards the wedding so this also sped up the timeline for saving the money. We asked during the beginning stages of planning if they would choose a date that my girls, his stepsisters of several years that he is as close as he can be with 10+ year age difference, would be able to attend. He has seen first hand/and has heard stories about my narssisant exhusband and how everything is difficult. We told him early on that their dad would not switch time with us or would make things extremely difficult if he did allow it. IYKYK. He asked for dates we had the girls, which was sent (pretty much week on/week off). Next thing we know, the date was set and deposits made, on a date we don't have the girls. The venue is a town about 2 hours from their home in a location that doesn't make a lot of sense and doesn't have relevance to the couple (first met, first date, family lives in, etc). My husband and I were devestated. My husband feels caught in the middle and doesn't want to lose his son over this but can't understand the decisions. I don't think stepson knows the extent of the devastation bc of my husband hoping it fixes itself. Stepson just said, it was the only weekend available, maybe you can ask their dad if they could come and dismissed it. We had been talking to the girls since the engagement about the excitement of us going to their wedding. I said originally I wasn't going to go but have switched to going for my husband. I've never felt like such a ""step"" for myself and my girls. His mom abandoned him after her and my husband's divorce so I thought I was a mom figure and we had a family. This isn't the stepmom and mother in law I wanted to be to this couple but now I can't even look at them. If I don't go to the wedding, I don't see how our marriage would survive honestly. We've given them the money promised but haven't been able to tell the girls they won't be going to their brothers wedding. This has messed up our family alot.",0.29
"AITA for ""making"" my friend help me clean up after I went blackout drunk? Okay, before I start I know I'm at least a moderate asshole already. This is mostly to figure out how much of an asshole I was.

So its Friday night, me and three friends are in my garage, and we have one 75cl bottle of tequila and one smaller (I don't remember how big) bottle of vodka. I remember up until 5 shots, then waking up, puking into a bucket. 

First thing I hear is ""oh, you can speak again"". So then I knew I fucked up. Me and another friend is hungover, while the other guy who was drinking left at this point.
The sober friend puts on days of tomorrow, and I puke maybe 3-4 more times. After I'm done he helps me with cleaning, and we leave to catch the drunk guy's bus. Then I spent the rest of Saturday making my parents think I was simply tired and not having the worst day of my life so far..

Anyway, for some more context, the sober friend knew we would be drinking, and still agreed to come. I also didn't force him to help clean up, he's just a nice guy. Alas, i still feel like a piece of shit for making him put up with my dumbass for that whole night.

"AITA for interrupting my ex husband's Dungeons and Dragons game and telling his friend to ""fuck right off"" So today is my (F28) daughter's eighth birthday. I spent the whole weekend planning, coordinating and spending money so that she could have a good birthday. Yesterday I took her for a mani pedi and today I took her and her friend ice skating at a local rink because that's what she said she wanted to do. Her grandmother (my mom) came to visit and brought her a chromebook as a present. Her father (M37) did not participate in any of this and in fact, has not seen her all weekend up until tonight, despite being off from work on weekends. Actually his cousin heard about the ice skating and asked if he could bring his wife and 2 children (my daughter's second cousins) to spend the day with her, while my ex husband did not offer to come at all and spent the day playing video games at home. He did call and talk to her before we left this morning though.
Anyway, once we got home from the ice rink my daughter wanted to set up her Chromebook, but my internet connection here is pretty terrible because we live out in the country so it was a very slow process and I'm not very tech savvy. Her dad lives in town and has high speed internet so I called him and asked if I could bring her over to spend a few hours with him and so he could help her set it up using his superior internet.
When I called him he sort of stuttered for a minute and said ""well uh, I have people over and we are doing a campaign."" He asked if I could bring her tomorrow night instead, so I asked my daughter which day she would prefer and she said tonight. Since it's her bday he relented But when I got there he and his five friends looked visibly annoyed and one of them turned to me and said ""yeah it's not like we were in the middle of anything."" I said ""yeah well it's -name-'s birthday so you can fuck right off."" 
His tone came across as sarcastic so I tried to match that but it was clear they were angry. When I got home, my ex texted me calling me an AH because I could have just waited until tomorrow but I don't agree because his daughter wanted to see him on her birthday, and I don't think he should prioritize dungeons and dragons over her. He also did not get her a gift or even a card, but he's saying I over reacted and that it was a joke that I took too seriously and that I was rude to his friend.",0.7
"AITA for telling my son and his boyfriend that he cant be at our house all the time?

The kids a little rough around the edges and drives Richard around on that damn harley of his everywhere but he's a sweet kid and he's good to Richard. Even learned sign language to ask him out and brings him flowers. Comes to my door all cheesy and respectful like.

Trevor recently came out to his parents about a two month ago and his dad didnt take it well and guess they've getting into alot fights about it.  So Trevor started spending alot of tiime over at our house. It got to the point where he was practically living with us and we had a 5th kid. Richard has always kinda liked having his own space and Is on the spectrum. He kinda needs decompression time from people. I could tell that Trevor being around so much wss starting to get to him. they've even started having petty arguments and what not. I  finally  caught him alone and got Richard to truthful tell me that hes been sucking it up for Trevor and that he feels suffocated.

I talked it over with my wife and decided I should have a talk with them. I sat them down last week and I told them straight up that Trevor couldn't stay at ours all the time. That it was the best thing for both of there well beings. Trevor started freaking out and saying he couldn't be at home and i tried to calm him down and I  told him that he was still welcome here just not 24/7.  That they could hangout other places and that me and my wife would try  to find him a safe place to go other than ours. I  couldnt get Trevor to calm down and he just ran oit and took off on his bike.. Richard was furious saying I used whst he said against him and that i didnt care about what happened to Trevor and I shouldve never said anything.

"AITA for not listening to my husband and responding in an emotional way? I (34F) went grocery shopping today, spent about 108 dollars.

Husband (41M) told me this morning the budget is tight this month and gave me hard time for not listening to him. 

I honestly do not remember having this conversation, our son woke up at 4am and didn’t go to sleep til 520am today and I was tired.


He told me we had this conversation around 11am but I really didn’t remember.


I am currently SAHM, we have a 5 yrs old boy and I am pregnant with our second, am 19 weeks.


I have been depressed lately bc I have hard time with this pregnancy. First pregnancy was natural, but we had to do IVF this time and I had bleeding issues which finally got resolved. I quit my RN job during IVF process because it was too much.


Also fluid around baby’s heart scare with the baby, and got into minor car accident at 12 weeks pregnant, plus we were renovating our house and we had to fire our first team.

Thankfully most of the problems are gone (baby is healthy, renovations almost done, etc) but I have been very emotional lately.

I also grew up in a household where my parents fought over money ALL the time (we were poor immigrants)which traumatized me.

Anyway, I am very sensitive and touchy with money due to this, and my husband knows this.

Basically when I got home he was complaining that I don’t listen to him at all(I sometimes do tone him out automatically I admit, not my intention though). 


I told him it’s not like I bought other expensive things, I bought groceries.


He wanted me to apologize for not listening to him and I just burst into tears. I asked him to come with me to grocery shopping earlier but he was too tired so I just went by myself.
I honestly didn’t remember about the conversation that we had this morning.


We are out of kimchi(I am Korean and eats kimchi a lot) so I went to get stuff to make kimchi, plus few extra things, which added up.


I told him I don’t want to talk right now, since I was emotional and was crying.


He kept pressing me to “just say sorry”, so I got so angry at the moment I slammed the pot on the counter and said “I am sorry now get the hell out of my way”.


I had to make dinner so I kept making dinner while sobbing, and while pot was boiling I went to the car to just to sit by myself to calm myself down.


My husband came and told me he didn’t mean to make me upset and that he is sorry that he made me cry, and left me alone.


I kept crying for 10 mins or so because again, money issue is my major trigger. We almost got divorced few years ago for this. I do realize I responded in a very emotional way, like slamming the pot on the counter, which I couldn’t help myself.


My husband does help around the house A LOT, and is a generally a great husband and a father.


I am currently retreating in my room to just go over what happened.

"AITA for giving my husband the silent treatment after he scolded me for getting peanut buttter i (nb30) went to the grocery store earlier today with a list that my husband (m30) sent me from our fridge. 

it wasnt listed, but i specifically remembered (without checking if there was another) that we were low on peanut butter, so i picked one up when i was shopping. 

i come home and set the groceries on our counter- my husband was in the shower when i arrived. when he finally came into the kitchen, as im putting things away, he notices the peanut butter and starts scolding me saying, ""why did you get another peanut butter? i specifically took it off the fucking list so you wouldnt get another one."" taken aback by how he reacted especially with how he swore. i just asked him why he reacted like that and that it wasnt a big deal we got an extra peanut butter. he told me he was just trying to 'save me money.'

he doesnt react like this to things often, but often enough where i have to replay the situation over and over again to really understand if I reacted correctly. he truly said it in a shitty tone and  like i did something incredibly wrong.

he kept trying to talk to me and i have been short with him. he said, ""im sorry if i did anything wrong."" and i literally looked at him and was like???? ""do you really not think you did anything?"" i explained to him my POV of what happened and he just said he was sorry again . but he truly doesnt think he did anything wrong and i told him, if you really dont see how weird that was that you reacted that way about peanut butter, then i dont have anything to say to you."" 

i want to make it very clear that my husband isn't usually like this, but there will be times he doesnt realise the tone or the way he says things and it's become a bit of an issue not only with me, but with our kids. i dont know if i am the one who is crazy and over analyzing how he reacted to this and idek how to confront him about this anymore either. am i the asshole?


edit: financially, we are a little tight- but for something like peanut butter, i am truly just confused why he had that reaction because out of anything i could get an extra of, peanut butter would be at the top of the list. we use/eat peanut butter daily. 

i take accountability that my reaction to his is wrong. i really was just taken aback by how my husband reacted and the ""fucking"" he added to it. the whole situation was just really weird to me and i didnt know how to handle it properly. i am not used to being talked to like that and i immediately just shut down and got upset.

"AITA for telling my friend I could still possibly meet him if my wife wasn't in labor? My wife gave birth to our first child last week. The pregnancy was largely uneventful and the baby was actually due 2 weeks from now.

Anyway, at 35 weeks she thought her contractions were getting intense so we packed our bags and went to the hospital where they said it wasn't time yet and to go home.

Last Saturday, I had plans to go meet a friend for dinner. An hour before I was going to leave, she said her water broke. I immediately packed the bag and said let's go. On the way there, I called my friend from the car and said we would probably have to cancel but just in case it was another false alarm we could probably still meet. 

She didn't say anything to me then but yesterday told me that was a real dumb and AH thing to do. She said all my attention should have been on her (which it obviously was) and even if it was a false alarm, I should have under no circumstances told my friend I could maybe make it. What made it worse was my friend on the call said I'm dumb for thinking of coming and should be with my wife too. Fwiw, her mom is staying with us so it's not like she would have been alone at home.

"AITA for asking money from my gf? Long story short, my on/off gf for a little over a year has not been very faithful or respectable to me. But she said shes trying to improve because Im important to her. Anyway, last night was her birthday. She says she’s heading to the restaurant and for me to meet her there. She then says shes going to her friends house (ended up being for a short surprise party with cake), and for me to get a table outside and wait for them. I was unaware they were having a surprise party and not told until they arrived at the restaurant so I was left sitting outside in the cold at a table for 20 minutes until they showed up.

Anyway, we have dinner, and then comes time to pay. Service was very slow so her friends go up to the front counter to pay instead of waiting on the waiter. I see the friends were having trouble splitting the checks. They also dont really speak english. So I go ahead and say just put it all on my card to make things easier — over $100… and the friends (still standing right there next to me at the counter) don’t say a single word, not even in their own language. No thank you, nothing. Literally just turned around and walked back to the table. I was in shock. Then we leave and they don’t even say goodbye. No acknowledgement at all.

Anyway, so they all go to the bar after to dance. I was asked earlier if I wanted to go, but I don’t drink anymore or enjoy the bar scene so I refused. But I mustered up the courage and asked my gf if she still wants me to go because I would. She said no, now its a girls night. So she went off dancing at a bar and doing whatever and I sat home on her birthday.

Today, I was so annoyed by that and also the money thing, that I said I want $80 back from them (only $80 because I still wanted to rightfully pay for me, my gf, and her daughter for her bday dinner). My gf wasnt with her friends so she offered the money from herself. I agreed and she gave me $80 even though I told her it should be her friends doing this.

Maybe not such a short story, but anyway, the advice I need is specifically for my actions today. I know I have a right to be annoyed, but did I project my frustrations in all the wrong ways? Should I try to make things right? Or was asking for the money back the right thing?",0.36
"AITA for not paying my daughter's tuition? My (52F) daughter (20F) receives a scholarship for her college tuition because I make under a certain amount. The scholarship completely covers the tuition, and how it works is that I pay it first, then it is refunded to me. I split this cost with her father, and is about 4k in total per semester. 

Last semester, however, she was unaware that she had to apply for the scholarship again as she received it in previous years without reapplying. I reminded her for months to take care of it the tuition refund with the financial aid office, but she kept putting it to the side. Finally, she emailed the office and they told her the refund would go through once grades were posted in December. 

Well, grades are posted and still no refund. I've been telling her to go to the office in person and take care of it but she hasn't ""gotten the chance."" 

So, I told her because of the failure to get the tuition refunded, whether it be her lack of action on reapplying for the scholarship or otherwise, I would not be paying her tuition for this semester, and that she would have to split the cost with her father.

A few times on my way to the bathroom straight after waking up he will catch me in the hallway and expect me to say “good morning 😁” as I’m rushing to pee. Same thing happens if he catches me right as I open my bedroom door.

"AITA for being hurt that my mother got a job? So, I (f21) graduated at the start of 2023 and got a full time job 8 months later in hopes of buying a home this year. My mother (f44) has spent about 1.5 years studying and has now been hired for the same job today. Now I didn’t get the job I originally applied for, I was offered a lower level job due to a lack of experience. My mother has been offered the job I originally applied for but two pay levels higher. I studied for 3 years, saved for 5, and have moved about 3 times during this period. This was due to originally living with my mother’s narcissistic (now ex) husband, who wanted me to pay $180 a week in rent after finding out I was granted a trust when I turned 18 (this was due to courts mandating my compensation after my father’s violence during my childhood). I was also cleaning the house, taking care of my siblings while they went on overseas trips together, and endured his taunts whilst he was unemployed during this time. I then moved to my father’s, who had me cleaning his 5 bedroom home, doing his groceries, making him food, and taking care of his new partners kids, then he kicked me out and I now live with my mother’s parents (my grandparents) who are letting me stay rent free until I can afford a house, which I feel so guilty for burdening them. 
My mother received some fairly substantial payouts after leaving both my father and her ex-husband, due to the abuse as well as some extras to set herself up. It was half way through my degree that she decided to begin studying herself and only when she realised my plans that she began applying for jobs in a similar industry to me. 
I’m not mad about her getting her quals or the job, I’m mad that I endured the brunt of the abuse during my childhood, walked away from everything, am trying to start over with this job, while she did all of it without the burden of debt, stressing over exams and everything for three years, and won’t even need to work her way up. She doesn’t have any experience either - I can count the years she’s worked full time on one hand. She’ll be eligible for a loan within 3 months and easily pay her mortgage. Meanwhile, I have to wait until my probation period ends to transition to the higher paying role, even with the salary increase I’ll still struggle, and don’t even get me started on my debt. I want her to succeed, be financially stable, and achieve all of this. It just feels like it overshadows everything I’ve spent so long trying to achieve myself. I can’t even say anything about it because I don’t want to burden/ruin this for her.

"AITA for only speaking in my native language to my American boyfriend? For a little bit of background, I (22F) have been living in the United States for about 3 years now. I'm from Argentina, and came to the States to continue my education. English is my second language, and even though I've been learning it for about 8 years now, it can still get exhausting to have to process and translate everything before talking (aside from worrying about pronunciation).

I have been dating my boyfriend (25M) for about 2 years now. For the simplicity of this story, I'll call him Mike.

This past summer, I went back to my home country for the summer in order to see family and friends. I was going to be visiting there for about 3 months, which is why I invited Mike to come with me. I offered to pay for his plane tickets, and he would be staying with me, so he wouldn't have to pay for any hotel either.

He denied my offer multiple times, and he mentioned excuses such as being ""super busy"" and ""not having the time"". He was unemployed and not doing anything during this time, so I found it weird, but took it as him being nervous of meeting my family, so I let it go.

During the last month of my stay, he randomly brought up that he wanted to come to Argentina, and I agreed happily (despite being weirded out due to him rejecting me before), and we had a great time. However, Mike couldn't really communicate with most of my family due to them not being fluent in English. I had to be the translator during the whole 3 weeks Mike was there, which ended up being mentally draining for me.

Ever since then, Mike has made empty promises to me that he wants to learn Spanish to be able to talk to both my family and I. I have always explained that it is a complicated language to learn, but that I would appreciate it so much (as well as my family) if he would learn the basics.

It's been three months now and Mike has not made any attempt to learn even a single world, despite still being unemployed and sitting in his computer all day.

Fast forward to last week, Mike came up to me very excitedly telling me that he had bought a year subscription for Duolingo and is now learning Japanese. I have never seen him as excited and determined on any task as he is right now.

I got upset at his lack of effort for learning my language and instead giving all his energy on learning a language in order to better understand anime. I lashed out at him and told him I would only have conversations with him on Spanish moving forward, and it would be his decision whether he wanted to ever have a conversation with me again or not.

Most of my friends, including my family, told me that I overreacted, and wondered why I want him to learn Spanish when we both already know English. AITA here?

Edit: I did have a prior conversation with him about me feeling hurt about his actions. He got dismissive and took it as a joke. It was after attempting to have a conversation with him that I decided to stop talking to him. ",0.77
"AITAH for not getting over my fear? Hi hi! So, I have an intense fear of throw up, also known as emetophobia. I've been living with this fear since 2019. If you have it, then you would probably understand its a pretty hard fear to deal this. 

Now I'm still a minor, so I'm living with my parents at the moment. My parents are also divorced. My father (he's like 41) and my step mom (around 30) don't understand my fear very well. Meanwhile my mother (36) understands my fear very well. 

Anyways, whenever I have to eat, I get anxious, thinking that whatever I'm about to eat is gonna get me sick. Even though im old enoughto know that thats not true at all. But I still have to check expiration dates a lot. Especially with meat and dairy products. Sometimes I ask my parents to either taste test the food to make sure it's good, or if I can't find an expiration date I'll just have them tell me when they bought the food. I don't think it takes too much effort, but perhaps I'm wrong?

When I was at my father's house I wanted to eat a bagel, but I wasn't able to find the expiration date, so I asked my dad when he bought it, a little annoyed he told me it was good so I began to put it in the toaster. But suddenly my mom joined the conversation and said something about how I need to figure out for myself if food is good or not by using my senses because they may not be here to tell me one day. But the thing that hurt the most was she used my dead name when lecturing me. I've been using this name for about 2-3 years? So it hurt that she was not only lecturing me for a fear I can't control, but also using my dead name, and my father agreed with her. 

And I agree that yeah, maybe I could just just look to see if the food is bad, but I don't think it hurts to have a little reassurance?

So AITAH for not getting over my fear?

Edit: I'm 13 years old and I'm currently in therapy to get over my fear!

Edit: another edit just to clear a few more things up- so as I said- I did just get a new therapist, when I told her about what I talked about up there, she said that she'd help me with my fear, but never talked about how I needed to start being more independent with my fear, which is why I asked here. Also I know I said ""whenever"" I eat, I get anxious - that's not true. It's really every once in a while, like maybe once or twice every two weeks? especially if I had forgotten to take my anxiety meds that day. But I know I'm probably still the AH here. Also no, I don't ask these questions at other people's houses, or restaurants because I know that would be rude, it's just when I'm in my own house. ",0.59
"AITA for telling my brother to buy his girlfriend a gift in front of her? This is honestly so weird to me, but it's causing quite the stir with my brother so I'm not sure where else to turn. 

I was recently on a double date with my brother and his girlfriend. My boyfriend and I are both 23, and my brother is 27 (I'm not sure how old his gf is, but I think they're similar in age). This is the third time I've met my brother's girlfriend ""Ashley"", and she's always been nice. After dinner, we walked around the mall and while in one of the jewelry stores, I noticed that Ashley was *really* hinting that she liked one of the pieces. 

She literally spent about 15 minutes trying on the necklace throwing hints at him! So as we were leaving, I casually told my brother he should remember the necklace and store for Valentine's Day. 

Ashley was a little bit icy the rest of the night, and I had no idea why until today. Apparently, she wanted my brother to just remember to buy it, and she was annoyed that I told him to get it out loud. I honestly don't really get the logic, but according to her, because I verbalized the reminder, it'll ruin the surprise because she'll feel like the gift was from me since I mentioned it. 

My brother is getting annoyed because she's been complaining and saying that I ruined her Valentine's Day surprise. He wants me to apologize just to keep her happy, but I don't want to say sorry just for the sake of saying sorry. Am I crazy?",0.03

It was a very small private Christian school and I’m apart of the lgbt+ community and I’ve always struggled with my mental health so they kicked my out because of my mental illness and they messed up my transcript and so I’ve never passed the 7th grade so the option to go to another school wasn’t an option.

"AITA..I (35 Female) feel disrespected by my (36 Male) husband. Let's start by saying my husband just had back surgery and has been on bed rest for a week now. He's doing really well walking around being able to sit in different chairs and even started helping with the baby again. Just small things like feeding him or sitting in his play room and watching him so I can get things done.

We own our own business where he runs the numbers and I physically work and manage our staff. I go in 3/4 days a week and physically work so he is more the stay at home dad.

I feel like Iv been kicking ass at keeping everything straight. And I'm waking up early and going to bed late with the baby. Now the dogs have felt neglected because they just want to be around my husband. But I DO NOT want them in the play room (where my husband has been sleeping and spending most

Because the dogs have felt neglected they have been rebelling. Marking in the house and ripping up their toys, and eating food off the counters.
And it's been a lot of extra work deal with the sad dogs.

After the second day of this happening I finally had to yell at my husband to stop letting the dogs in room. I finally yellingly explained it's more work for me the pee, them eating and getting into the things he needs laying around and them eating our babies toys. Stop letting them in the play room.

When I get home (8pm) the playroom door is open and all the big dogs are in the playroom and come to find out he never fed my dog just gave him some people food as he was eating it. I got pissed. I'm doing all this work to try and keep up with everything and all I asked was for a little bit of help and to keep them out so it's less for me to clean.
He tells me l'm dramatic and he didn't do anything wrong. He goes ""God for bid you pick up the slack for a week"". ""You do it an act like it's the end of the world"". He's getting very defensive.

So two questions finally:
1. Is it to much for me to ask him to A. Help feed my dog and B. Keep the door shut?
2. Because Iv been doing so good at keeping up with the house chores (for how quickly he's heal I would think the end of next week we should start talking about it again). When is my stopping point to expect him to pick it back up again? But I feel like nothing is going to get done…..there's going to be our son's laundry everywhere again and dishes only done once the sinks.

"AITA for taking my roommate’s emotional support animal to the humane society My 22F roommate 19F have had but strained but functional relationship since we moved in together in June. She is young and impulsive. In August, she asked me if we could watch her friend’s cat for the semester. Part of me was skeptical, since we have a no pet policy, but my roommate reassured me it would be fine.

I agreed since I’d been considering getting a cat of my own, but made sure to mention that watching a cat for that long could be detrimental to her mental health, since she could get attached to it, but she reassured me it wouldn’t. 

While the cat was here, I got annoyed with it always scratching on my furniture and I mentioned to my roommate that after this cat left I was done. She seemed to understand, so I thought nothing of it.

The cat was supposed to leave on Dec 14. I had a family emergency, so I left with my dad after I graduated on Dec 10. I did not come home until Jan 3 and was surprised to find a new cat in my apartment. She hadn’t mentioned anything to me about it.

When I called her out about it, she ignored me for days. I finally texted her and she said how she really needed the cat for her mental health and I called BS on her. I felt bad about it until she made a joke about how every ESA is just for show, to get around our no pet policy. We continued to go back and I asked her to keep it in her room, which she said was ridiculous and I was unreasonable. 

I then continued to remind her I didn’t want the cat and put all of the cat’s things that were in the common area (INCLUDING THE LITTERBOX MIGHT I ADD), and she kept moving it back and ignoring my attempts to talk about it.

Now that brings us to today. I received a text from my roommate this morning asking me to take care for her cat for the next 2 days while she‘s home for the long weekend. I said no since it isnńt my cat. When I left my room, I caught the cat behind my TV as it was tipping over, thankfully. 

This was my last straw. After I got my TV back in place and was sure it wasn’t going to tip over, I texted her that I would be taking her cat to the humane society. AITA",0.18
"AITA for telling my boyfriend to sleep at his own place? my (21f) boyfriend (21m) and i live separately, but he frequently stays the night at my place. he doesn’t get along with his roommates and i enjoy the company so i don’t mind it at all. 

i got a new job where i’ve started waking up at 6:30 in the mornings to get ready. he doesn’t start work until 9:30 so he sleeps in longer than i do. i keep my alarm volume as low as i can to not wake him up in the mornings and try to be quick getting out of bed. i do a majority of my routine in the bathroom as to not wake him. i pick out my clothes the night before too so i can change quickly.

well this morning, i was looking for a certain pair of shoes that was buried in my shoe bin in my closet. i was trying to use my phone flashlight but it just wasn’t helping, so i turned on the overhead light for a few minutes. i was trying to be quiet, but can really only do so much about the noise.

he eventually sat up and said “could you be any louder?” i told him i was sorry and i’d leave once i found my shoes. i found them and went back to the bathroom to finish getting ready.

while i was in there, he came in and told me how he couldn’t fall back asleep because i woke him up. he was complaining that he didn’t get to sleep in. i got frustrated and told him that i can’t help that i have to wake up for work and if he was so bothered, than he can just sleep at his own place. 

that obviously didn’t go over well. he’s ignored me the whole day and he finally answered the phone about an hour ago and told me that he’s done spending the night at my place, and he’s still angry with me for this morning.

"AITA for blowing up on my boyfriend for giving me a birthday card that ChatGPT wrote It’s my 35th birthday. Last year I got upset with my (m34) boyfriend because he didn’t get me a card. This year we discussed doing the birthday right and planning a trip, getting a nice gift, and a card. It was on me to book the trip but by the time I went to book it everything was sold out. Which was a bummer and had me pretty upset all week. So ultimately we decided to do a one night stay in the Florida keys. The night before we were going I asked him to not forget about the card. I also requested he put some thought into a message instead of just signing his name. 

This morning when we were supposed to be heading out he said “I’ll be back in a bit I have to go on your birthday mission to get card and flowers”. I was annoyed bc I wanted to be on the road and figured he should have taken care of this sooner. I was hysterical crying when he left and when he got back he noticed I was upset. He brought back ugly flowers and a smoothie I like and a card. 

I open the card and it really read like ChatGPT wrote it. I was so upset. I asked him about it and he owned up to it. 

We got into a huge fight - him saying that he thought I wanted a longer note and he isn’t used to writing long letters and it was still heartfelt. The fight just went from bad to worse as I tried to explain that it’s hurtful he couldn’t take 5 minutes to develop something on his own. He “hacked” my card.

"AITA for not wanting to give my mom 1000$ for a new car? Her current car is in constant need of repairs, and has no AC.

Her reasoning for me giving the money on top of the new repairs is that she uses the car to drive me to appointments; So it benefits me too.

I asked if she was going to pay it back and she said no; And then went on a rant about how she supposedly spent 3000$ to go get me from another state (I asked to see the receipts and she refused), about all the Xmas gifts she's gotten me, and stuff I asked for her to buy me (and I payed back triple or more the amount I actually owed her).

she always triples the price or more I owe her back, or when she does anything for me, gives me gifts, ect; She always uses them as a transactional point she can use against me in the future.

So, I'm begrudged to even want to help her as I feel she should have saved up the money easily this whole time (around 1yr almost).

"AITA for purposely wrapping my MIL’s birthday gift in a way it cannot be opened without scissors and then not giving her scissors? I’m fully accepting that I’m a petty asshole here. I am curious if I went too far.

Friday was my MIL’s birthday. We celebrated yesterday (Saturday). 

**Relevant background**. My middle son (17M) is disabled with limited fine motor skills. It is hard for him to open wrapped presents, but he still likes to rip the wrapping paper. We’ve always put a piece of looped ribbon inside the paper to act as a rip cord, and asked family/friends to either do that or a bag covered with tissue paper for him. MIL has always been judgmental of this, loudly commenting about how he will never improve if I keep “babying” things for him.

This year at Christmas she wrapped his gift the same as everyone else’s. She passed them out at dinner. My older son (20M) and my niece (14F) who were closest started to help. MIL hissed at them, waved away their hands, and told them he needs to try harder to learn on his own because he’s almost an adult now. Husband told MIL he cannot open it like that.

She went on a rant about *me*, how I have turned her son, I have poisoned her grand babies with vaccines and now I am keeping him suffering the consequences by “keeping him handicapped” and convincing everyone to coddle him. She said it’s time for tough love and this year she wasn’t putting up with my “tyranny” any longer. My BIL and SIL tried to calm her down. MIL stormed out of the dinning room exclaiming about how *I* ruined Christmas for her.

**Event in question.** MIL’s birthday. I wrapped her present with so many ribbons and tape it would be impossible to open without scissors. Watched her struggle with it for a minute or so. She chuckled, as she rummaged her purse, about how she needed to get her readers out to see and untie the knots. Then she tried pulling the paper out from under the ribbons. Next she tried squishing the cardboard of the packaging to slip the ribbons over a corner. Finally, she asked for some scissors and I refused, saying “you can figure it out on your own.”

She said “oh is there a trick to it?” She tried longer to open it before she started complaining ""its plastic and simply can’t be opened without scissors or a knife to cut it.""

I shrugged, suggesting “you can learn if you try harder.”

She complained its impossible.

I shrugged again, saying “I don’t want to *handicap* you with scissors. We believe in you.”

After that she shoved the box aside and started giving us all the silent treatment. My husband opened it for her with his pocket knife and she ignored the box until she left. My husband completely understood what I was doing but he did feel I took it too far and that she won’t learn from this. He feels it was petty and we should just limit our interactions with her. I agree I don’t expect her to have learned. But, my son’s got a kick out of it and I got a kick out of it.

"AITA for admitting to my best friend that my gf is higher priority now because of the title (girlfriend)? I (27M) recently had a conversation with my best friend (26F) of 8 years on WhatsApp. She admitted that my new relationship with my girlfriend of 2 months has affected her. We used to text every day and meet once a week, but the frequency has decreased, making her feel neglected. 

She also told me that she feels that our friendship is becoming one-sided because it is now usually her taking the initiative to text me, but the fact is, I am going through a lot now, juggling between work, relationship and study. She put me on the spot, asking if the relationship has put her on a lower priority list. I admitted so because of the title 'girlfriend,' and she was hurt.  
  
I still love (platonically) and care about my best friend, and I wish she didn't ask this question as my answer might burn bridges. I understand her attachment due to our amazing times together and the challenges we faced in college, and we were always there for each other (she sees me as a brother and I see her as a sister). 

It seems she feels betrayed by my new relationship, and me admitting that my girlfriend is a higher priority has worsened the situation as she has stopped texting me. I wouldn't have shared that if she hadn't asked. I feel that she may be overthinking about this friendship situation, just because I prioritize my gf over her doesn't mean I don't care about her, I will always care about my dear friend.

My boyfriend and his family are currently on a cruise throughout the Gulf of Mexico for a week while I stay at their house and house sit while also taking care of their two cats and their dog. 

They left earlier than expected due to snow storms coming in but this also means they they will be coming back *three days later* than agreed on. The latest they will be returning is this next Sunday, which is the day before the college spring semester starts.

Over all, the time house sitting doesn't quite matter, but the condition of their house does. I've stayed for five nights so far and every night I have cleaned the house. The house is absolutely cluttered and dirty. I have scrubbed every surface and vacuumed every floor and I seem to only scratch the surface of filth in their house. It doesn't help that the more I clean the more gross things I find. Not only that, but there are many things in the house that are broken and are not repaired. There is duct tape on outlets, light switches, and door locks, signifying that something doesn't work anymore and that it hasn't for a while.

"AITA for selling my Taylor Swift tickets at profit to fund a new laptop I really need for University instead of letting my sister buy them for face value? Last year, my friend and I ticketed for Taylor Swift in our country (Singapore). She got us tickets in the front of the second level for day one and I was able to get us good floor seats for day four. We are both University students. I babysit to earn money and once a week do some work for my uncle. 

Last week, the keyboard on my laptop stopped working just 6 weeks after my warranty expired. I took it to Apple and they said it needs to be replaced. It will cost about $1000 to fix it as it is out of warranty. For that, I might as well just pay a few hundred dollars more and buy a new one, as there are a couple of other issues with it, notably and annoying crack in the screen from when I tripped over holding it. 

I have decided to sell my floor ticket and just go the first day. I will get at least $2500 from selling it due to how close it is, more than enough to cover the laptop and the rest I can put into my savings account to have some savings handy in my account. This will be helpful for me for times where I need to babysit less because I am busy during exam period. 

My oldest sister is 10 years older and a lawyer. She was unable to get tickets. When she found out I am selling mine, she got angry I did not offer it to her for face value. Face value is not going to pay even half of a new laptop. She said I am being scummy by buying tickets to sell for more. That was not my intention. I'm upset to have to sell the ticket but our parents are not well off and I really need a working laptop for my studies. If the keyboard didn't stop working, I wouldn't be selling the ticket. I'm only doing it for necessity because I really need this laptop for university. She said I should get a cheaper brand than Apple instead of scalping but everything is interlinked with my iPhone & Apple calendar and I really don't like Windows OS and want to be stuck with it for years. I plan to buy extended warranty this time and keep it for 3 years if possible.

I said if she buys me a new laptop with the extended warranty, she can have the ticket, but she refused it is unfair. So I plan to sell it. But she keeps putting up stories on instagram about how I am a trashy scammy scalper so IDK if I am being a jerk.

"AITAH for going overseas without bf? Update: To clarify, I’m female and have a male boyfriend. My friend is male who I have never and would never have a romantic connection with - not a million years. My friend also lives in another state and is seeing someone. My bf met him once and said ‘he was gross.’

Short version: I’ve been dating someone for 5 years and we’ve never been overseas together. I was over it and a friend asked if I wanted to travel with them and I said yes. Now partner is mad and said I’m in the wrong and should have checked with him first.

Detailed version:
We’ve done a few trips within the state together, but never a proper holiday afar. While Covid certainly impacted travelling for a couple of years like everyone else, there’s always been a reason he couldn’t go somewhere.

This included: it’s too expensive, too busy with work, I don’t want to go or I rather go here instead. If we explored an option it quickly fizzled out and nothing happened. For their birthday, I knew they would love to do Vietnam. 

So I put together 2 options with everything from flights, hotel, tours, etc. to choose from. Everything was literally planned out and they just had to choose A or B. Their reason this time was “I don’t know what’s happening at work, I’ve got a bit on.”

I’ve always wanted to do a cruise somewhere and it wasn’t for them. They saw it as full of old people and gastro - each to their own.

Then a good friend of mine booked a solo cruise and asked if I wanted to go with. I said yes and booked the same cruise - different rooms of course.

I told my partner about it and he was shocked. They were mad and ignored me for a couple of days. When I tried to talk to them they said not right now. Eventually we talked and they were angry that I didn’t tell him them first before booking an overseas trip. They were mad that we haven’t been overseas together and I’m choosing to go with a friend instead. They felt I should have seen this from their angle.

To keep the peace, I apologised just to move on.

But AITAH? Was what I did honestly wrong? There’s no romantic connection with the friend or ever gave a reason to think I’m unfaithful. Keen for any advice.",0.45

"AITA for the way I punished my son for what he said about his friend? *Throwaway*

I (36M) have a son (15M) and a daughter (17F), and they've been friends with our neighbor who I'll call Ron. (17M) since childhood. Recently, my daughter and the Ron were hanging out with a friend, and they walked into our house as they left their friend's place. This is where the problem occured.

My son, who was at home with me, let out a big sigh after seeing Ron and asked why he was here. I was confused by what he meant. That's when my son vented about being tired of the Ron's constant presence and made hurtful comments about his sexuality(Ron is gay). It was shocking because my son had never expressed any issues with the neighbor before and had always been close to him. 

Ron was visibly hurt and offered to leave, but I insisted he stay but he said It was okay and left anyway. My daughter and I were rightfully upset and I admit we were yelling. I asked what his problem was. He yelled back saying he couldn't help not wanting to be around the Ron all the time.

I tried being calm, asking my son why would he say something like that to Ron. At this point, my daughter had already left and went with Ron. My son refused to answer me and just kept saying he was sorry. I told him I'm not the one to be saying sorry too. I told him I raised him better than this and this made him cry.

In the heat of the moment, I made the decision to ground my son. I took away his phone, PS5, and all his electronics, leaving him with only the TV in his room without the remote. He started crying even more and begged me not to go through with it, but I stood firm, telling him he needed to apologize to  Ron the next morning.

Now, I'm conflicted. My daughter supports my decision but when I spoke to Ron, he suggested I let it go assuring me he would be okay. I think he might be right, I tried talking to my son again, but he is straight up refusing to talk to me and keep saying please leave him alone in a quiet tone. I don't think I'm in the wrong for grounding my son, but I'm wondering if I went too far, considering it's his first time saying something like this.

Am I the Asshole for the way I grounded him?",0.33
"AITA for not wanting to go away on vacation with my boyfriend and his friends? My (46F) and my BF (51M) have known each other for several years, started dating a few weeks ago. I’ve been mostly single since we met, he is newly single. 

His friend group has this tradition of going away on vacation once a year in the late winter together, with the partners as well, and each year one person gets to pick where and all the activities for their birthday. Soon after we started dating, he asked me to join them this year. Says it’s usually about a $2,000 trip each, and that I would have to pay for myself. 

Thing is…I don’t want to go. First, I’m a single Mom and  and I can’t afford $2,000 for a trip. I told him, “yeah I’d love to go but I don’t think I can afford it, and I’d have to get my passport.” 

He replied, “well, get your passport and see what you can do.”

He told everyone in the friend group I was going. He is so excited to go and I don’t want to go. Not just the money but the thought of having zero freedom in a trip away isn’t my cup of tea. 

I would have to borrow money or use money from a tax refund. With inflation I barely have enough to cover my bills. He’s upset with me that I haven’t gotten my passport yet. I explained to him that I had to wait to get paid. 

AM I THE A for not wanting to go in trip? I feel like I am. I feel that I should have said “no” right at the beginning.",0.03

I told my boyfriend today that if we have a kid that his mom would not be allowed in the room. We have talked about this before, But he is acting brand new. I have said that I only want 2 people in the room my mother and him. He is trying to make me feel bad when his mother has seen multiple pregnancies and my mom has only seen one. Also it is big to me because this would be my first baby and this is his second and he doesn't think it's a big deal. Sometimes I feel like I can't compete with the first and it hurts.

"AITA for loaning out my mom’s wedding veil without telling my sister? 


I 31F got married last year and wore my mom’s wedding veil to include her on my special day. 

She passed away a few years ago, and when we went through her stuff we found her wedding dress, wedding veil amongst some other possessions. 

She was my stepmom, but my dad married her when I was 3 and growing up she had always been my mom. My dad and her had my half sister Annie 17F. 

We have a pretty big age gap so me and Annie aren’t super close, but when we discovered our mom’s wedding stuff, Annie said she wanted the dress and I said I’d take the veil then. 

My friend Lily, who came to my wedding, was getting married soon and asked me if she could borrow my veil, as they are getting married on a tight budget and she really likes mine, but it’s not in her price range. As the veil is mine and not Annie’s, I didn’t ask her and lent it to Lily. 

After the wedding, Lily posted pictures of her and the bridesmaids (including me) and I reposted it on my social media. Annie called me and blew up at me on the phone as she recognised the veil and said that it was her moms stuff, not my mum’s, and I shouldn’t have lent it out without asking her. I hung up on her.

In hindsight I could have handled the phone call a bit better and I should have at least informed Annie, but when she pointed out that my mom was my stepmom and her actual mum I got upset.",0.43
"AITA for being “too sensitive “ about the rules at my middle school? I(13f) recently told my teacher that I think the rules at my new middle school are crazy .
This was mostly because there are multiple rules that are frankly just weird, such as all the girls have to have the ""school girl haircut"" aka a short hairstyle that doesn't touch the collar of the uniform and cant have layers. I think that this rule is really silly and stupid to put it in gentle terms because when i joined the school i had to cut my long hair that reached my thighs. After that I went on this long rant to my teacher about this, later she simply told me that i was being ""too attached"" to my hair and that the school board knows what's best for me and that I should have put my opinions in more gentle terms . i just stared at her blankly then left the classroom a few minutes later. Later that day she confronted me and told me i ""shouldn't be so sensitive"" and that (i should respect my elders and that I had to stop being an asshole about it ) basically, she then told me I had to complete an essay about respect and hand it in to her tomorrow.

She fulfills her everyday duties as a wife and only stays at home. But I found that he has bought this woman perfumes, drives her around and compliments her telling her she looks beautiful. He has also signed himself up to a few dating sites to which he has put ""single"" as his marital status. I know if I tell my mother, she will only stress out and is not capable of handling any bad news as well as before after her sickness. Part of me wants to tell her to leave and I will look after her.

"AITA for not wanting to give our baby to my wife when she asked to? My (27m) wife(25f) and i had a baby 3 weeks or so ago. It's been challenging as newborns are but little fella is healthy and growing up. For context, i moved to her house when baby was born(she lives with her mother (MIL) and her Grandma (GMIL)), they've treated me like another one of the family.

Baby was particular fussy this night, so wife couldn't sleep well. I swear she transforms into Godzilla when she's sleepy. At 7am she sends me a text asking me to take baby so she can rest a bit ( we sleep in separate rooms, because reasons i guess, her decision, I'm guessing she feels more comfortable sleeping next to her mom and grandma).  I take him and proceed to try and calm him down, he seems hungry, i text my wife to tell her so and she tells me that he's already feed and he's only making a fuss. I say okay and then try again to calm little fella down. Everything seems to be going well when 20 minutes in wife texts me telling me to take baby to the kitchen and get a fire going in the fireplace. I reason why bother, given that she said she was going to sleep and the baby seems relaxed, warm and is falling asleep while i caress his cheek. Another 20 minutes go by and my wife storms into the room yelling. Conversation goes something like this:

W: I think i told you to take him to the kitchen

Me: Why bother, baby is fine, I don't want to disturb him

W: Why won't you let me do things my way, I'm the mother

Me: And I'm the father, if you're going to leave him with me trust that i can handle him

W: Being a father is easy, it's me who has to wake up every time to feed him

Me: that was your decision, since you refuse to fill with formula or extract so i can bottle feed him.

She then lunges to try and take the baby from me. Almost crying and looking very angry. I refuse to give him to her and say.

Me: sit down next to me, please, breathe and calm down

W: no, I'm taking him to the kitchen.

Me: I'm not giving him to you if you're being like this. I understand you're tired and want to sleep, but that does not excuse treating me like a punching bag and taking things out on me.

W: stop making things harder for me.

Then MIL came in to take baby away to the kitchen (she didn't say anything, she probably heard us) and wife storms off to her room.


I honestly think i might have handled it poorly, I'm really trying to be understanding, having a baby is hard on everyone, especially the mother. But i don't want to have her backseat parenting and i don't want to make it a habit for her to treat me like crap, I'm firm on setting reasonable boundaries. I always try to compromise and most of the times i yield to what she wants. But i feel that if u don't stand my ground on some things my existence is going to be miserable, but i think i could have given in this one to spare us unnecessary stress

"AITA for telling my boyfriend the truth about his cooking? I 22F am dating Max 23M. Max is not a good cook and had been living off frozen/ready meals before we met. After we started dating, I encouraged him to learn how to scook and taught him simple recipes. This has increased his confidence in the kitchen and he is able to make a few basic things.  
  
He has recently started to find recipes online and tried making them at home and they tend to be hit or miss, sometimes they turn out ok other times not really. I am only able to teach him vegetarian food as while I eat meat, I don't cook it and have no idea how to as I grew up vegetarian and only started eating meat after moving out.

At home, I congratulate Max's cooking as its alright, however I don't think Leo would be able to hide his reaction or want to hide it. I said to Max that he is a good cook, I can cook that weekend for the 3 of us, but Leo doesn't eat vegetarian food really so Max insisted on cooking for him alone even when i offered to help out. I then gently said that while his cooking is good, he can maybe practise some of those recipes beforehand and he got defensive and upset.

"AITA For wanting to live in my boyfriend's house rent-free? obligatory throwaway account and english is not my first language.

Fellow redditors, i'd like to hear your opinions on this issue.

My boyfriend (M27) and I (F25) have been together for 3 years. I graduated from college recently and got a job, and my bf and I decided it was time to move in together. I currently live with my parents.

After we discussed this, my bf informed me that I had to pay rent to live in his place. His house was a gift from his mother on his 18th birthday, so his only expenses are related to bills.

I refused to have to pay rent, since the place is not rented or anything. I'd like to contribute with half the bills, house insurance and other expenses related to the house, but not rent.

I suggested that he could rent the extra room if he wants to have the extra cash, but personally I would not be paying. My boyfriend thinks it's unreasonable for me to be living in someone's house rent-free, and doesn't want to rent the extra room due to privacy.

Am I being an entitled asshole for wanting to live with him without paying rent?

EDIT: just for clarification, he wanted me to pay rent plus half of the bills and house related expenses.

UPDATE: since posting this, I've evaluated the pros and cons of moving in together, and decided that it's best for me to stay where I am until I'm more stable financially. Right now my main goal is to save as much money as possible, and living together would mean that 2/3 of my salary would be gone (not to account for unexpected expenses, like a new roof or a boiler as someone mentioned).

I talked to my boyfriend about it, and told him I could not help him out with expenses in the way he thought was fair, so it was best to wait until I could. He was a little bit upset that I wasn't willing to put in any effort or sacrifice into our relationship, but I think he'll understand where I'm coming from eventually.

"AITA for talking to my partner like a child? Hello long time reading I never post and grammar is not a strong point for me so I’m sorry if it seems like I’m rambling.

I (31F) and my partner (M32) have been together for 4 years we also have 2 children together I am a stay at home mom. For as long as our first was born we both struggle with our tempers and have yelled and raised our voices from time to time. I know it’s an issue and I have been working on it a lot over the years I would like to say we both have but I don’t know if my partner has improved on it. Typically I’m home with the kids most of the week so it’s mostly just me and the kids but their dad is home in the mornings and is off on weekends. A long time ago we would agree to call each other out on if we felt the other was starting to raise their voice or any parenting we disagree with and I prefer that honestly. 



The on going issue is that my partner still yells or has an aggressive tone or tends to say things that’s unnecessary and I try to gently tell him when he does. Example being saying his name gently or saying language please. When I do he typically will snap at me and say “Don’t try to parent me I’m not your kid.” And any further discussion with it just ends up with him repeating that he doesn’t need me to parent him AITA for talking to him like a child?

Ben is very smart and can easily switch from japanese, english and french.

She checked on me multiple times as I was eating, and when I finished, I asked her if I could have a bag for my leftover biscuits.  She asked me if I wanted more gravy to take home with them, and I said sure.  When she came back, she said, ""I brought you some extra biscuits too.""  She didn't charge me for any of it.

"AITA for ditching my friend's New Year Countdown party. My friend Bob invited me to New Year Countdown party at my friend's house Nick that he knows as well. He invites me to join his party cause we are friends. I also happily said I will bring a TV to his home since he does not have one and bring controllers so we can play pummel party or other local party games.  However something came up with another friend of mine, John . He wants me to go out with him to check out custom keyboards as there were Christmas sale. So John suggested that after we check out custom keyboards, he would drop me off at the party location as it is close to the keyboard shop.  I informed Bob about about this and he agreed so then it was set at this point.

So today (31/12/2023) , I went out with my friend John to check out custom keyboards. So then the appointed time to go to the venue for the countdown party was supposed to be at 1pm after lunch hour. However shit happens and it was already 2pm . I called Bob at 1pm  that we are gonna be late to the place. Regardless, I told him we will be there after 1 pm.

I called my friend Bob that we are going to be on the way to the venue. **HOWEVER**, he told me that he was at a different location because somehow he needs to pickup a different **friend** , at this rate I have a TV in my friend's trunk and had to wait til 5 pm. I was disappointed . So I asked why is he not there, he said he was gonna fetch his friend and then be on his way.

My friend John has other plans at this point. This was not supposed to be part of the plan. He has other places to be. He has his own New Year Party to attend to at a different place. He had to buy door gifts and etc. I was disappointed about the fact that he could've communicated to me that he had another friend he was suppose to fetch the day before and I would have just not went with my friend John to the keyboard shop.

Fine his silly mistake. However, he and his friends fetched him from a mall by train and not by car. So the time for them to return home was 5pm. Whatever I had lunch with my friend John but at this rate I was conflicted whether to go to the party since the timing and everything seems trivial now.

Fast forward to around 4 pm and a few errands later, I decided to call him and ask him ""so what is the plan now?"" as I am in a different mall in a different part of the city.  He said ""oh we are close by !. We could fetch you from there. "" and then he proceed to say ""oh unlucky our cars seats are full."" In the most condescending tone.

I’m not saying he’s a bad person or racist or anything, but it just leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I also don’t wanna make a scene but that’s just something on my mind for a few days now..

"WIBTA for telling my friend they need to grow up before they get married My (26M) friend Mark (26M) is planning to get married in a few months to a nice girl named Katie (26F). However, in my opinion, he should not get married at the moment. He has been unemployed for at least a full year with little effort being used towards finding employment. While I understand people have their own problems, Mark barely contributes to the chores around his apartment and wakes up at 2pm or after to play video games. It seems like Katie is always the one to cook or clean and Mark will only help if Katie gets on his case about it.

Mark and Katie are planning to get married soon and I really want to scold him that he needs to find a job, given that Katie has been paying for everything, or at the very least, work on improving himself to be a better husband-to-be. At this moment, I think that he is a bad fiancé for his lack of effort in his relationship and I worry that Katie will just be stuck babysitting a man-child. Regarding why Katie hasn't broken up with Mark, the only thing I can think of is that Katie grew up in an environment where they believe that they should stay with the first person they date (for better or worse).

So my friends, would it be unjustified for me to tell him off or is it not my place to say it?

EDIT: You guys are right and I would be the AH. While I want Mark to improve himself for the sake of his marriage, it is not my place to say anything to him. The most I can do is give my support and hope everything turns out well. Thank you to everyone for their input on the matter!",0.33

She's now six months along. I was under the impression she was going to move out but she's decided she won't as it'll be easier to have our mom help her.

I am naturally pretty upset. I do not want to share my space with a baby, but also, the ragey ptsd thing is exhausting for everyone. 

I basically told my mom that she either makes sure the baby isn't living here or I'm going to move to my dads. He lives three states away. He's great and is pretty excited. He just works a lot so mom never wanted me there in case I need support or something and he's busy.

Mom is pretty torn and upset. My sister called me a selfish asshole. My cousin thinks I need to just wait it out. The baby is family and it might not even cry that much. Members of my bio family think it'll be good exposure therapy but I don't really believe them.

Mom is currently trying to make it work - find out a way for us to both stay. I refuse every option because it won't work. She wants me to at least try but I refuse to. Even seperately, I don't like kids. I don't want a kid in my shit when it grows up.

This has brought us closer. Mom is aware of our conversations and has asked me to keep her informed if things take a negative turn.

Steve, being highly extroverted, has expanded his social circle beyond his initial small group of childhood friends. Unfortunately, his new acquaintances are experimenting with smoking, vaping, and drinking. Steve has dabbled in snuff and vaping, but in moderation.

In my culture, drinking holds a specific significance, and it was generally okay until Steve informed me that he brought his new friends to our mom's house to drink in her absence. They had a bottle of 40% vodka, which concerned me, as idealizing drinking, particularly among younger individuals, is not well-received in our cultural context. I feel like he is still way too young to drink.
I gave my mom a general heads up about Steve's new friends without delving into specific details. She listened to me with curiosity, and then showed visible annoyance. The situation felt peculiar as she probed for more details indicating a deeper interest. 

Months later, during a joyful time in the living room, she unexpectedly advised my little brother not to trust me. When he inquired, she explained that anything he confides in me privately, I subsequently share with her. Both my brother and I were shocked. Despite my denial, my mom insisted that I share everything with her. When I urged her to share what I had confided in her, and even my brother expressed curiosity, my mom realized that, in fact, I hadn't disclosed anything to her. Despite my persistent inquiries about what I had shared regarding my brother's secrets, she couldn't provide any details. However, she bluntly informed my brother that I was supposedly attempting to cause trouble by wanting her reval his secrets that i had told her.

In a state of confusion, I decided to leave. Before I could exit, my brother angrily confronted me, demanding to know what I had disclosed to her. Even after I clarified what I had shared with her, he didn't find it a big deal. However, whenever Steve is around, he continues to express concern, wanting assurance that I'm not telling anything to mom. 

I mean the trust is gone. I am confused. Is this even a big deal?",0.04
"AITA for using the men’s bathroom? I 26F work in an office as the only girl on that floor. We have 4 mens bathrooms and although I have asked for a women’s bathroom, I’m the only girl so I was told to use the nearest  one which is two floors above. It is a bit of a hassle as I have to tap out on my floor, tap into the lift and tap into the floor with the bathroom to go. We have stairs but they are all the way of the other side of the floor.

This wasn’t a big issue for me as I work in office 2x a week and am remote most of the time. I needed to go to the bathroom really badly and when I got to the lift and realised I forgot my pass, and the men’s was empty. I went there instead, instead of walking back to get my pass from my desk. 

My co worker watched me walk out and now is saying he feels uncomfortable using the men’s as I could be in there.

"AITA for being mad at my colleague for not helping me get home. I 23F got stranded at work as the public bus service didn't turn up and was the last bus of the night, my work place is hybrid and I only travel there twice a week but the place I work is in the middle of the countryside with only one bus service to rely on. My commute to work takes around 1-2hours depending on trains and traffic as I live fairly far. No taxis will pick up as it's so far from town and to walk would take hours (15 mins by car). Me and 2 other colleagues from other departments went back to office to warm up as it was cold and to decide what to do next, a colleague from my own team walked passed and saw me in the office and came to ask why I was still at work and I explained about the bus and it had not turned up. He said ""that sucks I get to go in my nice warm car and go home"" he looked at the map to see how far it would be to take me to the train station and said it was to far and he wasn't going that way (15 min drive) and would add an extra hour for him to get home, I said please it's not that far and I would pay as i was desperate as I did not know how I would get home as my commute is already 2 hrs. He said no as I'm not going that way, this will give you a better incentive to drive, he smirks and walks off leaving me abandoned. Learning to drive in the UK is expensive at £35 a hour per lesson and I'm on minimum wage anyway with a house to pay so this is not a viable option for me ATM.

"AITA for giving more money to my daughter than my sons and saying that my grandkids are not my responsibility? My wife and I have three kids: boy 1 (34), boy 2 (30) and girl (26)

As we have good careers, we were able to pay for all of their college tuitions, which varies on year, degree and university. 

The three were all about the same, no big changes. Our two boys decided to get a degree and get to work, however our daughter decided she'll do a postgraduate, my wife and I have decided to pay for that as well. We have always valued education a lot, so we think that if we can help, there's no reason to not do so.

Our two sons are upset over these news, they think that we're spoiling our girl. Both of them said that they all should get the same treatment, I told them that this is because their sister is choosing to pursue higher education than they did, so she should get more money. Our oldest said that's unfair and instead of giving the money to our daughter, we could start a college fund for our grandkids. I told him that absolutely not, because their kids are their responsibility just as my kids are mine, so I'd rather pay for my daughter than my grandkids. 

I'm not saying that because I don't love my grandkids, I love them with all my heart, but I don't think that my kids should count on me to pay for their kids' stuff. My sons are upset, they're upset with me and my wife because we're paying our daughter's college, and they're upset at me for my comment about their kids. They said that we're once again spoiling our ""golden children"" and that I'm picking favourites (them v. Their sister/ my daughter v. My grandkids)",0.09
"AITA for calling out a coworker in a group chat I work as a party host with several other people. We’re all around the ages of 16-19. Our supervisor had made a group chat with all of us so it’s easier to give shifts to people or if we want to give our shift away we can go there instead of texting several people individually. Anyways, there’s this girl, who I’ll call Layla. Well Layla was part of a party with me and two other girls. Typically we work the party for an hour and thirty minutes, and in that time we do games, balloon animals, cake, and clean up their dishes/ trash so the tables don’t get to messy. Well this party was four hours long. Three of us couldn’t stay that long because our shift ended earlier than the party did. One girl stayed the whole time to finish the rest of the party but all she had to do was clean up their plates and trash. So now to the drama of it. Layla wasn’t in the party at all during her shift. She didn’t do games with us or balloon animals, which is a big part of doing the party because it’s where we get the kids attention and actually interact with them. The only thing Layla had done was bring in the pizzas and left, and maybe grabbed two plates. For a little more information about how she is as a worker, she had a party earlier that day and they had complained to my manager that she wasn’t in the room and didn’t do any games or anything, when she did go in the room she was in there for five seconds and then didn’t come back in for another thirty minutes. So later on in the day we get a text in the gc from the girl who stayed for the rest of the party. She had told us we got tipped and i had said I didn’t think that Layla deserved the tip because she wasn’t in the party and everyone in the group chat had knowledge of her not really being in her party’s and some even agreed with me. It’s true that I could’ve texted her privately but I was angry at the fact that she was getting credit for a party she didn’t help. The tip was like $50.

"AITA because I couldn't care of a fictional character's death? My friends and I were discussing about fictional characters. We were talking about 'Furina' A game character from genshin impact who died. I couldn't care less, since it was a fictional character and just written.

When I told them that (in a nice and respectful way possible), they started yelling at me how disrespectful I was being, and said I was wrong for this. They started to call me 'cold-hearted' after.

I don't get it at all. Why do people cry over a fictional characters death? I understand that the characters means a lot to the person, but why go far as crying for them?? I'd understand if you cried for a real existing person, but why a fictional one?

(Edit: My last sentence sounded too offensive when I readed it back. I meant to say I couldn't understand the purpose of someone crying over a nonexistent person since they're fictional. I didn't mean in any way of a mocking question. P.S. I don't play genshin impact much.)",0.13
"AITA for changing the plugs So to clarity in my room there is an out lit that the alarm system is plugged into and since it's is not a Plug that needs to be accessed often it is blocked by my bed and I have a multiplug that I use that is going out the side of my bed, And a few minutes ago the plug that was used broke and the alarm tripped so my father took my plug and swapped them so that the broken plug was out and my plug was behind my bed,and for contex my plug has a long cord that is useful as it can reach my table at the side of my bed and if the alarm system is plugged in the multiplug can't be moved. So I found another plug with a shorter cord that I wanted to swap with my plug so that I can still use my plug and The alarm can still be plugged in. However when I swapped the plugs the alarm tripped again and my father started shouting as to why I swapped the plugs when I don't need to use them.


And to add some information there are other plugs in the house that could of been used however he specifically chose to use my plug when there was one downstairs on the table that has more slots for the plugs

"WIBTA for calling my bf cheap? So I (22f) love giving people small gifts. I grew up in a lower income household, and have worked hard to have my own apartment with all the expenses that follow. What I have I share with those closest to me, especially my bf (22m). Whenever he comes over I buy food, we sometimes split the cost, but sometimes I'm like ""I got this"", and I really like this, along with bringing him his favorite soda or snack when I come to visit, or I know he's had a long day. 
I don't in any way think the man should necessarily pay for everything. But I like having a kind of exchange between gifts and who pays. It doesn't at all have to be the exact same amount, I don't want to or need to keep score like that. My bf lives at home, at doesn't really have any expenses besides transport. I'm very good at saving up, but my bf has almost twice as much saved up as me and cones from wealth. He very rarely buys pays for anything when we're out, where as I occasionally do it, but we've been together 6 months and it honestly takes all the joy out of it, when I don't seem to be worth buying the occasional snack for. We talked about it 3 months ago and he has since bought me groceries 1 time and snacks another. 
He really seemed to understand and wanting to do it more, but since it's gone completely dead. 
This weekend I surprised him with a expensive 3 course dinner at a fancy restaurant, because I had received a gift card. He then told me he'd get us a few rounds of drinks afterwards, which I was really exited for. He bought me one drink which was a little expensive (he chose the place and the drink), after 2 more hours I asked if we should buy 2 really cheap drinks since we'd been out a while, but he didn't really want to spend more money, so I asked him if I should buy us 2, and he just said ""sure"".
Apparently I was not worth buying a cheap drink.
This man in every other way treats me so well and he's so sweet, and I really don't know if thus is a ""me-problem"" or if I should talk to him again. Because honestly it is really affecting me.

"AITA for not wanting to be called Aunt? I (F 27) and my husband (31 M) got to meet our niece (9)  and nephew(7) for the first time this year (they use to live states away but we moved closer). They stayed with their grandparents (my MIL and FIL) over the Christmas holiday. I was introduced as Aunt \*my name\* to them (same goes for my husband and his sister) by my MIL. I thought it was to inform them who we were and that maybe after a few days they could just call me my first name and that's it so before dinner my SIL and I went over to MIL and FIL house to play board games with them. One of them said ""Hey Aunt \*my name\* it's your  turn?"" I informed them ""hey if just you wanna call me by my name that's cool too"". My MIL came into the dinning room and said They were only allowed to call me Aunt or Auntie and not just my name"". I was informed I was cool with it and i don't mind. She dismissed me and said no that they have to call you that. I thought that was weird because (CONTEXT) I never called my aunts and uncles by Aunt \*their name\* or Uncle \*their name\*. Just their name. I got home and asked my husband if this was normal in his family. He said no and ALSO he didn't really care to be called Uncle all the time either. So we called MIL and asked if the kids could just call us by our names. We didn't yell or demand this we just asked. She stated we couldn't be around them if we couldn't respect her rules. I was hurt by this because I started to like the kids and just wanted to pick my name they call me. So my husband called his brother (their father) and he said he didn't care what we wanted to be called by as long as his kids respected us and treated us like adult figures  which they have. While on the phone with his brother we both got a text from my MIL saying"" we were being disrespectful and needed to pick a title for the kids to call us"". I explained i never called my uncles/aunts anything but their first name so I'd prefer that. She said we would need to meet in person to discuss this further before we were allowed around the kids. (The outcome was we now go by titles and it was a long argument over it bc MIL told their father if he didn't do this that he was raising bad kids so we are respecting the parents wishes to go by Aunt and Uncle title) BUT I was curious if maybe the AUNT and UNCLE title is super important and we should be honored.

"AITA for calling a coworker out for not speaking Russian? My parents worked for the state department so as a kid and teenage I lived in Russia, Kazakhstan and Tajikistan so I speak Russian (and some Tajik) at basically a native level. I went to a local elementary school that was entirely in Russian and had many Russian speaking friends. I later went to university in the Czech Republic so I speak Czech and I also studied French and Italian to a lesser degree, maybe b1 or so. 

I'm now working in Melbourne and I heard a guy in the break room talk about how he speaks Russian because he went to Russia and he dated a girl from there. I said in Russian ""that's amazing, I didn't know you speak Russian, I speak Russian too"" and he says he doesn't speak Portuguese so he can't understand me. He says that my accent is really thick and he can't understand me. I said in English that my Russian is basically native level and that is not true. He kept insisting that my Russian is bad which is really pissing me off so I just said ""how do you say 'cow' in Russian?"" and he tried to change the topic so I brought it back and he said he can't remember. Then I asked him how do you say milk and he says to stop grilling him. It got really awkward and he left. Someone in the office said I was a dick for that and I told him he shouldn't lie. 

A few weeks later I heard him talking about how he is so fluent in French that the French man at the bakery nearby thought he was French. I asked him in French ""do you actually speak French or are you lying about that too?"" and he then says English ""don't use such vulgar language in the office"", I then said in English ""bro just stop lying, you don't speak French either"" and he kept saying he can't understand my bad french. I then typed something on google notes and said ""if you speak French tell me what this means"" and he then just says he doesn't need to be tested. THere's like 4 people who are just awkwardly watching this. Then another coworker from Switzerland, who I am close with, walks by and I asked her in French ""hey ask (shitbag liar) some questions in French, I don't think he speaks French"". She hates him because he creeps on her, so she asks him stuff in French and he pulls the same crap ""oh I don't understand your accent, but keep up the work and you'll speak French well soon"" and someone else said ""you idiot, french is her native language"". He leaves. 

Someone from HR witnessed this and pulled us in and we said our sides of the story, his being that I insulted him and I falsely accused him of being a liar. I then said ""prove you speak Russian and french, lets watch you listen to a video or translate an article"" and the boss said thats a good idea, so he asks me to do it in Russian and French, which I do. Then he does and he obviously fails and he got fired. Apparently what he did is fraud so he might be facing legal consequences so thats fucking hilarious.

"AITA for breaking coworker's confidence? TL:DR - A coworker told me his friendship with my SO was a facade and that he never forgave my SO for a past transgression. I kept the secret for a while until my SO started trying to plan around this coworker’s cross-country move so they could still be best friends. To ensure my SO didn’t waste time and resources, I broke confidence.

I might be the ass because I broke  confidence. 

I(31/f) started a new job in September.

I started dating a team lead at the sister company. As his SO, I tried to befriend his closest friends, his /m), and the other team lead(30/f). 

I've become close with the female team lead.

His supervisor has been difficult. I ended up advocating for the supervisor after some conversations. Although we didn't care for each other, this bridged the gap.

Fast forward, during a conversation with said supervisor, he says  “he is not friends with anyone at work, they were all just work buddies, not friends, and that he attends the occasional gathering to maintain the facade of friendship.” It also came to light that Supervisor hasn't forgiven my SO for a past transgression, and he dislikes my SO.

I kept the supervisor's secrets, knowing he was moving across the country. Let it ""fizz out."" 

My SO, convinced they were brothers, tried to plan around this move. The situation was delicate, but I eventually shared it with my SO, who was trying to keep this man in his life.

My SO thought he could patch things up because the supervisor is such a 'great guy'. So I organized a small gathering for the three of them since both the supervisor and other Team Lead are moving across the country, hoping to send them off on a positive note.

The supervisor and I disagreed about attending the farewell gathering. While he stated that he had the right to refuse, I told him he faked the friendship and to fake the friendship one last time. In the end, we ""agreed to disagree."" I told the two team leads that the Supervisor wasn't attending the event as he only attends a few to maintain the facade of friendship. These were his words. Both team leads were visibly hurt. Various work issues hit the fan, and we had to split to fix them. The tension was palpable. 

We ended the day on a good note, and the supervisor offered to drive my SO home to apologize because he realized he was wrong. I thought all was well.

Despite the promotion I got him, being conditioned on our close working relationship, he is treating me like crap now.

Edit for clarity: 
I am the most high-ranking individual in this situation.

My SO pursued me.
My goal was to befriend his friends, word count had me edit with poor word choice.

We are not in the same company. They are all in a sister company. Yes, I am dating someone below me in the chain of command. however, we don't work for the same company nor are we in the same department. 

Yes, we are technically coworkers, in that the same individual owns both companies, and sometimes our paths cross since we work in the same building. ",0.94

He said he doesn’t want to just spend his time in Ryan’s room, and gets upset that I’m the only one answering in the group chat. Just because I answer, and the other two don’t, he thinks I’m “making all the decisions” but I’m not. 

Even tho we live home and don’t pay rent, we don’t have money like that so we’d rather just chill and relax.

"AITA for yelling at a guy on a bike who ignored my warnings not to get too close to my young horse? **IN THE UK, HORSES ARE VERY COMMON, AND THEY HAVE SEPARATE TRAILS WHERE THEY HAVE RIGHT OF WAY. ALL UK RESIDENTS ARE TAUGHT ABOUT THE RIGHT OF WAY OF THE HORSE INTHEIR DRIVING TESTS.**  to be clear, I lived in the US, and some of the rules were different, I just wanted to make it clear that in my country I was legally in the right.

\*\*Important edit\*\* there was a path for bikes and walkers only adjacent and we are in an area where horses are very common and most people know to avoid them and ask to interact with them

Pretty much the title, I (15f) own several horses and train horses that have never been handled to be ridden and have been riding for 10 years now. My pony is Prince, a 5-year-old Connemara. Prince is not a rescue, we bought him last year, he is young and scared of bicycles - he snorts and prances but as long as they aren't too loud or close enough to touch he doesn't buck or kick. I always talk to the bikes if they are coming too close. I normally do this by calling ""Excuse me, can you slow down, he's scared of bikes."", but I often don't need to.

I was riding him down one of my favorite trails that is about 2 meters wide. I meet a bike on here about 1 every time I go down there. He has never misbehaved, and I think it helps desensitize him. However, that day (a rainy Sunday when it would normally be deserted) there were around 30 13-14-year-olds on bikes with headphones in, so they could not hear me. By the time I realized there were more than normal, I could not turn around because he gets far more upset when they come from behind. I pulled him off the path and walked him along the thin grass verge to try and get him as far from them as possible. I did consider dismounting but he tends to get more agitated and less easy to control on the ground. By the time most of them had passed, I had to pull him back onto the path because there were dense trees on either side. At that point, he spotted an abandoned shopping trolley, and I let him look at it and move past at his own speed, as the path was empty apart from a family about 20m behind us just entering the tree area and blocking us in.

Enter Darren. He was cycling toward us, and I could feel an already anxious Prince approach boiling point, and I asked him to slow down or possibly dismount his bike. He didn't, if anything he sped up and said ""Why?"". I said, quite loudly because he was getting close ""He's really scared of bikes!"" And Darren said ""How is that my problem?"" in a really passive aggressive voice. I completely lost it, I yelled ""It becomes your problem when he kicks you and puts you in hospital and breaks your bike and you have to pay because you broke the highway code!"" The dad from the family behind me starts saying ""just stop man."" and Prince is starting to rear and I'm concerned for his safety and mine because the path is concrete so a push him as far into the trees as he will go while Darren cycles merrily on his way while swearing at me. He also nearly cycled into the stroller of the family behind on purpose so the mum had to jump out the way. It took me ages to calm Prince down, and it has majorly set us back in training.

My dad says that I shouldn't have yelled at him.

AITA?

Also I'm in the UK where the Highway code says 2 or more meters between any vehicle and a horse. I was wearing lots of Hi-vis. I couldn't exit the trail because Prince wasn't listening and the family was blocking us.

Edit: Just to be clear, it was a bridleway which is designated for horses but walkers and bikers are allowed too. And Darren was around 40 I would guess, so not a kid.",0.62
"AITA for taking down a disrespectful picture? I (58F) go and visit my mother (85F) every weekend. My family has a sarcastic and disrespectful sense of humor, and sometimes it really gets on my nerves. For some backstory, I have two children and my ex husband and I divorced around 15 years ago, when the kids were young. I have tried to date since, but haven’t had any luck in terms of long term relationships. I wasn’t gonna settle down with just anyone, my kids are my top priority and I’m okay with that. 

My mother and siblings like to poke fun at me for being single for so long. They had my wedding picture up on the wall for a long time, and recently they put a piece of paper over my ex husband’s face with a sticker saying “open position, inquire inside.” They thought it was soooo hilarious. I, however, was offended and expressed that as such. Despite me telling them that I was in fact not okay with their joke, they left the picture up. I had to see it for months and months, all while biting my tongue to keep the peace. My sister especially likes to make jokes while she’s living in a glass house herself, as she is also divorced. But my mom favors her for whatever reason. There’s no wedding pictures of her up on the wall. 

For Christmas, I got my mother a bunch of lovely pictures, hoping that she would cave and replace the joke one. She refused, saying she liked that picture. I rolled my eyes. Eventually I got tired of it and took the picture out of the frame. I told her she has many options that don’t make me uncomfortable, and left with the joke picture. I honestly wanted to just rip it up, but I didn’t. I have it at home. My mother called me screaming that I stole from her.

"AITA If I asked my husband to help me take out the christmas tree and for 2 weeks its been sitting here I (25 F) and my husband (28M) have been married for about 6 months. We have been together for about 5 years and lived together for about 4. Some back story, I have ragging anxiety and OCD (from a childhood of intense trauma like drug addict dad and an narcissistic mom) and my husband has ADHD (grew up with a 2 parent loving household). So, as you can probably tell (and with gender roles exacerbating the issue) we fight a lot abt messes. I have gotten a lot better bc some of the things I agree are just too much to be mad at sometimes like whatever a shirt or a pair of shoes can sit out for a little bit. But what my husband is failing to understand is that with OCD and just regular old being a woman, we start to get resentful when we have to asked over and over again for the same shit. So, my husband never grew up with real christmas trees bc he is allergic. Well, so am I and we always had real christmas trees, you just touch it with gloves! So, about 2 weeks ago I had a day off from work (I work nightshift 4 days a week) and I decided to take down all the christmas decorations myself. So then I said to my husband “i want to take the tree out today” So here comes the issue, instead of just saying yes it either comes eith an excuse or a question 

him “well what are we going to do with it?”
me “throw it in the dumpster like we did last year” 
him “can we throw it in the dumpster?” 
(we have the same apt and same landlord)
me “yes we did it last year”
him “can we do it later i don’t wanna do it today” 
me “well idk when else we are going to do it i work the rest of the week and then we are going away to visit your mom for the weekend” 

but my first mistake here was letting him ask to do it another day, we should’ve just done it then but I wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt

Now, its 2 weeks later, 2 weekend trips passed, and the tree was still here. Now being beyond frustrated I said “we are taking the tree out now” and he said “well there were gloves here where are they now” so then i flipped out. Yes ik screaming and yelling are not condusive to have a conversation but i’m not a quiet and timid person. i had to go to intense therapy to help control my compulsions and anger so tbh I’ve come a long way bc 3 years ago I would’ve just cursed him out for telling me no the first time. 

But I said “no I don’t know where your gloves are, you had two weeks go find them” and then I got impatient waiting for him to find the gloves so I said Ill just do it myself and ripped the tree out of the stand and started dragging it out of the house myself. 

Now my husband is saying i’m overreacting bc i wouldn’t let him find the gloves and that i’m mean and this all could’ve been avoided if i had more patience.

I have asked them to at least not do It in the middle of the day and told them that at night when I'm asleep they can i cant force them to not had sex but still. My aunt did not like that and told me to just not listen. My aunt and uncle live in a 1 bedroom apartment and it's really small and the walls are thin and I tried to explain that that's hard to do when its such a small place!! I also told her how would she feel if she heard me have sex in the other room and she shrugged me off!! My uncle does not like arguing so he made us drop it. There was this Tension between me and my aunt the rest of the night i get there young but they have all the time to have sex when i am not there and all i asked is if they can please at the least do it at night.my aunt told me I would understand when i get in a super intimate relationship but i dont think i will i would never have sex with someone in my home and if i did and they asked me to stop i would. But my aunt is making me feel really bad so am I the asshole for asking my aunt and uncle to not have sex when I am over.",0.4
"AITA for telling my step mother that i won't eat her cooking? My (F16) dad (Damon, M34) had recently gotten remarried, after the death of my papa (Johnny, M35) three years ago. At first, I was absolutely horrified by my dad's new partner, he had been with papa since they met at uni. Papa was a gorgeous, artistic, eccentric man, he was the best father you could've ever asked for, he left an impression on everyone he had ever met.

By comparison, this new partner (Florence, 36) was a comedown. She really is just an average middle class woman, scared to death of anything even remotely 'out there.' She has rather rigid, narrow minded beliefs, she raised hell when she found out my A-Level choices (music, art, film studies) and tried to dictate that I change them to something more 'academic'.

I feel as though Damon is only tolerating her because he's managed (somehow) to get her pregnant. They aren't exactly the most loved up couple, Damon has called her 'ghastly' before, and sometimes when she says something, he will roll his eyes. 

Damon, papa and I have always been vegetarian, ever since they've adopted me I have not tasted meat. I'm still vegetarian now, Damon is not. I refuse to eat meat in any context. Recently, Florence had stopped working and now she insists on making dinner for everyone (she doesn't let me cook my own.), it was fine when the food was veggie, but now she's practically serving meat any chance she gets. When she gave me a plate with meat on it, I reminded her that I'm vegetarian, which led to her insulting me by telling me I look anaemic and that i don't know what I'm missing out on.

She started saying that I will need to start eating meat now that she's in control of meals, and to 'set an example' for her kid once it starts eating solids. I told her straight up that if that is the case, I refuse to eat anything she makes. I have stuck to it, I refuse to join them at dinnertime, I'm living off of avocado bagels, toast and snacks because she still isn't letting me cook. It's made her awfully upset and feel rejected.

Florence has started calling me childish and ungrateful, and my grandparents (once they heard) said that I was creating resentment for no clear reason asides from spite, that I should stop for the pregnancy's sake. Damon congratulates me for my strong will, but even he says to just give in and stop the charade.",0.69
"AITA for transcribing my girlfriend’s arguments during a fight in a notebook? Every time that we engage in an argument I feel like my position gets awfully misrepresented. Then I bring up how my position was misrepresented and I start to get a feeling like I’m being gaslit by my gf that I am the one misremembering/misquoting. 

I hate being misrepresented and I hate it when during a fight my GF oversimplifies what led to a fight, or omits parts of what happened to make me look worse. 

So a couple nights ago when we got into a fight I went to my room, grabbed a pen and a notebook and asked my GF to tell me her side of the story. I promised to not interrupt. She was confused as to why I have a pen with a notebook, but I told her to ignore it. 

She started to tell me her side of the story, I started my note taking. At first she questioned whether or not I’m even paying attention (she assumed I was doodling), I assured her that’s not the case. 

She finished telling her side of the story, and I started to go through each of her points one by one. That was when she realized that I was note taking, and for some reason she got insulted. She insisted that me taking notes is “super weird” and that “we are not in court”. 

I insisted that unless I’m allowed to use my notes I’m not engaging in the conversation. She insisted that unless I’m giving up the notebook she is not talking to me, because “using notes when talking to your girlfriend is the dumbest shit she heard”. It’s been two days and we still haven’t talked. AITA?",0.11
"AITA for spoiling my younger daughter and not my oldest too? I have 2 daughters, Rita 22 and Jade 20. Their dad and I have been divorced for over a decade. I'm remarried and have been for 5 years to Tom. He has 2 teen daughters of his own that are not relevant to the issue at hand.

Rita is upset because she feels I do more for Jade than I do her. Jade is in college full time, we're paying for her education. We bought Jade a nice second hand car and paid her insurance for a year. We also give Jade $250 a month in spending money to use how she sees fit. Jade is an A student, very driven, works 25 hours a week and volunteers as a tutor for underprivileged kids in elementary and middle school.

Rita lives at home, is pregnant, only worked 3 months before she quit her job, decided she has no interest in college and prefers to hang out with her boyfriend and their friends. I've had many long and difficult conversations about life and where she sees her future going. Rita has no idea and basically says her and bf will either wing it or just figure it out when the time comes. She's made it crystal clear though that her future does not involve higher education. Rita has also chosen not to learn to drive.

Rita knows we are paying for Jade's education and other expenses, she says that whatever amount we are giving to Jade each month for all things combined we should give her the cash equivalent of. In a sense we are, we own a decent amount of land, think 100+ acres that I inherited and are building Rita a 3 bedroom, 2.5 bathroom, 2,000sf ranch home on the property for her to raise her baby in. Her house will be on a 2 acre fenced in section with an attached garage, above ground recessed pool surrounded by a large patio. Rita says I'm only doing this because she's pregnant, which is true, I want her out of my house, and even once it's finished her and her bf will be responsible for all the monthly bills, also true, but I will pay their property taxes for 5 years as I promised. 

When I remind Rita of what we're doing for her, she says yeah she appreciates it and all but it's not the same. That we give Jade money free and clear with no expectation for her to pay bills (she's in student housing and that's included in her rent we cover.) Rita wants the equal treatment as her sister and I told her if she wants that, to learn to drive, hold down a job, volunteer her weekends and go to college. Rita started crying and told me I obviously prefer Jade. AITA?",0.24
"AITA My Mom opened presents with my son early, and we got mad I am 45 with a four year old son. My Mom asked that he spend the night with her and her husband the Friday night before Sunday Christmas Eve. My husband said no because he was concerned she would start drama and “ruin Christmas” as she has a history of making decisions during childcare that we end up disliking. I told him it would be fine and I would speak to her ahead of time to clear up any possible issues. I dropped him off Friday night at 7pm (we were late as it took longer to see Santa than we had planned.) I asked her what the plan was for Christmas presents. She stated they planned to come over on Christmas morning and bring my sons presents for us to open together. She also reiterated she didn’t get me or my husband much as they are broke this year and I assured her that was fine and I had presents for them. Her husband then piped up and stated “ we are bringing ALL the presents over there on Christmas?” And she said loudly “yes honey that is the plan” it seems pretty clear at the time her husband had been told a different plan. I was a little concerned by this so after we hung out a bit longer I decided to spell it out for her as we walked to my car. I said “please don’t do anything to spoil the magic of Christmas for him as he is smart and will notice if you say Santa came to your house too or came early or something like that” She assured me she wouldn’t do anything like that. We’ll fast forward to Saturday morning and she asked us to pick him up by noon. My husband is there at noon and noticed new toys scattered around the living room and wrapping paper from unwrapped presents stuffed into a trash bag. He took a picture to show me and left. When my four year old son gets home he proceeds to tell me that “spent all night opening presents until the sun came up” I am shown the picture and I ask kiddo about the toys and he lists off all the new stuff he got which I counted at least 8-9 items. So I call my Mom and ask her “did you open all the Christmas presents early?” She says yeah and it’s done now so get over it. I’m stunned by this so I just say that I’m not happy and hang up the phone. We’ll this escalates into an argue by text back and forth where she concedes they saved the 3 biggest for our house and opened the rest because “it was my sons idea” and why am I causing so much drama over socks. (That was the only present she let him bring home, they kept the rest there) well my husband and I get into a huge argument over this because he thinks she lied to my face and disrespected our wishes and he didn’t want her over for Christmas. I had to text her and tell her not to come but I apologized and told her I love her. Her argument was that I never explicitly stated they couldn’t open presents early and that my husband is abusive and controlling and he ruined Christmas when she was just trying to give my son some happy memories. Now my Mom has blocked me on all platforms over this and I don’t when she will ever speak to me again. AITA?",0.95
"AITA for asking my bf to stop listening to his mother? I (20f) and my bf (20m) have been together for almost a year. We are eachothers first real  relationship. During the year has had a lot of arguments that have included his mother. To begin I like to clarify that I really want to impress and be liked by my boyfriend’s family. His family is well kinda close. But he is not really with them. When he is at home he is always in his room gaming. I have had some weird feelings about being in their house and I’m feeling uncomfortable being there. Firstly they have two different set of dishes and whenever I eat with them his mother is always using a different plate than everyone else’s. Which is weird because they have enough plates for everyone to have the same. Another thing is that they only have 4 chairs around the kitchen table, so we always get an extra one. But it’s weird because they have another table with 6 chairs. But then again his mother is always making sure that I am a bit excluded. That I am sitting at different places and taking other people’s chairs because “I’m a guest”. I am not invited to there events but my bf is to ours. We have invited him to vacations and road trips. But his mother don’t want me with them. So I’m not welcome, but no big dealThis is not that bad but then it comes to other things. Like when she is disappointed that I tag along my bf to them. Her whole face just falls. And sometimes when she is dissatisfied with me for tagging along she decides that I don’t “deserve “ her company by not looking, talking or even acknowledging me. She is however talking to my bf and asking questions that could include us both. 
I have talked to my bf about her behaviour and if I’m overthinking everything. But he sees it sometimes and that’s just the way she is. I have not pressed the topic further until yesterday. Before yesterday my bf has never talked to his mother about me being uncomfortable at his house but he is tired about me always being uncomfortable at his home. So he talked to her. And forgot about it and two days later she says that she is angry with me and that I’m no longer welcome to be at his home because she is not happy about me being there if I’m SO uncomfortable. This has resulted in me not wanting to be at his home. He is on the other hand wanting me there. But because I never talked to her directly I feel like it’s his responsibility to solve it. I have however told him that I don’t want his mother to be anywhere near our relationship, no opinions or anything like that. I did also ask him to take a step back from his mother because she has a very strong hand around his neck. With similar ways like ignoring him or being angry and upset with him and just being grumpy. I feel like it’s not really my place either but I can’t take another discussion that is taking place because his mother had a opinion. Am I the asshole for asking him to stop listening to his mother’s opinions about us and taking a step back from his mother when she is controlling him?",0.17
AITA for refusing name my daughter the name her dad had picked out for his child ever since he was young My husband has always wanted to name his daughter Alicia but I once met a girl named Alicia that I don’t f with.

"AITA for not wanting my stepdaughter to come over anymore? I (42 f) married my husband (39 M) 2 years ago. We were friends first, so we knew exactly how big our family would get. All of our kids had time to adjust, and we have tweaked things along the way. 

My one stepdaughter (14 and not biologically his) is constantly talking bad about myself, her father, and her sisters (making some of them cry) to our live-in daughter-in-law (18). She brags about all this money that is spent on her by her family and is constantly talking about what boy to date next. Her sister's and my daughter-in-law have politely asked her to stop talking about these things, but she won't stop. She also tries to dress provocatively. My husband and I have discussed things with her before to make it clear that she needs to stop this behavior. It is a hassle to get her to do anything around the house as she just wants to be on her phone all day. Her mom and I aren't on the best terms, so asking her for help with the matter is not an option. 

The other day, she was telling my daughter-in-law that I am bat s*** crazy and I have no right to remove her phone from her possession at any time. I, of course, filled in my husband on everything, and he feels that she's just a little girl and needs to be able to vent to people in the house. If it was one person, I would understand, but she is venting to everyone about everybody. Her sisters, my daughter-in-law, my sons, and I are all sick of the drama. We know that having a lot of girls in the house, six teenage girls, will automatically have more drama, but whenever this one step daughter is gone, things are way more peaceful.  

Almost everybody in the house would be happy if she would just stay at her mom's, and her father has already given her that option. I did find out that she does not want to come to our house at all. She comes only because her mom makes her and wants to know every detail of what happens in the house when the little kids (7m & 9f) are here. Since she doesn't want to be here and almost everyone doesn't want her to be here, am I really the a-hole for not wanting her to come over anymore?

FYI: The mother of the stepdaughter in this story is my husband's second ex-wife. His first ex-wife and I get along great and co-parent very well together. I do have good relationships with his other children.

Update: I realize there's some info that would put things more into perspective, so I apologize for that missing. My husband met his daughter when she was 4, married mom at 5, and divorced at 9. He wanted to adopt her (since bio dad was ok with it and had no interest in daughter), but mom said no.

18 yr old daughter-in-law: She's a senior in high school who moved in with me full time cuz her fam was starving her. My son is in college and lives with me only half the time.  Both work and pay their portion of the bills....so there's no mooching. They aren't married yet, just engaged. I have a habit of calling her my daughter-in-law, and she calls me mom. ",0.36
"WIBTA Asking my girlfriend not to game and chat with a guy who is friends with blatant racist(s)? We are lesbians so this is not a risk-of-cheating issue. Just a guy I'm not sure she should be talking to. Also I haven't decided to approach my GF with this yet, I'm really depending on the ""Will I be the A-hole"" opinions to guide my decision.

My girlfriend plays PlayStation with a man from the United States. He seems cool. While they play games (on speaker), I frequently engage in conversation with the two of them while they are playing, although I do not play games with them.

He has not said anything explicitly wrong on the stream that I've heard.

Here is my issue. I am from southern-Ontario Canada. He is from some American USA place. The subject of racism came up, and the unacceptability of white people's tolerance of racism (we are all white). In the process of the conversation, he revealed that one of his best friends IRL from childhood is a virulent racist, and uses the N-word regularly. But he still regularly communicates and hangs out with this person (one assumes, in whites-only social engagements). I find this to be totally unacceptable.

To me, this would be a deal-breaker. If someone I was associated with would use the N-word or say something abusively racist, I would break that link.... Like I would immediately walk out of a restaurant and leave him behind, level of disconnect.

So although ""Seth"" seems like a nice enough guy, I'm worried he's one degree of separation from basically a neo-nazi. In my home we do not believe white people are inherently superior... Both my wife and I are strongly anti-fascist and anti-nazi, and neither of us would tolerate friends that have that persuasion. But ""Seth"" is not like that, except he is friend-of-a-friend from that attitude, and although he says he does not ""agree,"" he clearly sees no problem with it.

Would I be the asshole if I insisted she not talk to Seth while I am present? We live in a small home, and this would basically have the effect of totally cutting her off from an online friend. And I want her to socialize and have friends. But what kind of an influence is this...",0.5
"AITA for calling my husband an asshole when he told me he'd just sleep upstairs after I ""threatened"" his sleep if he didn't fix enough food for both of us? I want to start off by saying this is not a relationship breaking post. He suggested I post this after I called him an asshole. I have a chronic pain condition that leaves me in pain most of the time and makes it difficult for me to walk around, and I can't do stairs unless I'm very determined and have assistance.

My husband just got home from work and said that he was going to fix dinner. I asked him if he was going to fix enough for two. He said no, so I told him that if he wants to sleep well tonight then he would. He told me that he would just sleep upstairs. He said this because he knows that I would not be able to go up and get to him because I'm having a flare up right now and I'm in more pain than usual. I called him an asshole, so he called me an asshole. And since this is our favorite sub, we decided to let you decide.

Edit:  A couple people have come to the belief that we don't like each other, and I want to address that right away. We have a healthy, loving marriage and this is not a serious argument. I will eat tonight. He will sleep tonight. This is a joking argument. Neither of us is angry at the other",0.93

Yesterday my sister started asking me questions about the vet I use for my Dog, a 50 pound Rhodesian Ridgeback, Pitbull mix. The questions were how I liked my vet, fair priced, and where the vet was located. I asked “why all the vet questions?” Then my sister said that her daughter, my niece, was planning on bringing her Guinea pig on the trip to my house. I immediately refused, and my sister informed me that it was her emotional support g pig and now my niece is not coming. My dog would go through a bedroom door to attack it and I feel it’s not fair for this to be even on the table. BTW my sister has been living rent free and has asked to borrow cash numerous times.

"AITA for not inviting my partner's kids to meet our child? My partner and I have just recently welcomed our little lad, he's six weeks old. For some context, the dispute is mainly because of my and my partner's age difference. My partner, Steven is significantly older than me, he is forty-eight and I am twenty-five.

I met Steven through my job at a record shop. It's a rather decrepit little place, and usually you'd only have older dudes shopping there for some half-forgotten albums from the eighties. I was at university at the time and worked there part time as to not starve lol. Steven usually came in on his way home from work and usually on weekends, we ended up bonding over Patti Smith and the Stone Roses.

Steven has three kids from his previous marriage, William (15), Anjie (19) and Jeanie (21). It has been awkward to say the least, we are embarrisingly close in age, but we've tried to make the best of it. William still comes over to spend every other week at his dad's, and therefore we have a rather good relationship, however it's different with Anjie and Jeanie.

Neither of them were particularly happy about the relationship, and straight off the bat just treated me like crap. If they came over to see their dad, I'd ask if they wanted anything to eat but they'd either ignore me or say something mean. Whenever I tried to do anything to build a sort of friendship, they'd close it off immediately, but when I stopped trying to please them, they complained about that too.

They (asides from Will) had largely ignored the pregnancy and made snide comments about it, so I had chosen to not bother interacting with the older two. When our son, Lou, was born, they were not made aware because why would they when they've shown a lack of interest? Now, at six weeks, Anjie and Jeanie have been demanding to be allowed to meet him, texting Steven to say that they can't wait to be able to take him out on walks and dress him up.

From what I've been told, it seems like they want to treat him like a doll, and i don't have it in me to trust them enough with this tiny boy, out of the three of them, only Will has been allowed around Lou and he makes a very good older brother, but i have been rejecting his sisters' offers. Steven's on the fence about it, but my friends are reassuring me it's the right choice. My mum however, has been saying that it's an asshole move to not let them meet Lou.

"AITA for sticking a rude letter on one of my housemate's doors because of a disagreement over dishes. I (18F) live in a house with my aunt and a second roommate, both in their late 20's.                                     
 I have lived here for under a year but I find myself having the same fight with my aunt every week revolving around dishes piling up on the sink, they don't belong to either of us they belong to Z.

Z doesn't do her dishes at all which is annoying as she makes the most strange and complex meals out of all of us and often steals ingredients we bought to make our own food to do so.

We all share Dishes, plates, bowls, cutlery, etc, the only exception being mugs, (I have bought my own and both my Aunt and Z had their own moving-in but eventually, they all get mixed, I didn't want them to use my stuff and stopped using there's but they took it anyway), as I said Z doesn't do their dishes so my aunt and I have to once we see that they're moulding or have been there for a while.

My aunt and I have been doing Z's dishes the whole time we've lived together, (me more so because my aunt has allergies to dish soap), I have been saying since day one I was not interested in doing a grown woman's dishes for her and It wasn't my job which I always get either a 'we are a shared house we share chores' or 'you've left dishes on the counter for a day or two before' both are fair, but Z does nothing at all.

there have been pans in the skink for almost two weeks that my aunt has been yelling at me to clean and I've been refusing to do so as they are not mine, since Z's pans were piling they'd ben growing mould.

there have been pans in the skink for almost two weeks that my aunt has been yelling at me to clean and I've been refusing to do so as they are not mine, since Z's pans were piling they'd been growing mould. not wanting to risk a reaction to whichever pan had seafood I once again yelled at my aunt that I was not cleaning Z's bloody dishes for them.

In a moment of no thought I stuck a note on Z's door saying,

'there is a difference between getting busy and leaving your dishes for a day or two and being lazy and leaving them for weeks watching them rot and making us clean them, I've been 18 for less than two weeks and I'm already more of an adult than you, get your s\*it together, (thanks for the allergic reaction btw)'.

this made everyone mad, Z pointing out all my bad housemate traits, most of which are just me not doing all of their jobs and my being currently unemployed. despite being unemployed and hunting for a job I pay rent and bills and it doesn't affect them in any way. the dishes aren't the only thing Z doesn't do that drives a wedge between my aunt and me but they are the most constant other than me having to skip meals because they steal my food ingredients.

AITA for not just doing the dishes and sticking that note on the door?

Edit: thank you for all the responses, I’ve been reading a lot of people suggesting a form of house meeting.
That’s a wonderful idea and sadly one that has failed.
We’ve had multiple attempts at setting a time to talk face to face/ having a house text chat, but Z either won’t show up will yell about how house meetings are childish and unnecessary or just leave the text chain.
I 100% that I was childish for leaving the note I am unsure weather that warranted being called an A*shole",0.56
"AITA for yelling at my neighbor for letting his dog out? Context: I live in a rural area, and my neighbor has a decent chunk of property that isn’t properly fenced. He’s in his late 50s and has some mobility issues. Idk what exactly he has, but he can’t walk for long periods.


My neighbor has 4 dogs, three border collies and a sheltie (mini rough collie basically). Due to his disability, he can’t take them on proper walks, so he usually lets them out in the morning to run freely around his property, occasionally entertains them with fetch and in the evening he lets them inside. 


The BCs stay on his property, but because he has a crappy fence, the sheltie gets out and roams around the neighborhood.


Please note that the sheltie is basically a tiny asshole. He gets into my yard and scares my cats, he sneaks into my house using the cat door and eats cats food. Also he’s terrorizing the whole neighborhood, my other neighbor complained that he got into her yard and seriously bit her own dog to the point it had to get stitches.


I’m allergic to dogs fur, so every time he visits my house, I get runny nose. Also he’s super fluffy. A few days ago I woke up because the sheltie got in my bed and snuggled up to me in my sleep. I was horrified because he could’ve bitten me and I also had a horrible rash everywhere from being a contact with him. 


So I confronted the neighbor and told him that he should watch out for his sheltie or at least train him to stay on his property/fix the fence because this behavior is unacceptable. He said that he can’t walk his dogs and that he can’t keep the sheltie inside or chained because it’s an active breed. I told him to fix the fence and he basically told me to pay for it if I’m so concerned about his sheltie being out. It pissed me off and I said some super unsavory stuff to him, including some swear words.


He told all the neighbors that I harassed him and now some of them are pissed at me because apparently I cussed out a disabled person. Also his daughter who doesn’t even live with him somehow obtained my number, called me and yelled at me, threatening to sue me.",0.14
"AITA: Priorty Conversation  I have a scenario that repeatedly happens in my home. I will be in the middle of multiple things and my husband will start trying to hold a conversation with me. The point of the conversation is typically b.s. chat.

Then, when I don't realize what he's talking about and say, ""huh"" or ""I didn't get that"" he will scream at me that ""I HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION."" I was never paying attention in the first place because I'm feckin busy.

Just a few minutes ago I was:
Preparing a crockpot meal
Cooking a grilled cheese for my child and trying not to burn it
Texting in a group chain he's involved in planning an outing with friends

The most annoying thing is talking to me when I'm actually actively texting or speaking to somebody else without saying excuse me (if it's urgent) or waiting for me to finish.

"AITA for asking my mom to move her car? The driveway of our home is big enough to fit four cars. We have three cars (mine, mom's, and dad's) and an RV. The RV is usually parked in the backyard in its own dedicated driveway.

My dad usually parks on a patch of grass between the sidewalk and the street so my mom and I can get in and out easily.

Mom and I usually park side by side, but occasionally one side the driveway is otherwise occupied and we have to park front to end. She leaves for work early and I leave late, so her car needs to be able to get out before mine.

The other day, dad pulled out the RV and staged it on the main driveway. He moved my car and parked it behind the RV. My car was encroaching the sidewalk, which is not allowed, and I was mildly annoyed when I found out as I left for work. Mom's car was parked normally on the driveway, and she had mentioned that I shouldn't park behind her when I get home ""because it fits just fine behind the RV.""

So I left for work, got back home and prepared myself. I drove onto the driveway and called my mom and asked if she could please come move the car. Immediately she got upset and wanted to know why I couldn't just park behind the RV. I mentioned that there's not enough space and my car would encroach on the sidewalk. She said, ""Fine.""

Dad comes out with the keys and seems annoyed. He had a colonoscopy earlier that day. He starts complaining that my car was fine where it was and it only encroaching on the sidewalk ""a little bit."" It was taking 1/4 of the sidewalk. Mind you, my dad used to jog around the neighborhood and *he* was the one who drilled into me how much of an asshole you have to be to park over the sidewalk.

Anyway, I say I don't feel comfortable blocking the sidewalk, he says other people do it, I say that just because other people do it doesn't mean it's okay, and then he complains that he had just had the colonoscopy and at that point I said I'm sorry and asked him to just give me the keys and I'd move it. He protested and said since he's already there, he'll do it.

Mind you, I never asked him to do it in the first place, and if either of them had told me to do it myself I gladly would have because the whole ordeal upset the hell out of me.

He ended up moving the car and as we were walking back in, he said the next I want to move mom's car to do it myself. I had/have no problem with that.

Mind you, for *years* my mom has simply moved the car whenever necessary and it was never a big deal. But apparently me not wanting park over the sidewalk made it a big deal?

Am I the asshole here?

(also, before you mention it, yes, I could've parked on the driveway in the backyard, but I didn't know when my dad was going to move the RV back there and he'd likely get annoyed because he'd have to move it himself since I'm usually asleep until the afternoon)",0.19
"AITA for calling my bfs brother careless I (25f) have been with my boyfriend (27m) for 5 years. His brother, (27m) has always had something against me. He is always going out of his way to make me feel uncomfortable.

To give an example, he got drunk one time and messaged me on Facebook saying something along the lines of  ""im ruining his brothers life & he will never like me"". 

BACKSTORY:

He is overall, not nice. His own ""friends"" who are the same as my boyfriends have even made several comments behind his back of the type of person he is. All his friends kinda just deal with it, including my bf saying things like ""oh thats just the way he is"". I've grown accustom to it, and really try to just stay away from him in any given circumstance. 

My bf and his brother were both gifted a car when they graduated college. They had shared a car their entire life, including during college. His brother was careless with that car, to which my bf always expressed to me. When his brother got his car, he was careless. He dinged up that thing, he beat it to shit. It looked a mess. Mind you, he also has a dui. 

my bf is very defensive of his brother (sometimes, more like when they are on good terms) but also seems very drained by him all the time with how his brother treats him. His brother belittles him constantly. 

Now here is my situation currently:

We were all suppose to go out to dinner together. My bf, me, his mom, her boyfriend and his brother. His brother didn't end up showing up. I wasn't sure why until my bf texted me today that his brother got into an accident with his mothers car. 

 The convo is too long to post entirely but this is where it escalated.

bf: he is doing good to me, better than me.

me: yeah and i know thats your brother and all but i wouldn't say that lol you are both on your own paths. dont compare yourself.

bf: mhm thats what i was gonna say in my next text. 

me: All i know is that he ran the car that your mother bought him to the ground with dents and dings, hitting things and being careless and he just did the same thing to your moms car so there not much growth in that category but im sure all else is good! ur his brother you know best. 

bf: yeah all i know is i dont want you talking poorly about my family. I dont talk poorly about yours. i was just mentioning why he didnt show up. im already upset he didnt so i dont need you to make me feel worse than i already do. i shoudnt have told you

me: yeah, no ones talking poorly about your family. we are pointing out the fact that he is careless which is obvious. i was going to find out anyways. you cant hide shit and lie to me, but it doesnt surprise me at all that you would. 

bf: no one is hiding shit from you. just move on.

i dont believe i did anything wrong in this situation or talked about his family poorly... aita? i truly think hes just being defensive of his brother.

"AITA For texting my mom about my brother coming over? 

I (17 F) have a brother (19M) who I don’t get along with. And by “don’t get along with” i mean we’ve gotten into screaming matches and physical altercations. We used to live together in my moms house until i got a court order that allowed my mom and I to kick him out. That day, we had gotten into a fight, he was currently staying outside because he threw a chair at my mother’s table and broke it. I told him he could not come back in and he jumped through the window, I locked myself into my room and he started screaming and arguing with me outside of it. He accused me of being a prostitute and many other things. That day, I went to the court with my mom and got an order against him. It was only temp though. 

Ever since then, I haven’t really had a relationship with him. I would sometimes only go to his new place start up his truck with my car, but it never progressed. My mother has reconciled with him though. They talk and she gives him money when he needs it. He’s gone over a few times, which I did get mad about but I just stayed in my room.

Okay, backstory. My brother lost his phone, he does not have any wifi at his own place. He took my younger sisters old phone to use it as a replacement. This is when it went downhill. My mother went to work, she let me know that he was coming over to do things on his phone. I thought he was only gonna stay for a while, to check his icloud or maybe where he had last seen it. However, he only stayed to scroll on his phone and eat snacks. This is what made me mad. I felt so angry that my mom made him feel comfortable just coming over whenever he wanted, after all the stress I went through and abuse while she wasnt present and at work. I messaged her an angry paragraph, it included asking her why hes so comfortable just coming over, telling her i will never speak to her again when i move out, and calling her out for not even being there when he was doing all this (i had to convince her to go to the court after that incident) 

I have people telling me i have no right to determine who my mom brings into her own home and the message wasnt necessary. I feel like I do have a say because, i live here as well its not like i can move out at my age?

"AITA for standing up for myself because of my accent and the way I dress?? I (17M) am a Bay Area born and raised Fiji Indian. The parts of my family that were born in America also settled in heavy BIPOC communities of Vallejo, Sacramento, Modesto, and Stockton. Growing up, my said family grew to have a Bay Arean accent (an accent that has aave in it and some trademark phrases in it like hella, for the f, etc.) which I have also grew up to have being around them for so much and also just being from the Bay in general. I never thought that my accent would be a problem until my senior year of high school.

The way I choose to dress is definitely y2k, all my outfits consist of things like baggy, embroidered jeans and rhinestone tops and belts, but one of my favorite accessories are in fact bandanas, seeing as though they come from India and how their paisley patterns have deep history in our Indian culture.

Recently, I've been receiving a lot of backlash from this SINGULAR friend group saying that my accent has been offensive as well as my choice of dressing, specifically my bandanas. The way I wear them is to wrap the entire top of my head in one, kinda like wearing a beanie. This same friend group numerously has accused me of trying to be Black and being insensitive, numerously mistaking my bandanas for durags and then riding on those false claims.

Meanwhile others don't see a problem with my dressing, and always compliment me on what I wear, and have no problem with my accent, considering how most of our school speaks in the same Bay Area accent and uses the same lingo that I do.

These persistent accusations have been going on for 2 months until recently, when they started actively shit talking me in my face. I first decided to stand up for myself by posting screenshots of 5-6 websites stating how bandanas come from India and are a part of Indian culture. But that didn't stop them from shit talking me.

I eventually had enough and asked a girl in their friend group, who was once our (my friend groups') friend but ditched me for her new group, about why they insist on shit talking me, considering I haven't done anything to them to deserve it. She proceeded to send me a long text about how I am appropriating ""black culture"" by my dressing and my accent, and this isn't the first time I've had to justify my actions to them and explain my upbringing.

I had enough and proceeded to send her a LONG text addressing everything she accused me of. This was 4 days ago, and she hasn't seen or replied to me. AITA for standing up for myself because of my accent and the way I dress??

TLDR: I wear bandanas and have a Bay Area accent, a friend group thinks im trying to be black, I finally stood up for myself",0.08
"AITA for not flying home to see my dying grandma? I live in Canada and my parents and grandparente live in India . I've been very close to my grandparents all my life and this morning we learnt that my grandmother (who is 88 years old) has been diagnosed with glioblastoma multiformae (brain cancer) and doesn't have too long to live.

I'm shattered and feeling terrible but also grateful that I was able to spend so much time with her and hope the last few months/weeks are as painless as possible.

My sister who lives with my parents asked when I'm coming home to say goodbye. I said I probably wouldn't be coming because tickets are super expensive right now and while I can afford it, it's not an expense I can completely justify with jobs being precarious at the moment. Also I have a wife and a 2 year old and it won't be fair to leave my wife behind alone.  We definitely can't all 3 afford to fly over. Additionally, and I recognize I am being selfish, the trip will break me and I won't be able to handle it emotionally so I'm better off from far away.

My sister said I'm an AH and don't care about our grandma. She says this is the least I can do and that I've abandoned the family enough by moving miles away when I didn't need to. I said this is unfair and I also have my own family to take care of.

This has made me feel even worse but I do want to ask. Am I the asshole?",0.1
"AITA for not allowing my brother to eat my friends' food at my potluck birthday party without bringing a dish My friends pressured me (22F) to have a birthday so I am now having a birthday party with 8-9 friends and my sister (21F) at my house on my birthday. Everyone including me and my sister is bringing a dish.

My brother (28M) mentioned how he plans on eating the food at the party. I told him that he can eat the food me and my sister cook but isn't allowed to eat the food my friends make unless he makes a dish or brought food. I just don't like the thought of him just coming along to my party to take the food other people have put time and effort into cooking when he wasn't invited and isn't giving anything in return. He refused and said that because he's allowing people to use his PlayStation that's enough. I replied that my friend could bring one instead if he was going to act like that and he said it wouldn't make sense. This resulted in an argument and my mum now mitigated so he would bring drinks which I wasn't happy about but eventually relented because I couldn't do much.

The whole idea just seems greedy to me, just trying to take other people's food unfairly. It really hurt as this is my party and he just wants to do whatever he wants.

My brother is now bringing both snacks and drinks to be a peacemaker but when I asked if he saw anything wrong in his initial stance he said no. I'm hurt and annoyed about that, but at least everything is solved.

Am I justified for initially saying my brother can't eat the food that my friends have cooked for my birthday party without bringing a dish?

TLDR: My brother wants to eat the food at my birthday party where everyone else is bringing a dish (including me) but doesn't want to bring food as he's allowing us to use his PlayStation. I said no to the idea.",0.76
"AITA for making a comment about my cousins eating habits Throw away because my main account shares the same name as other accounts

I (M20) was recently at my Aunties house for a family get together a few other members of family were there but most importantly my cousin (M16), we’re amicable never bad blood but we only see each other rarely, during the evening we all sat speaking about different goals for the new year and stuff like that due to the lack of contact, during my turn I expressed my goal of how I’d like to start going back to the gym properly as I have a few free weights at home but no proper equipment, after expressing this my cousin made a comment about my man boobs and how they put his girlfriends to shame, my family laugh but I’m sat there kinda angry as everyone knows it’s a large self image issue I have, for a bit of context I was diagnosed with gynecomastia to which I have a higher level of estrogen in my body giving me puffy nipples and small breasts nothing that would fill a bra but still noticeable it’s always been like this since I hit puberty and it’s kinda the norm for me without it I’d look like any other bigger dude in his early 20’s but never the less seeing everyone else my age have regular looking chests and being bullied relentlessly about it during my school years has always lead to me having conflicts with my own self image, once everyone finished laughing it up I turned around and fired back with at least I know when to put the fork down (he’s a big kid who would eat you out of a weeks worth of food if you left him to it he eats because he can and not because he’s hungry usually passing on main meals just to eat snacks and other stuff around the house) before I get up and going outside for a smoke to help settle my temper, the room went quiet and everyone threw the “oh shit” look at each other before my mum got up to follow me saying I was being really shitty about it and I should have just laughed it off to which I just scoffed at her before turning around shouting thanks for hosting to my auntie and leaving, after a while my phone blew up from texts in the family group chat aimed at me but I couldn’t care less I was too busy sat consoling myself with a friend drinking in an empty park, he said I should’ve just left and maybe took it too far with the food comment but at the time I wasn’t thinking I was hurting which I kinda agree with but there’s still part of me that thinks it was a deserved comment due to it not being the first time he’s made a personal comment at me, after thinking on it for the past few days I thought I’d get an objective view because I still think it’s deserved but I’m still being hounded to apologise

"AITA for not letting my neighbor's cat into my house even though it seems to like me more? So, I (18F) moved into a new apartment a few months ago. My neighbor, let's call him Dave (34M), has a cat named Whiskers. From the day I moved in, Whiskers seemed to take a liking to me. He would often sit outside my door, and sometimes I'd find him waiting for me when I got home from work.

One day, I found Whiskers sitting outside in the rain. I felt bad, so I let him inside just until the rain stopped. But after that day, he started coming over more often. I never fed him or anything, but he would just sit in my apartment and leave when he felt like it.

Dave noticed this and seemed okay at first. He even joked that Whiskers had a new friend. But things changed last week. Dave knocked on my door, clearly upset, accusing me of trying to steal his cat. He said Whiskers now spends more time at my place than his and it's affecting his mental health as he's quite attached to Whiskers.

I was taken aback and told Dave that I never encouraged Whiskers, but I wouldn’t let him in anymore. Dave then demanded I pay for a pet therapist for Whiskers, saying my actions caused this behavioral change. I refused, saying it was ridiculous and not my fault his cat chose to hang around me.

Now, Dave has been telling other neighbors that I tried to steal his cat, and I'm being given cold looks. I feel like I might be in the wrong for not paying more attention to the situation and letting it get this far. But at the same time, I think Dave is overreacting.

"AITAH for asking my hungry gf to cook our dinner while I shower? me (33M) and my gf (31f) have been living together since last June. We get along great, we love each other very much, and we share basically all the home responsibilities. For example, she ends up doing the dishes more often because she usually wakes up earlier and is bothered if there's stuff there, and I usually take the trash out more frequently because she doesn't like to do it very much. We also do everything that we can together, like cooking, doing dishes, cleaning, etc. All in all, evenly and fairly distributed chores, and we try to talk about stuff when they bother us. Also worth noting that both us are introverts and sometimes we're very bad at talking about stuff that bothers us. 

Anyway, this morning we left home for work together, then later met at the subway and walked home together. She's saying on the way home that she's hungry, and even though I'm not hungry I say don't worry about it, we can eat as soon as we get home, and I'll go to the gym later. Our chicken breasts are unseasoned, so I suggested we season it and eat right away, but she thinks it will be tasteless. I insist a little bit because she's hungry, but she's adamant about letting it marinate for a while, and says she'll eat an apple or something, and I should go to the gym and we'll eat then. While we're having this conversation I chopped some garlic, she started seasoning the chicken and I washed some dishes while she did that. I then go to the gym, and as soon as I finished running I sent her a text asking if she wanted to go ahead and start cooking the chicken so she could eat earlier, but she says she'll wait for me. once I cooled down a bit, I get back home, drenched in sweat, and I really want to shower. I know she's hungry, though, so I ask her if she could cook the chicken while I take a shower, and she gets upset. She says she wants to do it together, I argue that I'm only asking to be efficient as she is hungry, and I'll take a quick shower and be back right away to help. She insists, I insist, she eventually starts insisting that I go but now I'm insisting on staying because that's what she wanted in the first place (on that part I was a bit stubborn, I know), we raise our voices a bit (not much, really), and I go take my shower.

Am I the asshole here? Honestly, I thought cooking the chicken breast would be such a small effort for her (granted, it would be benefitting me, but aren't relationships about mutual support?), but she felt offended because I asked her to cook for me instead of offering to help. I just wanted to shower :( After that I made it worse by trying to explain my reasoning, but that's another story lol. I just want to understand if I was an asshole for asking, or if maybe she was a bit unreasonable?",0.04
"AITA For having a firm talk with my students that they are not owed letters of recommendation from anyone? I teach high school grades 11 to 12 (mostly 16 and 17-year-olds) and am frequently asked to write letters of recommendation. I do my best to provide students with letters but I am unable to honor every request. I speak for myself and my fellow teachers in saying that we put a lot of thought and effort into each individual letter. It takes a lot of time and it simply wouldn’t be possible to write a letter for every student. I explain this to my students and emphasize that they need to ask for letters early on before those spots fill up.  
  
Well, I have recently been notified about specific students who have been badmouthing their teachers for not writing them letters of recommendations. These students said things such as that they need letters of recommendation and their teachers are selfish and do not care about their students. Some of these students were saying very nasty things about their teachers because they didn’t write them a letter of recommendation.  
  
I decided to have a talk with my classes. I explained that there were specific students in the room who I knew were badmouthing teachers for not writing them letters of recommendation. I wasn’t going to name any names of course. But I said that all of them need to understand that they are not owed a letter of recommendation from anyone. I reiterated everything from the first paragraph and also explained that we are not compensated for the time we spend on letters of recommendation nor are we required to write them. Choosing to write a letter is a kindness. We do our best to provide letters. But we have families and other responsibilities who need our attention too and your teacher isn’t telling you no because they don’t care about their students. I ended by saying that if I heard about any more students badmouthing teachers, I would be speaking with them personally.  
  
After my last period of the day, my classroom aide “Becky” asked to talk with me. Becky reminded me that my students are at a point in their lives where college applications are made out to be everything and not having a letter of recommendation does feel like it’s the end of the world. Becky agreed that the students badmouthing their teachers were in the wrong, but I could have spoken with those students privately and showed more empathy for the stress they must be feeling right now.  
  
My students are already young adults and most if not all of them are planning to attend college soon. Badmouthing an educator or future employer will seriously hurt their opportunities once they leave high school and aren’t considered “kids” anymore. I feel I would be doing my students a disservice by turning a blind eye and not trying to correct their behavior now. And even though the majority of my students have been respectful, I feel the talk I had with my classes was something that all of my students were able to benefit from. AITA?",0.2
"AITA for wanting my girlfriend to spend less money? I'm 22 my girlfriend is 21 

We have been together for 2 years and both work full time. Because we have been together for 2 years we both want to move in together ASAP so 6 months ago we agreed to start saving up. We agreed we would save up £250 a month each for it. 

The first couple of months I didn't think anything of it but then I the more I went out on shopping trips with her the more I grew concerned. She spent a lot of money everytime. For example she'd buy a really expensive dress. We'd go out and she'd wear it once then she'd buy another expensive dress 2 weeks later. She constnatly buys expensive shoes, handbags, purses etc. I knew she was like this before but u was not bothered as we had no agreement in place. Once we had it I expected her to not be quite so spend happy. 

After a few of these shopping trips which seemed more frequent than anything in our relationship before I began concerned that she wasn't meeting our agreement and saving up the required amount. She works a minimum wage job and so doesn't get paid that much, and with all I say her spend I'd be suprised if she even broke even with what she earned. 

A month ago I asked her if she was saving up the required amount that we agreed on (I personally transfered it to my savings account each month). She asked me why I was asking and I was honest and told her I thought she was spending too much. She got really mad. She shouted at me and said  it's her money and that she can do what she wants with it and that it's none of my business then she stormed out. I'd never seen her react like to anything before. Ordinarily I'd agree with her but since we agreed to save up for something together I thought it was fair to query it. 

I tried brining up the topic again because I found it odd she just wouldn't say that she had been saving the required amount. It caused numerous arguments and about a week ago she finally admitted that she hadn't saved up as much as she should. But she said that it wasn't a problem at all that she would make up for it in the coming months. And still said i was out of line asking her to control her spending. She called me controlling. AITA?

TLDR; Me and my girlfriend agreed to save a specific amount up each month so we could buy a play together. She seemed to be spending a lot of money on accessories and I was concerned she wasn't meeting the agreement so I asked her to spend less and she got mad at me saying it's none of my business.

"AITA For How I Acted At My Ex's Game Night? A few years ago, I was spending the night at my ex's apartment the next town over. It was about 45 minutes away from my house and I had taken the weekend off to spend with him. Short background: my ex is a DM for his friends DND group. They played every other Saturday and Saturday's were my only day off. He was upfront and told me he was always going to choose DND over me and he wasn't willing to attempt to move the game to another night so we could spend time together. My spending the weekend there was an attempt to see if this was something that could work for us. 

He picked me up at noon and decided he was going to make tacos for dinner for everyone. When we were shopping, i noted it didn't seem that he was getting enough ingredients but he assured me it was going to be enough. I hadn't eaten yet that day but i figured i could wait until the tacos were made. I helped him prepare the tacos and once his friends arrived I retreated to the bedroom to let everyone get their meals. 

I was always raised that if you are the host, you let you guests get their food first before getting your own serving. I told my ex i would be doing this and he didn't have any issue with it. The walls in the apartment were very thin so I figured I would be able to tell once everyone had gotten their servings. After less than 10 minutes, I heard a few friends state that they were going to get seconds. I waited to hear if my ex stopped them but when he didn't I decided to wait a few more minutes, then go get my food. When I came out to the kitchen, everything was gone. Everything. I looked over at my ex to see if he noticed but he was too focused on starting the game. I once again stated I'd be in the bedroom and shut the door behind me. 

At this point it was about 3 and I figured I would just wait until the guests left, then see if we could get more food. However, the hours passed and I started feeling sick. I was on a discord call with my friends and the longer I went without food, the more angry they got. They offered to send me food but I didn't know the layout of the building well and it was gated and I didn't have a pass to get in. My ex came into his bedroom to use the bathroom twice and never looked at me, never checked on me, it was like I wasn't even there. The second time he came in I was even crying. I had been texting my mother about how upset I was and she offered to come and get me but I reiterated I didn't know how to get out of the apartment building. She said i should text him but his phone was in the bedroom with me. 

His friends ended up leaving at 10 and once we were alone I told him how upset I was at what happened. He told me it was my fault, that I should have gotten food when everyone else did or come out to tell him I was hungry. I told him I didn't want to make an issue since his friends already didn't like me. He then angrily made me a frozen pizza and barely talked to me the rest of the night. AITA for what happened?

"AITA for not wanting to go on a trip with my boyfriend? My (34f) boyfriend (34m) and I have been quasi-planning a trip for a little over a year now. Just high-level stuff, nothing super specific until a couple weeks ago. Once we started mapping out the trip, I realized I'm not really interested in going. I don't have a specific reason, just that where we'd be going doesn't excite me or interest me all that much. Nothing has been bought or booked, but he was planning on me going.

He doesn't understand why I DON'T want to go. He says the alternative to me not going is just sitting at home and doing nothing rather than going to new places and sharing that experience with him. He's understandably frustrated that I don't want to go, but he's really making me feel like crap about it. He's called me selfish because I can't see past my own interests and do something that's not 100% interesting for me.

Thing is, we have other trips planned this year that I'm definitely going on with him. I admit that I'm a homebody, but I feel like it's not fair for him to expect me to want to go on every trip he thinks we should.

I just - don't want to go, and that's not enough for him.  


ETA: The trip is tied in with an event during the weekend, so my boyfriend would go anyways. He figured we could make a longer trip out of it and check multiple states off our list (we're in the US). He says he's not going to go back just to hit these states, so it's a perfect opportunity to visit them.

"AITA: My best friend knows I hate when he eats part of my takeout before I’ve even had any or had a chance to sit down. He does it anyway and calls me a bitch when I get frustrated. Just got home with a bunch of food cuz I wanted to treat myself. My best friend made me pay for his gas to take me to pick it up… he’s been driving me around for years cuz I don’t have a car so it’s reasonable but kinda annoying. He drives a high end BMW and he’s fairly rich. 
I got a grilled cheese + tomato bisque, boneless wings and a pepperoni pizza… don’t judge me I am having cravings, didn’t want to choose, and I don’t really go to the grocery store so I want to have leftovers. 

I sit down, open my box of boneless wings, get up to grab a fork, he walks in the door from parking the car, walks over and says “oh are these boneless?” And I’m like yeah don’t I haven’t even had any, please don’t. And he takes one anyway. Like you just literally took away the satisfaction of like having a brand new fresh freaking meal and now I got him who just picked at it. 
He literally knows I hate this. But *he* doesn’t think it’s reasonable to get upset about so he feels validated just doing it anyway. He also knows I would give him some at any point after I started eating if he had just asked. I always do. I always give him some, offer him some or want him to try something. 
So I got irritated, not like yelling but just like “ughh whyyyyyy” and he is offended and says I am a child and I’m never gonna act like an adult and tells me I treat people like shit. So I’m making my case where I’m just like… dude you *know* I hate when you do this and you *know* I would give you some but I just don’t like when u take before I’ve even had any. And he’s like “no it’s cuz ur a bitch. I’m supposedly ur best friend.. blah blah” and I’m like… yeah and u do things that you know are going to irritate me and then act like I’m the problem for getting frustrated when you don’t respect my fucking boundaries at all. It’s a symptom of a much larger problem. Like how he calls me a bitch when he gets mad or calls me a cunt and feels validated because “that’s how I’m acting”. 

It’s not even about the food it’s literally just like, you kinda spoiled my treat and then yelled at me and called me a bitch for getting frustrated. Like I even realize how ridiculous this entire post is. It’s fucking chicken like it doesn’t matter. I would’ve literally let him eat half of it if he wanted to but I just don’t like it when I haven’t even had any yet and he knows I hate that. 

AITA for being “petty” and “spoiled” over a small piece of chicken or is he the asshole for not giving a shit about how I feel and then getting mad at me, even tho he knows I’d give him some if he just waited literally ten seconds. ",0.09
"AITA for wanting my toddler at my family events? I am an enormous enthusiast of those voiceover videos recounting Reddit posts. I recently created this account to particularly inquire about my conundrum, especially from gurus in comparable collectivist culture. For context, I (40M) hail from an SEA country where families are closely connected across generations. Since childhood, the extended family customarily congregated at my grandparents’ place for a weekly meal. Although these weekly visits are not compulsory due to conflicting calendars, this custom persisted as my preferred practice throughout my many life seasons.  
  
I have been with Boo (38) for 7 years now, with 4 of those as husband and wife. During our courtship, I incorporated the weekly visits into our schedules; she was welcomed to join the dinners and frequently did. I even encouraged her to adopt the same routine with her family, and now we meet my in-laws at least once a week as well. The issue arose a year into our marriage once we were blessed with a baby girl, Dee. After a period of confinement, Boo and I gradually resumed joining the dinners with our (now) toddler in tow.  
  
However, Boo has been recently resisting the visits to my family (she has no qualms visiting her parents). I have repeatedly told Boo that she can choose to skip the dinners. Instead, I offered to bring Dee by myself for the few hours. Unfortunately, this is deemed unacceptable to Boo. She refused to allow me to have Dee follow me every time she wants to pass on the visit, going as far as claiming that I am kidnapping my child from my wife.   
  
Additional context: I have had one-on-one dates with Dee before without complaints; Boo’s grievance is only towards my family events. The extended family (usually 10 of us) gathers at my remaining grandparent’s house, as my grandma, who raised me from young, is now close to being a centennial and has some mobility issues. Food is mostly managed by an uncle; we normally discuss the menu upfront via our group chat that includes Boo. Though shy at times, Dee interacts with every member present, especially my mom, who seems to be her favourite person at this age.  
  
I am not sure what other information is relevant to this conundrum beyond our identification details. Nevertheless, feel free to specify what additional details are needed to help me understand if I am missing any angles or viewpoints causing my wife's negative reaction. AITA for wanting to bring my daughter to these gatherings?",0.35
"AITA (f 33) to ask my partner (m 32) that I'd like to meet his female friends? AITA? Me (F 33) and my partner (M 32) have been in a relationship for 2 Years. The relationship has been amazing with with him. We've decided to move ahead with getting engaged but there are certain insecurities that I have that I believe needed to be addressed.

Recently we were out with his childhood friends for dinner (first outing with his friends) and his friend's sister was overly touchy and flirtatious with him. She also has strange interest in our relationship, like asking us what we argue about. At one point she got up to go to the washroom, and he called out to her to wait as he wanted to go too, so they left together. I felt left out and hurt, like I wasn't there. After dinner when we were home, I spoke to him about it, he shunned it off saying she's like his little sister and I should not think of it that way. I didn't think much of his response because I trust him enough to know that he would not respond to such advances. However I was shocked that his friend's sister, whom he considers his sister was behaving that way with him, and it seemed like he ws ok with it. We moved on with our lives. 

Two days ago after we were discussing about getting engaged this year, I brought up this incident because I really needed to know what was up. When I spoke to him about it, he admitted her behavior was weird because at some point she even had her arm around his chair too (I didn't know that) He said he was oblivious to her advances (my partner has adhd and is not on medication) but however his obliviousness made me feel like he was engaging with her then and I felt hurt. He said he would never act on advances that way. It was really weird for me to understand that dynamic where he thinks he is acting like a big brother to her while she was overly touchy and flirtatious with him and he said nothing. 

The incident of his friends sister, made me tell him that I would like to meet his female friends along with him to see how they behave in a social setting. He says it's humiliating to do that because my intention of meeting them is to figure out if they hit on him which makes me a bad person. He said that I would pick up on things like physical touch between them, and start an argument again. He also said that I come from a family that lacks physical touch/I've been physically abused through childhood so I'm overly reading into things and think of it as something lewd. He says I do not trust him and me saying that I'd like to meet them before we get engaged is holding our engagement hostage. For me the point of meeting them prior to engagement, is for peace of mind. I do not want arguments about them in the future or social situations like the one with his friend's sister. 

Another solution was for me to tell him in a social situation at that exact time, that his behavior is making me uncomfortable. I don't mind doing that but it seems like he doesn't want to do the work on enforcing boundaries with them and I have to do the work.

"AITAH for wanting my stepson to make an effort? My wife and I have been married for 7 years, we have 3 of our own children, all under 10. My stepson is 21, obviously he sets the example for his siblings, everyone wants to be like their big brother. 

I've been in his life for 11 years, I taught him how to ride a bike, got him his job, I've done all I can to help him. His dad is still in the picture, he's just a lazy piece of shit that doesn't put in an effort. 

Anyways, the issue is he has no drive or motivation. He works at Wendy's, for 3 years now, is not in school, rarely comes out of his room. It's either he's in his pajamas, or his Wendy's uniform. He constantly plays video games, often times with our oldest son, and his group of friends. So his circle of friends is mostly 9 year olds. 

Lately I've been wanting to push him into a career type job, or school, or just doing something productive daily, my wife gets very defensive and explains that he will eventually do something different. 

Am I the asshole for wanting to expect more put of him and to contribute to the household? Or should I just let it go?",0.03
"AITA for wanting a little time for myself? I (42f) remarried (39m) 2 years ago.  The summer following our wedding, I needed to have another surgery. I say another because it was surgery number 14. Ten days after my surgery, my husband had a horrific fall in a 15-ft deep feed bin at his work, a mill. Miraculously, only his ankle was damaged. He needed three surgeries in order to bounce back, but his ankle is officially dead, and he will need ankle replacement. After his accident I took more responsibilities around the house. 

We have 10 children together: He has seven kids, and I have three. We have 3 ex spouses (we get along with 2), kids in 7 different schools in 3 different counties, 8 are teenagers, 5 have jobs, and 3 of them drive. There is a rotating schedule, but everyone is in the house all at once 6 days a month.  I work two part-time jobs and do my best to get everything done. The only reason I ""survive"" the craziness is my chore chart and my color coded schedule. Everyone pitches in with chores, wether they want to or not. 

The problem is what my husband and I expect from each other... and we both ironically fail. 

He expects himself to bust his ass making enough money so that his wife can focus on the house and the kids. His one request: a hot meal every night for supper. His failure (his words not mine): he doesn't make enough for me to stay home. (Side note: many evenings his ankle is hurting)

I expect myself to get done the housework, errands, cooking, organizing, etc. I absolutely LOVE to cook. My one request: having my back with disciplinary stuff (happens maybe 15%). My failure: since I work 2-4 evenings per week and need to drive people to work etc, cooking becomes difficult, and it rarely happens. 

I'm so so tired that I feel selfish and guilty for wanting time to myself to just relax, or get help with things, or let someone else cook (others in the house enjoy cooking too). We are trying so hard.....I burned out so bad a few months ago.  I don't want it to happen again, so I want some me time.  Am I selfish? Am AITA?",0.69
"AITA for going on a trip with a guy friend while in a relationship? A few months ago (when I was single) I booked a ski trip with a long-time guy friend from high school. We've been skiing together for years and have always been platonic friends. Also worth noting that we'd be staying overnight at his apartment, but separate beds in different rooms.

I recently got into a relationship and my bf was really upset about me going on a trip alone with another guy. I offered to introduce them, but he said he would feel uncomfortable whether he knew my friend or not. It was too late to cancel flights and lift tickets, so I said while I can commit to not doing these trips in the future, it was too late to cancel this one. I went on the trip despite my bf feeling uncomfortable with it and he's really upset. AITA?",0.46
"AITA for not wanting to play games w/ my husband? My husband is awesome, takes care of the family & is involved. He loves entertainment & excitement. He has many friends & fills almost every evening w/talking w/friends, having them over, gaming, or the occasional evening of watching a show or movie w/me. This year I've been trying to be more intentional w/my time, & I've told him this. It's a personal goal, not one he has to do. I want 1 evening a week focused on us, 1 evening for friends to come over & we cook for them & watch a movie, & 1 evening where we do something special w/our kids. He said those sound like great ideas. 

Last night we argued b/c a friend showed up unexpectedly WAY earlier than he was supposed to. I was irritated but didn't want to be rude & make the friend go home. My husband felt trapped b/c he couldn't fully relax w/the friend & he didn't want to send him home either. I said I may be more easily irritated because he’d spent every evening for the past 2 weeks gaming w/friends&we hadn't had time to pour into each other. The 1 night a week I set aside to focus on us, I gamed w/him so we could be together. So expressing this frustration obviously communicated that he'd done something wrong & now he's upset.

So he has been avoiding the computer all day trying not to upset me & has been unhappy all day. So addressed it saying, I'm okay w/you gaming. It's not going to bother me.

Once the kids were asleep he asked me if I wanted to play a video game w/him. The game he suggests is 1 I don't like & I've told him I dont like it in the past. I say no thanks & he sadly says oh okay. I feel like he's just asking me to play w/him because that will allow him to be able to play without guilt. A few minutes go by & he says what about game B? This is 1 that I do like playing so I say only if he wants to. He says sure, but I can tell it's not the 1 he wants because he just sits there. I finally say I'd love to play whatever game youre most interested in.

He said, I just want to spend time w/you so whatever game you want. I told him that was sweet & if he just wants to spend time w/me then I'm happy to play any game. I told him that I thought he was just trying to find something that allowed him to play his favorite game guilt free & he said ""so what if I am? Can't it be that & me wanting to be w/you?"" I said it can be both, but each of those things evokes a different emotion in me. If youre just trying to find a way to play  guilt free, I dont want to have to play a game I dont like just to let you do that. If you really do just want to spend time w/me, I'm happy to play anything. He said he just wants to spend time w/me, we could even watch a movie.

It's so hard for me to believe that. I could say yes let's watch a movie & test him. But thatd be rude. I also feel like he's going to use his actions today against me later: “I spent a whole day not gaming and you weren't happy with that”. Am I being an asshole? Should I be more thankful?",0.7
"AITA for not reaching out to my brother after I was uninvited from his wedding online AITA For not reaching out to my brother after I was uninvited from his wedding

For a little back story I went on a family trip involving my parents, aunt and uncle, my partner and brother/SIL and their son (1) - the trip was a fully paid for Disney trip funded by my parents and my aunt/uncle. It’s not uncommon for my family to visit Disney but there was added pressure on this trip due to it being the big family gathering since Covid had started and would be the babies first trip. When we all arrived at the resort there was a mixup with giving our luggage to bell service that resulted in us having to wait an hour for our luggage and miss a dinner reservation. During this time I got upset and my SIL made a dig at me stating “I should have just gotten my own suitcase.” I left the room right after and it was never brought up again other than my mother stating she handled “her” 

Next few days of the trip go by and my partner and I notice that we are being ignored and not being allowed to see or hang out with the baby. Not wanting to feed into anymore drama we chose to ignore it and continue on with the trip and just try to get home. While out to dinner all 9 of us my partner and I both went to the bathroom and that is when my aunt overheard my brother and father fighting and saying “she (referring to me)needed to be talked to and was allowed no where near their son” and my father stated “two people will be corrected when I get home”. Referring to me and my partner and the drama we still had no idea about. 

I later on that night find out my brother/SIL are mad because of something that happened between my mother and I before we went on the trip and my mother chose the trip to express her frustrations about me to my brother. (My mother since the trip have sorted our issues and came to a common ground)

My brother and SIL took this as the sign I was allowed no where near their child (whom I am supposed to be an aunt and god parent for) and I am not allowed at his first birthday or their wedding. As well as my partner. 

The way in which I found out was by my SIL is when I received their save the date in which my partner and I were both supposed to have rolls in. I went to their website and found out our roles had been replaced. We were also invited to their sons birthday over Facebook and when confronted about a tik tok she reposted as a direct dig at me, she uninvited us on Facebook and blocked us on all social media. Since then they have refused to talk to us, acknowledge our attempts at reconciliation and even refused to hear mine and my partners apologies for how we negatively affected them. I have tried talking to my mom but she says she’s not getting in the middle of it while still telling me what my brother is saying and telling me to reach out to him if I want anything to do with them or their son. I have since told my mom I need them to contact me or my partner if they want to talk or try to move forward somehow. 

Am I the asshole for refusing to reach out anymore?",0.83

"AITA for berating my boyfriend for having an account solely for p**n I (23F) have a boyfriend (22M). We've been best friends for over 3 years before we started dating in our last year in college (our current year). We had some issues  before and we always try to talk about them in a way that we didn't really need other people's (our friends) opinion or that we didn't really felt the need to rant to them before eventually making up. 

We're really active and we even watch p\*\*n together a few times so yes, I am aware he watches because I did too. A few months ago I stumbled upon his alt twitter account that was linked to his app. He made it before we became romantically involved and at that time I didn't have any issues with it but I did say I didn't like it. I don't know but to me, watching p\*\*n from websites and having a different account solely to follow those contents are different. It was then removed from the app but it wasn't deleted (it was only unlinked from the app but he could still access it). 

Yesterday while I was taking a class online, he had to line up and buy us some food so I asked him to leave his phone because I was using his data to do my online class and he was fine with it. (For context: we know each others' social media and we've never really shown any hostility about using each others' devices so it didn't feel wrong). So anyway, I got bored midway the class and scrolled through his twitter because most of what he follows are kpop, anime, games, etc. which are also stuff I'm interested in. When I clicked his profile, I saw there was another account linked and lo and behold it was his p\*\*n account. 

I was so livid but I didn't cause a scene when he came back. I asked him what that was doing there and he said he thought we were breaking up so he put it back. (For context: we almost broke up once but we managed to fix it up by talking about our issues more openly). We had an in-person class in 15 minutes so I had to suck it up but we were texting about it and I was so angry. After the class and separating from friends to head home, he said he never used it but as I scroll more, I found out that he was using it just 10 days ago! 10 days! I never thought I'd cry about it but as I was scrolling at the things he would've saw 10 days ago, I burst into tears. My heart broke into a million pieces and I just said every nasty thing I know to him through chat.

We were fighting all throughout the night, while I was simultaneously asking our male friend for another male's opinion. (This male friend is taken btw and he's friends with both of us). The friend said that having an alt account is weird on it's own but the fact that he used it recently is what's off about it and I agree. I told him that if the account was made before we were together, I don't mind. If he used the account earlier of last year, I could've not be so mad because we haven't established boundaries, but the fact he used it just days ago? I just can't.

"AITA for confronting my girlfriend about her relationship with her coworker? So this is about me (25M) and my girlfriend (20F).

We've been together for 6 months and have been best friends for 2 years before that. She moved to a new city a couple of months ago and started a new job there. Until now she mainly has made one friend there, which is a 34 year old coworker of hers she sits in the same office with.

At the beginning I was really happy she found a friend and she was always excited and told me stories about him. I wasn't insecure about it either and I've been inivted to his place as well by now and he seems to be really nice and likes me a lot apparently, and he sometimes calls me when both of them are hanging out and asks me how I'm doing. He isn't really attractive and way older than her so I didn't worry.

However, things began adding up that made me insecure. By now they are really hanging out a lot and it's always at his place. They see each other after work or at the weekends, and they also drink together and go out to clubs and stuff. This by itself is perfectly fine with me, also that they would crash at his place afterwards and sleep drunk on the same couch.

Now red flags start. This dude is currently friends with benefits with a 22 year old and has sex a lot with women that age, even when they're in a relationship. She swears he's just like a big brother and isn't interested in her, but I am still very insecure about that.

Also they do have bodily contact with each other, she cuddles with him and lays on his chest when they're at his place. It seems more and more like a relationship. She also casually goes to his place and cuts his hair for example, and yesterday she texted me that she wants to help him with his personal problems but is afraid because she tries to emotionally reach him but he is just blocking it all ... she worries about him a lot.

Now the part that bugs me the most: There was a rumor at their office that she had an affair with him because they're so close. I am absolutely sure she doesn't have sex with him, but it still makes me insecure.

I called her about it and told her that there are boundaries in a relationship, that guys get insecure about this type of stuff, that i am really suffering from it emotionally, and that I find their relationship inappropriate. She disagreed with it vehemently, not acknowledging anything about the situation as problematic, and telling me she doesn't cheat on me so if I am insecure it's my problem.

"AITA for buying my best friend the same perfume as my sister? My(15f) best friend's 16th birthday is coming up so I asked her to choose between skincare and a perfume with flowers and champagne. For context, the perfume wasn't part of the the gift originally but my sister (18), who is technically my aunt but we grew up a sisters, recently plugged me with a perfume store this sells those 'inspired by' perfumes.

 They smelled amazing and immediately after letting me smell the scent she made it very clear that she didn't want us smelling the same because we go on the same to school bus and she wanted to have her own signature scent that she will use until graduating from college. I honoured her wishes and ended up choosing another perfume from the same store.

Today,  I asked her if she has another bottle of her perfume because I thought of buying it from her to avoid paying shipping. She went crazy. She started yelling at me and telling me that she did research for 2 weeks and specifically wanted a perfume that isn't worn by slot of people, and she doesn't want someone my age wearing her perfume at our school and that there are other perfumes I could choose.

Personally, I haven't smelled other perfumes and I chose that perfume because it smell nice and I think it would suit my friend. I don't intend on choosing another perfume for my best friend because it's very unlikely that they'll meet at school even though they know each other, our school has 2000 people. I just think she's being childish.

The cat food I picked listed beef as the third ingredient. It didn’t occur to me that there would be an issue. All I thought was that it’s weird someone at the company mixed chicken, salmon and beef into one meal, but other brands’ recipe were similar. But when my friend returned, he was upset.

"AITA for not wanting my aunt to move in? A few weeks ago my mother told me (21f) that my aunt would have to move back in with us. She’s lived with us before and stayed in a guest bedroom we had available at the time when she wasn’t able to support herself. She’s struggled saving money over the years due to the fact that she’s never been very good at her job or money management in general. What little money she does have she uses to go out drinking and partying. This wouldn’t be much of a problem except for the fact that I have another aunt that she’s been staying with for a few years now, who’s had to pay for the entirety of the rent, utilities and food because my previously mentioned aunt refuses to pay for it (I could pay for it and I work part time in fast food the only reason I’m not is because her lease is over soon and she’s moving out to live with her husband). Now she’s been kicked out after mooching off of her for years, and this is after she’s been set up in multiple apartments by my mother in attempts to get her to move out. My mother would pay for the down payment and utilities, all my aunt had to do was pay her portion of the rent/food and be done with it. Now after being kicked out of multiple places (including my other aunts house) for not paying the rent, she’s moving back in with my mother and I. My mother wants me to move back into my old room, the problem is what used to be my room is now a sort of workout space and I have moved into the guest bedroom. The “gym” is much smaller than the room I’m in now and I’ve long outgrown it. There is absolutely no room for me or all of my things. It’s filled with heavy equipment like weights and a treadmill as well as a bench press set up etc, none of this can be moved as it is used regularly and there’s nowhere else to put it all. It should also be mentioned that when my aunt moved out of the guest bedroom she left everything an absolute mess, so when I was moving my things in I had a lot of cleaning to do. Including old clothes, messes in the attached bathroom, old bathroom supplies, shoes, and various other Knick knack objects she just left here when she moved out and never came back for. I definitely had to work to get this space carved out for myself as it was a complete mess before and it feels unfair now that I’ve worked so hard to clean it and make it my own that it was all for nothing. After I cleaned everything I got new bedding, new decorations, new furniture, etc to settle in as I was also starting college and was looking forward to having a new space. Now it feels like I’m being shoved back into my old room without a second thought for the sake of my mooch aunt.",0.46
"AITA for treating my bio and bonus children equally? So a bit of back round information, I (20f) and married to my husband (23m). Before we met, he had two daughters (currently 7f & 5f) and I had one son (3m). My sons bio dad and my daughters bio mum have no relationship and zero rights, as my sons dad was cheating on girlfriend with me and the girls mum basically decided she wanted to persue another man without her children. We also have one son together (1m). This is not about our ages as I know we are both super young, parents however, we are 100% finantually responsible for our children and have finished our educations.

So my mum and I were out to eat, I had brought the girls with me. My boys were at home with my husband and my daughters had come with me quite frankly since they liked this place. My mum commented on how when I said I was bringing two of my children she though she meant my ""real"" children. All four of my children call my ""Mummy"" or ""Mama"" and I have known my girls for the past 3 years. So I do feel they are my real children, if someone asks they are my daughters. I don't believe in treating them any differently.

Anyway, the real problem started on Christmas Day. Either spent Christmas at his families house or just the six of us. But this year my parents said we had to come over to theirs as we went to my inlaws last year. So we did. But when my parents brought out presents, they brought out a notebook and pen for each of the girls and full large bags filled with what must of been £100+ worth of presents. The girls looked sad and left out, both my boys ended up sharing with them and letting them help open presents. But it did make me feel angry. I decided to talk about it to them later.

Well, at the Christmas lunch table, my mother brought up the topic of ""when is the next baby coming?"" we said we are done having children for the for seeable future since we are still super young. She started crying and said, ""so your never giving us a granddaughter?"" I lost it. Those girls may not be my biological daughters, but they are my children. I love them dearly and couldn't imagine a world with them not. I told them ""you've got two granddaughter right here, and if before you know it you won't have any grandsons either."" I grabbed my husband, and we all left.

My dad is forever sending me angry texts saying how I didn't birth them and they aren't their granddaughters and that I've made my mother upset. Well quite honestly, I don't give a fuck how upset my mother is. Whether she has to go to therapy and be on anti depressants I don't care. She disrespected my family and my daughters. But I really just want outside opinions. AITA?

I'm editing just to add, my parents ditched me on my 16th birthday. I was in a woman's shelter from the day I turned 16. They met all my children at the same time, both my sons and my daughters. I mended ways as I wanted my sons to have a second set of grandparents. I feel stupid for that now. If anyone wants to you, I do have an IUD placed right now.",0.1
"AITA for wanting to wear an American Large size hoodie? I (15f) recently finished a really tough online course. The course took me 6 months of work, and lots of crying over problems. The course is a part of an extremely well known university, and it’s an online version of the actual course taught at that school. Once I finished, I got my certificate and was sent a link to the (name of school) shop, where I could buy merch for the course, or the school. I felt proud about my work, so I asked my dad if I could buy one of their course hoodies, with the course name printed in the front. My dad, proud that I finished the class, agreed, so today I showed him the website and started picking the colours and the size. Important to note that I’m half Japanese, half Korean with a typical small stature.

I decided to pick the American L size, which my dad immediately said no to because it would be too big. He said that American size differed from Japanese size and that an L would look huge and baggy on me, but I told him that I wanted an over size and baggy hoodie, because I don’t have one of those. Besides, it’s really cold where I live so with a baggy hoodie I could wear layers without having to wear parka. He started getting mad and insisted I wear the medium size, literally yelling, and I asked him if he would rather I wear a revealing bikini to school and went to my room. He went out for a smoke after that. 

My mom told me that an American L is a Japanese XL, which is not a problem because I have a Japanese L size hoodie that fits me right, but they both seem to think American L is a Japanese XXL or something. I just don’t understand why my dad can’t let me wear the L size hoodie, it’s not that big of a deal and it’s what I want. I’m not the type to show much skin, I never wear short in the summer except in the house, or wear tight fitting crop tops. I’ve always liked baggy clothes, and it’s not body dysphormia or whatever, it’s just what I like. AITA here for not listening to my parents?",0.14
"AITA for not wanting to apologize for stating the facts to my BIL's gf? So, I was with my husband and the rest of his family for New Years. During the gatherings, all of his siblings and their partners and we were sat around the fireplace chatting.

At some point, his younger brother's girlfriend Julie asked what was the family's opinion on adoption. 

Most were obviously all in support of adopting and all the usual arguments in support were thrown around. 

When I was asked, I said adoption is obviously great but I'm not a big supporter of people adopting kids that don't want to be adopted. 

I specifically made this point because I knew why Julie asked this question. She has a son James who was born long before she met my BIL. While James' real father is not in the picture, James is very obviously not close with my BIL. He has repeatedly said he doesn't want or need a dad and I think his opinion ought to be respected. He's 12. 

This obviously upset Julie and she asked me if I wouldn't want my kids to have a dad at any cost? I replied by saying I wouldn't have kids with anyone I know has no interest in being a parent. That there's a reason my husband and I waited  till marriage and settling down in our careers before we planned kids. That I was careful to not play around with birth control and get stuck in a bad situation. 

Julie got angry and said I had no right to judge her. I told her I wasn't judging her. I'm telling her the facts. James' dad isn't involved because Julie hooked up with the guy once, didn't check her birth control, got pregnant and is now forcing her kid to accept a new father figure when it's too late. That she should accept her son grew up too fast and now doesn't want a dad figure in his life.

Both she and BIL got mad at me and Julie called me an asshole. 

I didn't lose my cool and asked her to explain if any of my points were wrong? She had nothing to say and just told me to ""fuck off and die"" and the next morning she and BIL left early. 

My husband defended me against his older brother and younger sister who said I was being rude to Julie but couldn't deny my points either. His parents are on my side though. 

Now, at the end of January, it's my FIL's birthday and we've all planned a surprise party for him. But Julie says she won't come unless I apologize. I asked if she'd apologize for cursing me and telling me to die and she left the group chat. 

Now BIL is threatening to not come if I don't apologize to Julie and support them in ""convincing"" James. That I was and would be an asshole if I didn't. 

So, AITA?",0.91
"AITA for telling my girlfriend wee need more sex? NOTE: My girlfriend suffers from depression; it's not very severe, but it still affects her. I have already apologized for what happened, and I am worried about your mental health.

My girlfriend (W 20) and I (M 21) met two years ago. We had a very quick connection and shared the same experience of failed relationships. At the beginning of our relationship, my girlfriend told me that she often needed alone time and that sometimes she might not seem as present; she also told me that she didn't really like sex and that she wouldn't have it as often and asked me if that was a problem for me, I said no. At the beginning of the relationship, we were very close, and we had sex almost every day. A few months later, we decided to move in together; that's when things started to get weird. She often seemed very distant, wanting her time to read her books or watch a series. And I ended up spending most of the day playing video games. At that same time, she also started avoiding sex; she seemed to feel disgusted every time I tried it when she didn't want to. I didn't insist on it; when she said no, I stopped. Until then, we were having sex every fifteen days (approximately); she told me that in some moments we did it because she wanted to, but in others, she only did it to please me. However, in these last few days, it has been almost a month since we did anything, and she still shows repulsion in trying anything. Which makes me insecure. I talked to her about it, and she told me that nothing had changed in her heart and that she loved me very much but that she really didn't feel like having sex that much. I pressed the issue, and then she just left crying; she told me that this was her insecurity and that if I didn't want to be with her, I should just say so.",0.92
"AITAH for kicking my best friend out of my apartment for making too much noise when I was sick? I (28f) live with my boyfriend (28m) and close friend (27f). He and I recently rented a luxury apartment and invited her into our spare room (en-suite) because she was having a rough time. She’s not on the lease and we have covered a good chunk of her share of the rent so that she can afford it. 

Tbh it was all downhill from there. She is great company, but she is extremely negative and at times very judgmental and snappy with me. She doesn’t do any communal cleaning or even clean her own room, regularly takes our food and guilt trips me into lending her my stuff a lot. 
We had to talk her out of throwing a party and she’s had 8 guests over in 12 weeks, (all were unannounced, most on weeknights and 1 girl she didn’t know that well, but let crash here?). All of them have been extremely loud and she’s been warned multiple times.
The one time we had another couple over she got really jealous of them and threw a fit.

 A few weeks ago she went out on a date. I was sick and hadn’t slept in days because of a really bad respiratory infection. I asked her to be quiet when she came home and reiterated that I was very sick and needed to sleep. She brought the guy back anyway and despite me pleading with her multiple times, they were ridiculously loud and still chatting and giggling at 2am. I thought this was inconsiderate so I tried to address it the next day but she sort of gaslighted me and essentially said I was spoiling her fun. 
 I talked to my boyfriend about it and we both agreed that she needed to leave. Neither of us wanted to directly address the issues because we already feel like we’ve been manipulated into parenting her a lot and didn’t want to get caught up in more drama. So we simply said we wanted to live alone. She’s having to move into a far less luxurious house share now and I feel really guilty. 

I can’t tell if she was actually in the wrong or maybe I’m just a control freak? AITAH?",0.04
"AITA for telling my sister I don‘t think her degree choice has a future because of AI? So yesterday my little sister (17F) and me (24F) talked about degrees. 
She‘s been thinking about going to university a lot lately and always talked about architecture up until yesterday.
She said she wanted to do character design now. 
I would be totally fine with that, I always encouraged her artistic side, but as of lately I think a lot of creative jobs are going to be taken over by AI (heck I even think a lot of other jobs are not safe anymore).
So I just told her straight up that I think it will be irrelevant in the future or at the very least very competitive, because AI keeps evolving and some studios already do their animations with AI.
She doesn’t agree with me and her argument was that the animations and drawings are very sloppy to which I replied that this is just the beginning and it will only get better from here on.
After the argument she said I crushed her dreams.

"AITA for refusing to let my mother-in-law throw me a baby shower? I (32F) just found out I'm pregnant with my first child. My mother-in-law ""Susan"" was immediately insisting that she will throw my baby shower. The problem is, ""Susan"" and I don't have the best relationship.  
  
She has very strong opinions and often tries to override my preferences and decisions. When my husband ""John"" and I bought our first house, Susan criticized all of our design choices. Whenever we host holidays, Susan takes over the kitchen like it's her own home.  
  
I know if Susan hosts my baby shower, it will end up being her way or no way. She won't listen to any of my input on the theme, decor, guest list, etc. I envision her inviting all of her friends instead of mine and making it more about her than me.  
  
I gently told Susan that I appreciated the offer but wanted my closest friend to host the shower instead. Susan blew up and accused me of trying to cut her out of her grandchild's life. Now John's whole family is upset with me.

"AITA for not wanting to kiss my bf because of his teeth? My bf (25M) is 6ft, great body shape, with an edgy cool-guy personality. Sometimes he wants to makeout with me and I feel terrible about it because I can't stand his teeth. I'm not really sure what's wrong with his teeth or why they look the way they do but they're atrocious. Even searching ""crackhead"" teeth doe not really do the the visual justice, if you wanted an example. He's never talked about why they look the way that they do and I've never asked. I'm embarrassed to even acknowledge them, I don't want him to feel bad about something that is so obvious, since I'm sure he knows about his own teeth. He's not a druggy nor ever has been. He does smoke cigarettes more than anyone I've ever met in my entire life though. I'm not sure if that would contribute to it or not, but yeah. I enjoy making out with someone and I do kind of miss doing it, but he's a great guy and I don't want him to make him feel like shit about himself because of his teeth- but I just can't do it.

"AITA for still expecting half of the rent to be paid? I have been with my partner nearly 3 years and we have lived together for 2 years. I have no family or friends in the town I currently live in whereas my partner has her parents and a lot of friends here.  
We moved into a new apartment four and a half months ago and signed a 1 year lease because we loved the apartment and the landlord prefers long term tenants so wouldn't do a 6 month lease. The lease is in both of our names and the landlord has both of our bank details. For rent we both send half each.  
I have noticed that we are seeming more like friends than an actual couple so I tried sitting down with my partner to talk through my concerns but she just brushed them off and said we were fine. I tried talking to her again a couple of weeks later but she again dismissed my concerns.  
After the third time of trying to talk to her and getting dismissed I told her I didn't think we were working. She asked what brought this on and I told her I've been trying to talk to her about my concerns and she refuses to listen and she just repeated that that's because everything is fine.  
I just told her that it wasn't and that's what I've been trying to talk to her about. I mentioned that since we were both still on the lease for 8 months and neither of us can afford to break the lease (the charge for this is 4 months rent) I said I would stay on the couch.  
She said no and that she would move out and move back in with her parents. I said fair enough and she said I would be paying all of the rent. I told her that she is still on the lease so the landlord is still going to expect her to send her half each month and that just because she moves out it doesn't mean she's not liable.  
She said she would not be paying. I told her I would advertise for a roommate but until then, I will expect her half to be paid. She said on and that she shouldn't have to pay for an apartment she isn't living in and I just mentioned that moving out doesn't take her off the lease.

"AITA for not wanting my roommate's boyfriend to stay over every night? I (24F) have been living with my roommate ""Jenny"" (23F) for about a year now. When we first moved in together, we agreed that having significant others stay over 2-3 nights a week would be fine.  
  
A few months ago, Jenny started dating ""Tom"". Since they started seeing each other, Tom stays over at our apartment 5-6 nights a week. I've talked to Jenny several times about how it makes me uncomfortable having someone else here that often. She said she really likes Tom and wants to spend as much time with him as possible.  
  
Last night, Tom was over again even though I specifically asked Jenny if he could stay at his place because I had a big presentation at work the next day. I ended up barely sleeping because they were loud when they came in and I could hear them through the walls all night.  
  
Today I sat Jenny down and told her Tom can't stay over more than 2 nights a week anymore because it's too disruptive. She got upset with me and said I'm being unreasonable and she should be able to have her boyfriend over whenever she wants.

"AITA for telling the truth to my boyfriend? Me(31) and my boyfriend (36) have been in a relationship for 10 years. Five years ago we were hanging out with a character (let's call him B), we only  knew superficially at the time. We (and two other people) all drank. We talked about why my boyfriend and I don't have children. B then declared that he will make me a child and that I just need to bend over. My boyfriend was sitting next to him and was involved in the conversation. At the same moment, I asked him if he heard what B was saying. He only replied that he believed in me and that I was strong enough to defend myself. And I did.  Five years later, my ex-boyfriend calls me.I immediately hung up, and that was it. Now my current boyfriend for no obvious reason is telling me that he should do something abot  my ex because he called me. I just asked him why would he do anything now when he didn't do anything before when B commented that he was going to make me a child,and in front of 2 other people.

"AITA for not knocking on the bathroom door before opening it on my roommate when the door has a perfectly functioning lock Opened the door to use the bathroom and my roommate (let's call him Liam) was in there taking a piss. He turned his head and yelled at me for not knocking while I hurriedly closed the door and left. I went back to use the bathroom after I heard the toilet flush and Liam leave, but just to be certain I knocked again before entering. Normally I wouldn't make a post for a minor awkward moment that only happened once.

However, it has now happened a second time, a couple weeks after the first incident. Same situation, except this time after Liam was done my roommate told me I needed to knock on the door before entering, and asked me what sort of place I was raised in where I wasn't taught to knock first before trying the handle.

I've started knocking now, but it seems entirely pointless given the fact that the bathroom door has a lock that has worked perfectly every time I've used it (so, every time I need to use the bathroom). If I can remember to lock the damn door before unzipping my pants I don't see any reason why Liam can't either. It's not a finicky or complex lock either, it's a knob you turn 90 degrees. Knocking shouldn't be necessary if the door has a functional lock like that, but according to Liam I should knock *every time* regardless, and the fact I don't is cause for shouting. AITA?",0.59
"WIBTA If I backed out of gaming plans with a friend because he suddenly wants to include another person I don't even know? Here's the thing: A buddy and I had planned to play co-op on a game together online, and I was under the impression that it was supposed to be just the two of us. Naturally I was excited and said ""yes"" initially. We ironed out the tech issues and compatibility and planned to play the following day.

The next day, we're both online, I'm ready to start and he decides that we can't play tonight, not because something came up or he wasn't feeling well, but because he had invited someone else I don't even know to play with us without even asking me first. I had previously agreed to meet this person and play a different game as a group at some point, but none of our conversations mentioned that this person would be joining us for this game as well.

Don't get me wrong, I'm all about meeting new people and being sociable, even though I'm not particularly good at it. There are two things about this, however that really annoyed me--to the point where I'm seriously considering just saying I'd rather not play after all:

1. He never even asked me if I was okay with someone else joining us, and just assumed that I would accept it if he asked me later--after he had already committed to the other person that they could join in. Either way, he was misleading both of us, intentionally or not.
2. The Scheduling issues. While buddy and I are in different time zones, we're only a few hours of difference, so it wouldn't mess with either of our schedules too horribly much. Adding this third person into the mix makes an 8 hour scheduling discrepancy because they live over seas. This means that either I or the person added to the plans would need to massively change our schedules, and since we all work during our own respective day times, this would make sleeping close to impossible at least for one of us.

I cannot tell if my annoyance is an overreaction or not at the moment since I was just blindsided with the information, and so I didn't want to unilaterally back out of our agreement.

I know it's a silly thing to be so worked up over, but I'm a little hurt that my buddy didn't even seem to care enough to ask about it before he made the decision for everyone. So WIBTA if I just told him that on second thought, I'm not really interested in that co-op campaign?  


Edit: Thank you to everyone who commented. I really do appreciate the constructive criticism. Was a little confused at first that apparently my post gives off jealousy vibes, but it's good to know that this is how my thought process was perceived and it will help me to keep that in mind when I'm speaking to buddy about this tonight. I likely won't end up doing the (apparently) douchey thing by bailing on him and try to make it work, but it's abundantly clear that we need to have a talk about how I feel having someone else just thrown into the mix without a heads-up though. :: sigh:: I guess I'm probably gonna be the one going to work without sleep.

"AITA? I (21F) got into an argument with my (28M) husband over his friendly AF mother and ex. A convo came up because I got curious. I know I probably shouldn’t have but I recently moved to a new state where he is originally from. At the same time I don’t know anybody here, but he was raised here. And here came the question about his ex. he’s very close with her mother because she practically raised him, before they even got together. Which I don’t mind him being close with her mother, I understand the situation.
I told him that I feel like I should at least know what they look like because I’m not about to have somebody sitting in my face on some fake shit when they have other intentions. And another point being his bio mother is weird as fuck and probably talks to them too, and they probably already know who I am. Why would I be comfortable with his mother posting ugly ass pictures of me at my Lowest point to Facebook knowing damn well she’s friendly with his exes?Finally after 3 years of being married he showed me. He ss their FB profile and sent it to me. It’s not that I was comparing myself or anything like that. In the same sense I feel like he could’ve done better anyways. But I know I did too much when I snooped a bit harder and went to the comment section of their picture. What do I find? His mother being friendly as fuck in the comments sending hearts and shit. I felt some type of way because one that’s pretty disrespectful if you know your son is married and two if you yourself is gonna invite yourself over and sit in my face.

 I don’t know why I felt like i needed to let him know. Not that I was mad or anything I just thought it was weird as fuck. He got pretty upset though and I know it’s because he told me not to get upset and compare myself. I just thought it was important to tell him. He said I was being childish and I shouldn’t have cared, like how he doesn’t care about his ex. He was so pissed I ruined his whole day. When he called he said he thought it was something important, and that I wouldn’t do something childish like that, and that now since I’m doing this what makes him want to tell me anything else when I ask something. Or that he already warned me about his mother and not to be surprised.

And he does have a point because he told me from the start not to go too deep or have shit on my mind and to focus on us. And I did tell him all I wanted to see were pictures. And I guess in a way I betrayed him by snooping. That’s how he feels anyways. He told me next time his mother wants to come over I have to be the one to set boundaries and I have to be the one to tell her no, or tell her she can’t bring all these people to my house. He said that if she comes and she snoops into stuff when he’s not there then he’ll be pissed at me. Just how last time she came over and went through my panties and folded them. Wtf? He said that is no excuse that I don’t want to be rude to her or mean. All because I found out she still talks to his ex. But that’s YOUR mother.",0.91
"WIBTA if I kept my mom’s insurance money? My (33F) mom (51F) and I are no longer speaking. It’s been about a year since I have seen her. She is a narcissist and after years of her verbal abuse I made the decision to cut ties with her because I saw signs of her manipulating my kids and while I can handle her, I want to protect my kids from her. I knew it was a boundary I had to make. 

A couple years ago I sold her my car. She severely underpaid for it, I could have easily gotten way more for it but she could only pay 3000 so I agreed. Unfortunately, the title was tied up in another state from moving and the title remained in my name until it could resolve. 

She informed me that she totaled the car and that the insurance company would be contacting me. Because the title was in my name, her insurance had to do everything through me, and eventually the check was sent to me and with my name on it and it was almost 3x the amount my mom paid me for it. She has two other vehicles, and is not without a car.  She doesn’t need this money to replace the car. I have already sent 3000 because I’m sending it over Zelle and that’s the limit. 

My dad (60M) (her ex husband) thinks I should keep the remaining money because I paid her back what she paid and the check is in my name so legally it is all mine and I didn’t technically *have* to pay her the 3000 in the first place. That didn’t feel right, because she did pay for the car in the first place. But my dad really thinks I should keep the rest of it. He is jaded towards her though and she has stolen thousands of dollars from him, so I think he just wants to get back at her. My husband supports whatever decision I make, but pointed out that keeping the money would have something for her to hold over my head, and a constant excuse for her to reach out. So sending her the remaining money would be a clean break. My dad said I could just block her if that’s the case. 

I don’t really know what I want to do. My mom has stolen money from me, and she used all of my college savings on a drug addiction. There’s a part of me that wants to keep it, but the other part of me that feels it isn’t right. WIBTA if I kept it?

"AITA and/or sexist because I told my BF he cannot be a stay at home partner? My boyfriend and I have been together for about 2.5 years. We do not live together and we both have 2 kids each from a previous relationship where we share 50/50 custody with our respective co-parent. 

At the onset of our relationship we agreed we would split cost 50/50. Dates, vacations, etc. We alternate on who pays for dinner, for example, so not a super anal 50/50 but we do take turns paying. Which I’ve always been okay with. 

Fast forward to about 1.5 years into our relationship. Now we are comfortable sharing how much our income was. He has always made more than me but for a brief period, his salary increased significantly and was 3x my salary. During this time we still kept a 50/50 split. Granted we never spoke about changing anything and he didn’t offer. 

Fast forward another year. He decided to step away from corporate and pursue his dream of starting his own business. Which I love for him and am supportive. Because I know he no longer has a steady income I have, on my volition, picked up more of our expenses. So it’s no longer a 50/50 split. I cover most of our expenses. Again we never explicitly spoke about this, he didn’t ask me to, but I felt it was the right thing to do. 

Now with all that context in mind; we had a conversation where he asked (hypothetically since we do not live together) if I would be okay with him being a stay at home partner (with the responsibilities that come with that cook, clean, take care of the home etc.) and I be the one that goes to work and financially support us. 

I said no I would not be okay with that. I explained I think that creates resentment, I wouldn’t want to have that full financial
burden, he doesn’t know if he wants to get married. However the biggest reason is based on how he’s behaved in the past with money, I don’t think he would do the same for me. 

He is adamant that he would be okay with me staying home and him being the bread winner. He also says that the past behaviors around money are not correlated and doesn’t understand why that would influence my decision or disbelief in what he tells me. Also that I’m being sexist because I would be okay with it the other way around.

"AITA for being angry at my guy after I said an innocuous joke to a fellow bar patron, then having my guy just sit there while that patron turned around and insulted me? Scenario: at the bar watching a football game with my on/off boyfriend.  There's a few people at the bar.  No one I knew; my guy goes there every weekend (and more) so he knows the patrond.  I go every few months at best.

I am 54 year old female; my guy is 46.

A few seats away from me is a man in his 60s who I notice is looking at me.  I make eye contact with him and he says that I look familiar to him.

I giggle, smile and say an old favorite line to people who say I look familiar, ""Oh, thank you for remembering - Miss April...1987!"" 

I have used that line a few times in my life and it always garners laughs and smiles.  It's just an ice breaker.  This man looks me dead in the face though and says to me, ""I don't think so.  You're not pretty enough.""

I was like WTF and looked at my boyfriend for his opinion on the man's not-so-nice comment to me.  I thought my guy might be angry.  He surprised me and said, ""YOU started it..."" and ignored the situation.  

I looked over at the bar patron again and he doubled-down with, ""You are NOT centerfold material.""  

I looked at my boyfriend and said, ""Tell that guy to lighten-up a little, please.""  My boyfriend said I ""started"" it and he wasn't going to say anything to his fellow bar patron.

It’s been a tough placement, but through the trials we have grown very attached to Daniel. Early Jan. 2024, we petitioned to adopt him and it’s been accepted. The rest is legal, paperwork, and time. Until finalization, Daniel is still our foster son.

My close friend (32f), let’s call her Mandy, and I have been friends for over 12 years. I was one of her bridesmaids. Mandy got pregnant with her husband in August 2023 and she’s due in May 2024. Mandy knew of Daniel as I snapchatted and talked with her a lot about him since June 2023 - before she was pregnant.

After expressing to Mandy my desire to adopt Daniel in December, I told her in a message we’ve been accepted to adopt Daniel a few days after my partner and I found out ourselves.

My friend feigned little congratulations, then sent a long paragraph explaining excitedly what she is naming her unborn child - Daniel. 

Mandy said, “I hope it’s ok” and that Daniel is the only name they feel fits their last name and they agreed on. In the moment, I found it funny and a coincidence, but soon after I had adverse feelings about it. I complained to my partner how out of all the names in the entire world, she had to choose my only son’s name.

I would simply choose another name since it’d be confusing and weird to be talking about our children who have the exact same name. I have not shared these feelings with Mandy as she is pregnant and working still so I don’t want to cause her more stress.

"AITA for insulting my best friend in front of everyone I 22(F) and my best friend 22(F) are together since 2 years. I am a heavy chested person (size of 36D) and have been insecure about it for most of my life and have told my friend about it. She is a person with the sporty physique. So people do always point out about my breast but I don't say anything as I don't expect anything from them. But once we were all in a group and my best friend made fun of me because of my breasts about how if I'll fall they'll act like airbags etc and then I said ""oh what do you know about breasts"" and everyone went silent for a whole minute.

"AITA for being upset I didn’t get any registry gifts? My MIL threw me a baby shower earlier this month. She didn’t include my registry info on the invite and she didn’t ask people to RSVP (so she couldn’t easily give it to people when they contacted her). Shower came and went and I got nothing from the baby registry. I didn’t actually get many gifts at all. I guess people didn’t think about it since it wasn’t on the invitation. 

I thanked my MIL for the shower before, during and after, but she heard me telling my husband we still need to spend hundreds of dollars getting everything we need now because she didn’t provide the registry info. She called me ungrateful for the party and she’s still upset weeks later. But I’m frustrated because really what’s the point of a baby shower if not to help the expecting parents get ready for baby? AITA for being annoyed that we still now have to buy everything?",0.45
"AITA for calling my bf selfish for setting too many alarms? I struggle with insomnia, it takes me a couple of hours to fall asleep usually. He falls asleep as soon as he decides to, sometimes within 1 second of closing his eyes.

My bf always sets multiple alarms to wake up for work, he gets up before me. I’ve always found this annoying and said so a few times but I assumed he just changed his mind each morning and decided to sleep in a little longer.

Until this morning. I needed to be up for 7 today and he set the alarm for it. So when I heard the alarm I started to get up but he said “no not yet, that’s the first alarm” I looked at my phone and it was 6am! I got annoyed and asked why he set it so early if we aren’t getting up? He said he always does it in case he sleeps through the alarm… I still don’t get his logic. I can understand setting maybe 7:00 then 7:05, 7:10 etc but why set it an hour early just to go back to sleep??

Anyways, then he got annoyed at me for being upset saying he does it every day and I never mind and always go back to sleep. This p*ssed me off because as I said, I mentioned it multiple times. Yes, sometimes I can go back to sleep in the morning but also sometimes I can’t and I wake up with the first alarm and just lay there trying to sleep again while he snores away unbothered.

When I realised he was PURPOSEFULLY setting his alarms to sleep through I called him selfish and he started swearing at me about how I’m overreacting or whatever. I called his method stupid and he called me stupid for not understanding why he does it and that it’s worked many times how he wanted it to (again, I still don’t understand the purpose so maybe I’m being stupid idk)

So we are both just not understanding each other.

I don’t understand why he does that

He doesn’t understand why I think it’s a selfish thing to do or why I’m upset

maybe I overreacted but I’m really ill and only got 4 hours of sleep because of this.",0.13
"AITA for giving my fiancé an ultimatum between me and him using cocaine socially? I’ve been with my fiancé for a few years and I entered the relationship knowing he does cocaine with his friends on nights out and I wasn’t comfortable with it but it wasn’t a big deal at that point because he was only doing in on social occasions and had apparently lowered down his use after being with me. Him and his friends usually go to his 1 friend’s house and play pool and darts, drink and just do cocaine all night and they’ve been doing this for years on most weekends.

He did stop for a while because we moved outside the city and he barely sees his friends anymore but lately, they’ve been coming over and would stay over all night doing it. It’s been a 2-4 times a month kinda thing and it’s getting really annoying.

2 days ago, he went over to his friend’s to watch football and got home at 6am, called in sick for his morning Monday shift and literally slept all day, woke up at 7pm, had dinner and went back to bed. He was very moody and hungover and wouldn’t engage in conversation with me. I was clearly very upset with him and he didn’t do anything to try and make things better.

He’s an amazing man and treats me so well but his cocaine use is starting to become a breaking point for me. He hasn’t reached out to me today either so I’m giving him an ultimatum tonight to choose me or his friends and cocaine. The problem is that most of his friends do it, some on more of a regular basis so him hanging out with his friends and not doing drugs is very rare because they always have it. He has absolutely no self control and will do it all night until he runs out. I find it absolutely disgusting, I hate it when he’s on it and the effects that come afterwards for the following couple of days. We’ll probably be having kids in the next year or so and he promised he would stop once we have kids but I can’t risk it at this point. We just bought our first home and are getting married in a few months.",0.04
"AITA for snapping at my SIL because she won't shut up about her ""perfect life""? This is my (f35) brother's wife (f29). My brother (m31) and her have been together since highschool, they have been married for 9 years. 

They have four kids. A girl (5 years old), twin boys (4 years old) and another boy (3 years old). She's currently pregnant with their fifth kid. 

She got a degree from college, but she completely ditched her career when she got pregnant with their first baby. My brother took over the family business, so I guess they're well enough financially.

Ever since she had her first child, she got into this ""annoying mother mindset"" in which she literally can't talk about anything else than her kids and how much she loves motherhood. She's always giving advice to anyone who is listening, always asking dumb questions that she already knows by now, just to keep the focus on her and her kids. 

I have two kids myself, so I was always understanding and tried to help her especially with her first child, since I already was a mom at the time. But ever since the twins she's turning more annoying every time we meet. 

She can go on and on for hours about her kids, her marriage, her house, basically just bragging about how perfect her life is. She seems to believe that she's in some sort of fairytale or something, she comes across as childish sometimes. 

Well, I got tired of it. She was in the middle of bragging about how easy it was for her to get pregnant again when I asked if she knew how insensitive she was sounding. She said that she just feels fortunate for her fertility. I let it go that time, but then she started talking about how much she enjoys motherhood and how she feels this was her call, she said that it's so easy and she can't imagine prioritising a career instead of her children.

Well, I snapped at that. I told her that she should stop bragging about her perfect life like that, without a care if the other women near her have fertility issues or financial problems that don't allow them to just sit at home all day looking after the kids. She got defensive and said I'm just jealous because my marriage is a failure, so I can't be happy for her.

I told her that she sounded like an entitled child (along with some other things) and she started crying. Now I'm the asshole because I can't be happy for my own niblings and their mother? I am seriously struggling to see how I'm wrong here, that's why I am asking here",0.33
"AITA for buying my boyfriends roommate a birthday present? I (24F) have been dating Jake (25M) for just over a year. Over the course of our relationship, I have become close with his roommate Cole (26M). Cole is a great guy, and we have a very similar life so we have gotten to be good friends. Cole's been going through a bit of a rough patch lately, and I've tried to be there for him as much as he allows.

Cole's birthday was last Friday. I knew that Jake wasn't planning anything, and Cole didn't want to do anything when I asked him if we could take him to dinner or something. So I decided to buy Cole a birthday present. Nothing major, just a book he's been talking about and a bottle of whiskey. It seemed to really make his day, and it appeared as though that was the only present he received that day. 

I apparently didn't tell Jake beforehand (i don't remember if I did or didn't, but he says I did not), and he got quite upset about it. Saying how I'm his girlfriend, not Cole's, how it was inappropriate to do, Cole will get the wrong idea, etc, etc. I tried to tell him that it was a friendly thing to do, but he wasn't having it. Jake has brought up concerns with our relationship before (Cole and i have gone to get drinks before, just the two of us, while Jake was working, and Jake said he is trying to ""steal"" me), but I thought we had moved past that. Jake is still upset, AITA?

"AITA for telling my dad he ""turned me"" asexual/lesbian? My dad is the typical overprotective dad who didn't let me or my younger sisters wear nice clothes, go on dates, have male friends, have guys on social media, or anything else. My mom goes along with whatever he says. 

It was much harder on my sisters because, it turns out, I'm asexual/graysexual with romantic attraction to women. Because I was happy to wear baggy flannels and hang out with girls, my parents constantly used me as an example to my sisters. It caused a lot of resentment which still lingers.

I finally came out to them after the holidays because 1. I'm finally sure of my identity and 2. my  mom started making ""When are you giving me grandbabies"" comments now that I'm ""old."" My mom is struggling, but trying. My dad is not taking it well. He keeps suggesting therapy, sending me weird links, trying to set me up, etc.  Last time we talked he started with ""I must be a terrible father, where I go wrong??""

I snapped. I told him  that he shouldn't be surprised I turned out like this since he never let me dress or act feminine and yelled at me every time I  talked to boys. I told him that it was too late for me and if he wanted to save my sisters he should let them do normal girl things. 

He hasn't talked to me since. My mom keep asking me to apologize and ""just try therapy"" because apparently ""his spirit is broken"" My sisters are conflicted because they can finally breathe, but he's completely withdrawn from them now. They don't want me to back down though, because they're afraid of things going back to how they were. 

I feel guilty because I'm perpetuating the idea what there's something inherently wrong with people who aren't cis/het/etc. That we are the way we are because we are damaged or broken.

"WIBTA for forcing my boyfriend to answer his ex girlfriend's call I (20F) have been with my boyfriend (22M) for 4 months now. Things have been going really really well and the relationship has been thriving, making me feel like he really is my soulmate. I love this man so much.

Today, I went to his place and while we were watching a movie his ex girlfriend called him. His phone was charging and he quickly got up, went to take his phone and silenced it, turned it upside down and said he'll call her later because she's just bothering him with unnecessary stories. I don't know whether I'm overreacting but the last time this happened was with my ex and it turned out that he was still together with his ex, and they are even now. When this happened today I felt like I was reliving this and I was scared. I insisted that he calls her back because I wanna know what they're talking about. Two minutes into the call his sister called him and he had to tell his ex that he'll call her later. I became so turned off and what worries me is why does he not want to talk with her when I'm around.

Apart from this, he also has some painting on his wall that his ex gave to him and he said he's never taking that down because its pretty. They had been together for 3 years and I feel so threatened. I'm planning to tell  him I need him to take that painting down and lose communication with her because I'm smelling something fishy. AITAH",0.95
"AITA for letting my bf be himself? I (19F) and my boyfriend (18M) have been together for almost 4 years now and his mom has always been in the way for us to see each other. 

For a bit of information, my bfs mom has always had something against me and calling me manipulating and that I've changed my bf. Though both me and my bf has seen that he has just grown in to himself. His mother has always been very controlling and deciding what he can and cannot do(to a rather extreme level). By the age of 0-16 he was ""not allowed"" to choose his own clothes when he was at his moms place (his parentsare separated). He wasn't allowed to have his own opinion because then he would get yelled at. I don't know if he wants me to give more details about this.

So fast forward to now. Since he turned 18 he has spent alot of his free time at my place, wich I don't see anything wrong with. But his mom is always complaining that they never see him. But what he has told me they ""forced"" him to events he didn't wanna go to. They acted as if he was 5. Wich did concerned me in the beginning so I told him and he agreed that it's not okay. She has commented multiple times that he should be careful around me because I am depressed and could do something to him. I feel that she does this to intentionally ruin my relationship with my bf. Just before new year we went and visited his mom and she couldn't even say hi to me, not even a small one wich kind pissed me off since it's common sense to say hi. 

His mom also says she does gentle-parenting but she constantly screems at my bfs younger brothers for example, spilling a glass of milk. She basically believes everything she reads on for example Facebook.

He has stated multiple times that he wanna cut contact with his mom wich me, my family and his dad fully support.

"AITA for losing a friend of a friends' microphone/recorder? Years ago a friend came over to my place to hang out and brought along a friend of his that I had met a couple times but didn't know too well.
All was good, and as they were leaving, the friend of a friend, ""Jay,"" asked me if he could leave his recording device with me to record drums on, and give back to him next time I see him...

My immediate response was, ""honestly I'm not comfortable with that, mostly because i don't want to be responsible for your equipment.""
He said not to worry, he trusts me, insists it'll be cool and he's fine leaving it with me. Stupidly, I accept and take it, thinking I'll see him soon anyways.

Well, I did not see him soon. I didn't hear from him for months. Eventually I completely forgot he left it with me, and that year I ended up moving to a new place.

Inevitably, Jay texts me asking if he could grab his recorder. I go looking. Can't find it anywhere. It must've been misplaced during the move. Totally gone. Fk. So I tell him I'm super sorry but I moved and it's been misplaced. Obviously he's all pissy and upset and thinks I should replace it. I'm kinda like...fk man I told you I didn't want it...but I also feel bad, it's probably a couple hundred bucks and I know he doesn't make a ton of money.

I haven't replaced it. It's been like 10 years now. I still think about it and feel bad.

"AITA for not inviting ALL partners to our wedding? My (28f) fiancé (27m) and I are getting married later this year. We finalized the first round of who is invited (save the dates) and now are getting ready to order the actual invitations and RSVPS. 

Our guest list is a little under 200 people including our photography crew, coordinators and DJ (this is because we will be feeding them)

Everyone on the list we know. Like they aren’t JUST our friend’s partner who is their random plus one. We’ve gone to their birthday, helped them move, went to funerals, celebrations, they aren’t just an “bonus”. Our friends love them, we love them. 

With that being said, my relative started dating someone seriously a two weeks ago and has already mentioned bringing them to the wedding. I haven’t said anything because it’s been through my mother’s mouth, not the relative. I told my mom no, they would not be bringing their partner because we created very strict guidelines to who was invited and their are other people I would have liked made the cut and they are priority over the new partner. 

One rule was knowing them a year before the wedding which I feel is pretty fair. I have yet to meet this person and probably won’t unless I reach out to meet them which honestly, I don’t care to. I’m getting married in less than nine months and I have enough to worry about than meeting someone’s new boo.

I’m sure they are great but what if it doesn’t work out with them and I have this random guy in my photos? Like “him? Oh yeah he dated so-and-so for like a year and they broke up.”

"AITA for “bullying” a coworker who purposefully spells my name wrong? My (F28) legal name is Saoirse, which is pronounced as “Seer-sha”. I get that it isn’t the easiest name to spell, so I usually don’t give people who do it wrong a hard time or go by my middle name that’s way easier to spell. To make it worse, my middle name is Rifle. Yes I’m not kidding. Basically my mum picked my first name and my dad did the middle name, unfortunately I have no ways of finding out what was the reason for that choice as they’re no longer with us.


I have a coworker (F33) who’s a bitch baby about my name for some reason. Like I’ve been Sirsha, Siersha and Sasha (wtf woman) for some reason, and it was on paper so I had to contact the boss and have them redo the papers. And yes according to her Rifle isn’t an actual name, won’t be arguing here, but it’s how it is on my ID and I can’t do nothing about it. For reference her name is Kate, maybe she’s jealous bc she has a boring ass name idk.


So I got fed up with her bullshit and started calling her Kathleen, Catelyn, Kylie, whatever just not Kate. Of course it made her like super upset and she started whining about how I’m being a bully. I said it’s her who’s being a bully who constantly misspells my name. She said my name is too hard, I told her to use my middle name instead and she started bitching that it’s “trashy” and “not an actual name”. Like I said I didn’t take no shit this time and told her that until she starts respecting my name I won’t be respecting hers. She said that I’m a bully and an asshole.


I reckon that maybe my response wasn’t the gentlest but tbh I felt like she should get a taste of her own medicine. Also I reported her to the hr and they didn’t do nothing bc the company we work for is kinda crappy.",0.1
"AITA for yelling at my husband in the car after a family gathering? Me and my husband are both in our early 30s. Over this last weekend we had a huge blow up after a gathering with his family. It started the day before. I had made plans a few weeks in advance to hangout with a friend and my husband took off of work Friday. Friday morning I got a text from a contractor that had come highly recommended that I've been waiting to hear from. He asked if he could come by around 1, so I asked my husband if he'd be around to talk with the contractor. He asked me to see if the guy could come another day bec he had shopping he wanted to do. I asked if it was something he could work around as shopping didn't exactly have a set time. He said no. I didn't argue as I'm the one who was pushing for the contractor. I cancelled my plans. Around 11 my husband finally got ready to go, and asked if I wanted him to be back by 1. I was visibly upset but calmed down and said it was fine, I had already cancelled my plans.

Saturday we were going to visit his family for bunch and Sunday we would see them in the morning as well and for dinner Sunday night. I had told my husband I had a lot I wanted to get done in the afternoon and asked to leave around 1 or 2. He agreed. We were eating when my MIL mentioned that we could stay for dinner. Without asking me my husband said yes. I reminded him about our dog and how I had things I wanted to do. He said I could move it around and the dog would be fine. I offered to leave at 1 and come back to get him that night but he said no and I'd be fine staying, in front of my MIL.

I gave in, as I didn't want to cause a scene and he had committed us. As the day went on all of the kids (5 under the age of 9) became increasingly louder. I have bad anxiety and it was starting to overwhelm me. My husband just kept telling me I'd be fine. Eventually I whispered we need to go now and we need to talk.

When we got to the car, I had a full panic attack from overstimulation and asked WTF was wrong with him. I couldn't keep calm anymore. He said he didn't think it was a big deal and I could have easily moved my stuff around. I reminded him of Fri and how we were seeing everyone tomorrow too.

It's the same with Amy for her dance classes. He keeps doing thins like that, offering to pay me double to do it. And promises the kids that I'll do it, so when I don't they get upset.

It's gotten ridiculous and I feel like he's trying to make me the kids new mom. So I texted him saying he'd need to find a new babysitter after he promised Amy I'd chaperone her fieldtrip in the spring.

"AITA for telling my brother / roommate to consider his life choices? I share an apartment with my younger brother (he’s 28, I’m 32) who has been acting very strange and arrogant towards me for a while, but more so recently.  

Firstly, he had been getting picked up by somebody and coming back like 3-4 days later almost every weekend for many months and never talked about what he was doing or who with. Now he brings this girl to our family Christmas gathering saying she’s his future wife and all this. I just feel mad disrespected that he never told me about what he was up to. We’ve been pretty close for a while. Additionally, our whole family is worried for him as this girl is pretty obviously mentally unstable and a bit nuts to say the least. 

Also, he sleeps til like 1pm every day and plays Fortnite almost all day every day. His last job (which fired him about a month ago) was extremely easy and he only went in like 10-15 hrs a week. Shows no signs of motivation and just wants to get high all the time.

Another thing is he takes over an hour in the shower every single day which has made me have to pee in bottles at times because of it. Sometimes I can hear him fucking fleshlights in there, which is mad annoying to me.

I’ve been trying to stay out of his business but recently I confronted him on why he never told me about his whereabouts or his gf, and he became extremely defensive and aggressive with me. I tried asking what his plans are and told him to think about what he’s doing, to which he responded with some very cruel words attacking me.

I’m really trying to be nice about it but I’ve decided he is a narcissist and must be avoided at all costs.

"AITA for calling animal control before talking to my neighbor about their freezing dog? Over the weekend I called animal control because our neighbor has left their dog outside in freezing weather. This dog has been outside for as long as I know. I've never seen them take it inside their house. The weather here is a high of 0F and a windchill of -20F. The dog has no shelter, not even trees or bushes to block the wind. I think the dog is a shepherd/lab mix. I admit I'm not a dog expert, but it didn't seem like this dog had any business being outside.

I didn't talk to the neighbor first because I've heard rumors that he has had run-ins with a few other people in the neighborhood and I didn't want to deal with that. Besides, I figure they know they have a dog and they know it's cold outside. I didn't expect to get anywhere by talking with them. I also was hoping to remain anonymous if I had to report it and talking to them first would have made it obvious that it was me.

Animal control came out over the weekend while the neighbor wasn't home. They took the dog and left some paperwork on their door. The next day he came over and asked if I'm the one that called. I didn't really want to admit it but I also didn't want to lie. I told him that I was really worried about the dog and I wanted to make sure it was alright. He started arguing with me and saying I should have talked to him first and blaming me for their kids' pet being taken away. Note, I have never once seen the kids playing with the dog and like I said it is always outside. He was also saying I owe him $400 ($150 fine + $120 for boarding + $100 for medical). 

Anyway, I figured if animal control came out and there was nothing wrong then they would leave and it wouldn't be an issue. The fact that they took the dog makes me think it was the right thing to do. Maybe I should have talked with them first, but I didn't want to get into it with them. AITA for not talking with my neighbor first?

Edit: Thanks for the support everybody. Early replies make it sound like I did the right thing. I knew the dog needed help, but I wasn't sure if I screwed up by not talking to my neighbor first. I was hoping to avoid a confrontation, but I'm not overly worried about it. I told him I wasn't going to pay when he was demanding it. I'm going to stick to it if he asks again. Oh, and as far as I know the dog is okay right now. I don't know whether he will get it back or not.",0.06

 One of my best friends asked if I would meet her for a double date. I told her I really didn’t have the funds to do so as I was a single mom, living with my grandmother at the time. She told me she wanted to set me up on a blind date and that he would pay for me and my son to go bowling. 
When we met up all together the guy she introduced me with I noticed was very heavy set. 
That would not be an issue or deal breaker for me, but I myself have struggled with my own body and was trying develop healthier er habits. It looked as if my friend (who has always been athletic) tried to set us up because we are both big people.

On Snapchat these thots and girls in bikinis constantly pop up on the discover page thing, I never watch these because they are brain rot. My girlfriend goes on my phone and sees the women on the discovery page thing and thinks I watch them.

We have been dating for 2 years, and in the beginning I have been caught watching porn on twitter, but I deleted twitter since don't communicate with friends on there so I feel like this situation is different. Personally I think it's very controlling to demand me to delete an app and all my memories because of insecurity. I know I messed up with watching porn on twitter but I don't think this denies me the right to have any social media at all. Personally I think only fans girls and porn have cooked this generation of men. I don't watch porn anymore, and it was an addiction that took awhile to get over.

"AITA for reporting my coworker for timecard fraud? I (24F) work an office job and have a coworker, Mark (29M), who brags about clocking in early and leaving late to get paid for extra hours he didn't actually work. He's boasted to me about how he gets paid for 50+ hours each week without actually working more than 40.  
  
This timecard fraud has been bothering me for months. Our workplace policies clearly prohibit this and instruct us to report any suspected violations. After debating it, I ended up confidentially reporting Mark's timecard inflation to HR.  
  
HR investigated and caught Mark red-handed falsifying his hours. Now he is facing disciplinary action. Mark is furious at me for turning him in. He claims I sabotaged a coworker who has a family to provide for.  
  
But I believe Mark brought this on himself by openly admitting to timesheet fraud. While I understand needing money, it wasn't right for him to steal hours like that, especially when it sets a poor precedent. I gave him months to self-correct.

"AITA For ""destroying"" my bio dad's family for my own health Sorry redditors, I reached the limit and had to find a way to post again. Sorry for the title change!

Now for the real story...

Moving on with my life, I have no contact with my siblings (it is my choice which is a lengthy explanation - so I will not go into detail) and I am currently struggling with a very rare genetic cancer that is most likely the first of its kind. Well I had discovered this a few years ago, and it wasn't until recently my doctors took me seriously. Well with this discovery my grandmother and I decided to get a kit to test our DNA to see if it comes from my Dad's side of the family. Well the results came back and we found out...we were not biologically related.

Here's the real kicker. I had called Scum for the first time in many years and she immediately told me who my bio dad was...Trash. My Grandmother then broke down into tears as she realized she knew who that person was immediately. In fact Trash was best friends with my Dad, and we are still close family friends with Trash's stepfather. My Grandmother had a feeling that I was most likely not her ONLY CHILD'S child from the beginning but she never said anything about it.

That night we cried for hours. And I mean HOURS. Immediately I was met with feelings of anger and fear. Angry because the only reason I found this out was because of a dna kit to find out more about my families health history, and fear that my Grandmother who is my only family would hate me and abandon me because I was opening a can of worms that I could not close back up.

Well I had offered to pay for a dna kit, and he was at first compliant. Until his wife found out in which this whole story turns to hell. She accused me of ""destroying"" their family and that I only wanted him for money. No offense but no. In fact I had that written over text that I only want to do a dna test - which I would pay for- get some answers on why my older brother is; find out his personal health history, and lastly apologize to my grandmother. Then I would be completely out of their lives for good 

Fun fact Trash was the first person to show up to my Dad's funeral.

Well she refused, and said I would have to go through ancestry to prove. So I said fine, and made them wait an entire year before I followed through. Turns out he is my biological father. From their i tried contacting him but I am being ignored.

My life has never been easy and now I have to fight this piece of trash for some answers? I had proven that the genetic cancer I have does not come from my Scum side of the family. So now i also had to warn him to get his other daughter's tested as well. 

I am currently going through various treatments and I might be infertile and have a possible hysterectomy by the end of this year to remove the cancer. This breaks my heart because the one thing i wanted the most was my very own family. 

So reddit, AITA for not letting my biological father and his family be, and continue to press for answers from him?

I got woken up at 5am because she was yelling.

"AITA for telling my friend I’m not surprised all her friends eventually ghost her? I (30F) have a friend (31F) who I met at work. She complains and bitches about everything. I can usually zone this out and focus on the fun things we do. However it’s gotten worse the last few months and it’s exhausting to be around someone so negative all the time. 

She used to comment that I was always out and socialising after work and on off days. (I’m rarely home and spend a lot of time with friends/family).

I asked her about her social life and she said she didn’t really have any friends because they all just ghosted her for some reason. I felt bad so invited her out.

She didn’t really like some of my friends (she said they’re not her kind of people)and that she preferred being in smaller groups.

I started making time to hang out with her 1:1 where we would go for coffee or go for dinner etc. I also started inviting her out if I was meeting up with one other person. She always declined.

She started complaining that I prioritise other friends over her. My friend group get together regularly through the week to see bands, ice skate, and gym etc.

She also thinks that I’m not making her a priority because I don’t reply quickly. We text all day, hasn’t been one day we haven’t spoken since I met her. But when I’m with friends/family I try to actively be in the moment with the people I’m with, I do the same when I’m with her. I also can’t text when I’m at work but this seems to be an issue for her as she has to wait an hour or two for a reply.

We meet up once a week, could be more but she never wants to come to anything with others. We FaceTime a couple of times a week and we text a lot. It’s getting exhausting trying to keep her happy.

With this being said. I apologised anyway because I didn’t want her to feel that way and asked her what I can do to make her feel more included. She couldn’t answer me so I told her to have a think and let me know.

We had coffee this morning and she just sat and talked at me for 2hrs about how she’s pissed off that someone she has on Facebook has a new dog and her husband won’t let her have one. Her cousin just bought a house and it’s bigger than hers and thats not fair (her parents bought her a house). She then asked me if I had a good night at a gig I went to last night. She then started bashing the people I went with.

I lost my temper. I told her she needs to spend less time worrying about what other people are doing and more time working on her bad attitude. I told her to stop being a bitch about people she doesn’t know and that I’m not surprised her friends ghosted her as she is truly insufferable.

I may have taken it too far.

"AITA for not paying first date? Context. 
Met this girl at a NYE celebration. We spent the night talking and danced a bit. We exchange numbers and text for a few days after and meet up for a date.

Day of Date:
She texts around 7: hey im going to the gym then going to take a nap and I’ll text you when I get up and we can coordinate. (I tried to plan things but she just wanted to play it by ear.)

12:30: She hasn’t texted, so I make lunch. 

1 PM: Hey sorry I overslept. I was thinking about getting food at X spot. 
Me: Hey sorry I just ate, I hadn’t heard from you and was really hungry. Im happy to meet there and if you want to get something for yourself I don’t mind.

2 PM: We get to the place, she eats, then pays her own bill. (Like $27 for shrimp tacos, it wasn’t a cheap place.)

We leave and walk around the city and she brings it up almost immediately. Not yelling but wondering why I didn’t pay. I told her I’d already eaten then reminded her of my text and what I said before we went in, which was again that I’d already eaten and it was basically on her. She absolutely knew. The date was just underwhelming for a lot of reasons. We weren’t a good match. 

Message her the next day, hey I had fun but I don’t see this going forward, I wish you the best take care. She hauls off on me about not paying for HER food.

Background on me. Young professional, with a good job. My job sometimes makes people see $$ when looking at me. I don’t EVER take any dates out to get a meal on a first date. I like to keep it low pressure and low cost. Because let’s be honest, many people don’t make it to the second date. Boring, not a long term match, etc.

I’d rather figure out if there’s something worth exploring for $25 for both of us, than be out $70. I also don’t want the person to feel pressured or obligated to kiss/sleep with me/go out again.

This isn’t me being cheap, when I’m in a relationship, I have zero issues spending money on my partner. Like TIs whatever you like. I take care of my woman, once we are in a relationship. But in the mean time, I’m nobody’s meal ticket. There are absolutely some people who will say yes to a date for a free meal, I don’t want those kind of people.


AITA for refusing to pay for her food, when I told her I ate before hand because she didn’t want to settle on a plan with me and said NOTHING about going to get food, I also told her it would be on her, I am holding her to the same rule I hold other first  dates, and she chose a moderately expensive (for where we are) place to eat knowing all that?",0.13

"AITA for letting my niece take a self defence class after my BIL said no? I 24F am a guardian for my  
niece Ruby 15F after my sister passed. I am civil with my BIL but we both have different ideas on how to raise Ruby and struggle to compromise sometimes. 

Recently, one of Ruby’s classmates came forward to say she was followed home from the bus stop. Her school is organising a self defence workshop for all the girls and Ruby wanted to sign up. 

I got an email from the school to sign a form to let Ruby participate in the class and was going to sign but out of courtesy told my BIL.

We spoke on the phone and he disagreed with letting Ruby join the class. My BIL is overprotective of Ruby and wasn’t willing to discuss the class and said no. 

Ruby came to see me last week, the night before the class, and said her dad wouldn’t budge and even when I tried talking to him he insisted that Ruby doesn’t need to learn and is fine. 

I signed the form for Ruby, as you only needed one signature and messaged my BIL that Ruby is going to the class and he couldn’t name one valid reason for her not attending. 

He is now mad that I have overstepped boundaries as I am not Ruby’s parent so I shouldn’t make this decision for her.

eta-my sister and BIL were never together and my sister knew she was going to pass so handed her custody to me.

"AITA for rejecting someone after giving them hopes? Hello. I (18F) met this guy (24M) a week ago, we chatted online for a few days before meeting, and he seemed to really like me. He was also very nice and treated me with respect.

I really did like him, but I felt no attraction. Still, I thought to give it a chance cause he seemed like a really nice guy.

However, I realised that my family problems and my studies were almost taking my entire time, I have no time to figure him out or even chat with him anymore. At first I asked him to give me some time until my life is sort of stable, and he agreed and gave me the time that I needed. We even planned the places we wanted to go to after my exams were over.

But for the past two days, I've been doubting about it. Today I thought a lot, and decides that my situation in life rn is too complicated to enter someone new in it and involve my feelings in a relationship. I have only one friend, never dated someone before, and basically the only people I'm around are my family, one friend and street cats. I was afraid to let someone new in.

Also, I have big trust issues, so I kept doubting his gesture. Even tho he absolutely treated me kindly, I always overtthinked about his words and actions. He's 6 years older, so I think it just felt a bit overwhelming as well.

Tonight I finally told him about it, apologised for giving him hopes. The only thing thing said was, ""Okay there's no problem."" and stopped texting me. The Las words I said was that I'm thankful for his understanding and that I hope he will meet someone special.

Now I feel very guilty. I wish I had never planned those things with him before, it feels as tho I stalled him, even if it was just a few days. I never had a relationship before so I wouldn't know.

"AITA for not being able to enter public university due to a ""bad"" grade? For context: I (18F) live in Brazil, where we have a National Exam of Highschool to allow students to enter public college courses. It is a huge deal in here as most private universities are nowhere nearly as good as the public ones. For one to be accepted into a public uni is amazing and they are highly praised by their family.

I've always been an exemplary student. By that, I mean I was the top 1 in my class all years until the pandemic. Ever since, I've began to be heavily bullied, developed deep depression and lost contact with my friends, having to transfer to another institution in the very last year of school. I also had terrible OCD and anxiety. The past 4 years, I've been a nobody. I no longer had a personality or even basic motivation to keep going forward. I was a heavy burden to carry around. As expected, my grades also got way lower.

I have to admit I only finished school because the new institution was very comprehensive of my situation, as I couldn't even attend classes anymore without having panic attacks. I'm very thankful to them as I was able to conclude this nightmare. But the result of the National Highschool Exam wasn't out until today. As I've said, it is a *huge* deal, even though I've already decided to go to a private institution instead.

As expected, my grade was not very good. It was average. Not enough for the courses I wished to do. I was sad even though I saw it coming. I cursed a lot when I saw the result in the computer screen. My mother eventually approached me and said I should not be disrespectful. I told her I was very nervous and should be allowed to be frustrated. She then got angry at me and yelled ""well, you didn't get into college because you didn't make an effort! You didn't study, so you deserve not to go to a good university.""

I got very, very mad. She knows how much I've struggled the past years with my mental issues and how I swore to be better from now on, and yet she chose to act disappointed at me because I failed. I told her she was acting like ""a monster"" and went to my room. My mother followed me, shouting that I never respected her ever since I was young, that she only told me the truth and that she ""pitied my sad existence"". I basically told her to f off and then she left my bedroom.

"AITA for Criticizing My Uncle's Decision to Visit His Wife Before His Sister? A bit of backstory before I begin. My uncle who is my moms younger brother (36M) lives in South Asia and married someone in the US (originally from South Asia too) last year; she is now my aunt (24F). Anyways, I (17M) often message my aunts sister (15F) who are about a couple hour flight from us. I'm sharing this because my uncle finally decided to move to the states. We have lived here for 20 years and he had never visited us but we’ve frequently gone to him. And despite never visiting my mom, he chose to visit his wife’s family first. We explained to him that when he books his flight he will be landing here regardless and there will be a 1-2 hour layover minimum, and we were just asking if he could stay with us for a couple days since he is landing here anyways. He started talking about costs even though we’re offering to pay for his flight from here to there, and he knows we did the same thing for his wife with a first class ticket!

I discussed this with my aunt's sister, expressing that I found his decision rude and inconsiderate. My mom had been eagerly awaiting this visit and had handled all his paperwork and expenses for coming to the U.S. I also mentioned that he would likely find more success here, given our well established business. 

A few days later, my uncle asked my parents to speak with me, unaware that I had talked to my Aunts sister about this. When I answered the phone, he immediately threatened to 'fix' me himself. He accused me of disrespect, including calling him by his first name, which I never did and he is well aware that every single kid on his wife’s side calls him by his first name. And another reason was because I called him “uneducated” and “stupid”. I had actually said his idea of visiting them first was dumb, not that he was dumb. But honestly, considering he lost a 5000sqft house, an established jewelry shop his father left him; and shared nothing with my mom, maybe I should have.

Anyways, after going back and forth for a bit we ended the call. After that point nobody back home spoke to my mom for an entire month despite knowing she is sick and is having a surgery this week; and he took his flight here without us knowing. They say, I should BEG for his forgiveness which I refuse to do and my dad agrees with me. Also, one of my moms siblings felt bad and spoke to my mom frequently. One day we find out that he’s been calling back home talking about how he’s been cooking, cleaning, doing laundry, etc for the entire family. I found this amusing because my mom gave him the world, bought an apartment, bought him a car after a minor motorcycle accident, and every year she switches her phone giving the old one to him, high end shopping, etc.

He is great, I do love him, but everytime he's here for more than a weekend, I feel really bad about the way my husband educates him. He stays in the couch almost 27/7 and gets up only to seat down again to eat. Basically, he lives up to eat, sleep, play videogames and repeat. I know he's in shcool holidays and he deserves to have some fun and rest, but I get worried because he's gaining weight and as a 12yo he doesn't seem capable to spread some butter in a slice of bread by himself, because he's used having everything on a silver plate.

"AITA for growing indifferent to my fiance's dog? Hello all!  
I recently became engaged to my GF of two years. We're madly in love. She had an 80lb dog when we met. Prior to us meeting, I had always wanted a dog, but my philosophy on raising a dog is very different from hers:  
\- For one, I don't like big dogs. I don't dislike big dogs, but if a dog is going to live with me, I'd much prefer a smaller one. Plus, our dog is slowly destroying our furniture/flooring. Sure, maybe our bed and couches are a little cheap, but not many beds can resist an 80lb dog slamming into it at full speed a dozen times a day. This happens whenever someone comes home (either from work or from grabbing the mail for 30 seconds). We tell him to stop, but he can't contain the excitement.

\- I don't want my dogs sleeping with me. My fiance had already established this behavior prior to meeting me, so out of respect for her and the dog, I just dealt with. If the dog was smaller it'd be almost a non-issue, but I ***hate*** being blocked by the immovable force that is our dog when stretching or getting comfortable in bed at night. Why am I contorting my body in less-preferable ways after working all day and feeding him?  
\- I don't want my dogs eating human food. My fiance had been casually feeding our dog bits of food from her plate during the 2 years she had him before meeting me. Because of this, he will always have his head directly next to our plates when eating dinner. If we yell at him enough to stop, he will, but only for a while. Once he notices that someone is close to finishing, his face is right next to the plate again. I **know** that this does *not* bother my fiance as she's never tried to prevent it prior to me sharing my annoyance. I appreciate her trying to get the dog to stop, but he still refuses. It's not fun feeling annoyed for every meal.  
\- He was a quarantine dog and my fiance worked from home at the time, so he is **extremely** needy. I understand all dogs love and need attention, but this fella is on another level  
Aside from all of that, I do technically ""love"" the dog. Or at the very least, I love my fiance so much that I'd do anything for her, including being a doggy step-dad. Plus, he really does bring me joy occasionally. Because of her work schedule, I feed and walk the dog 85% of time (which doesn't bother me...I think?)   
The only reason I'm making this post is because I can feel my indifference for our dog growing and my patience shrinking. I do pray that my impatience has plateaued, but it is hard to know for sure.  
Does anyone have any advice? My options are pretty limited here aside from trying to retrain him, but $800 at doggy training camp did absolutely nothing.

"AITA for expecting my girlfriend to move to Florida with me? We are both HUGE fans of theme parks. To be more specific, she *LOVES* Disney World and I love Universal Studios in Orlando. We live in Texas, but we go as often as possible. Sometimes even twice a year.  
  
She has always told me she'd love to be a ""Disney Nurse"" as a retirement plan. I think that's a great idea for her. She's an incredible nurse.  
  
Lately, she and I have really disliked where our careers are at. I have been searching for a new job in our area, but I couldn't help looking for some jobs within the parks, just to see. I came across a nursing job in Disney World. I guess I kinda figured, “Why wait for retirement, when we could live the life we want now?”  
  
I sent it to her, and she applied. I even helped her with her cover letter and the wording of the resume when she asked. At the time, she was saying things like ""I just don't know how I could turn down an opportunity like this"" and it really excited me. We even talked about how we could just walk into EPCOT for free and try a new restaurant (around the world) every night if we wanted to. However, long story short, she did not get the job.  
  
I know it really hurt her feelings. She was a great candidate, and her credentials were a match for everything accept that they wanted her to have a Florida Driver's License and experience in an urgent care. We think that MIGHT have been the reason she was not accepted into the role. She has experience in just about every department of the hospital including ER and ICU. Seriously, she’s amazing and it was their loss. Regardless, in my head, I saw that as a learning opportunity on how to get the job she wanted in the future.   
  
During the time she was applying to Disney, I was applying to jobs at Universal. I recently have gotten 2 applications ""under review"". When I asked her if I should try to schedule an interview if they give me a call, we had a long discussion that ended in her saying she doesn't want to move to Florida. It wasn’t a fight by any means, but it was definitely a disagreement. It really upset me in the moment.   
  
I’m a really introspective person, and now I’m looking back trying to figure out where I went wrong. I question if maybe I pushed this on her... I *DID* send her the application, and I helped a lot to get it sent it. I *AM* the one that brought it up in the first place. I guess we should have had a sit-down and make sure it’s what we both wanted. It just didn’t occur to me given my understanding of the situation before our disagreement.  
  
My only thing that I just *can’t* wrap my head around is how she seemed excited and on-board when she had a job opportunity and I didn’t, but when I have a job opportunity and she doesn’t…. she wants nothing to do with it? Especially if the only way for her to become a nurse in Disney World is to move there first.

Things have generally been good w/my (32f) husband (33m) and I. the biggest issue we have rn is he views me as cold/unemotional, I view him as clingy/overly sensitive. It has been difficult to navigate at times, even w/us keeping the other in mind

  
For example, last night I made dinner, we talk about our day and he shares a fun fact as usual. We are all having fun, teasing each other, laughing. He started telling us about his fact and after a while of going into great detail about some sort of tech box, the kids and I asked silly questions. He got upset and said he will just stop talking since no one cares, finished what he was saying and left to take the dog out. Finished dinner, I put the kids to bed. He was upset but has been working on breathing to calm down before talking so he doesn't explode on me so I let him be while I cleaned up

  
Once everything was done I kept in mind he has said during previously that he wants to be checked in on/hugged when upset. We crossed paths in/out of the bathroom I asked if he was okay and tried to hug him, he said yes and stepped aside even though he obviously was not. I let it go and he got in bed angrily. I asked again a few mins later when he looked at me, he said I'm fine. I tried one more time to check in w/him and give him a hug, he shrugged it off and said drop it. So I did and read while he gamed

  
This morning while I'm wfh he wanted to talk. He feels I don't care about him/his feelings and when I said I tried to think about what he wanted from me and reached out to try to talk multiple times last night and he didn't want to so I let him be, he got upset and said I was turning it around on him/making him to be the bad guy. I was hurt he called me cold/unfeeling again despite me trying but pushed that away and asked what I could have done differently to make him not feel that way. He said he wanted me to keep pushing, I asked can you give me a number of times or something like that because I am worried about him getting pissed off at me for trying to force him to talk to me when he isn't ready to or doesn't want to as that has been known to happen in the past. He said infinity times, forever until I talk to you and left the room

  
I don't feel I should have to chase a grown man begging him to talk to me about why he's upset and coddling him. I am completely fine with and want to be there to support him and talk things through but feel he is being immature and expecting way too much from me. I work FT at a stressful job, do the majority of the chores/errands, run the house, I don't have the time or energy to chase him around the house asking to talk about something that bothered him when he says he doesn't want to. I feel that what I did was more than enough and that I kept him and his wants/needs in my thoughts in how I acted when he got hurt. He feels I didn't do anything, don't care and am cold.

"AITA for selling a wedding gift that I won't use? Throwaway account for privacy.

My (35F) husband, Zayden, (36M) and I got married five years ago and are still debating about a wedding gift we received.  When we got married, a mutual friend of ours (Adria) gifted us an expensive telescope based on an offhand comment I apparently made about enjoying astronomy (I don't remember making this comment).  This gift wasn't on the registry and is not something we're interested in using.  We don't have much space in our current backyard to set it up, and we're not interested in hauling it along when we move to a bigger house.  

We've been storing the telescope in our basement, where it's taking up a lot of space.  I suggested to Zayden that we sell the telescope online and use the cash towards a down payment on a house, but Zayden is worried that Adria will see the advertisement for the telescope and be offended that we're selling her gift.  So, when a good friend of mine told me how much she loved astronomy, I offered to sell her the telescope and she happily agreed.  

After the transaction, I told Zayden about it and he got really upset, saying we should have just kept the telescope.  My response was that since it was a private sale and not advertised online where Adria could see, then there wasn't a problem.  My husband said that Adria had been randomly asking him about whether we're using the telescope, and he told her I sold it because I didn't like it.  

Now Adria is upset that I sold her ""thoughtful gift"", and Zayden is calling me an AH for upsetting Adria when we could've just kept storing the telescope in our basement.  I don't think I did anything wrong, especially since Zayden told me he didn't want the telescope, either.  AITA?",0.11
"AITA for taking something from my friends house without telling him, after he gave me it when I asked Context: when we first met, he had a habit of always taking stuff from my house for his own consumption (e.g., weed, food etc.). I didn’t mind, because sharing is caring. 

Until recently, since he has a key to my house (for emergencies), he comes into my house unannounced when I’m not home.  He’ll come in, eats my food, takes my weed, use my stuff and sends me pictures of his doing this. I did address this with him, and asked him to tell me next time he does it. I was expecting a quick text, saying “hey I’m stopping over to let your dog out, might take some weed”. No he’ll snap me pictures of him in the act, either eating my food or just hanging out in my house (without telling me).

It wasn’t bothering me until he called me out for taking his stuff from his house without telling him. When he does it all the time. I just apologized and decided to move on. But I don’t think it’s fair that he’s requesting for me to tell him in advance, when he doesn’t follow the same rules and I’ve already addressed how I feel about it.",0.3
"AITA for telling my wife to not go back to school? I 24F am married to Mia 26F. We have been together since university. Mia took pharmacy and I was doing dentistry. Dentistry is a 5 year course after high school and then foundation training before qualifying in my country. Mia graduated after 4 years and started working before I did. 

Mia left her email open on our laptop and I saw she applied for her medical admissions test without telling me. I asked her about it, and she said she’s realised now after working she isn’t interested in pharmacy anymore and wants to go back to school and study medicine. 

I am working as a trainee dentist. My salary alone can’t support the 2 of us if Mia goes back to uni, especially as pharmacy pays well and she has been the breadwinner for the last 2 ish years.

We have been talking about adoption for months now, and Mia going back to school would push that goal back as it wouldn’t be fair to adopt and not be give the child attention.

Mia says it’s unfair she supported me through my degree and I’m being a hypocrite by not letting her do the degree she wants to, but I feel upset she went behind my back to apply for the medical admissions test and she didn’t tell me.

ETA- I am not against Mia going back to school, it’s just not financially possible for us right now. We both have student loans and rent and my salary alone will not cover that. I am asking her to put it off a year at least as I don’t see any possible way otherwise right now.",0.81
"AITA for telling my in laws to act like adults for their future grandkid and niece? 

AITA for deciding to have a sit down in my in laws (MIL, 50) (FIL 50) (Step MIL,41) and (SIL, 14) and telling them to not talk shit about each other to their future grandchild and niece. I (F 23) am currently pregnant with my first child. My husband's (M28) side of the family is a bit messy and complicated. To make a long story short; my FIL had an affair with his coworker and left my MIL, SIL and husband about seven years ago.  It was an extremely messy divorce with my MIL fighting tooth and nail to have full custody and keep her daughter.  During this time lots of comments were made that have been called slanderous,gossip or back stabbing.  In my four years of being married I have heard all of the story and there is good and bad on both sides. However that doesn't seem to be how my in laws view it. They are all so focused on their anger,hurt and trying to make themselves in the right of it all. I understand that I can't fix any of this nor is it my job. However whenever I'm with my FIL and step MIL it becomes a whole gossip session about the divorce, how my MIL is raising my SIL and all the other things she is doing ""wrong"". Whenever I'm with my MIL it's all about how my step MIL is a vicous bitch and a monster and how my FIL is neglectful and abusive. My MIL says this all in front of my SIL so she just parrots what she hears because she wants to validate her mom.

I spoke to my husband about the fact that I never want our own child to feel like she needs to be a protecter because of what my FIL did or MIL did during their divorce. I 
 want to try to ensure that my daughter gets to enjoy having grandparents and never feels like she needs to defend either one from the other as that isn't a child's job. Ever. My husband and I decided that we are going to sit down with them all in one room and set a firm boundry that you can't talk negatively about each other at all to our daughter. Including my SIL talking negatively about her dad in front of our daughter.  you break that rule, consider that relationship gone with our child. We won't allow toxic shitty behavior into our daughters life just because you are related by blood. I know this might seem harsh but AITA?",0.5
"AITA for accusing my in-laws of stealing $200 from me? My, 26f, in-laws(late 50s) and brother in-law(30) all live with me, my 2.5yo son and my partner(32m). This arrangement has worked for us for a few years now&I get along really well with my in-laws. 
backstory: my in-laws own their own company. Recently a piece of equipment vital to their job broke&they haven’t worked besides few small jobs. The part costs over $700 not including labor. My BIL is a recovering addict&as of recently has been doing well.
I’m a bartender, so I always have a lot of cash on me. Bc of my BIL,we still take precautions with our stuff(keys, wallet,etc.)& leaving them around. (He’s stolen a lot from us before) My partner, me&my son have the whole upstairs.At the bottom of the foyer is a door that locks from our side. We make sure to take our stuff upstairs&lock the bottom door at night so my BIL can’t access it.The other side of the foyer, is another door that locks from the other side into my in-laws suite. They usually keep it locked. 
I had $404 in my wallet before I went to bed Sunday night. 
Yesterday, I sat down to budget my $ &recount it, I only had about $185. I was so confused,went upstairs&tore everything apartNo where to be found. I knew it wasn’t missing, it goes from an envelope into my wallet into my purse. I haven’t touched it since I counted it last night. 
When I came downstairs b4 I realized $ was missing, I put my purse on the kitchen table while I made a list,etc. BIL was in the kitchen, in-laws were in kitchen&living room, it’s open concept,but I didn’t keep eyes on my purse the whole time since I was right there. 
When I realized the money was missing, I automatically thought it was my BIL.
Last night my partner suggested maybe it wasn’t his brother&could’ve been his dad since MIL told him his dad has been stressing&not eating because of the broken equipment.She then asked him to skip paying rent(him and I take care of all the rent)to help them get the part. My partner obviously said no. So theycould’ve snuck in thru their foyer door Sunday night while I was sleeping&I didn’t notice until morning.
This morning I confronted all three of them together &said it’s obviously one of you that stole $200 from me&now I don’t trust any of you&just wanted to thank you for not being able to pay bills, not beingable to send my step dad any $towards my moms funeral expenses that we’ve been chipping away at for 5 months now,etc.I told them it wasn’t even all about the money, it’s about respect, trust,&me feeling comfortable in my own home. 
No one owned up to it&a few how dare you accuse me’s were thrown around. My BIL insists he didn’t take it&said if he did he would’ve taken all the money&paid his phone that’s still off. He also has been sober all last night&today. I can tell when he uses very clearly. 
Idk what to do,I’m really hurt&feel betrayed.There’s a lot of tension in my house right now&I’m starting to thinking maybe I was a little too harsh, AITA?",0.12
"AITA for having resentment and feeling done dirty? Throwaway… I am in a relationship. I have loved this person for 3 years. I have given it my all. I have loaned my partner upwards of thousands of dollars which they have dragged their feet to pay me back on. It’s been years. Instead of them prioritizing paying me back ( as they make more than I ) they have used whatever extra money they receive/have to spend on expensive luxuries (vacations), birthdays,  and gifts for themselves. They have a nonworking car that they haven’t bothered to repair for the last few years and have been taking my car with rarely contributing to gas and no contribution to when the car goes into the shop. They think it is not a priority to pay me back nor to get their car fixed. Furthermore they no longer are intimate with me, rarely ever contribute to the upkeep/ cleaning of the house and don’t plan dates or quality time with me anymore. They continue to play video games exclusively during majority of their free time and then blame me for their weight gain and for not seeing their family/friends. Even though I have never once stood in the way of that. Recently they told me they needed time away for serious life reflection and clarity. And so they were gone for some time. Then I come to find out they were on a vacation with their best friends. But this does not come off to me as a self reflection/ clarity time but rather escaping the situation. And I feel lied to under the pretense for them needing to find themselves when it was just them going to party with their friends. I’ve had time to process this and the more I think about it the more angry I am as it’s another vacation they have took when I’m owed money and when I was led to believe they were working on themselves and figuring out what they want.

"AITA for yelling at my roommate for waking me up early? Am I the asshole for yelling at my (30F) roommate (33F) for waking me up after doing an overtime graveyard shift? (From 11pm to 8am)

I have clinical insomnia. I was extremely tired this morning after working overtime, grocery shopping for the household, and getting coffee to bring home to my roommate. Once I got home, I waited 3 hours for my roommate to wake up and drive her to work like always. After getting home and struggling to sleep, I slept for 4 hours by the time I had to wake up and get my roommate from work. 

Once we got home I had time for a 3-hour nap before my next shift and I desperately needed to sleep some more or else it was going to be hell. 

Our living room is my personal space when I sleep (we live in a small one bedroom apartment not much bigger than a studio.) I laid on the couch and spent 45 minutes trying to doze off. I slept for 30 minutes before my roommate woke me up telling me to move my nap to the bedroom because she had 2 friends coming over to drink. By this time it was almost 9 and I would be waking up at 10 to start getting ready for my shift. 

I immediately felt enraged that she thought it’s okay to wake me up and invite people over knowing I was sleeping an hour before I usually wake up. She knows I have awful insomnia and need total quiet, I can’t sleep if people are socializing in our small apartment.

I was now wide awake from how annoyed I felt that I completely blew up on her. I started shouting about how it’s complete bullshit that I do all these chores and favors for her and our apartment, sacrificing my sleep schedule, but when I desperately need to nap, she invites people over while I’m asleep instead of waiting for me to wake up and go to work.

I yelled that she is being extremely inconsiderate to me, especially since I help her out so much when it comes to her sleep schedule. Without me, she’d get less than a full night’s rest because she’d be waking up early to take the bus. I completely dominated the fight. I must have yelled around the house for 15 minutes. 

I feel horrible for my behavior. It was a mixture of being cranky and feeling disrespected. I can’t stop thinking about how loud and upset I sounded over a nap. But I hate when I go the extra mile for people and they can’t even do the bare minimum for me. It’s one of the few things that can send me into a rage because people always take advantage of my good heart. 

Should I feel sorry that I let my emotions get the best of me? I feel so childish and embarrassed. I do so much for her sleep schedule, meanwhile I practically survive off of naps. I’m ashamed of myself but I’m letting the people of Reddit decide for me. Am I the asshole?",0.32
"AITA for asking my fiance to buy her own clothes? We've been together 10 years and are getting married this year. She's made it more and more of a habit to ""borrow"" my clothes recently and has been wearing them in public more and more, like on errands and dates. I finally sat her down and asked her to buy her own clothes that fit her body this year because as a married couple in our thirties we should stop going out of going out in public like a college girl wearing her boyfriend's gym clothes.  I want her to look good and I want my sweaters coats shirts and pants back. AITA?",0.9
"AITA for trying to throw away my family's belongings? I (M22) have been living with my mom for a couple months since I graduated college. Over the past few months, I've come to realize just how much our family home stresses my mom out. I wouldn't say my mom is a hoarder, I just think she has been placed in the unfortunate position of holding on to a lot of our family's junk and she has difficulty throwing things away.

It's been hard to watch my mom grapple with the shear amount of stuff that has accumulated in our home. I have three sisters (F30, F27, and F20) and they all keep a lot of their old stuff at our mom's house despite all of them having ""moved out"" (my younger sister has her own apartment that she stays in near her university). My mom even holds onto some of my grandparents things since she lives in their old home.

Long story short, there's a lot of crap in our house.

I've talked with my mom multiple times about the state of our home and she confirmed most of my observations about her being stressed out from all of the stuff in our home. I tried to do what I could and make a dent in all the clutter, but there was only so much I could do on my own.

So I pitched the idea of renting a dumpster for my mom as a Christmas gift. Which me and my sisters would then fill together over New Years weekend. At the very least, we could try clearing out our basement and storage room which were the worst rooms in the house. My mom LOVED this idea and I went ahead renting the dumpster.

Finally, the dumpster came and my sisters and I emptied out everything from the basement and storage room into the yard. However, over the course of the day I could sense a lot of tension rising between me and my sisters. When it came time to start throwing stuff into the dumpster, my siblings kept preventing anything from being thrown out or donated. Even if we were sorting through outgrown clothes or broken toys, they insisted that we couldn't ""just throw it away."" I tried to level with them and tell them how I felt, but they were not having it.

They exploded at me. They accused me of being heartless and not cherishing the memories of the things we have. They wouldn't let me defend myself and eventually my mom took their side. I was forced out of the ""what does and does not get thrown out"" process and had to help carry everything that wasn't thrown out back into the house.

They didn't even fill half the dumpster and our family home was put back in the awful state it was before.

The next day I tried to fill the dumpster more by throwing out whatever was in my room that I didn't use anymore and suggested my sisters try the same. They didn't care for that either.

Since then, my sisters have all left and it's back to just me and my mom in this cluttered and stressful house. My relationship with my sisters has been seriously strained since that weekend and I don't know why they can't understand what I tried to do for our mom. Did I fuck something up? Am I a huge asshole about all of this and I just don't see it yet?",0.3
"AITA for not wanting to spend several thousand dollars to fix my neighbor's flooding issue? Our houses sit on a hill right next to each other, where our backyards are the high point and the land slopes down to our front yards. My house also sits much higher than his, even though they are only about 25 feet apart. The water from my roof goes directly to his property. His house also sits in a bit of a bowl. His land rises toward the front of his house before dropping off again, effectively trapping all the rain water right around his house.

Last year his basement flooded completely. In an effort to help, I had new gutters installed on my house. The leader goes into what I thought was an existing dry well. Apparently, it is only a small catch basin that does not hold much water. In major storms the catch basin overflows and we are back to the water going directly to his house. Now his basement flooded again. He wants me to rectify the problem. He does not have French drains in his basement and said he does not want to break up his floor to install them. His property really needs to be regraded, but it would be incredibly difficult and expensive. It would be difficult to get machinery there and he would likely have to destroy his driveway.

I could have a new dry well installed in my backyard to handle the overflow from bad storms, but doing it correctly would be a real financial hardship. It just seems a bit unfair. Why should I have to bear all this cost when he is unwilling to do anything to improve his own situation. Even if I install the dry well, there is no guarantee that it will solve the problem.

AITA if I tell him I'm not willing to spend any more money to fix his flooding issue?",0.23
"AITA For Cooking Food my Husband Dislikes for Guests I (39 NB) am from Appalachia and occasionally like to cook food from my culture to get a taste of home. I don't do it very often because my husband (41M) dislikes most Appalachian food. 

We are having guests over for dinner tonight and one of them is from Appalachia so I decided to make a dish that I know he loves and misses, fried salmon patties, collard greens, and mashed potatoes. The greens have been simmering on the stove all day. My husband initially came down and said ""that smells good"" then he started complaining that there was nothing for him to eat for dinner because he didn't like salmon patties or collard greens. 

I knew he hated greens but I didn't realize he also hates salmon patties. He's eaten them a few times in the past without complaint. He says he has always hated salmon patties. 

It hurt my feelings that he's acting like this. He eventually said he will have a pb&j. So now I feel like I have to embarrass myself in front of our guests to explain why he isn't eating what is being served. And now I'm worried it's too much of an acquired taste and my non-Appalachian guest who is new to me (and is a chef) will hate it too. 

I can't go to the store and get an alternate food because there's a ton of snow on the ground and I'm not comfortable driving in it.

"AITA for making a your mom joke? For context, I'm a 28 year old man who is a recovering agoraphobic. Most of my social interactions are either online or short visits on good mental health days. One of the social interactions I get is with our neighbors son who I'll call Kenny. Kenny is 13 and tends to talk to me when I'm getting the mail, in the backyard or just generally doing any yard work. He likes to shoot the shit about new video games or movies or whatever and it helps me get out of my shell a bit. Well the other day while I was in the backyard, he came to the fence and was rather serious. This took me off guard because he's usually really energetic and goofs around. He was telling me about how this kid at his school was ""being a dick"" to him. Making fun of him, pushing him, etc. I asked him if he told his parents and he said yes, they brought it up but his principal pretty much chalked it up to ""horse play"" and didn't do anything. Me, hearing that he handled it the way he should have first and just wanting to make the kid laugh and maybe feel a bit better, I told him ""The next time he says something mean just hit him with a good old ""your mom"" and walk away."" Childish, I know, but that's a 13 year olds sense of humor and I wanted to try to de-escalate the situation and make him laugh. Which it did! He thanked me for the talk and went back inside. Well the other day both Kenny's parents call me and say they want to tell me something. We ended up just talking outside and they filled me in on the day. Apparently Kenny's bully was acting up again, and Kenny said ""Your mom"" to the kid. The kid got really quiet and beat red and went to the principal. Turns out the bullies mother had passed away some years ago and it struck a nerve with him. Neither of the children were in any actual trouble but my name came up in conversation with Kenny's parents. They were outright giggling like school girls at my embarrassment and told me not to even worry about it. Even going as far to say they're happy my son has a ""friend"" to talk to about stuff, but I feel awful for planting that in Kenny's head.

"AITA for being upset that they canceled the trip 3 days before? I (27F) have a birthday trip planned to Las Vegas in 4 days. My sister, my partner, my cousin and her husband are all coming. This trip has been planned for 3+ months, already booked, paid, non refundable (everyone paid for their portion). So a day ago my cousin (24F) and her husband (26M) get into a fight because she has been texting a friend (M) from school a lot. The husband read the messages and feels like she is pushing boundaries. I will say she has mentioned this friend before and her husband knows they’re friends, also this friend lives in another state. I read the messages and nothing romantic is being said but it is obvious they are very close and fond of each other. The husband feels like my cousin is always pushing boundaries and is fed up. They both confided in me and I suggested they go to marriage counseling. They both apologized that this happened right before the trip and I was understanding and told them you can’t really plan for these things. 

Fast forward to today (the day after the fight) and I talk to my cousin and she tells me they are not going on the trip and have scheduled their first counseling session for 2 hours before our flight takes off. 

I expressed to both of them that I respect what is going on between them but that their presence will be missed and I hope they can make it. But my cousin told me that her husband does not want to go and she is so upset herself and would feel bad still going on the trip. 

I haven’t expressed any frustration to them nor do I think it would be productive but I can’t help but be really hurt that they couldn’t put their feelings aside and come out and celebrate with me for a couple of days. AITA for being upset with them for canceling this trip?

AITA for seeing if she gets a refund? My dog had a emergency and it was a few grand. I was a grand shy and my childhood friend of 20+ years let me borrow it on her care credit card. I couldn’t find on my invoice what it was spent on. I sent her a photo of the invoice showing it wasn’t on there. I told her I called the vet right after I got off the phone with them and asked what the money went to and she couldn’t tell me at the time. She said she’d call back when she has a moment to look into it and figured it out. My first message was asking if she got charged to make sure she did since I didn’t see it on there which she showed me she was. So I explained what happened and said it’s odd there’s no itemized invoice that said what it went to so maybe she’ll get a rerun of it didn’t end up going to anything. She kept trying to say I was trying to have her prove to her she paid which I only asked the one time when I initially messaged her and could clearly see she was charged so I kept telling her I could see she’s charged that’s not the issue. The issue is I don’t have anything saying where that money went so that’s what I was trying to find out and if it didn’t go to anything she’d get a refund. Not even 5 minutes into messaging her she calls my vet to yell at them. She then accused me of trying to not pay her back and swindle her out of her money which she made clear to the vets that what she felt was happening. My vet stated they’ll no longer accept payment from anyone else. She didn’t even wait for me to get a call back to figure out what was going on. I have every intention of paying her back so I have no idea where this came from and in over 20+ years of friendship I’ve helped her financially multiple times and this was the first time I ever asked her for help with anything. At this point I’m crying because I’m being accused of being a terrible person that’s trying to con my best friend. She said it’s my fault because I’m too dumb to understand my bill that she had to call and figure it out for me so I’m the ass hole and not her. At this point I became an ass hole and messaged her husband the situation since I know she doesn’t like when I explain a situation to him because then he knows both sides instead of hers. She told him that I was trying to make her prove she paid which I didn’t and have the receipts. I even repeatedly said that’s not what I’m trying to figure out I’m trying to figure out what it went to because if it went to nothing then you get a refund. I’m literally just telling you that the money you paid isn’t on my invoice and that’s what I’m trying to figure out is WHERE it went. I can’t obviously see it was charged that’s not the issue at all. I don’t even understand how this shit show happened… but am I the ass hole? Now I want to pay her back ASAP and change vets because it’s super awkward now.,0.88
"AITA for eating fries at the bottom of the bag? I remember this from a bit ago, and it's silly, but I figured I would share.

I'm a 27m, and I often go out and get food for family and friends. Sometimes, I get compensated for it, but most times, I don't. That being said, whenever I get food from a place that sells fries like burger places, I'll usually grab the few fries that fall to the bottom of the food bag. My family and girlfriend don't really care as they all end up getting an even amount of fries anyway.

Anyway, a while ago, I was going to a friend's place to play games when he called me to grab some food from McDonald's. I obliged and grabbed the order, which included fries for both of us. When I got to his place, he needed to use the restroom. I did the polite thing and took the food from the bag, and placed them on plates. I saw those crispy, greasy fries at the bottom of the bag and decided to grab them to eat mindlessly. 

My friend comes out seeing me eat fries from the bag and asks me what the hell was I doing. I told him that I was just eating from the bottom of the bag, which made him mad. I pointed out that his food was already plated, but he said that wasn't the issue. He refused to elaborate and didn't even pay me. I decided to leave after eating, but he called me up to tell me that I was being gluttonous. I pointed out that it was like 5 fries that could've come from my box. He just hung up on me after grunting.

I may as well ask just because I found it more funny than frustrating, but still... am I the asshole?",0.05
"AITA for wanting my ex to spend time with me during a miscarriage?  

I broke up with my ex a year ago, but we’ve continued to see each other, more recently we’ve been sleeping together.

On New Year’s Day, I found out I was pregnant. 10 days ago, I began to bleed. 

When I saw him next, I decided to tell him. He was sympathetic towards me and held me and let me sob and explain everything.

The next time we met, he started talking about his weekend, and then he asked about mine. He noticed I was feeling off and asked me ‘are you alright?’. I said ‘well, I don’t know, I guess I’m just still finding the miscarriage thing quite hard’. 

When I said that, it was like he became annoyed. He said he doesn’t understand how I can go to the beach and hang out with friends, tell him through text earlier that day that I’m ‘feeling pretty good’, but then when we meet up be edgy and on the verge of tears. 

His reaction made me start crying. He went on to explain that it takes a toll on him as well when I’m emotional, and he’d like to be able to know what to expect when we’re hanging out, so that he knows not to assume it’s going to be a nice chill hangout. 

He told me that this was what led to us breaking up. I had a lot of medical issues while we were together, and he felt like I never acknowledged the emotional toll on him for my breakdowns and need for emotional support. 

My miscarriage reminded him of my tendency to just expect sympathy instead of being considerate to how it makes him feel. Plus, he’s the one I vent to and cry to - while everyone else in my life gets to see the bright and happy side of me. 

I think that if he were softer and more gentle with me, and didn’t make me feel so bad about my emotions, I wouldn’t end up in tears so often. I am easily soothed by a hug and some nice words, but he finds it impossible to give me that if I’m ’making him feel obliged’. 

That night after I went home, I ended up in hospital with severe pain. I was diagnosed with a miscarriage. I told my ex. 

He checked in on me all day and told me he would visit me. He picked me up from hospital and took me home. He told me that we could hang out once he finished work in the evening.

Evening came and he told me he’d had such a long day he wasn’t going to be able to come over. I said of course that’s fine, no worries. 

Two days have passed, and we’ve been texting and checking in with each other. I was curious whether he was going to make time to see me. I texted him ‘are you avoiding me?’, and then he went off at me.

He’s had such a long and draining week, is he not allowed to have alone time? I can’t just expect him to be there for my every need, and make him feel like a bad person if he isn’t. I clearly don’t care about how he’s feeling, etc. 

I apologised for saying that and explained I have just been having a hard time and would like to know when we could see each other.

He hasn’t responded to me and I feel like shit.

"AITA For Telling My Friend She Can't Eat? I, 22 Female and my (ex) friend 23 Female used to like going out a lot. We would frequently eat in the city and since my family is more upper class and hers are more middle class, I end up paying from 75%-100% of the meals we eat. 

At first I didn't mind paying, but ever since I started to object, she would make snarky comments like ""What daddy didn't pay your trust fund?"" or "" What's the point of having so much money if you're not gonna spend it on your friends?"" or ""You're so stingy, You know I don't have as much money as you do.""

Yet every time we went out she would pick the more expensive and fancy restaurants, and as soon as it's time to pay, she would be like, ""oh you'll cover the bill, right?"" or "" Sorry I didn't bring my wallet."" 

It's just excuse after excuse with her and I'd just get so annoyed that last time we went out to eat, I asked her if she would pay her half, she told me, ""No, I don't have enough money"" so I said well then you're not eating. At first she laughed and we she saw my face, she looked at me like, 'you're joking, right?'

at that point I got so fed up I told her ""If you're not willing to pay your half of the meal then I'm not buying you food, you're a full grown woman with a bank account, use it."" And after she heard that, she got angry and we kept arguing so loudly that we got kicked out of the restaurant. 

And to top it all off she had the audacity to demand me to call her an uber because it was my fault that we got kicked out of the restaurant. Of course I didn't and left her there. But ever since that night, my friends have been blowing up my phone calling me an asshole for leaving her there at 11pm at night.

I was so excited because it was my sister's big day and she meant the world to me. But when I got to the wedding venue, I found out that she hadnt invited me to be a bridesmaid Instead she chose her friends, our cousin, and two of our siblings. At the least, I wasn’t even the flower girl. Her friend’s daughter (8F)  was the flower girl instead And my sis barely knows her

I was hurt and confused. I had always looked up to my sister and I couldnt understand why she would leave me out of such a special day. I felt like she didnt care about me or our relationship. I debated whether or not to leave the wedding with my dad, but in the end i decided to stay and support her from the audience

durijg the ceremony, I couldnt help but feel jealous of the bridesmaids. They looked so beautiful and happy and I felt like I was missing out on a once in a lifetime opportunity. but I knew that my sisters happiness was more important than my own so I stayed and watched her get married

After the ceremony, I sat down with my sister and told her how I felt.

"AITA for not serving a customer that threatened to pee on the floor? So first off, first ever post. Sorry for formatting and any spelling mistakes. 

So I work at a dispensary, and due to someone literally shitting on our bathroom floor a few months ago and a number of other disgusting incidents, we have made the bathroom employee only. It has an “out of order” sign on the door and a giant cardboard cutout blocking the door so most of the time customers don’t even know we have a bathroom.

 Today a man in his 60’s came in and immediately asked to use the bathroom. I usually feel bad about this so I just said “I’m sorry, it’s out of order.” And he immediately called my bluff and said that he knew it was working. At this point he was getting visibly frustrated, so my co-worker jumped in and said that the bathroom was not public. Then I kid you not, this man yelled, “I am 64 years old, I need to go now, I will piss on the floor if you don’t let me in!”  

So my co-worker was like, “ok, just this once.” At this point I was already getting uncomfortable since even though the guy was old he was tall and BIG. He comes back out and starts to walk to my register, so I immediately went into the back room and told my managers about the situation. 

Needless to say they were pissed at the guy and told me I could stay in the office until he left. It took this guy at least 15 mins to get all his stuff, but I was so relieved when he left. My manager let me know that this guy will not be allowed back to the store due to his aggressive behavior not only for the bathroom thing but also just the way he was talking to my co-worker when he was helping him.

Anyway the reason I’m posting here is because I mentioned this to a friend today and she said that we were the assholes for not allowing our bathroom to be used by customers. She said that we should expect people to get upset when there’s a perfectly good bathroom that they aren’t allowed to use, and the fact I didn’t help him when he went to my register makes me a bad employee(my managers would say otherwise) and a pussy for not being able to face this guy. 

But I think the rule is reasonable considering this guy left an absolute fucking mess of pee in the bathroom. You gotta remember we get all kinds of people here and we’re also concerned about people taking illegal drugs in the bathroom since there’s been bathroom overdoses in several dispensaries and smoke shops (not ours, thank God). And I feel that I have every right to refuse service to someone who was being this aggressive and rude. 

So tell me Reddit, am I the asshole for refusing service to an aggressive old man who threatened to piss himself in the lobby?",0.03
"AITA for turning on the TV ? Hello, I am (22M) I have anxiety problems and I usually watch the TV while using the phone to play a video game because silence makes me anxious and it's a little difficult to be calm without having something like a podcast Iñin the background. So I did it tonight and my brother (18M) got angry telling me that ""it was autism to have to use multiple stimuli at the same time."" I got upset and it ended with him leaving the room.  My mom ended up changing places to sleep so there wouldn't be fights, I feel like I wasn't asking for much, he wasn't trying to sleep or it affected him a lot if I had the TV on low on the background Because we all usually do it at home but apparently it affected him a lot if I did it.

For context, my brother has a history of always wanting to do what he wants and feels that he is never wrong. He thinks I am mom's favorite because I am the rainbow son, although that has never been the case.  I need opinions because I feel like I wasn't acting wrong but maybe I could give in and stop my mom from changing rooms.",0.78
"AITA for not letting my boyfriend go snowboarding because I can't go for medical reasons My (21F) boyfriend (28M) got invited to go snowboarding with a friend from work and I am upset he would go without me. For context I have been begging him to take me skiing for the past 2 years that we have been together but he would always make up excuses or say it was too expensive, or things would get in the way. All in all, never made the time to take me skiing even tho i have expressed multiple times that I really really love skiing and it's something I miss doing from my childhood. A few months ago I was diagnosed with a medical condition that would jeopardize my reproductive health if I do any extreme activities, running, or jumping. It is temporary as I am on a waitlist for a surgery. 

Since getting the news he has not been the most considerate of my condition. He once threw a hissy fit for not being able to go on water slides with me while we were on vacation. We had an argument and in the end he apologized and told me he recognized how insensitive he was being. 

Now my question is WIBTA if I got upset at him for going snowboarding without me? It just stings because its something I have expressed time and time again that I wanted to do together and now that I can't do it, it feels like he jumped at the first opportunity to go.  ",0.79
"AITA for Saying not Everyone can be Pretty? I was hanging out with some of my friends and one of us saw a reel describing why Aishwarya Rai (an Indian actress) is considered to be the most beautiful woman in the world. That reel described how we perceive beauty in symmetry and how her features on her face are spaced out like that. 


**When I mention “beauty” here, I exclusively mean surface-level, aesthetically pleasing features.**

This girl felt offended because I dared mention that there is a lot of objectivity in beauty, regardless of evolving beauty standards and how we all want to feel beautiful. To put it bluntly, not everyone can be pretty, because being pretty is just one of the many traits that make us who we are. There are some features that are always going to be more aesthetically pleasing than others. 

She accused me of gatekeeping beauty, when that’s not something I was trying to say. You can’t “gatekeep” something that isn’t already exclusive. And rather than delude ourselves into thinking we are just as pretty as VS models and Aishwarya Rai, we should strive towards acceptance and lean into other aspects that help us shine.

"AITA for telling my husband to “man up” 
So me and my husband went on a trip with my friend and his girlfriend.  He’s basically like family because we go way back.

Anyways it’s really cold where we’re staying and it’s a small town so it makes more sense to walk from place to place than driving because literally its all within a small space. 

We were in Banff town for those who are curious , look it up and you’ll see for yourself. 

Well today we walked a little far from the hotel so along the way we stopped in shops to get warm and then get back out, like sometimes in life you get uncomfortable and you deal with it. You can’t always expect to be warm.

Well my husband kept saying “that’s why I said we should drive, it’s so cold”

“This is unbareable” 

“ I hate this”

Literally no one else was complaining, my friend and his GF were playing around and having fun so I told my husband and I quote. Mind you we’re grown ups (24 years old, and my friends GF is 20, she’s younger and even she wasn’t complaining)

“Babe can you please man up a little”

I said this after I kept telling him that we’re almost there and he has to hold out a little bit.

I said this and he immediately went quite and when we got to our room he said that I embarrassed in front of everyone and I told him that they’re like my brother and sister and it’s family.

But he didn’t wanna hear it and he’s upset right now and I don’t get what I said wrong.
He says I was a jerk for saying that and he just went to bed.

"AITA for saying my next birthday might be 'disappointing' even though I'm spending it with my bf? Hello! So my bf (Colton) is a bit upset with me now because of something I said to him when we were on the phone the other day. I'll give some context. I'm a high school senior, and I got into my dream college, which I'm starting in the summer. My 18th birthday also happens to be the first week of classes. My parents are taking me to a concert a few days before but will not be there for my actual birthday. Now onto the story.

We were on the phone talking about my birthday and then the different ways our families do birthdays. My family likes to go all out, they will decorate the house while I'm asleep and set out presents and a cupcake for me to wake up to. It's always felt very special and is one of my favorite parts about my birthday. My bf's family is the opposite, from his description they don't do very much for birthdays other than a dinner and maybe a party. I was jokingly acting appalled and saying I'll have to give him the experience of a 'real birthday'. 

Later, the topic of my birthday was brought up again. I mentioned how I was a bit worried that my 18th would be 'disappointing', and Colton got upset. He told me it was pretty rude of me to say to his face that celebrating with him was 'disappointing.' I tried to backtrack and explain that I didn't mean it was disappointing because it was with him but because I wouldn't have my family there, but he really wasn't listening. He doesn't seem as upset about it today but I still feel bad. So. AITA?

TL;DR My bf and me were talking abt bdays, his family doesn't have as much importance for bdays as my family does. Later I mentioned my bday might be disappointing, in reference to it being without my family, bf misunderstood and got upset.",0.24

There has been this other girl, lets call her L, she has bullied me since i moved to the small town i now live in (it has been four years now.). 

She has never left me alone, she has always found something to bully and make fun of me about. shes accused me of the worse and got me suspended from school and also made fun of my friends. she was the regina gorge of the school, except nobody liked her. EVERYONE hated her and it was obvious, she was short, hideous, loud and obnoxious. she has this little clic of friends. when i was in 5th grade i had this best friend that i was glued to. her name was E. Then in 7th grade i got into a fight with E’s friend and thats when our friendship crumbled and L took the chance to swipe her up and make her hate me too. 

i was always the outcast because i liked things that others didnt like. she was terrible and ruined my mental health. anyways,

"AITA for being upset about my husband’s nominated beneficiary? So recently, I found out I am 50% of my husband’s insurance and superannuation beneficiary. And no, he’s not rich, we’re just a normal couple on average income (both of us work & on the same salary). We have a 2 year old cat, joint cars, and live in a rental + we go halves on all bills & such. We have been together for almost 4 years, engaged for 2. I would’ve been more understanding if his parents were the 50% but it’s his sister and I became extremely  upset. 

His sister is planning on moving to America, from their hometown. So the USD is extremely high in comparison to our currency (AUD) which is why I’d be more understanding if his parents were listed. Plus, his parents raised him, fed him, educated him so I’d still UNDERSTAND if his parents were even 100% listed! He stated, how she might need it, etc. And I told him that his parents or I, will need it more than her since her in-laws, boyfriend are residing in America and she’ll have a great income working as an engineer (she’ll be residing for study/work purposes + her boyfriend).  

It got me thinking, what if we have kids? Or our own house? His sister disliked me since day one. This is because my husband’s mother wanted him to marry someone within his religion, culture (especially due to language barrier + grandkids). When he stood his ground and defended me, the sister and the mother disliked me. It made me so sad because I didn’t do anything wrong but as soon as I found out the comparison she had / has with me, it made more a tad annoyed. I’d tan my skin, she’d show-off her “natural” skin to my husband and would call us “Westerns, brain-washed”. I’d get acrylics and she’s compare her “natural” nails, so on and so forth while my husband would have a laugh with her. Ps, I am middle-eastern, just born and raised in Aus, lol.

The reason why it’d made me so upset is because I’d do more than I should, outside and inside our home. He works from 8-5, I work from 9-4 so I’d be home earlier than he is. Within 5 working days, I’d have Wednesday day off and I’d manage to cook, clean, load up the laundry, fold and iron our clothes, clean the backyard + front yard, clean the car, take our cat to vets, etc. or just do all chores within anytime of the week while he works or does whatever at home. Anyhow, I do everything! So when he asked, “what’s the big fuss?” I responded, “from now on, tell your sister to do your work. I’ll only be doing mine from now on. You do your own household chores or call your sissy to do that for you”. He said, he’ll change it. But I don’t want him to since that’s how he feels about it. 

I am planning on telling him to change my beneficiary to his parent’s instead since they might need it more + to keep his sister as I won’t need his money. Will I be considered petty? 

I am on okay and civil terms with his family. I don’t really mind or care, I am over the past. However, do I have the rights to be upset about this matter? WIBTA if I continue to be upset?",0.88

She insissted on them getting cats, so they got three. One died of old age, and they got another.

The extra one they got is an orange and white cat that she just had to bring with her. This fucking cat is a big fucking mess maker. He gets into any trashcan he can, and strews rubbish all over the kitchen, not to mention walking around the house yowling all day.

We have had two cats we adopted from the shelter almost seven years ago, and this is just really fucking up their program. They don't want to share any room with this new intruder, and it is making the mood in the house shitty because I am always following this cat around cleaning up after it.

Not to mention the fact that when it eats, it throws food from the bowl all over. Our two cats are really out of sync, and I think her cat would just be better with the other two cats he has known for two years.

Dell without talking to me just gave the role color to AJ and when I saw this I got absolutely heated. I tried to say to Dell ""Hey I've had the yellow role for like ever could I have it back?"". I had grown an attachment to having that role color. But Dell said ""No you have to let AJ have the yellow role, they wanted it"".

"AITA for utilizing medicinal marijuana? AITA for utilizing medicinal marijuana?  
I (25f) have used prescribed marijuana since I was 17 to combat insomnia, my eating disorder, and to alleviate chronic pain, as well as combat some of my anxiety and PTSD. Between the ages of 20 and 21 I overindulged a bit as I was escaping an extremely abusive, toxic, narcissistic relationship. Since early 2022 I have only used it after work, in combination with melatonin to combat the Insomnia that plagued me in highschool, in place of prescribed Xanax,

  
My girlfriend of 3 years hates it. We moved in together a year ago. She was aware I smoked, but we did not really have any discussion about how she feels, nor did she offer up that info. She admitted to me she assumed I quit when I moved in and up until 8 months ago she worked third shift and had no idea I was hitting my pen before bed. I did not hide this info from her, we never went to bed together, and it never came up. We had our first discussion regarding this top 8 months ago, and when asked what her reasoning is she has no response beyond “This is how I was raised” ; “I don’t like the idea of smoking” ; “I just don’t like it”.   
It has been the biggest and only stressor in our relationship. I tried to stop, I did for 6 months but my sleepless nights went from almost never to me not being able to sleep without Xanax or Clonidine combined with melatonin or zzzquil, but even then I am only able to sleep a few hours at a time without waking from night terrors if I sleep at all. More recently I have brought up smoking again with her, and she tells me she cannot get over how she feels and how she was raised, and she just doesn't like the thought of me doing it. I asked her if she would leave me over weed and she said no, but she would be deeply unhappy if this is something I had to do on the regular.

"AITA for temporarily wanting to move to my dad and away from my mom (divorce)? I came back from university to move in with my mom until I get my life sorted and have a job and an income to get an appropriate living space for myself.

I am 23.

My parents are divorced since a couple of years but we've lived apart for way longer (about 2015/16). When we moved out I went with my mom, I don't think I actively made a decision here. Then I barely saw my dad for years because my mom was never good with that and I didn't want to upset her. Also during that time I majorly struggled with my mental health, I had an exercise addiction and disordered eating (I am better now, when I was old enough I got myself professional help and I consider myself generally happy now and feel like I deserve to live). 
My mom wanted and wants me to have solidarity with her.

Then I grew older and wanted to reconnect with my dad as I - in comparison to her - never made any significant negative experiences with my dad.
My dad and I have a good relationship now, usually I try to visit him discretely because my mom still doesn't like it/sometimes gets very upset.

Lately I felt like it would be better for my mom and I to live in seperate spaces (she has severe depression with some bipolarity and anorexia). Therefore I asked my dad if I could move in with him for a bit until I get my finances sorted (he also has a girlfriend since more than 2 years and I like her - since then my mother even got more allergic to me going to him).
I talked to my mom about it and she didn't say much to it - only that she also felt like someone needed to leave. Now I made it more concrete with my dad and he said if I want to it's fine with him.

Consequently my mom had quite a nervous breakdown and she said she was very disappointed in me for even considering it as an option (even though my idea was to give our relationship more space and therefore improve it - I communicated this) and that she would stop all contact and would never want to see me again.

Now, am I the asshole for wanting to move away from my mom to my dad?
I understand she might've had (very) negative experiences with my dad and felt very left alone in the relationship but I was a child and I think deciding against my dad from her perspective is not right as he has a different view on many things. My mom financially supported me a lot and I also love her a lot which is why I want to save our relationship but not at the cost of my life or my mental health.

"AITA for Shaving My Son's Head as Punishment for Bullying a Kid with Cancer? *Throwaway*

I (36M) recently was told by my oldest son (17M) that my youngest son (15M) had been bullying a kid with cancer at school. 
My oldest son was concerned about what his brother have been doing. What added to the surprise was that the school had never contacted me, and my son had never exhibited such behavior before.

I confronted my youngest son and he initially denied it but later admitted to the bullying. Trying to stay calm, I shared my own experiences of being bullied in school, and explained the impact it can have on a person not only physically but mentally as well. I insisted that he needed to apologize to the kid when he goes back to school. My son flat up refused and told me that he wasn't going to do it.

I asked my son if theres a reason he's bullying this boy, but he just said it was because it was funny. My oldest son jokingly suggested shaving my youngest son's head as a consequence. I actually agreed as I thought it was a good punishment. I gave my son two options either I will come up to the school and make him apologize to the child or I would shave his head.

My son chose the second choice and so I gave my son buzz cut. While doing so, his  brother started laughing and my son became upset and started crying so I sent his brother out of the room. After the haircut, my son got mad at me because he told me he wished harm upon me and his brother. I told him not to say that and he got up and left. His brother went to check up on him and he told his brother he felt betrayed and screamed at his brother to leave his room and then told his brother that he hates him.

I defended my actions and his brothers saying that he had the choice to apologize, and this was the consequence he chose. I explained the problems of bullying, especially when targeting someone with cancer. Despite my efforts, my son now refuses to speak to me, claiming he doesn't want to see me again. His older brother now is upset because he feels responsible for what's happening. He said that he feels hurt that his brother said that he hates him and regrets telling me. I told my son that he did the right thing and that his brother would come around eventually. 
I went in my son's room and told him that I didn't mean to hurt him and that I loved him but actions have consequences.

I asked him how he would feel about therapy and I regret asking him this because he accused me of thinking he's mentally ill and kept asking me to leave him alone.

"AITA For Treating My ""Friend"" How She Treats Me I 17F have a friend who I've only known for about a year,we met through a mutual friend and she started hanging out with us and I liked her alot but she didn't really like me that much and was always aggressive and rude to me but always nice to everyone else which I didn't understand as I never did anything to her So I just left it alone and never brought it up.

Recently,I found out that since we met shes been telling our other friends how annoying I am and just talking bad about me in general.Ever since then I've started treating her the same way she treats me and apparently I'm rude and mean to her and everyone agrees with her including the friends that I've known years before her.

Now,She's started being a bit nicer to me but Im sure she's faking as one day she would be my best friend but the next she's insulting me and my appearance and everyone just laughs along and doesn't care to think about my feelings but if it was me doing it to her everyone would get mad at me and say that I'm rude and hateful to her and I seriously don't know what to think or do",0.05
"AITA for telling my husband that him boasting about losing weight telling me how amazing he looked hurt my feelings. Hey all. 

Feeling confused and would appreciate an outside opinion. Not sure if I should be apologising. 

For context I am 35F and my husband is 41M. He is an amazing person - I am very grateful for him - I just genuinely need some objective help with this one. 

Normally I am also a slim and fit woman, but I have been feeling increasingly unwell and poorly for the last 7-12 months. I was getting a lot of pain in my abdomen and bad fatigue. I used to hit the gym 3/4 times a week but I was struggling to manage even one. 

I went for further investigation and it turns out I have an ovarian cyst which needs surgical removal (I’m going for this in two weeks) and possible endometriosis. I’m trying my best to eat healthy but walking is painful and even sitting is painful. I’m on naproxen which helps, but I stupidly ran up some stairs the other day and I nearly passed out from the pain at the top from twisting. 

As I’ve been struggling with moving for a few months I’ve not been doing really any exercise and walking the dog has been difficult. I’m trying to do my day to day activities but my nagging pain is just always there. I’m not much bigger than I was but I’m maybe 8-10 pounds heavier.

My husband has been supportive and obviously understands I’m in pain and is relieved I’m getting treatment. He has continued to hit the gym almost every day and so is in amazing shape. I do compliment him daily and I know he looks amazing. 

But this morning as I was getting ready, he came in our room and started telling me how great he looked. How he had beaten the Christmas weight and felt amazing and god didn’t he look fantastic. 

I know I felt super insecure in that moment, so I said ‘you know I’m feeling really bad about myself at the moment and I’ve put on weight.’ And I think I said he hurt my feeling by almost rubbing it in my face a bit. 

He said he wasn’t doing that and why didn’t I want him to ‘celebrate his successes’. I said it wasn’t about that and I am happy for him and I do tell him he’s amazing and handsome and looks incredible but I’m just really not in a great place right now and I think maybe that should be considered by him. 

I now feel rotten and feel like I was putting him down. And I really am worried I’ve been the asshole here. But I want to be back to normal and not in pain and I just feel so much anxiety right now with my health. He doesn’t like to argue so we left everything fine, but I’m at work now and worrying.

Appreciate peoples honest takes. Was I the asshole?

Update: thank you guys for the great advice - I have called my husband today and apologised and communicated how insecure I’ve been feeling in myself. Thankfully he understood and I’m now heading home to make him dinner. Just can’t wait until I can get back to being myself again after my surgery! ",0.95
"AITA for refusing to name my daughter the name of my husband's dead grandmother and my bully's? When I was in high school, I was constantly bullied by Sophie. She made fun of my appearance, personality, hobbies and grades. She also spread rumours about me and often told me that she wished I'd die (and was pretty specific about this). In elementary school, there was a bitchy stuck up brat named Sophie who endlessly spoke about how she was rich. In general, I do not have a positive connotation of the name ""Sophie"" but wouldn't just dislike someone because they share that name.

My husband (27) and I (26) were discussing names for our child. We don't know if it is going to be male or female, but started making a list of 10 male and 10 female names that we would consider. One of the female names my husband was very insistent on was ""Sophie"", the name of his dead grandmother who basically raised him since his parents were always busy with work. 

At once, I told him that I would not even consider it because the bully who tormented me throughout all of high school was also named Sophie. He got angry since he really wanted to use the name of the person who meant so much to him, but I refused. He told me that we should at least put it in the possible names, but I said absolutely not since I did not even want to consider it.

He got really angry that I wasn't trying to take his opinion into account.

"AITA for not using my mil old cot? I'll jump right into it as I need this argument settled, I'm 39f with my bf 37m we are expecting our first baby together but its my 6th.
My mil offered us his old cot, BUT the cot is 37 years old, it had him and his 2 brothers in it, It then when to my bf uncle who had all his kids in it, AND then had his grandkids in it.
Now onto the argument,  I've always had a good relationship with my in-laws so I very politely said no thank you we've picked another cot. 
As I didn't want to make waves and upset anyone from declining her offer.i showed mil the cot i wanted but Mil didn't offer to buy a new one for us or offer to buy anything for the baby ( which is their first grandchild ) which I though was very strange as they are fairly well off.
Where as my family aren't well off and have always insisted on buying things for the babies.
I can easily buy everything myself I just thought it would of been a nice thing for them to offer.
My bf has slight autism so doesn't always understand stuff so he couldn't see why I didn't want to use the cot.
I explained that I didn't find it hygienic to use a 37 year old cot thats had about 15 babies use it when we can just easily buy a new one ( it's not an expensive  one) I also explained that it was a unnecessary risk to the baby given its age and that we don't know how its been stored so it could have mold or rot, And that I wasn't comfortable with it and to me it was just common sense not to use it.
He agreed that we wouldn't have it in our house.
Now THE BIG PROBLEM .
His mum said the other day how she was bringing the cot to HER house to use for when she baby sits.
Which hasn't been discussed with us at all! 
Now im my perspective where she is lacking in common sense I don't feel comfortable her babysitting my baby and told my bf so.
(I got pressured into having 2 people babysit my other kids when they was babies and both times ended very badly so now I don't trust anyone with my kids.)
My saying I don't want his mum babysitting started a massive argument as i won't be pressured into something I'm not comfortable with. But I got told I'm ""cruel"" for taking that away from his mum who has wanted grandkids for years.
I really don't want to be stuck with a mamas boy who doesn't put his foot down, because imo if its your parents you deal with them and I don't want a mil who doesn't listen and the whole thing is stressing me out and causing alot of arguments.

"AITA for asking my boyfriend to dedicate one day a week for us? I(23F) and my partner (27m) have been and lived together for 5 years. Our relationship has been pretty good for the most part and we have just moved to a different country together. I have always had a big group of friends but I have always chose to spend my free time with my partner as he his my best friend, my partner hasn't had a lot of friends but now were in a new country he has made a couple of friends that he enjoys hanging out with.   


We only have Mondays off, and I had asked if we could make Monday our day together which he agreed too. Come the following Monday of us agreeing Monday will be ""our day"" he had arranged to grab lunch with a friend (which was okay because we actually had another day off together that week which we had organized to do stuff, but it didn't sit right with me that he was okay with disregarding that Monday is our day. This is not the first time that it has happened either. We had planned to get lunch one day and he ""forgot about it"" and booked in to do a hike with this person instead)   


The more i thought about it the more it bothered me so I just wanted to check in and confirm if Mondays was still our day to spend together, which his reply was now ""Sometimes"" which set me off. He went on to further explain that Mondays is his friends only day off as well so some days he will be with me and sometimes he will be with her. It was interesting to me because they work together, drink once a week together but then also hes happy to spend a day with her? Where as me on the other hand I work mornings and he works nights so the only time I see him is when i leave the house in the morning and when i wake up the next day. I told him it doesn't really seem fair that his friend gets a night and a day with him and i get 1 day with him sometimes a week.  


He then went on to say things like ""oh what so I cant hang out with my friends"" ""You're jealous"" ""I see you 7 days a week"" ""Why am I not allowed to have friends"" ""You're so controlling"" ""It wouldn't be a problem if my friend was a guy"" and just went on to say I'm crazy la la la. ALSO I do not care that his friend is a lady,  she's 20 years older than him and is married and I trust both of them. I am happy that hes starting to make friends and go out more because he never did but he makes me feel like I'm holding him back from living a life.

TLDR: My boyfriend has made a new friend and is spending more time with her and I feel like this new found friendship has become more of a priority than me. What I am having trouble distinguishing is   
1) Is it too much of me to ask my bf to dedicate one day a week with me? Do I just need to chill tf out?  
2) Is what he proposed (seeing me at least 2 times in a month) fine and should I be more open minded and accepting of this proposal?

"AITA for doubting my future with my fiance due to finance? Please help! My partner (29M) and I (27F) are engaged since last year, we plan to elope (small ceremony) later this year and start building a family after that (trying for a baby, buying an apartment etc.  
  
We come from different family financial situations and I have recently been realizing that this might be an issue for me in the future. I come from a middle-class family (we lived comfortably, nothing fancy, my parents and grandparents own a few properties). He comes from a poor family (his parents only own one property (inherited from grandparents), which is old, not big and not renovated). He has told me that his parents have always been poor and never strived to buy their own home, it is not something that was even considered.   
  
My current savings are $65K, his are $27K. Our monthly combined net income (after tax) is $3K (we do not live in the USA, we live in a small East European country and here that’s a mid-income). We currently live in a rented flat and it is very important to me to get our own property, especially when thinking about having children. The issue is that it’s impossible to do without getting a mortgage and my fiancé is scared of that, because he worries what would happen if he loses his job. He earns slightly more than me and has been trying to get a raise during the last year, but unfortunately with no success. In the past few weeks we have discussed these topics more and more thoroughly, I have openly shared my thoughts and concerns. He says that he doesn’t understand where this urgency is coming from and that things will fall into place, he will get promoted etc, but I have doubts.  
  
In the beginning of our relationship I wanted to invest my money in a small property and discussed it with him as a partner (didn’t want financial help), but he said that he can’t support me and doesn’t think it’s a good idea.  
  
If we get a property together now, he does not have any form of “safety net” (his parents cannot help us). It’s unclear if my parents will assist further, as a big chunk of my savings are given from them and they would expect his side of the family to help us as well.   
  
He is a good, kind guy, has never done anything bad to me and is loyal and I fell in love with that. He often sleeps in till late, doesn’t spend much time trying to educate himself on housing/investing and that’s starting to worry me. He also doesn’t have a car and we are both using mine (I encouraged him to get his drivers license, he didn’t have one before). I was fine with all of this before, but honestly am starting to get cold feet, especially when approaching the elopement. I feel quite stupid and blind, and blame myself for not thinking about these things earlier in the relationship. I think I missed/overlooked the signs and the information that was given to me. I feel scared to end it and start all over. We have the same circle of friends, we have gotten close to each other’s families.

"AITA if i not let my ex to get custody of his kid? This might be long.

I (35 F) married my ex ben (37m) 13 years ago. We have two daughters 10f sara and 8 f jess. When i was pregnant with jess, my husband had an affair. This woman (ow) was very young (was in college or something, i dont remember much detail). Affair was short, but he got her pregnant. When she was around 4 months pregnant,  Ben refused to be with her. She gave birth to a girl amy (7f), and i didn't know about her until ow vanished totally and ow's friend (kory) , who was raising her, contacted ben. He told me everything and asked me if he could bring amy in our house. I was furious and took a break from him for a month. He kept contacting me and kept telling me the things i wanted to hear, and i wanted a whole family for my kids, so i came back. 

Amy was 2 at the time and was a happy child. She sometimes called me mom, and i got furious at her. Once, when i was giving cuddles to jess, amy wanted too but i snapped at her. Amy got so scared, and it made me realize that i still hate my husband but not this kid. I started the process of divorce when amy was 3. Ben has half custody of our kid but refused to see amy because he thinks she broke the marriage.

He met someone during the divorce process and got married when we divorced. After few months he was diagnosed with prostate cancer. He is fine now (i guess), but he can't have kids. Now he wanted to see amy, he offered me some money in exchange for him adopting her. When i refused, he got angry and told me that she isn't my daughter and how much i hated her. At least she is his only chance to have a kid of his own.

"AITA (31F) for wanting to ghost a date (34M) that asked me to pay for both our meals on a third date? **TL;DR** Date that lives an hour away came to my city after I went to his city two times. After choosing to go to a restaurant and ordering food and drinks he asks me to pay for both of us because his old job hasn't paid him so ""money is tight.""

**Background** He lives in another city about an hour away. He doesnt have a car but that car rental/sharing is very standardized here. I do have a car. He's Dutch , Im American. For the first date I drove to him and we got drinks (he paid). 

**Second Date** The second date he invited me over and he cooked dinner (a very cheap cut of beef and frozen broccoli). I brought two bottles of wine and treats for his cats. 

There was a long lag in between the second and third date (three weeks) but we chatted almost everyday.  I told him blatantly I thought I had commuted to him enough and wanted our third date to be in my city. Multiple times he would say ""oh I'll come up this weekend"" then would not give me notice until Friday afternoon of his plans, by which time I had already filled my weekend. 

**Third Date** Finally he said he would come up on a weeknight, last night. His apartment is nice and considered very modern for the market. His demeanor changed when he arrived at my house, which is provided by my company and much larger than I need but it was chosen for me (three bedrooms). He made a couple of comments about how nice it was then we departed for dinner at a local pub style restaurant, which he said he preferred over ordering in or making something. En route to the restaurant he complained about the price of the rental car.

**He Asks Me to Pay** We shared one entre and got a salad and starter, plus each had two beers. As we were finishing our beers he asked ""do you mind paying for this one?"" I was a bit shocked by and told him I preferred to split. He said that was fine and explained he ""hadnt gotten paid by the job he quit three months ago so money is tight."" 

**Sexy Time Didnt Happen** We had agreed that he would sleep over but I just instantly felt put off by how tacky it was to ask me to pay post meal.  Later at my house one of my decorations is various currencies from around the world and he asked me if he could have a US five dollar bill I had in the bowl, ""because he loves the feeling of spending all his money and losing his cards when drunk but always having a random foreign currency in his wallet."" Maybe I was already dubious of him, but I thought this was an extremely immature thing to think about and regularly losing everything is a bit odd. I fell asleep on the couch and about an hour before we both needed to leave we relocated to my bed, but there was no kissing or other physical interaction. 

**I'm Going to Ghost Him** In the morning he told me he was excited because a discount rental car was a short walk from my house, a comment I found cheap. I wish he would have just offered to split, suggested we stay in (an option I gave him), or do something else. ",0.58
"AITA for expecting to be treated how I treat my friend? I know it's a little thing, but as someone who thinks she's getting gaslight and manipulated, I really need some outside POV. It's important to note that she (my friend) suffers from serious mental illness. 

This happened last weekend. 

Me (25F), my (best)friend (25F), her boyfriend and another one of our friend were at her house, having dinner and planning on playing some board games.

Just before sitting down to eat, I felt nauseauos, and couldn't eat anything. I excused myself and went to lay down on my friend's bed (with her permission ofc) to feel better. I didn't, and ended up vomiting a few times. 

My friend was beside me the whole time, telling me that I could stay there to sleep, and shouldn't drive home (I live about an hour away). Now, after texting my parents if they could pick me up and not getting any replies, and after the second time she told me I should stay, I asked them if they really could let me sleep there. 

They said of course, and asked me if it was a problem if her bf slept there too. It's not my house, of course, and while I was a little confused (one of us would have to sleep on the floor - only one bed and no couch) I said it was not a problem. Then, after I got sick another time and it was about 1am, she told me if I could go home before 10am because they had other plans. 

I must admit, I felt really annoyed by this request, but HEAR ME OUT: it's not because she asked, of course. I had no problem (I actually felt better at about 1.30am and went home on my own) and I would't want to interfere on their plans. I got annoyed because in the past, I had to drop everything when she needed it. Whenever she felt too anxious or depressed to be alone, I was with her. Whenever she had a panic attack (even if we were out with other friends or while I was at work, or late at night) I dropped everything to help her. 

I **wanted** to help her, of course, even when she didn't ask. But I also know that she would get mad, depressed, or she would get a panic attack if I was not to help her for whenever reason. So it was 70% of me wanting to help her, and 30% of fear of consequences. 

One time she also said that she felt as if I take her for granted, but I actually feel the contrary. And in our friendship, she was always the one saying: ""You're my priority"" and all of these kind of things (we met during hard, hard times, and were each other saviours you could say). 

I was talking about this with another one of my friends, and she told me I'm an asshole because I shouldn't be expecting anyone to drop everything just because I'm sick. I'm an adult and should be able to figure things out on my own.

"AITA for refusing to let my MIL ""baby talk"" to my five year old daughter? I'm a mother of two, a five year old daughter and a one year old son. I don't do any ridiculous baby talking with my kids. I talk to them the way I talk to adults, using proper words and full sentences. My MIL doesn't like this and thinks I'm just cold and uncaring. 

I made another post about this on the confessions subreddit. It's in my post history. 

Anyway, so yesterday was my husband's birthday and it is the one day of the year when MIL is allowed to come over to our house. As you will know from my other post, she doesn't like me one bit. She also blames me for ""ruining"" her relationship with her own daughter (my SIL) because SIL has always stood by me. 

So, both mine and my husband's family (including his mom) came over, we cut 
the cake and had dinner etc etc. Then MIL tried to talk to my daughter, which was drinking a cup of milk. MIL kept asking her if she likes ""milky milky"". I feel gross just typing that out. My daughter told her, ""no grandma, this is milk"".

MIL insisted that my child call it ""milky"". My daughter just looked at her, with a confused expression on her face. This is when I stepped in and told my daughter to finish her milk quickly before sending her off to play. When she was out of earshot, I turned to my MIL and asked, ""how many times do I have to tell you, not to baby talk to my kids?"" 

MIL was angry now and accused me of robbing my kids of their childhood and innocence. I told her she needed to leave. My husband, who had heard the whole thing, backed me up. He told his mom that this attitude of hers is exactly why we don't let her come over more than once a year. My father in law tried to tell us off but I simply walked to the front door and opened it, as an indication that we want them gone. My in laws stormed off.

As expected, MIL has been bad mouthing me for ""taking her son and grandkids away from her"". My husband's aunt understands where I'm coming from but thinks I should let her baby talk sometimes.

"AITA for letting my girlfriend burn herself and not wanting to help her afterwards? My girlfriend came over because she saw some recipe she really wanted to cook.

We are cooking it and it required a large cooking pot, I was cooking some of it in the pot and when it was done she told me to give her the pot. The pot is very large, like maybe 15-20 liters and I was holding it by the handle. When she asked for it I handed it to her and say ""careful the bottom is hot, grab the handle"" and she said ""Ok"" in a really annoyed tone and tried to grab the bottom and I said ""I said the bottom is hot"" and she yelled ""OK GIVE IT"" and I started to give it to her and she again, but her hands towards the bottom and I said ""I'm telling you the bottom is hot"" and she said ""OK I GET IT"" and I tried to give it to her and she again put her hands towards the bottom and I said ""THE BOTTOM IS HOT"" I'm getting really annoyed and she screams so loudly ""OK GIVE IT "" so I just say ""fuck this you can go burn yourself"" and she grabs the bottom of the pot, drops it and the shit spills all over the kitchen.

"AITA For having been an asshole in my past, but actively improving myself? First off - throwaway acct. 

I (36m) have been with my wife (31f) for close to 10 years. I battled hardcore alcohol abuse up until \~3 years ago. I failed to stop multiple times prior, until it basically came to a head with my wife that it was her or the bottle (after a nasty binge while home alone). So I quit that shit and really buckled down - I actively worked on myself, started seeing a therapist, and started removing toxic things from my life (social media, certain friends, etc.).

So I was an AH while I was either drinking or dry drunk - I spent time talking with someone I knew from middle school (romantically, or as an outlet, I'm not really sure). The last time I had said anything to this person was also during my last heavy binge. After I picked up the pieces from that, I vowed to myself not to fuck around anymore. In time, my wife was contacted by this other woman and given all of the messages. I felt like a fucking moron and begged for forgiveness...We worked on it, and she told me I needed to be clean and sober for 6 months before she would even consider children. I kept my word to her and to myself about not screwing up. 

All had continued to go well, aside from the occasional remark about the other woman from time to time, which has been turned on me during disagreements about things. I get upset with myself about this, and she knows it. And I don't fight back or disagree.

In February/March of last year, she was rocking our son, and we were quietly talking. She told me she forgives me for the BS I put her through, and said that if I ever did it again, she would leave (100% understandable). I took this to be a positive step towards healing our relationship, and it really grew strong over the next couple months, but, the off-hand comments still come occasionally, most often when there's work or other stressors and I become the punching bag, I take the licks and moved on.

I've always woken up for work around 4 or 4:30 to watch news, pay bills, drink coffee, etc.. For years. Occasionally (especially with an infant/toddler), I would get woken up around 3 or so, and be wide awake. I try for 20-30 minutes to fall back asleep before I just get up. This morning - awake around 3, and tried til 3:30 to fall back asleep. So I got up, went downstairs, checked sports scores, and started paying the remaining bills. I got a text asking where I was...downstairs...She responds with ""You get 2 hours of peace and quiet alone and you can talk to (other woman) again, secretly"". I didn't respond. Then, I went upstairs to get ready and to watch my son while she takes a shower...First words out of her mouth were ""Did you do the dishes? You had 2 hours alone."" I hadn't - but I went downstairs and did them immediately. She then told me to just finish getting ready and go to work and that she didn't want to talk to me. I got a text from her saying we need to talk tonight after I arrived at work. I'm just...confused and trying to figure shit out.

"AITA for not baby proofing my home? 
My friend and her 5y old son came to visit me last week. She's a single mom and we rarely see each other because we live far apart. I just moved into a bigger apartment, so they came to stay with me for a few days.

Everything was fine at first, we had fun and although I'm not good with kids, I tried my best. One morning we were all in the kitchen, my friend and I made breakfast while the boy was playing with a toy on the floor. After a while, my friend left the room to take a call and was gone for a few minutes. I'm not used to having kids around, so I dind't think twice about leaving him alone when I left to go pee. My friend was just in the next room, the door was open too. I also had to walk through the living room to get to the bathroom, so she knew I was leaving him alone in there.

When I came back she was still on the phone (explaining something to her coworker) and the kid was still in the kitchen. But when she came back, she noticed a bunch of photos on the floor. I had put them up on my fridge with small neodyium magnets, so we started looking for those but didn't find any. Knowing how dangerous magnets can be for kids, we immediatly tried to find out if he ate any but he just started crying, so I drove us to an ER.

My friend was panicking in the car and started yelling at me, ""Why do you even have tiny magnets in the first place? You should have told me about it before! Why did you leave him all alone?"" I was driving and tried to focus, so I didn't answer her. Honestly, I just never thought about my fridge magnets being a hazard.

All was fine in the end, he didn’t eat  the magnets. I was relieved and said ""let's go home, I'll take down the  magnets and see what else I might have to baby-proof for the next few days."" But my friend was still furious with me and demanded I drop them off at a hotel and bring her things because ""who knows what chemicals I have lying around in childs reach, she can't take her eyes off of him for a second in that house""

I tried to calm her down and reassure her that nothing else was going to happen and I'd keep a closer eye, but she refused. She just kept yelling at me. I dropped her off at a hotel and haven't heard from her since. Until this morning, she called and said that she's disappointed that I didn't even apologize for putting her child in danger. That I don't care about his wellbeing because I don't like children (I don't, but I don't want him to die, obviously?) and that I was clearly not even worried when it happend.

I don't mind apologizing, but am I really the only one to blame here? I never have kids around and while I did remember to put detergent and cleaning supplies out of reach, I just didn't think about the magnets. I could have done more and maybe shouldn't have left him alone in the room, but she has done it too and I just didn't consider it.",0.09
"AITA for ratting out my boyfriend after he and his friends left me on the side of the road? Before I explain why I could be the asshole, I just want to say that I am not quite sure if I am able to post this here as it is kind of about a relationship, and I am apologising to the mods in advance. 

On Tuesday night my (17f) boyfriend “E” (19m) were staying at a holiday park, and we had had a very stressful day (he was kicked out of his house and we had to pack up all of his things) he wanted to drink alcohol to have some fun, as we weren’t sure when we were going to see each other next. Everything was fine until his friend (19m) and his girlfriend “S” (19f) wanted to hang out. I was already drunk at this point, and E told me we had to go out and meet them. E then said we were going for a drive with them, and we got in the car. Before I even had a chance to put a seatbelt on, S started speeding off. I tried to find a seatbelt to put on as I felt unsafe, and I realised there were none. I tried to tell E that I wanted to get out but he was brushing me off. I then texted my best friend (18f) saying that I was really scared and to please call me. After about 3 minutes of being in the car, she called me and I asked S to please pull over so I can answer my friend as it was an “emergency”. She pulled over, and I stepped out of the car and shut the door and my back was towards the car and I walked closer to the fence next to the footpath so they wouldn’t hear me. I hear a squealing sound and I turn around and the car had disappeared around the corner. I tell my friend and I start bawling my eyes out and I explain everything to her. She lives about 2 hours away from me, so she wouldn’t of been able to get me. She tries to contact some of my friends in the area and is unsuccessful and she stays on the phone with me for about half an hour before calling the police as I was in a very dodgy part of our town and she was worried about me. This is where I may be the AH. I was freaking out and I texted him a bunch of times asking if we were breaking up, why he didn’t wait for me etc, and I ended up calling him about 15 times. He didn’t reply to any of those so when the police came and got me I started talking about all of the illegal things E does/did to try and get back at him. E and his friends think I am in the wrong for doing that, but my friends think that it was fair as he left me on the side of the road in a dodgy part of town. I’m conflicted now because I feel bad for telling the police things he told me in confidence, but all of my friends who are obviously biased say I am not the AH. So AITA?",0.32
"AITA for asking my husband to throw way his own broken dental picks? We were watching TV and both picking and or cleaning our teeth. As the evening ended and I was generally cleaning the area, I asked my husband to throw out his own dental pick which he had discarded on the coffee table. He got furious. I was polite. I took it in my hands and said something like could you at least throw this one out?  He got furious. He is now not talking to me. For background : he leaves the used unbroken ones laying about, in

"WIBTA for asking my parents for more money? I, M20 study abroad for university. My parents provide funds for me to attend university and for general expenses (eg. rent, food, etc) they explicitly stated their funds could not be used for partying/clubbing/etc. They do the same for my sister (F 22) as well. We both get the same amount per semester. We study in different towns but in the same country (too far away to live together). Our tuition and rent are about the same, although my rent is slightly higher but on the other hand, restaurants in her town are more expensive.  
I, however, developed multiple disabilities and chronic illnesses that even with insurance cost up to 700+ EUR a month. Over the last year, I've had to be in and out of the hospital for testing and treatment. I now have a diagnosis and a treatment plan but it's expensive. I don't party or even drink but, I burn through the funds considerably faster than my sister. My sister goes out clubbing all the time and even goes to concerts. She recently got a job to help fund this but previously used our parents' funds.

As a foreigner in this country, it's incredibly hard for me to get a job due to my physical and psychological conditions. On top of this, there is a lot of anti-immigrant discrimination in the town I live in. I got accepted for 2 jobs before but both are not accessible to me (physically) anymore plus, to work I have to get my visa sponsored, and it's hard to find employers who will do that for me. I've done what I can think of to try and be strict with my money; buying only discounted food or the cheapest item, growing things myself if possible with my limited space, I haven't even gone to a restaurant since developing the condition nor have I gotten take out. I do lab studies at my university as a participant but they often pay only like 4-5 euros. I've sold clothing, food, etc. to try and get some income but it's incredibly hard. I had to make a GoFundMe to get a wheelchair as I couldn't afford it.  
Because of the difficulties in gaining finance and my medical condition causing a large variable expense every month, I am forced to stop treatment or ask for more funds.

At the same time, my parents refuse to accept my new condition medically. I have given them any and every document they ask for and have tried countless times to explain it to them but they refuse to believe it. I don't blame them, it's a lot to process. The thing is, they already provide a lot of things monetary-wise not just to me but also to my sister.

"WIBTAH if I brought up brother's theft charges from years ago? Brother (50) has always been a taker since he was young. In his 20s, I sold him my used car at a greatly reduced price to help him out. I could have sold it for $3,000, but charged him only $1,000 as it was his first car. He sold it within a few months for $3,000 and took the extra $2,000 to buy a different car but wouldn't give any of the money back. (I could list more examples, but you get the idea.)

Fast forward to a year ago. Our parents moved to a nursing home so the kids need to clear out their stuff. He shows up with a trailer and takes most of the good stuff that has value. The other kids take a few mementoes and other stuff that would fit in a car. Nothing of any real financial value. We donated the rest to a charity. 

Brother wanted a specific thing from when our parents first got married. It had no monetary value but was a reminder of an event they attended when first dating. He accused me of taking it and has since been telling others that I stole it. I didn't. I wouldn't have taken it if offered, I never saw it and would never want it. But he's got it in his head that I have it. I've reassured him that I don't but he doesn't believe me. I've never stolen anything in my life so I find it very irritating that he continues to say this to others in the family. I think another sibling just threw it out not realizing it had sentimental value. I even tried to find a copy from the event from 70 years ago in case there were extra copies. There weren't.

When he was much younger, my brother was charged with theft on two separate occasions, several years apart. He also got away with insurance fraud (he claimed expensive things worth a couple thousand dollars were stolen when he never owned them in the first place). And bragged to the family about it. EG showing off his new leather coat that insurance paid like he was some genius. 

I've been taking the high road and just ignore him. We haven't talked much since but there is an event coming up where we will all be together. I'm concerned he's going to allude to the thing in front of others implying I have it and everyone will think I do but am just keeping it hidden. What I want to say is 'one of us has been charged with theft several times in the past and it wasn't me.' I know he'd freak out but I'm tired of being taken advantage of. He's got his issues so I am concerned it will set him off in an unhealthy way. I'm pretty sure everyone in the family 99% believes me and thinks he's the odd one. Part of me thinks let sleeping dogs like and just have nothing to do with him and have not contact once the event is over.

WIBTHA if I publicly reminded the family that my brother is the one who has a history of stealing things, not me. It will greatly embarrass him as his kids do not know about his theft charges from before they were born.",0.27
"AITA for forcing my spouse to get rid of his dog? I (25f) have been married to my husband (44m) since 2019. He had this dog before we got together and had to send the dog to his mom's due to the dogs behavior. He has always been quick to snap and has broken skin on many people. My first meeting with this dog he grabbed ahold of me when my husband left the room and I stood up. He had no problem removing him from the home at that point since I had a 3 year old as well. 

Fast forward to a year ago, his mother requires hospice care due to dementia (stage 3) and we moved in so he can help her out. 

Well, I moved out about 7 months ago and couldn't leave him alone and now we're expecting a little boy in June. He wants me to move back in and refuses to help me in any way with preparing for the baby, visiting me, or anything that involves him leaving the house. It's on me to move in if I need help. Including Tylenol when my fever was 102, I was told I'm a narcissist for ""expecting"" him to help. My exs mom brought me Tylenol when she picked up her grand daughter since I was very sick, pregnant, and my 7 year old still needs care and is in school. 

Well, he is demanding I move back in for me to receive any amount of help. The reasons I left are a long list, the reason I'm not willing to move back is the dog. In the past he has bragged to me about bringing my daughter around the dog when I was very clear that dog is NOT safe and I refuse for her to be near him. 

We have all heard the phrase ""don't bite the hand that feeds you"" well, this dog does that. To my husband's own mother, ridden with dementia. I am willing to look passed everything we've had go bad in the past and try to fix everything but not while that dog is there. 

I am told I'm a narcissist for not wanting my newborn around the dog and I don't trust him to respect my choice not to bring my infant around him when he didn't listen about my daughter who isn't his and knows her father was furious as well. I did tell her father about it because my daughter told him as well and I felt no need to lie or hide it. 

If he doesn't respect his mother's safety, my daughters safety, or respect my rules as a parent to ensure the safety of my kids... I don't know if it's valid or not that I should be labeled as a psychopath or a narcissist for wanting to keep my life in a seperate home or wanting the dog gone to give it all up but I also know he had the dog before I got there.

"AITA for telling my daughter she is being selfish and that she needs to take an uber since I am not leaving her older brothers wedding This has been a built up issue, my son got married this weekend and this issue isn’t dying so I am going here. My daughter has very bad anxiety, she is 19 and I will call her Shelly. Shelly used to go to therapy when she was a minor but stopped when she turned 18. Ever since the her anxiety has been out of control, and due to this she won’t drive anymore.

She has a license but refuses to drive. We live in the USA and driving is basically needed or it’s a big inconvenience for the people around her.  Also she is an adult so it not like we can force her to drive. 

This is the issue, my son was getting married  and she was uncomfortable with so many people around at his wedding. She asked me to take her home, I told her no and if she having difficulties wait in the car. She told me it’s freezing outside and  she needs to leave. I told her no again turn on the heat in the car and wait if she needs to be away from people.

She don’t like this answer and told me she will have an attack if she stays and she needs to go home. I told her to take an Uber than I am not leaving. She don’t like this and this was turning into a full argument. Shelly told me I need take her home again and I had enough.

I told Shelly she is being selfish, that she has many opinions and I will not deprive her bother (my son) of his parents being  at his weddings. If I took her home I would miss his wedding since it was a hour drive here. She called me a jerk and left to stay in the car for a bit. She was back about an hour later for the rest of the wedding.

"AITA for causing my ex’s girlfriend to break up with him I (23F) grew up with a boy (25M) who we will call C for the duration of this post. Our parents were very close friends so we saw each other often during our childhood. We went on family trips together, even traveling Europe with them. Since as long as I can remember, I had a crush on C but he was always in some sort of a relationship so I kept it quiet. One day, during the summer, our families were camping with each other when suddenly, he began to seem interested. One thing led to another and he ended up taking my V-Card. Soon after, we didn’t start fully dating but we were friends with benefits. One thing to add is when we originally hooked up, he had a girlfriend. Although this sounds horrible and I severely regret it, I was only 15 at the time and he was 17. His girlfriend broke up with him and we made things official but our relationship only lasted a few months before I ended things with him. We lived far apart and he was moving way too fast. Although our romantic relationship ended, we continued to be friends for years until around a year ago, he got a new girlfriend. Soon after they started dating, C texted me saying his girlfriend was making him block me on everything, which I was sad about but I understood. We didn’t talk for months until recently, a friend of our passed away and our friends Wife requested for me to tell him. I found his Instagram and DM’d him, informing me of our friends passing. C responded later that day, sharing his condolences and we began catching up. It was a completely innocent conversation, we were just talking about what’s new in our lives and our accomplishments. Now, this could be where I was in the wrong but I said “Completely as friends, I miss you. We should talk more.” At the time, I thought nothing of it and assumed he would also take it as an innocent message. I only said I miss him because he used to be one of my best friends. Soon after I sent the text, he told me to delete that which confused me. C then asked me to send screenshots of our conversation from earlier. Another thing to add is his girlfriend can be extremely jealous and a bit controlling but again, that’s none of my business. His girlfriend DM’D me on Instagram saying “Send me your conversation right fucking now.” I did not respond to his girlfriend and then, he texted me saying “I lied to my girlfriend.” This confused me even more and right after I asked what he meant, and he then proceeded to send me a large paragraph, cussing me out and saying I am the reason for his girlfriend to break up with him. C then proceeded to block me and last night, his girlfriend tried to follow me on all my social media pages. I honestly don’t know what I did wrong and I seriously need advice.

"AITA for not wanting my (30F) partner (30M) to take a gun as a Christmas gift from his grandpa? Some background: I was raised without guns. I had never held a gun in my life until a couple of years ago. I am always nice to the grandpa, even though he's done some things to rub me the wrong way. I act interested in the things he shows me even if I'm not. Well one time he was showing me a gun and placed it in my hands. He didn't ask if I wanted to hold it (I would have said no) just handed it to me. When he saw how uncomfortable I was holding it he took it back and said he thought I would want to look at it. I told him that was the first time I had ever held a gun and it made me uncomfortable. My partner was raised with guns in mind, he was taught how to use them safely and taken to the gun range as a child. 

A few years ago my partner was pressured into taking his father's rifle. I wasn't happy about it and neither was he. He complained about it to me on multiple occasions and said he wished he hadn't taken it. However he never expressed this regret to his family. 

Well this Christmas his grandpa got him a gun as a present. My partner said he wouldn't take it home until he had a lock for it. On our drive home we talked about if he should take it at all. I told him ultimately it was his decision but that I thought he shouldn't. I talked about how he told me he wished he hadn't taken the rifle before and how big of a stressor it was to get rid of it. I told him he didn't have to feel guilty for not taking it and his grandpa should have known better than to buy someone a gun without discussing it with them. I compared it to buying someone a puppy as a present. My partner is very defensive of his grandpa and said he kind of wants to take it to make his grandpa happy. I said I think that is a bad reason to have a gun in your possession. 

Am I justified in being upset with his grandpa? Should I be more supportive of him taking a gun as a present? A big part of me is worried about setting this precedent. If my partner takes this gun, will his grandpa buy him more guns as gifts?",0.59
"AITA for being offended my friend didn’t ask if I was okay after being anesthetized for surgery? hi all,

I’m and my friend is 23f, respectively. Weve probably been friends for around 3 years now and text every day, and hang out about every week. She does have some jealousy issues with men and attention, which will be important later. She’s even gone as far as to say its disrespectful for her male friends to show/ tell her if they’re hanging out with their other female friends or girlfriends even though she has no romantic attachment to them.

I’ve been planning/ saving up for an elective surgery for the past 6 months. I went in yesterday for a “top” augmentation. She knew the night before that I was going in, and then the next day asked what time. I told her after I was out. She knows you have to go under anesthesia and that there is pain associated with the procedure. We’ve talked on and off all day for two days since - and she’s not one asked me how I’m doing / feeling. I asked her actually for assistance with something I couldn’t do myself since she lives only about two minutes away from me and all she did was send me a laughing emoji. In fact the only comment she made since I got out was that now she needs to get an augmentation now bc I have ‘’more” than her.

Am I the asshole for being offended that she hasn’t check in on me at all? And would I be the asshole if I brought up that I thought it was rude behavior? Just looking for advice/ how to approach.

"WIBTA if I didn't tell my friend I didn't cut my hair to support her through cancer? January 2023 one of my friends, Anna, opened up about her cancer diagnosis. She didn't tell us about it until after it became more obvious that she was loosing a lot of weight and loosing her hair. 

There was a group chat on Facebook where some of our friends talked about shaving their hair to show their support. I wasn't a part of the group chat as I'm not a big Facebook user. I log on maybe once every 2 or 3 months. No one told me about their plan. I think they all assumed someone else would tell me about it or I'd shave it when they did. 

A few people knew I was thinking about cutting my hair, but I don't think I told anyone outside of my partner and a co-worker I was going to shave it. Anna wanted to have a big birthday party with everyone there in case it was her last one, so of course I went. What I didn't know was that everyone was going to be shaving their hair at the party. 

When I arrived my hair was already shaved. Anna saw me about 10 minutes after I arrived. She started crying when she saw me and said how thankful she was that I shaved it for her. I tried to tell her I didn't know about everyone shaving their hair and I had it planned for a few months. She was quiet after I told her, which led me to think it was awkward for her and she was avoiding talking about it. At the time of the party I didn't recognize the signs of her disorientation from meds and chemo. I didn't know what that looked like until things got worse for her. 

A year later and that friend is a lot better. We talked last night and she broke down over how thankful she was that I shaved my hair for her. She said giving up that much hair to show support for her was one of the kindest things anyone has ever done. It gave her a lot of strength to carry on. She fought to stay alive because she wanted to grow her hair out in the future as long as I did and donate it to someone else. She wanted to stay alive so she could rebuild our friendship and get closer to me again. She went on and on for almost 20 minutes about how thankful she was that I did that for her. I didn't know what to say. I never told her or anyone else that I did that for her. I thought she was mentally there enough have remembered me telling her the truth. I now think she may have been disoriented during the conversation at her party.  

I talked to my mom about it last night and she said I shouldn't tell her because it's going to hurt her a lot. My partner said the same thing. Everyone I talk to about it says it's too important to her to ruin it. I would've absolutely shaved my hair for her if I knew what everyone was planning. My partner said that's enough for me to not tell her because it's something I would've done for her anyway. I don't know what to do. Should I wait until she's fully better to tell the truth? Should I tell her today? Should I let her keep believing I did that for her? I feel horrible that she thinks I did that for her when I didn't. I feel like she deserves to know the truth",0.96
"AITA for ""insulting"" my cousin? I 23m was with my cousin Jessica 26f and a few other people at my other cousin's birthday party. We were talking and Jessica kept bitching about her boyfriend Samuel. I've never said this to anyone but I don't understand why Samuel is with Jessica, Samuel is very good looking (no homo), is very smart (he did 2 bachelor's at the same time from differnet universities, speaks 4 languages), is very fit and has a very high paying job while Jessica is lets say a little bit less than mid. She's a bit overweight but more importantly she is just so obnoxious, she contributes nothing to their relationship, she doesn't work and spends his money and i think she's cheating on him. 

Jessica went off about how Samuel isn't her dream man, that she wants a man who can better provide for her, takes her on vacations to tropical islands, had abbs (sam's abs are only somewhat visible but he has big biceps and pecs), how she wants someone like Chris Hemsworth. I was getting really fed up because I actually like this Samuel guy, I've met him a few times and he's a really nice guy. I told her ""hey Samuel is a nice guy, you should be grateful he takes care of you"" and she then bitches about him saying he doesn't do enough and he needs to be more like Chris Hemsworth so I responded back with ""maybe you should start looking like Alba Baptista, you're getting the better deal in this relationship"" and she just got a bit angry and then started tearing up and left. Her friends yelled at me saying I am such a pig and I hsouldn't talk about her like that and I told them they're fucking toxic and I hope their boyfriends leave them. 

This is where I might have taken it too far. I found Samuel and one of the girl's boyfriends on facebook and I told them how their girlfriends talked shit about them. I later heard that both of the men broke up with them, I don't think this was the only reason but this might have been the last straw. Jessica got my parents involved and demanded I apologize to both of them and  try to get samuel so i told them no and to go fuck themselves so now my mom isn't talkiing to me (she was always a pushover) and my dad decided to get a pair and took my side and now there's a rift. 

On the bright side, Samuel invited me to go Marlin fishing with him which is somehting I always wanted to do, Jessica is pissed off about that saying she deserved to go on that trip, Samuel's friend is a charter fisherman and he's letting Samuel bring some people as a birthday gift. ",0.38
"AITA? Cat Allergy Hell A bit of context to begin with. I've lived with my partner for about 6 years now with no major issues, think it's safe to say we're both pretty happy in the grand scheme of things.

4 years ago we brough home a lovely kitten and it transpired that I am allergic to this kitty, quite badly so. We have at great expense put in wooden flooring to help hoover up the cat fur, purchased a fancy anti allergy hair wrap hoover, got an anti allergy air purifier and I have seen my GP and take some heavy duty anti allergy medication to try and help mitigate my symptoms.

However, every now and then even with all of this my symptoms are pretty bad. I struggle to breathe normally and switch between being fully blocked up and nose streaming,  not to mention the general lethargy I feel from having kitty around. There are some things I ask of my partner to try and help me including cleaning the floors, surfaces, washing the cat more regularly, trying to wash her hands after petting, trying to not let the cat on the bed and she usually does this for a little while before reverting back to just doing it occasionally or until my allergies really kick off again.

"AITA for breaking my friend's ""marriage""? 
I (F18) have known this guy Max (M19) for 7 years now. We were part of a larger friend group which disintegrated with time, so me & him were the only ones who stayed close.

Back in summer of 2022 ish, Max started acting different. It started with dark jokes riddled with red pill, alpha male, incel culture adjacent buzzwords. It was nothing very extreme, till well, it got extreme. 

I'd discuss my life updates with him, & whenever I'd talk about relationship issues, he'd jump onto me & start defending whichever guy I was dating at the time. At first, he'd flippantly call me a ""red flag"" or referring to girls as ""females"". You see where I'm going with this.

On one particular occasion, I was at a gathering with him & a bunch of his HS friends, & one of them directly called me a w***e to my face cuz I made a joke about dolling up to attract my crush at a party. Max laughed along to it.

Max said it was all in good fun, & also started giving me unsolicited advice about my body & fashion choices later on. I am a pretty non confrontational person, & I only have to see Max like once or twice a week. So, I try to avoid controversial topics around him even if his behaviour hurts me. 

Anyways, Max had a long term gf (F20) he planned to marry. He would talk bout how ""easy"" she was & how annoying & whiny girls can get behind her back. He dreamt of ""putting her in her place"" once they got married.

His gf is a very strongly opinionated lady, a no nonsense feminist- Twitter's wet dream. I was pretty close to her since they started dating, and it irked me how much Max demeaned her in private but didn't have the guys to do it to her face cuz he knew she'd get pissed.

So I was conversing with her the other day at her house, & we were pretty drunk. I was really sad about a recent breakup, so I confided in her bout how rude Max had been to me about it. I instantly regretted it. 

She however caught it, & wouldn't let it go. She pressed me about it, & I tried to play it off by saying that ""it's just how he is"" & that seemed to make it worse cuz she demanded more details. 

I had to divulge most of the story to her, & she got so mad, she called him up right there and yelled at him about it to defend me.

Max being Max, insulted her right back, called us ""entitled b words"". That really triggered her, & I sat there petrified as these two had a clash of egos & broke up infront of me. His gf thanked me for opening her eyes, & then started crying. That was that.

Next day, Max calls up his gf, apologises & obv she doesn't buy it. Max is livid at me for meddling in his relationship & ruining it. When his gf called the other night, he was out with his friends & they heard it all, & he says he is so embarassed.  

He was planning to propose to her soon, & I feel like shit coz now I broke up his marraige. He says it's really hard for a guy like him to find love, & I feel for him. I honestly didn't mean to do it, I was just really sad and blurted it out in the moment.

So the other day i put my foot down. I was i the kitchen when Tia started again, so i ignored her. Full blown ""cant hear ya over the sizzle of the pan"" pretended not to notice her.  Over the week we made it clear that we werent interested in anything more than exchanging smiles upon eye contact and only occasional chat. But yesterday suddenly Tia came to the window and screaming to make sure i couldnt even pretend to miss it : we know you hate us, unneighbourly \*slang slang slang\* snobbish asses \*slang\* and left.

Now i am wondering if we really were in the wrong to ignore her. Maybe i  should have had an honest conversation with them. But then what was i to say ""we dont wanna talk to you anymore?"" Thats weird, but idk maybe we were wrong.

aita?/awta?

edit : we cant have a full curtain coz that turns our small kitchen into a smoke chamber. We did/do have a thin raggish cloth covering half the window. They talk to us nonetheless.",0.07
"AITA for calling my dad selfish for refusing to drive in the snow? I (19f) got into an argument of sorts with my dad. My dad is the only one in our household with a driver's license (my older brothers drive too but they live elsewhere). My mom and i mostly use public transport to commute. But today it snowed a lot and buses have been cancelled during the most busy hours of the day, which means my mom can't get home from work. She was recently sick so she's still very tired and this morning already she was wishing to come home.

Well my dad refuses to pick her up from work. It's less than half an hour drive and the roads are pretty clear. It's not snowing anymore so the sight is all fine and the roads have largely been cleared so all the snow's just on the sidewalks and such. From my window i can see plenty cars driving, albeit at a slightly slower pace for safety ofc. Buses were canceled before it stopped snowing and i assume it's too late for the bus company to un-cancel all the shifts but either way it's pretty safe to drive now. Still my dad doesn't want to go pick her up. I think it's ridiculous because 1) it's pretty safe out rn and 2) he went out earlier today when it was still snowing and didn't seem to have any driving issues then. I suspect he just doesn't wanna go out and risk traffic jams or whatever and be away for an hour.

My mom called to ask what to do and he told her to stay at work, that he can't pick her up until maybe late in the evening or in the morning. She asked him why he can't come and he was like ''no, there's too much snow now''. She reluctantly accepted. I feel bad cause she is so tired and wants to go home but can't come. I'd pick her up but i don't have a license. 

I said to my dad it's unfair he gets to sit on the couch and watch tv while he could easily pick her up to take her home. She does so much for him, literally 60% of all house chores (I take care of the other 40% so he has it really easy obviously), and he can't do this for her? I called it selfish. He says i'm being ridiculous and as a non-driver i don't get to have any opinion on this. Now he's acting angry toward me. I wanted to vent to a friend but she told me i need to get his side to cause it's not fun going out into the cold and doing the slow drive to work and back. Her comment made me wonder if AITA?

"AITA for not wanting to babysit for my mother when she needs it? My (f21) mother (f42) had a baby last year, she took a year off work (not paid) and now she'll have to go back to work. My mother had to take the time off because her pregnancy was harder (due to her age) even though she and her husband weren't in an ideal financial situation, they have been paying bills with their savings, so it's very needed that my mother goes back to work.

I have a daughter of my own, she's 4. I don't work, I stay home and look after her while my boyfriend works, I am also taking online courses to try to get some education and get a job. I am also pregnant with our second baby (first trimester)

Well, my mother asked me to babysit for her since I'm home anyways and she needs the help. I told her no because when I'm not looking after my daughter, I am studying or doing home chores and having another baby at home will make everything twice as difficult. I think that it'll probably add up to the stress I am already feeling and I don't want that to harm my baby. 

I know that she's in a difficult place and I understand why she'd ask me, but she's pressuring me to agree. Is this a reasonable boundary? I understand her position but I feel like she doesn't understand mine. She told me that I owe it to her because she babysat for me when I had my baby so I could finish school and I know she did, but i feel like i can't babysit for her now, looking after an eight months old while doing everything else I have to do will be too hard.

"AITA because I met another guy? First of all: this incident happened a while ago but it's still mentioned in discussions, so I guess it's still a thing

2 years ago my boyfriend and I moved to a different city for his studies. At this time I was writing on my bachelors thesis to finish my studies and concurrently started working at a school. 
The time was mentally really challenging for me because I had BIG struggles with my writing process, I didn't like the job and I had trouble making new friends, so I felt really lonely. I have to add that it was also a tough time for my boyfriend because I unconsciously took it out on him. I cried a lot, I was in anger, I hadn't any will to do anything and I laid in bed most of the time. Even when he tried to motivate me for doing things I passed and pouted. To my defense: I really gave my best, but I often couldn't help it. You know, we more or less moved for him so he could start his dream studies, he hung out with his fellow students, he did what he loved, had a lot to do and felt comfortable in our new adopted city and I was really happy for him. But on the other side I felt totally lonely, bored (he had long days at university while I just worked 16 hours per week), I regretted moving because I started missing my friends, I felt powerless when it comes to my thesis and I think I became somehow depressed. 

So what's the problem now? 
After some months at work I started talking to an indirect colleague and found him likeable as a person. After a while he asked me to hang out what we did on a random friday or so. (Unfortunately) it was the first warm and sunny day after a long winter. Exactly this is my boyfriends problem. He judged me for being able to hang out with another person (on the first sunny day) but previously denied most of his offers to do something. I somehow see the point but to be honest this was the only chance to get in contact with someone at that time and I couldn't know that day will be nice and sunny.  (Which seems to be relevant to my boyfriend as in conflicts he argues like ""you remember that time when after a long hard time for me seeing you unmotivated, sad, angry, depressed... and after repeatedly being rejected you meet another guy at the first good day in a decade"") 

I wonder if I am the asshole for hanging out with my colleague instead of spending that sunny day with my boyfriend, after he had a hard and frustrating time with me 

If it's necessary to mention: both of us were in a happy relationship and none of us viewed this as a date. 

I am really interested in your perspectives!",0.92
"AITA for not letting husband’s ex into a moms class groupchat? Husband and I met in college. Before that he dated “Millie” from ages 14-17. When I first met his family, they all seemed to be in awe of me and it was quite awkward so he explained that his family (and most people in his life prior to college) believed him and Millie would be together forever. I was uncomfortable but he assured me that he “loves me and only me”. We had a few fights over things his friends said but ultimately it was clear that we were being dumb. 

I didn’t have any problems related to Millie for several years. Everyone seemed to have moved on.

Husband and I now have 3 kids. My middle son (6) is in the same grade as Millie’s son. They are in different classes and I only found out about this after my MIL passively mentioned it. 

The moms in my son’s class created a groupchat. A couple days ago Millie contacted me and asked if I could add her into this groupchat and said that she and her son are having trouble connecting with the other moms/kids and it would be a huge help. I was a bit confused as to why she was asking me for permission, and how she got my number but I quickly realized that the other moms probably told her and out of consideration for me wanted her to ask me? I’m not sure. Most of these women grew up with Millie so they know “everything.”

I told her that I can’t really stop anyone if they wanted to add her but I’d rather she not join. Besides, it’s a class groupchat and her son isn’t in it. 

She got upset and asked if I’m only saying no because of her history with my husband. I said well yeah. She then said I’m being sensitive and petty. I told her that I’m uncomfortable. She said not everything is about me and I’m being selfish. I made a sarcastic comment about protecting my peace before firmly telling her she won’t change my mind and that neither she or her son are my responsibility. Millie got even angrier and said that I’m the only person still hung up over their relationship and that I need to grow up and stop being so insecure. She also accused me of being elitist? 

She’s still at it and will tell anyone that’ll listen about how I’m being selfish and how I’m so hung up over the past. My husband thinks we’re all being ridiculous. He was joking when he said that but idk. One of the moms in the groupchat privately asked me about the whole thing and she just said “hmm” so I really don’t know, but they said they weren’t going to add her unless I “gave my permission.” AITA?",0.8
"AITA for not wanting my boyfriend to be apart of his best friends child's life? I've known my boyfriend (22m) since June 2022. We were coworkers, and we started talking. He ended up cheating on me with our supervisor. I decided to forgive him after he's done everything in his power to gain my trust back, but now the so-called Supervisor got with my boyfriend's best friend and got pregnant. His best friend wants my boyfriends to be the godfather of this child. Which makes me feel really uncomfortable at the fact that he's still going to be involved with this woman. I've brought it up to his best friends attention and he said that he understands how I feel because she was messing around with my boyfriend while she was messing around with him. (I know crazy right)

He said that they don't have to talk to each other regarding this child but then when I brought it up to my boyfriend and we all had a conversation with his best friend. His best friend back tracked what he said and called me insecure. I would like to add that I know this child has nothing to do with the past issues but I don't want my boyfriend associating himself with this women at all. I've tried bringing it up to my boyfriend in multiples different ways but it seems as though he'll never understand why I'm feeling this way especially when theirs a child involved.

"AITA for making a Jehovah’s Witness take part in a drama lesson? I am a secondary school drama teacher and currently year 9 are studying The Crucible by Arthur Miller.

For those of you who don’t know, the play is about a group of girls falsely accusing others in the town of witchcraft and was written by Miller as a comment on McCarthyism in the 50’s. The idea of the play is that people get caught up in mass hysteria - there are no witches.

So, a general supply teacher told the class that next drama lesson they would be doing The Crucible and a little bit about it being to do with witches. Cue an angry phone call from a girls mother who said she isn’t to learn about witches and ghosts etc because the girl is a Jehovah’s Witness. I explained to the girl on the day of the lesson that the play wasn’t about real witches, no one cast spells or does anything supernatural. That the whole thing was about hysteria. I explained the extract we would be concentrating on for a few lessons was between a husband and wife and witches wouldn’t even be mentioned.

She was dubious, but got into the lesson quick and even volunteered to perform the extract for the class. 

Then today she turns up with a copy of Little Women and says she isn’t allowed to ‘learn about witches’ and will read. I told her no, she has to take part as the lesson isn’t about witches, today the lesson was about proxemics and eye contact during Elizabeth and John arguing. She again joined in no problem and said later that the content was fine when I checked in with her.

But mum is complaining again and I now am at a loss, was I wrong to make the girl take part in the lesson? Should I have respected her religious beliefs even though I knew we weren’t doing anything supernatural?",0.5

I stayed up until 11 pm watching TikTok in an attempt to fall asleep and sent him a TikTok at around 10:30 pm.

"AITA for telling my sister I already knew she was pregnant? A while ago I [16f] heard my sister arguing with my parents about something so I kinda eavesdropped and figured out that they were talking about my sister being pregnant, and I was obviously surprised but I couldn’t tell anyone I knew. And then another while after I overheard them talking about when to tell me so I pretty much knew when they were planning on telling me as well. 

They called me into the kitchen one day and she said she had something to tell me and they were making it a big surprise but obviously I knew what she was about to say. Leading up to it I was thinking of how I was gonna act when she tells me but when it actually came to it I decided to just tell her I already knew instead of lying and pretending to act surprised. Both her and my parents were pretty shocked and asked how I knew and I told them I had heard them talking about it. I felt kinda bad because they were probably expecting a big reaction but I thought it was better than lying to them. 

My mom was pretty pissed off and later that night she went mad at me for ""ruining a special moment"". I told her I just didn’t want to fake a reaction but she said she didn’t care and that I could’ve just pretended to be surprised and happy for her.",0.17
"AITA for ""lecturing"" my wife after she got fired from her dream job? Me (37m) and my wife (35f) both have what I suppose would be considered ""prestigious"" jobs, in a career that she considered her dream job growing up. When we met, she said that her real desire is to be a SAHM, but we both agreed (and continued to agree) that either of us being a SAHP is financially out of the question for reasons that aren't relevant here. Currently we live a comfortable lifestyle: we travel, we live in a nice house, and we are able to give our two young children whatever they want or need (within reason). All of that will probably now change. 

She worked in the most ideal situation imaginable. She made roughly $125k per year while working fully from home approx. 30 hours per week in an average week, with nearly unlimited vacation and personal time off as long as her work got done. Literally a perfect situation to work while being parent.  

Recently, I noticed when I work from home that she was working less and less, and somedays not even turning her laptop on. To offset those days, she had been mixing in 12-14 hour days to get her work done.  I confronted her about this and she said that she hates working, is not a career oriented person, and does not care about her job. I explained that she should not take this job for granted because she is literally never going to have a better work life balance anywhere else, certainly not for that money. We had that conversation twice and she agreed both times that she was being a bit ""soft"" about work. 

On Friday she got fired from her job. Her work was not getting done and she was not being responsive to her bosses.  Her reaction was basically ""oh well, now I have more free time with our kids"" and has not committed to job searching. I make nearly double her salary, so she thinks we're fine without her working. 

I got upset and ""angrily lectured her"" about how good she had it at work and how, despite being ""fine"" by average annual income standards, we can't afford to maintain our lifestyle on just my salary unless we sell our house and move into something cheaper, smaller, and further from the city I work in.  I explained that I feel like she let the family down by having such a poor attitude about work, especially after I warned her about how noticeable her decline was to the casual observer.  I love her, and we have an otherwise perfectly health marriage, but being a SAHM is out of the question unless we make some serious lifestyle changes that she doesn't want to make.

"AITA because my dad yelled at me because I accidentally farted on him and it was loud? Please DO NOT be rude!!! I am very angry at my dad and a bit ashamed for writing this.

The other day my dad and I were sitting in the couch watching TV. My dad sprawled out in the couch. I was sitting on his legs and I had a cup of orange juice in my hand. As I bent over to set it down, I accidentally farted on my dad’s legs and it was loud. He yelled at me calling me names basically telling me that I farted on him on purpose and that I should have excused myself to the bathroom. I told him that I farted on accident and that I had no control over it. He then told me that it was very disrespectful for me to fart loudly in front of him. I explained that the fart didn’t smell it was just loud and that I can’t control if it’s going to be loud or not. I am not sure what to do as my dad hasn’t talked to me since the whole incident yesterday. I have tried to call him at work but he completely ignores my phone calls.

"WIBTA if I sell my parents' Christmas gift to my kids to buy something that fits my family better? WIBTA- My (36F) parents are like the Beverly Hillbillies. We grew up dirt poor and then they struck it rich through mostly dumb luck when I was an adult. 

But poor or rich, they've always been narcissistic and have had a complicated relationship with all of my siblings. Only now they occasionally dole out expensive gifts to reward good behavior or to pit us against each other. Yes, there is a golden child and no, I'm not it.

Mom has a habit of ruining my big life milestones (my wedding, my pregnancies, etc.) by picking fights and not speaking to me for several months. It hurt at first but it's lost it's effectiveness.

Last year, I got fed up and told her that I was going NC myself. She's still welcome to call or visit my kids (12m, 4f, 3f) but I wasn't putting in any effort with her anymore.

A month later, she sends a group text to all the kids- we need to show up at her house in 3 days to receive a check and show our gratitude. It was condescending in the extreme but on brand for her. I happen to live 2 hours away.

I had a work event and a family anniversary that weekend, but kind of wanted to get over the silent treatment, so I asked if we could reschedule for another day with more notice. This caused a huge blow-up. 

She said I'm ungrateful. I said I didn't need the money. She said she's writing me out of the will. Fine.

Going NC felt great. My husband and I both have great jobs, own a house, and are happy- even more so with less family drama!

The silence lasted a year. Mom has texted my husband 2-3 times but not me. Then around Christmas, I receive a huge box on my doorstep.

My parents had bought an expensive outdoor playset as a group gift for my kids. I was planning on getting one myself this year for them so it should have been great. However, this one was too large for my yard and too flimsy for my 12 year old to use.

I want to sell it and use the money to buy something all the kids could enjoy. This could have been seen as an olive branch and I know that selling it would be the ultimate insult- but not why I would do it. It simply doesn't fit my family. There's no way I could explain this to them that they would take it as anything less than an FU from me.

I haven't heard from my parents in almost a year and I'm on the fence about whether I want to fix this relationship any time soon. It's not like they'll see that I'm not using it and I'm honestly happier without their drama. I feel bad that my kids don't have a better relationship with my family, but they're too young to really notice their absence.

"AITA for REFUSING to let maintenance come to my room? I (21F) live in a building. A couple of weeks ago, the fire detectors kept going off 24/7 and so were my neighbors. I put in a request to have them fixed or replaced (I bought batteries and tried changing them but it was still going off).I ended up uninstalling them because I was going crazy and they were saying it wasn’t an ‘emergency’. I put this request in on January 2nd and they came to replace 2/6 alarms on January 15. 

Fast forward to today. I woke up with period blood all over my sheets and a guy banging on the door. They said that they were here to fix the fire alarms. I told them to come in tomorrow because today was not a good day, and quite frankly I was embarrassed. I also had a mess in my room I didn’t want anyone to see. They started being very persistent but I kept telling them to come tomorrow, and how it says in the lease that they need 24 hrs notice to come in. The building manager came and everything and I told him that I was having a ‘personal emergency’ (also I forgot to add, they had shut off the water to repair a pipe, so there was also no way to clean myself). 

Anyway, now I’m having mixed feelings. Am I the a-hole? I feel like it really wouldn’t have been a big deal for them to come fix the fire alarms, but it also felt like a huge (and illegal) violation of my privacy. They also threatened me to give me a violation/fine for this",0.2

I told her ok, my normal price is 150€. But I will do 100€ for her since she is my friend. Deal made.

After couple of days she asks me if we could do 70€ because she saw somewhere that market price is around 60-80€ and she is a bit short on money at the moment. I said 70€ and dinner, no need to be fancy, just some dinner. She said 70€ and starbucks, fine, because she is my friend.

So I started the process, she confirmed sketches and I finish the drawing. Couple of revisions and thats it. Now she is complaining that she likes it but its not as detailed as some of my other drawings and she wanted that. There are details in the drawing, but not these super fancy effects and super details because she is paying me 70€. I explained her that I gave her a friendsprice, she lowered it two times.

"AITA for kicking my mother out of the house that she paid for? I (26F) am an only child and my mother (68F) always wanted many children. My mother thinks family is everything. You always have to be there for them and children should make their parents proud. She tells me I am the only thing that determines whether people respect her or not. She tells me that I need to get married to a good man and give her grandchildren so that she can be happy. She critiques the way I look and gets mad at me when I don’t want to talk to my family. I am a very introverted person due to being bullied in school. I don’t like texting or calling people and I find it very difficult to keep a sustainable friendship. As my family lives far away and I don’t share the same values and interests as them I tend to keep to myself.I just know that I don’t fit in so I avoid the confrontation.

My mom does not respect boundaries. She would walk into my room without knocking, come into the bathroom when I’m there and would go through my stuff and move it when cleaning my room, which I have told her many times not to do. I understand she wants to take care of me but I feel like I am old enough to have my privacy and my own space. 

After a year of moving back home after uni I decided to look for my own place and was looking for an apartment close to work. My mom wanted to pitch in to buy a house. I first declined, then she insisted and told me I wasn’t leaving her house if I did that. So we looked for a small house. I found one and I had saved enough money to buy it. My mom insisted on me using the money that was in an account that was opened at my birth. It had my birthday money and my inheritence from my dad. It was in her name but she made me believe that I was entitled to that money so I agreed. Using that money I only needed a small loan that I could easily pay off in 10 years. So I bought it and my name is the only one on the deed.

She has a spare key and uses it whenever she wants. I come home from work and see the dishes have been done and the bed has been made. I called her to tell her that she shouldn’t do that. I told her I didn’t feel comfortable with it. She ignored it and kept going when I was at work. One day she threw away stuff I still needed. I called her saying she should not touch my stuff and should respect my boundaries. She got upset and told me I was being ungrateful.

No she is mad at me because I didn’t message the family a happy new year. I told her I did message some family. She then called another one and shoved the phone in my face so I could talk to them. I panicked, pushed the phone away and told her to leave my house. I then cried for some time. I called her to ask if she got home safely. She yelled that I have disgraced her and called me ungrateful. I told her she didn’t respect my boundaries and I didn’t want to get yelled at in my own house.

"AITA for asking my stepmother to leave my mother's family's Christmas celebration? My parents divorced when I was a teen; my beloved mother passed away 10 years ago and my father (Joe, M/70s) remarried about 20 years ago to Lisa (F, late 60s). I'm an only child (42F). My relationship with Lisa's rocky - not for typical stepkid stuff, but she stirs up issues, is outright mean at times, confrontational, etc. I've spent my adult life trying to preserve the peace and kept most of this under wraps from Joe as I didn't want to add gas to the fire. 

After a few years and more issues with Lisa, we addressed it with Joe and he agreed that it was problematic. Her behavior is well-known and discussed amongst her four children, their friend circle and extended family, so it's no secret and we've witnessed it fracture their relationships over time. 

Examples: Lisa got caught by a friend turning a framed photo of my mother and I displayed in memorandum at our wedding facedown (more than once, so not an accident), ""losing"" the keys to my mom's car that we needed to sell upon her passing, repeatedly introducing herself to people at our wedding shower as my mother (deceased less than a year prior), insults to me, husband, inlaws, you name it. 

While my mom's side of the family's has always gathered on Christmas day, I've hosted them at my home the past few years - we're not super close, but it's the one day out of 365 we spend together and it's a nice way to remember my mom while preserving the relationships with family on her side. 

In the past few years, Joe's attended my mom's family Christmas as he was their family as well for the 20+ years they were married. While there was a bit of bad blood in the divorce, the family has let go of animosity toward Joe. They are *not* a fan of Lisa - mom despised Lisa and they're aware of the issues Lisa's caused.

Christmas: Joe messaged my husband and asked if Lisa could come to my mom's family's celebration at our home. 

My husband (43M) politely said that it wouldn't be well received if she attended. Joe said ""that's disappointing."" We moved forward with the typical Christmas plan; nothing else was said about her coming. 

Welp, Lisa shows up on Christmas day, right in the middle of the gathering. She let herself in, walked up to my husband and said ""I'm here to make my presence known."" My husband looked at her (wordless), then she asked ""Am I welcome here?"" He simply said ""no."" She turned around and left. 

Joe is throwing a FIT. Called my husband and berated him over ""denying her entry,"" criticized his character, shamed him...you name it, it's been said via phone, text, and now emails. He is demanding we apologize to Lisa, said we're holding grudges, we've embarrassed the family...I could go on and on.

"AITA for wanting to give back an iPad because it's not the one I want? Around 1-2 months ago my father was traveling and when he came back, he had brought back an iPad that he had bought for me overseas. For context, I am starting an extremely rigorous academic course and currently have the iPad 9th Gen and have been using it for the past few years for assignments and schoolwork and have really hated it. It's extremely slow, battery drains and takes forever to charge, and a couple of other technical issues I experienced ever since I first bought it made me really dislike the way it works and decided to upgrade to the 10th Gen.

As I am currently a student, I don't make big purchases if at all unless I really have to so if I do want to buy something, I'll spend months researching and trying to find the best possible fit for me; a long process which I enjoy as well. I had gotten a job and told my family that I was saving up to buy myself this iPad - I was extremely excited and the prospect of making a big purchase like this on my own from my own money meant a lot to me. I didn't touch a single dollar of any paycheck just so I could get it as soon as possible for myself. I had been vocal about how I felt this would be a huge step in independence, not having to rely on my parents as much.

I do acknowledge that I am extremely fortunate to have a problem like this and am incredibly appreciative. I had also been very vocal about my excitement and how good it would be to have an upgraded 10th Gen to be able to handle and process all the documents and files I need for school, as there is a lot that I found the 9th Gen absolutely could not handle, even within the first few months of getting it a few years ago. Something that was valuable to me was the act of saving the money, picking up more shifts and working towards a monetary goal that would serve as beneficial to me, it gave me something to feel motivated by. I know that if I use this iPad it would work just as the one I currently have and with Apple slowing down older models, the 9th Gen doesn't seem like as good as a long-term option as the 10th Gen does and I would end up buying it in a few months anyway.

I know I should accept the gift and use it, but it would seem like a waste at the end of the day when it inevitably stops working as well given the digital load I currently have and will have following starting the course. Ideally, I would like to give the iPad back to my father so he can use it as he would use it recreationally or gift it to someone else as I have left it completely untouched and unopened.

So, AITA for wanting to give back an iPad because it's not the right one or should I just keep it? Also if you have any advice, that would be greatly appreciated!

EDIT: I've tried selling it and still have the listing up much less than it's retail price but got no inquiries for it in the past 1-2 months. If I sold it and bought the original with the money, my father would notice as he is quite techy and picked it out himself, but unsure why he got a duplicate.",0.25
"AITA for not helping my wife get ready in the Morning? I'm currently out of work so I stay home with our 4 year son during the day while wife works. My wife needs to be at work at 8am, but lately, she will wake up at 645, sit in bed for 10 or 15 and watch TikTok videos or scroll Facebook, then go and shower, do her hair, makeup, and get dressed.

Meanwhile I get up, get out son fed and let the dog out to pee (and because she's a runner, she can somehow get out of our fenced in yard) and get the dog fed.

This morning my wife comes down and gets made that her coffee isn't made, her lunch is not made and packed, her work stuff isn't together and brought out to the car, and her car isn't warmed up.

I told her that it's not my job to get her shit together and she can either wake up earlier in the morning or make her lunch and get her stuff ready  the night before.

She told me that wasn't the point, the point would is that as her partner, I should be assisting her to get to work on time and now she is going to be late. I told her if she didn't sit in bed watching TikTok or Facebook, she would be on time.

She called me an asshole. So, am I?",0.33
AITA for wanting my dad to get rid off the couch that was giving to him after my grandmother died For context my grandmother pass away two years ago and and my father was given her house and everything in it. And the only issue i have with it is the couch. Manly for the fact that grandma dead body lady on it and I'm 80% sure she die on it. My father said she died on the floor but I nor him was here when it happen. But after her death he laid her on it. I can't get the picture of my dead grandma on the couch out of my head. I've brought it up to him that he should get a new one. But he said it's a perfectly find couch and it would be pointless. And he said she didn't actually died on it and its a nice couch. I'm tempted to go ahead and buy him a nicer couch. It's just creeps me out.,0.96

"AITA for leaving my friend's house early and then saying something that hurt her? I Kate (29 f) have been frnds with Amy (29 f) since we were 12. We luckily became neighbors during the pandemic during which she even had a baby who my husband and I LOVE! Unfortunately, they had to move cities due to their job. Amy asked me if I could fly with them(their company paid for it) and help them get settled in their new home. I didn't mind at all since my work is remote anyway.  
The weekend I was flying, my husband & I found a home we loved in another city as well. We spoke to the realtor and were still thinking through our next steps. While I was at Amy's new home(since Sunday), I was working during the day and tried to help whenever I could with unboxing, with the baby etc. My husband and I were also talking about the house we had virtually toured. I hadn't booked my return tickets yet but on Wednesday, I decided to fly back home on Friday as my husband and I finally decided to drive to the new city to look at the home. (FYI I kept my friend updated about this the whole time)  
On Thursday, my company announced potential layoffs which terrified me (cos my husband was laid off the year before during covid and we had to manage on one salary for about a year) While venting about to my frnd - one of the things she said was - ""you have money, why are you worried?"" which threw me off. I then spoke to my husband who was able to get my anxiety down. I could feel myself spiraling and decided to leave that evening itself. My frnd and her husband were taken aback but I told them I didn't want to burden them with my anxiety and needed to be with my husband to calm down and figure out if we even should buy a home right now.  
Once I was home, My frnd accused me of not wanting to spend time with them or celebrate their new home and I just wanted to get away from them, which I was surprised to hear. I told her I might have been distracted with things going on my end but by no means was I feeling that way(the timing was just bad and I had my own shit to deal with). I asked her why I would agree to come for a week if I didn't want to be with them, to which she said - ""you didn't have to come. You could have said no"". which just escalated things for me. She said she wasn't able to connect with me the whole week.  
Now here is where I might be the asshole. Amy had been short-tempered and edgy with a mutual frnd, Val (29 f), cos of which Val(who is an absolute sweetheart) had decided to cut her off. Knowing Val's side of the story + how Amy was talking to me, I texted Amy - ""if you aren't feeling connected with most of your frnds, maybe you should take a step back and think about what is going on"". which hurt her a lot and she blocked me everywhere.  
In that moment, I intended to make Amy reflect on how she was treating her frnds who really care about her but I can't help but feel like an asshole for saying that to her or even leaving their place earlier than planned.",0.15
"AITA: Backing Out of Being a Bridesmaid Hello! My good friend is getting married in November (yay!) and she asked me to be a bridesmaid. I’m a single mom, and one of my daughters (will be 12 at the time of the wedding) is going to be the flower girl (also yay!). It was planned that my youngest daughter (will be 7 at the time of the wedding) would sit with her grandparents (family friends of my friend). Now, the bride is telling me that she has to uninvite my youngest because she “has too many people on the guest list and needs to take some off.” 

I understand it’s her wedding her choice, but I don’t have anyone else around that would be able to watch my daughter while my oldest child and I, along with the grandparents, go to the wedding. I’m considering backing out of being a bridesmaid for this reason. I know my friend won’t take it very well, and I don’t want to feel like I’m giving her an ultimatum, but I just can’t make it work if no one else is available to watch my youngest - who is also very excited to go to the wedding after my friend invited her personally.

It just so happens that most of the time when my time of the month comes around, I happen to be on kitchen duty and he is on trash duty. lately, he’s been refusing to take out the trash when I’m on my time of the month because a “grosses him out” when I asked him to elaborate, he gave me a story about a guy coming up to me in public and giving me the creeps I told him that that probably wasn’t the best example because I would be in danger and he’s not  he refused to talk to me after that and went to his room.

The main problem I’m having with this is now three weeks out of the month I’m on the trash and two weeks out of the month. I’m on the kitchen.

"AITA for ruining my cousins wedding? Hey folks, this happened not too long ago and there's a lot of emotion around it. (all names changed) im 22, my cousin Carly got married to her husband Kyle and only family was invited to the wedding, including my Great Uncle Frank, Frank for short. Just to give an idea of who Frank is, he was a hippy when being a hippy was new and weed was demonic. I always loved Frank, when it came to hanging out he and I just always clicked. And I honestly trusted him, he was incredibly important to me. 

Here's where the problem comes in, the venue for the wedding was a large house in the mountains and we had all come down a day early to help prepare. (We live in Colorado) but with the amount of people at the wedding two people would have to stay in a guest house; Frank and I were paired together and we didn't mind, we planned on watching Columbo and going to bed early. But the thing with Frank has always been that he does not take no for an answer. So, he offered this special ""Strawberry blend"" of weed. For context im a total lightweight, and Frank has been a stoner since the 60s. I said no, he kept asking. 

After awhile I was feeling a bit worn down and honestly wanted him to stop asking more than anything, so sure, I'll do it. He gave me this little metal thing that looked like one of those cigarette lighters in old cars, and said it made it even better. We watched Columbo, and I nursed it for awhile before passing out on the couch. The next few hours were hell, it felt like I was dreaming and I barely remember most of it. But I woke up covered in vomit and an EMT asking if I knew where I was, I passed out, and woke up at home. The weed was laced, and everyone was angry for obvious reasons. My side of the family was mad at Frank for not checking what was in the stuff, the other side of the family was mad that we were smoking the night before the wedding. 

Arguments were had, my dad said as long as Frank was there he wouldn't be. And my cousin ended up crying before her wedding because of the arguments caused by me not standing my ground and saying no. None of us have spoken to each other, Frank never said anything to me after that, and the entire family is ripped in half now because of my mistake. It's eating away at me and I don't know how to even start fixing things. But part of me is mad that someone I thought I could trust gave me anything that had such an extreme effect.

"WIBTA for disinviting my dad from walking me down the aisle at my wedding I’m not disinviting him from coming to my wedding. I (27F) just don’t want him to walk me down the aisle anymore. 

Since I got engaged my dad has shown absolutely no enthusiasm. He did congratulate me and my fiancé (28M) over the phone once but that was it. My mom on the other hand has been over the moon about everything. 

She is insisting on paying for a big chunk of our wedding. When my dad found out he told her that anything over 10K would come from her own savings. She was completely fine with this and still insists that she wants to contribute. To give context I am their only child and they are doing exceedingly well financially. However if they change their minds my fiancé and I would be ok scaling back our wedding. 

Every time I talk to my dad about my wedding he turns the topic to something else. Every time I talk to my mom about it she gushes about floral arrangements or something else she’s excited over. 

My fiancé and I decided to throw ourselves an engagement party this summer. I told my dad about it and he said he wasn’t sure if he would be able to make it because he may be on vacation. I told him that nothing was set in stone and that I can pick a date that is convenient for him. 

So some context before I elaborate. My parents have a friend with a house in Hawaii that asks them to house sit for a few weeks every year. It’s all done pretty last minute but my dad is retired so it’s not an issue and my mom had family there so she was always happy to go. Well this past fall they spent 4 months there because my mothers family there past away. She has expressed that she no ok her has a reason to return. 

So anyways my dad told me that he couldn’t commit to any date because he may have to dash off to Hawaii last minute. (He hasn’t even be asked yet) I asked if he was serious and he said yes. I told him how important his presence was to me and he eventually relented and said he would go but I wasn’t even trying to see his side of things. Then he made me promise to not tell my mom about our conversation because she would be mad at him. He kept repeating that he was just trying his best…..idk what that means honestly. I told him I wouldn’t tell my mom and I intend to keep my word since I made a promise. 

However now I am left feeling that he could not care less about my wedding and all the events that come with it. I don’t want someone who feels that way to walk me down the aisle. I want to ask my mom to walk me down the aisle instead. She has been supportive from the start. I know it’s non traditional but that is not what is giving me pause. I don’t want to start a fight for them. If I do think I know if will deeply hurt my dad and if I explain my choice I know it will start an argument. Probably a really big one too. 

I get that my wedding isn’t the most important event in the world but it’s the most important event for me. I don’t want to feel anything but happy walking down the aisle. Would I be the Asshole for disinviting my dad from walking me down?",0.31
"AITA for asking my boyfriend to take his daughter to his mother's on weekends? I (30) had my (36) bf move in a year and a half ago when his previous living arrangement fell through. He had nowhere else to go. He has a daughter (10). The kid is pretty great, but not so much her mother. I had a home gym room that I changed into a bedroom so the child could have her own space when she came over on weekends. I should mention that I pay about 90% of the bills. He supplies groceries and I cover the other expenses. The kids mother is very unstable and has had an issue with me from day one, for the last almost 4 years we've been together. It got so bad that I installed security cameras in the common areas of my home because of false accusations. One time the kids dinner took too long to cook and I was accused of letting her go hungry. That is a very serious accusation so I installed a security camera in my kitchen. Long story short, every weekend it is some kind of new drama. Using her child as a pawn, showing up late for pickup and even threatening me for asking her not to call us vulgar names in front of the child anymore. Many times I've missed events due to watching the child while her father was at work and her mother being late for pick up. New Year's Eve was the last straw when we were an hour and a half late for a pre planned date. My boyfriend and his ex argued on the deck for quite some time while I waited inside. The following weekend, the child gave me attitude and refused to speak to me for whatever reason. Which is fine. But she also does not listen to her father. She jumps around the living room furniture and I mean jumps; I am seriously concerned for her safety. In addition, I work 40 hours a week and have a severe autoimmune condition that everyone is aware of. I ask simply for them to be quiet until I wake up on weekends. This has never once happened. I never intend to sleep past 9am but they cannot even accomodate that. I am woken up every single time. I cannot use my living room during the weekends. Not to work out or watch something, even for a short period of time. Despite the child having her own room. She will have an entire tantrum if I request to use the television for even an hour to watch one episode. I am at my wits end with this situation. I pay all of the bills except groceries, and I am limited in my own home. My boyfriend refuses to correct the child and let's her get away with whatever she wants because her mother is too disciplinary. I have recently asked if for the next few weekends, they can go to his mother's. His mother is very much on board. My boyfriend not so much. He feels it is wrong. But I need a break from this stressful chaos. I just need even ONE day of rest.",0.34
"AITA Telling my roommate her boyfriend can't visit her I am a freshman in college and got randomly assigned with my roommate. In the first semester her long distance boyfriend, who is 4 years older then us, came to visit twice. Once when I was away for the weekend and once during a break when I went home. Both times he stayed a day longer then I was away. The first time this happened I slept in my own bed sharing a room with them. The second time my roommate asked if I could give them alone time and I slept on my friends floor.

Recently she asked if I would be traveling this month and I said no. She informed me that she was hoping for her boyfriend to come visit and stay in our dorm room for 3 nights as hotels are expensive. I told her that I did't feel comfortable sharing a room with them for 3 days and didn't want to sleep on my friends floor again. She said that her friend has an air mattress I could borrow and I told her I didn't want sleep on a random persons air mattress nor did I want to impose on my friend and her roommates room for 3 days especially as she wanted him to come during a time when I have exams and need my room to study. I asked her if it would be possible for her to wait till spring break to see him or to visit him as he has his own apartment rather then him come here. She said she really wanted him to come here. And I repeated that I didn't want him to come. She then left the room.

When she returned it looked like she had cried and she told me that it makes her very sad when she can't see him for a long time and that I'm not letting her see him and that if my long distance bf came to visit she would gladly sleep in someone else's room. I said that wasn't the point and that if he really wanted to come he could find a cheap hotel. ",0.1
"AITA for telling my best friend she shouldn't date her boyfriend? In 2020, during the pandemic, I (22f) met and formed a really close online friendship with “Melody” (21). She became my best friend, and our friendship was like sisterhood. I cannot emphasize how much this girl means to me. Melody is a black woman. This is important.  


Earlier that year, I encountered “Blake” (30) on DOTA 2, introduced by mutual friends. Blake's attitude was AWFUL. He would have outbursts of anger during games, spewing every possible slur you could think of. I distanced myself from him but remained in mutual Discord servers. When I met Blake, he had been married to a woman named “Avery”. In early 2023, they were divorced.  


I ended up blocking Blake because he was always toxic, no matter when or where. The final straw for me was when I was painting on stream for my friends and he started making fun of my painting in the call we were all in. After I blocked him, he relentlessly tried to contact me, going as far as getting my phone number.  


In September, he messaged Melody through Steam. I’m assuming he did this because she had left a number of comments on my profile, so it was obvious we were good friends. She told me what he said to her, and I briefly explained who he was and I recommended that she just block him. Instead of blocking him, she continued to talk to him. The next month, she dropped the news that she had developed a crush on him. I begged her to reconsider, suggesting that maybe she just enjoyed the attention he had been giving her? She thanked me for my concerns and we didn’t talk about it again.  


Two months later she sent me a picture of them wearing matching outfits in person. My emotions were going fucking wild. I called her and told her this was a boundary I just couldn’t overlook. I told her I would always love her but I couldn't be friends anymore. However, I would ALWAYS be there if she was in serious trouble or danger.  


A couple of days later, I learned from a mutual friend that Melody was actually on a road trip with Blake. He had flown her out to California, where he lives, and they planned to drive back to New York, where she lives. I had no idea if she was safe. All I knew was she was on a road trip somewhere in the country with this guy. I called her, just to make sure she was safe, but Blake heard me and began berating me as psychotic and insisting she was fine. The exchange escalated, with both Blake and I yelling. I know this was wrong for me to do. I also told her she shouldn't be dating him.   


A day later, she sent a text airing grievances she had about me. Most of it was about how she was dreading telling me they were dating because she knew I’d have a problem with it, but why wouldn’t I? I don’t believe he is a safe person for her to be pursuing a relationship with, even though she’s insisted he’s changed. The thing is, I don’t think he’s changed. I think he’s putting up a mask to get her to trust him, but she doesn’t see it that way. AITA for telling her she shouldn’t date her boyfriend?

"AITA for asking my wife to be more hygienic? Need the help of this sub today to help me decide if I'm the asshole.

I clear out the trash every few days from our trash can in the bathroom. My wife uses pads for her period and very often does not dispose of them properly so when she's on her period I often have to pick up used, open pads from the trashcan. 

I brought it up to her a couple of times before and she said she'd be more careful. But when I brought it up again today she said I'm being ridiculous and a man-child. She says it's normal and it's okay to sometimes forget and I need to be more mature and understanding about it. She said I'm being an asshole and pretty sexist and wouldn't understand unless I'm a woman.

I said this is a hygiene issue and nothing to do with her being a woman or anything. She's refused to address it time and again and honestly if she doesn't want to dispose of them well, she can fish them out of the trashcan.

"AITAH for the bad communication with my MIL? My MIL was planning on playing with my daughter (4) today. She had texted yesterday mentioning that she planned on their play date and that she would also like to plan a play date with my son(1.5) for next week and asked if Wednesday or Thursday worked. I read the text quickly yesterday and responded that either would work great for us, and I accidentally missed the part of the text where she asked what time my daughter could go over there today. So, I realized my mistake this morning so my daughter and I tried calling and FaceTiming her to get their play date set up. We called twice, once leaving a voice message, and then my daughter tried FaceTiming 4 times. Then she FaceTimed my FIL who isn’t feeling well and was still in bed when we called at 10:30, and I asked him to let his wife know we called and to give us a call back. Hours passed and she finally texted us on a group message with my husband and FIL at 1:50 and asked what time my daughter could come over. I was doing snack and nap time for my son so didn’t reply for 20 minutes. No response. So I texted again 30 minutes later. No response. My husband texted me (he’s at work) and asked if I’d heard from them and I said no so he even texted to the group asking them to respond and not leave us hanging. All day, btw, my daughter was asking where her grandma was and when she could go to her house. All I could say was idk they must be super busy. Finally my FIL texts an explanation that they’d been working around the house and shoveling snow and hadn’t had their phones. My husband and I practically simultaneously texted back that that is fine, but some communication would be nice and to let us know all that. Well, my MIL showed up to get my daughter at 3:20 and the first thing she said, clearly put out and upset, was “You never texted me a time last night” and I said sorry but I did call you 4 times this morning and left a message with your husband and on your voicemail. She said well I didn’t get a text from you and he just told me you were trying to get ahold of me, so I texted you and never heard back. I said sorry for not getting back to you for 20 minutes but I was doing nap time and all that and then I didn’t hear from you. She said she was working with the window guys this morning. And then listening to an audio book and never got any notifications. Well, I did plenty to try to communicate. This actually happens all the time and we’ve told them we need communication so my daughter isn’t just anxiously waiting and so we’re all not just twittling our thumbs waiting on them.

"AITA for insisting me and my boyfriend should stay together after stillbirth? Me (F29) and my boyfriend (M37) lets call him Jack, havent been together too long but so far havent had any fights or big issues. 
We are also in LDR

In summer I got pregnant, I freaked out so much, he was calm and reliable 

After long discussions we decide to keep it and raise it together even if it would mean raising the children inbetween two countries 

So far he was really supportive, Jack had two previous kids from his ex wife (they are 10 years old), they reacted good to news about me and his relationship and about new pregnancy as well (they have shared custody with his ex wife) 

Jack was truly happy, I was scared but also excited 

In december while he was in work trip I had stillbirth. It was truly devastating but there was nothing they could do. 

At first they thought its because I caught virus previously and was sick but turned out it wasnt the reason and despite all the tests they coudnt find whats wrong 

I told Jack and he coudnt be there with me but at first he told its absolutely bad news and he insisted what was the reason why they died, I said they only have assumptions due to the virus but physically they cant find anything, most reasonable case is that they think their hearts just stopped (we were expecting twins) 

I multiple times asked Jack how he feels, what is on his mind and he was focusing only on babies. 
Jack also all the time only used - HIS babies, not our 

When I said to him I am devastated he ignored me and kept focusing on the fact that he needs to find why his girls (they were girls) died and thats the only thing we need to focus 

He also mentioned that maybe we should meet up for a closure but lately changed his mind and said we need to focus on memorial and reason why they died and also bury them 

I said to him that I genuinely think it would be easier to go through this if we would stick together meanwhile I also do respect we need our alone time 

He never asked me how I felt, how was time in hospital, etc 

He constantly insists on the fact that he needs memorial for HIS babies and also autopsy results 

He also mentioned he thinks its my fault for not taking my sickness previously earlier and not taking medication (I felt fine and doctor said I should just rest without specific medication), he disagreed and said everyone can google you need medication for that since it can harm fetuses 

He also said comment about blaming me since I should have know better how to avoid this (I am doctor, but this doesnt mean I can predict miscarriages or problems during pregnancy) 

I also said to Jack that I feel extremely alone and want to see him, he ignored me 

It seems like since I am not pregnant anymore he has zero interest to ever see me again

"WIBTA For Setting Limits On How Much Time My Roommate's Boyfriend Can Come Over? I (30M, straight) have lived with my roommate (30M, gay) for about seven or eight years now. We spent our early-mid 20s in a cool alternative lifestyle commune type-of-deal with a bunch of other people, but as we got older we both got sucked back into the real world, and now we rent an apartment together. Having lived together as long as we have, you'd think we'd be pretty good friends, and in some ways we are. However, whenever he is in a relationship, he completely abandons his friendships and stops helping with the shared responsibilities of the apartment. We're about to move and sign a new 12-year lease. We live in SoCal. Our 2br rent is a little over $3,000/mo before utilities, split halfway. I want to set some limits on how much time his boyfriend is allowed to be over, and I'm curious if I'm being reasonable or an asshole.

The current boyfriend (27M) and I do not get along at all. We don't speak when he's here, and I typically end up hiding in my room or trying to find something to do outside of the apartment when he comes over. The two of them make messes they don't clean in the kitchen, and when the boyfriend is over, my roommate doesn't help with our dogs (he has one and I have one, and they have to be walked a lot since we don't have an outside area for them to go to the bathroom). My roommate also never helps with the cleaning of the common areas of the apartment - a separate, but related issue - but whenever his boyfriend is coming over he cleans and vacuums his room. Even the upcoming move: we have been on month-to-month terms at our place for over two years, because I've been desperate to move, but he refuses to make any time to help look for places, or even fill out applications for places I find. When we're in the middle of something and his boyfriend calls, he will let his boyfriend know what we're doing and ask if he can call him back, and his boyfriend *always* says no, he won't be available later, and insists my roommate stop what he's doing and talk to him on the phone.

Obviously, the bf and I have some issues, which I'm happy to elaborate on further, but this is already tl;dr. To play devil's advocate: the boyfriend is not out of the closet to his parents, and he still lives at home. They have nowhere else to hang out, so of course they're going to want to spend a lot of time at our place. My roommate would likely contend that they do, in fact, sometimes take the dogs to the dog park, and that they spend the majority of their time in his room. I'll admit, I'm not sure what standing I have over who can hang out in his room. I don't believe that his boyfriend is at all dangerous, we just don't get along and he monopolizes my roommate's time.

I am also not the perfect roommate - I definitely have my own issues that my roommate puts up with, and he never complains. With all that said, **would I be the asshole if I told my roommate I don't want his boyfriend over more than one weeknight / week, and one day per every other weekend?**",0.14
"WIBTA for refusing to cover bills for my roommate who’s gone to basic training? I’ve lived with my current roommates for almost two years now. I decided to move in with them when my last relationship was ending since I’d get a good deal on rent and it would be split 3 ways. They’re a couple that recently got married last summer and have been together for over 4 years. We used to be great friends when we first moved in but our friendship has greatly declined over the years to the point now where we barely talk unless it’s regarding house things. Around the end of December, one of them told me they’d need me and their spouse to split all the bills for January and February since they’re going away to Army basic training for two months and won’t get paid until February most likely. I didn’t really know how to handle this news and just told them we could work something out.

Fast forward to now, end of January, they’ve been gone at Basic for two weeks now and their spouse expects me to start pitching in to cover half of the bills, since it’s only us two living here. I told them that I’ll pitch in what I can but that I can’t financially afford that. We split things like WiFi, utilities, electric, and storage three ways for a reason. My roommate that isn’t going to the Army also has things like savings pockets and excess funds where as I live paycheck to paycheck and barely have savings. 

 I want to tell them that because they’re married, they should figure out their share of bills between the two of them. However, because we used to be close friends, I still really care about them and want to help where I can. But this just feels like they’re taking advantage of my kindness and this is just not feasible for me. Would I be the asshole if I tell them to figure it out on their own? 

TLDR: one of my roommates went to basic training for the army and now their spouse expects me to cover half the bills, instead of a third.",0.07
"AITA for not moving me seat? Last weekend my friend and I went to a concert. We scored box seats. We got there early and we were told the 2 rows of very cushioned seats were technically row 1-4 and we were welcome to sit where we wanted. (No seat numbers ANYWHERE) Since we were the first ones there and got there about and hour before the show started we sat in the front row at the railing. A little later 4 guys show up and sit behind us. Opening act comes on amd a little after it starts this older man comes and tries to tell us we are in his seats that he has 5 tickets for row 1 like we were suppose to move because he said so. He proceeds to pull his tickets up on his phone to show us each one. We politely inform him we were told we could sit where we wanted so we did. Mind you 2 of the 5 people in his party were not at their seats yet. We didn't want to move and didn't feel we should have to so we didn't. The rest of his party finally showed up and one of them moved to the row behind us. No big deal, no complaints from that person.  He was actually really nice. Grumpy old man next to me sat with his arms crossed and kept looking at his watch and kept pulling up his tickets like he was going to try and complain the WHOLE concert. He looked like he was so mad he didn't even enjoy the show. He also sat so close to me he was practically on my lap.  My friend and i however enjoyed ourselves and didn't let him spoil our fun. Were we wrong in not moving after being told by staff sit where you want?",0.4
"AITA for asking my best friend to attend my baby shower even though someone she hates is coming? I (29f) have been pondering about this for months now and I am unsure how to feel about this. Not sure if I should end my friendship with her or just be cordial. We've been friends for over a decade now.  Gina (28f) is a kind and loyal friend. We don't fight or have issues up until now. She never attends any of my friend-gatherings. She only hangs out with me alone.

Many years ago, I asked her if I ever host important events, if she would attend. She said definitely yes.

I never hosted anything big for myself, not even my wedding (we decided to elope). So I wanted to host a baby shower. After inviting Gina, she said no to coming because she doesn't want to see this other friend, Lydia (28f) AND she has anxiety in big crowds.

Over a decade ago, Lydia told Gina that they cannot be friends anymore and Gina has been very sensitive about it and said that Lydia bullied her. I understand it wasn't nice but what Lydia said was straightforward about her issues and of course nobody's wants to be called out. Quite frankly, it didn't seem like bullying. These are just two friends who didn't get along anymore.

Lydia is well aware that Gina is coming but she didn't care. Lydia helped out so much at the shower so I was thankful she attend.

I also want to say that this baby shower is REALLY important to me. Maybe to some people, it's just a shower but this is a big milestone for us.

We had friends at the shower that didn't get along but they all attended.

I later asked Gina to reconsider because she's my best friend and I explained how I don't want to have events for my son and tell excuses that Auntie Gina can't come. She also said maybe in the future she will get better with anxiety and her situation with Lydia that she will come to my son's events. So I said why don't you start with this event? 
I don't think she will change. I felt like she wanted me to uninvite Lydia so she could come but I also felt like she would've use her social anxiety as an excuse as well if I told her Lydia isn't coming anymore. I just find it bizarre that she loves her sales job but has anxiety with people?  In the end, I couldn't tell if she just didn't want to attend MAINLY because of Lydia or because all of our highschool friends were there. Regardless, she couldn't put her feelings aside. I even offered her to just come for a bit even if it's an hour. As long as she came to celebrate!  I was trying so hard that I was hormonally depressed about this shower. Like I wasn't excited anymore. She didn't help AT ALL for this shower and I avoided talking about the planning.

Eventually she agreed to come.

I realize that these years, I've only been a convenient friend to her. Like I don't ask much from her and when I do ask for anything I feel like I'm a bother.

So AITA for asking my best friend to attend my baby shower and put her feelings aside for me?",0.89
"AITA for telling my employee that he can't change the schedule however he feels? Using a throwaway account. For context, im a manager, so when I make a schedule, it's meant to be that way. 

On Saturday, an assistant manager that I had scheduled asked if he could call in his friend and go home because he ""wanted to go see his wife."" I told him no, his friend isn't needed today and that if he wanted the day off, he should have requested off. He wasn't sick or anything like that, he just didn't want to be at work. 

Lo and behold, 40 some minutes later, his friend shows up and he says hes going home. I tell him, no you aren't, i had you scheduled today for a reason and that the other employee needs to go home. He clocks out and leaves anyways. At around 8 pm, we get our dinner rush and it's terrible. This employee that he called in can't be left alone for longer than 5-10 minutes without messing stuff up, and I'm trying to help him and do my own tasks at the same time. Literally, im not exaggerating there's no place that he could both be useful and left alone. He's still in training, so there's a reason I only have him scheduled on days where he has essentially a glorified babysitter. So when the rush is finally over, i call the Assistant Manager from before up, and tell him that i'm writing him up for insubordination. He tells me that his friend needed more hours, and that I can shove it and he quit. He said that he was going to HR to complain about me and that he quits effective immediately. Then, his friend quit because he was only here because his friend was here.

Should I feel guilty for not ordering her something too? It wasn't like it was for dinner and she was home with me. She was at work.

"AITA for considering a move without my partner? My partner (28) and I (25) did long distance for a year (we’ve been together a total of 2.5 years). For that year, they were living at home, and searching for jobs to come move to the city I was in (I’ll call it Beautiful City, I loved it). My partner didn’t land any offers— they are good at what they do, but we learned that it’s difficult to get jobs in their field without a masters degree. 

Flash forward, we both get into the same university for Masters programs! Finally, long distance will be over. We had 4 months between the offer and the start of the job. We talked about how they could get a service job so that they could move closer for those 4 months. However, we both knew they wouldn’t be very happy doing service jobs. They also made the good point that they hadn’t spent quality time with their family in a long time, and this was potentially the last time that two of their best childhood friends would also be living in their hometown. So, we came to the conclusion that they should take advantage of and enjoy the quality time with their friends and family. I was totally understanding and happy with the choice, though I was sad that we’d have 4 more months of distance. 

So, now we’ve both moved to the new city (we’ll call it Tough City) While I am so happy to no longer be long-distance with my partner, I am incredibly depressed and uncomfortable in Tough City. It’s been really taking a toll on my mental health.

Part of me wants to move back to Beatiful
City. It’s an hour away, so the commute would suck, but doable. But, if I moved there, I’d live an hour from my partner. I would still regularly come up to Tough city, but my homebase would be beautiful city.

When I told my partner I was considering this, they said that it is completely unfair to them, especially after how much effort they put into moving to the same city back when we were long distance (they applied to dozens of jobs, though decided to stay home for the last 4 months). When I brought up that they also once made the difficult choice to remain living in a different city to take advantage of quality time with family and friends (a choice I supported)  they said they didn’t think it was fair for me to say that situation was similar. 

I love my partner, and would much rather be in the same city as them, but given the circumstances, I think it’s fair for me to consider moving back to a place that I know I love that is still commutable. They KNOW full well how tough I find Tough City and validate my feelings about it, but they think I’m not valuing our relationship enough by saying that I would consider moving. 

Note on why they wouldn’t move with me — my partner and I agree that While ideally they would move to beautiful city with me, it is really expensive, so the chances of them also finding an incredible deal, and being able to move down with me, are extremely low (it’s a long shot even just for me, too).",0.35
"AITA for not going to my Aunts wedding? Hey I’m 24 and my aunt is 34 we lowkey have a sisterly relationship. My aunt got engaged 2 years ago and I also got engaged last June. I started making plans for my wedding right away and she recently had just started. About a year ago she asked me to be a bridesmaid and I of course agreed. She always discussed of having a destination wedding, however after my engagement (June 2023) she started saying 2024 or 2025. Our family figured it would be in 2025 since we all would need time to prepare. We had conversations about her wedding being in Mexico but she never picked a date so I figured we’ll have enough time to save for it. Well a few weeks ago she announced she’s getting married August 14th in Mexico this year. I explained not only am I paying for school but I’m also moving out the state at the end of August so it’s really bad timing and impossible for me to go. She became upset and said if the roles were switched she would make something work to be there. She implied that she would do anything as far as getting a credit card if she needed to. I’m also not the only person that can’t go. She feels like 8 months is enough time since the family knew she was having a wedding. However till this day she hasn’t paid for a venue or sent a quote to the family so we can see how much things are. She told me she’s going to be matching peoples energy and they shouldn’t be shocked when she starts not being there for others. She said she knew this was going to happen. I feel like she wanted this to happen because why would you wait till less than a year to prepare for a destination wedding? I explained to her everyone doesn’t live the lifestyle she does! Are the family and I being unreasonable? I hate that she feels the way she does but I feel like she needed to prepare us in advance and she just picked her date this year and we still don’t know the PRICE!

"AITA for wanting to report a classmate for plagiarism? I (F 19) have been taking a creative writing class for a few weeks now. In these weeks I’ve noticed the same student plagiarize from some websites online. I first noticed this because her grammar and sentences were suddenly a lot more coherent, and didn’t have the spelling errors she would make (uncapitalized I’s). I mean no offense to her writing, but it was obvious from the differences it wasn’t her own writing. I copied and pasted one of her sentences into google and immediately found the website she stole it from.

I decided not to report it after discussing this with my mom, I assumed the teacher would notice since it was so obvious. 

This didn’t happen.

Fast forward to today and I caught her AGAIN. Once again I copied and pasted a sentence into google and found the website she stole it from.

"AITA for turning off the iPad my ex bought to call our child anytime? I'm (40f) not seeking validation. I'm genuinely conflicted and this feels complicated to me. Wondering if it's very simple to others.

My ex-husband (37m) Frank bought our child (6) Pat an iPad for Christmas. He checked with me first to see if I was OK with this (*kinda*—it was a bit rushed, but he did). I had concerns about screen addiction in general, but we agreed we'd keep an eye on it/would work together on it/etc. 

Fast forward to when Pat returns home from Christmas with dad. We're laughing and joking as usual while I cook dinner, when I overhear another voice—Pat's dad! Frank had FaceTimed Pat on the iPad. This felt invasive to me, but I didn't want ro disturb my child's fun, so I just made a mental note. 

That next weekend when Pat's at Frank's house, Frank texts to try Facetiming with Pat. I text back, ""Is it an emergency? It's not a good time."" In reality I was lounging on the couch nude, and didn't particularly feel like putting on clothes to Facetime. He said no, but texted an hour later to see if *now* is a good time. I figured they're just excited about the iPad, so I put on clothes and obliged.

The next Sat, Pat and I were hanging with my Parents—big grandparent fun—when I get a text from Frank [and I looked this up just now so it's word-for-word]: ""Hey [iCodeSwitch], Happy New Year, Is Pat not allowed tablet time? Like when do you cut it off or what did you set screen time to? I've been trying to Facetime Pat all week"" 

Pat has no set time—we just hadn't been using the iPad. I texted Frank back that I didn't know he was trying to call. And to let me know next time and I'll get the iPad out. 

My question: WIBTA for turning the iPad off in my home unless requested (and letting Frank know)? I'm uncomfortable with the idea that a 6 y/o should have open access to calls at any time, for multiple reasons—but I also find it extremely invasive for my ex to expect to Facetime anytime—w/my home and life in the background—without coordinating with me first. 

I'm torn, because I don't think my ex has ulterior motives—he just wants more access to talk to Pat day-to-day. But twice over the weekend Frank Facetimed Pat without my knowledge while I was having sensitive conversations in the background. And while I don't chill nude around Pat, I certainly relax my styling and how much I have on (braless, toothless, wigless—you name it*) more than I would in public, and something about him Facetiming with no notice just annoys tf out of me!! 

We are generally pretty competent and mature coparents who get along and put our son first, but this just feels like a bridge too far for me—AITA!???

"WIBTA if I asked my fiancé to stop giving his grown son extra money? My fiancé and I have been together almost 3 years, just engaged last month. He has 2 grown children and I also have 2 grown children. We are both divorcees who swore we would never get married again, but here we are years post divorce and engaged. 

My issue is, my fiancée gives his grown son approximately $1,000 a month, I know this after a recent conversation we had with some friends when he just casually brought it up when we were talking about extra money we could be spending on certain things but instead are spending it on XYZ.. 

for instance, I was spending my extra money on a trip that he and I had talked about going on and then he didn’t have the money to go so I went with a friend, and he said he was fine with it. I was very upset that he was not going to be able to go, and I even offered to pay for his part and he refused. Well, during the conversation with the friends I learned he didn’t have the extra money because of this grown child, 25 years old with a college education and a career that pays good! I was baffled. I knew he would give him money occasionally for whatever but $1,000 “approximately” every month is a little outrageous in my opinion. Especially when it interferes with things that we are or were going to be doing together and now can not. 

I honestly do not even know what to say to this or how to respond, is our time together not worth turning down your kid for some spending money? He doesn’t even “need” the money, it’s money he spends on gas, eating out, and hanging out with his friends and GF!. AND is it to much for the man to get his passport?! I’ve begged and went out of the country on trips by myself that he was supposed to go with me on, even said he was going to get his passport but 2 years later has yet to do so, because he does not have a desire to travel internationally..

      I am getting married to an amazing man later this year. While deciding who to invite he threw out his friend Jack and his fiancée Jill. My fiancé, Henry, owns a company with Jack and they have been close friends for many years. He even lived with Jack and Jill for three years when they first moved to a new state to start their company. Henry was Jack’s best man at his wedding. Needless to say they are very close.
       Here is where my issue arises I CANNOT STAND Jill. I have known her for 5 years and have had little to no positive interactions with her. She has said very classist things to me, covertly racist things, is very condescending and generally makes me miserable to be around her. At best I dislike her at worst she makes my blood boil. 
        Two years into our relationship, Henry was given a plus one for Jack and Jill’s wedding and he asked me to go with him. I declined as it seemed not right of me to attend a wedding of someone I disliked. I didn’t know anyone else at the wedding, it was on a weekday, and I was a 5 hour drive from where I lived at the time.
       Our wedding is going to be very small (no more than 50 people) and we decided against having bridesmaids and groomsmen. Henry still thinks it is best to invite her because it would not make sense for Jack to go alone. I don’t want to invite her because of all of my experiences with her and given that it is a small wedding it is inevitable that we will interact.

"AITA for telling my Husband our son was gay? I (32F) caught my son (15M) cuddling with his friend (15M) while they were sleeping in their room. I decided not to wake them up and I discussed it with my husband (34M) and the possibility that our son might be gay came up. While I initially agreed with my husband's suggestion to approach our son when his friend leave, I late decided that we should just wait until our son was comfortable sharing this with us. My husband agrued saying what if he never tell us that he's gay. I told my husband that if he doesn't tell us that he's gay then he's probably not. I told him  that we should just let our son know that we'll love him regardless and leave it at that.

However, my husband went against our agreement and questioned our son about his sexual orientation while I was driving my son's friend home. When I returned home, I discovered my son in TEARS, yelling and accusing me of outing him. I was confused and told my son that I didn't know what he was talking about.

My son told me while he was crying that his father revealed what I saw and basically coerced him into coming out before he was ready. My son asked me why I would I tell his father and why would I enter his room with out his permission. I started crying and told my son that I was sorry and that I loved him and accept him no matter what. My son remained distant and now refusing to speak to me and his father.

When I confronted my husband I told him that I was angry that he threw me under the bus.

Despite his pleas for forgiveness, I can't help but feel anger towards him knowing my son is now feeling hatred for me of something that I actively tried to prevent.

My husband argues that blaming him for our son's emotions is unfair, and told me our son is only going through an emotional phase that will pass.

I've met a lot of new parents through my other job and have been getting a lot of babysitting jobs with them. There is a talk I have with new parents that basically says ""since you've hired me to watch your kids, you should trust me.

If you feel the need to hover, it means you don't trust me and if you don't trust me I should not be working with your kids"".

Was only on my phone to take/send pictures of the kids and for music for the kids) will not be accepted.

"AITA for throwing out clothes that could have been given to the needy? I (15 f) am still in high school. I’m the only one in my family that goes to this school currently as all of my older siblings and cousins either go to different schools or have dropped out completely. A long time ago, my cousin (15 f) gave me a bunch of her clothes to sort through and decide if I wanted any of it, and I didn’t. A lot of the clothes I was given were old school uniforms that were only out of date for a few years. Recently, my school switched from an ugly white shirt that didn’t stay white for long, to the sports shirts that were more popular either. There were also navy blue shirts in the same fabric as the white ones but only a few people actually wear them. 

These clothes that my cousin gave to me literally just sat in my room either on my floor or on my desk for a solid 6 or 7 months. I didn’t want them and neither did anyone else but whenever I brought up what we should do with them to my mum she would just disregard and said to just keep them in my room. I had no space for them in my room so I just shoved them into a box and they sat there for another month before one day I got angry at everything and threw them out since the last time I asked her she told me if I didn’t want them to just throw them out so that’s what I did.

Today I felt guilty about it though. It’s been a few weeks since my hissy fit, (it wasn’t about the clothes they were just collateral damage) and my mum came knocked on my door like she always does, I told her she couldn’t come in since I was getting dressed and she asked me about the old school clothes and I informed her that I had thrown them out with all of my cousins other old clothes and she responded with “of course you did”. That wasn’t exactly something that was out of the ordinary since that’s how my mum often responds to things like that. After a few moments of silence she asked me why I would throw them out and tells me about this Facebook group she’s in that was looking for hand me down clothes to people that need them and wanted to donate. I responded with “they had just been sitting on my floor and in that box for months, we weren’t doing anything with them then.” She didn’t say anything and just walked away. I could tell she was disappointed in me.

I do feel bad for those kids that aren’t going to be able to get school uniforms because I threw out clothes they could have used but I also feel like my mum could have taken care of the clothes since her room is bigger and more spacious instead of making me keep them all that time and doing nothing with them.

"AITA for telling my sister she's a jerk for what she said to our bio dad and making our younger bro agree with her?

Infact he was more active in our lives than when our mom was SAHM for a short amount of time. our bio dad is chill and fun to be around and lowkey easy to talk too but yea he has his rules as a parent would. Our stepdad is fun as well but he's WAY more strict but only on certain things. Lately me and my siblings have refused to spend any time with our dad everytime he would ask but would jump at the chance our stepdad would bring us to something that was only a little fun.

I apologized a lot in the Conversation and my younger bro stayed quiet, but my sister said some cruel things I'd rather not say.

"AITA for answering the call from my older sister in annoyance? I’m 23 (F), sister is 26. 

TLDR; Went to the supermarket yesterday. Left the house without telling anyone but few minutes later my sister call informing me that dad wanted a fruit. Then another few minutes later when I’ve already arrived at the supermarket she called again and wanted to say that mom wanted a drink. The connection at the supermarket is usually bad and I’d have to leave to be able to have a proper uninterrupted phone call. Somehow I got annoyed and answered my sis with an irritated “Hello?!” but I never shouted or anything. Then she said “Why are you angry at me?! Mom wants iced tea” before ending the call abruptly just as I was asking where from. So I texted her and she told me to ask mom myself and to not talk to her. So I replied explaining why I answered the way I did and she hasn’t talked to me until now. Not even this morning when I asked her if she was going to shower first because our alarms were ringing at the same time. 

This isn’t the first time she’s done something like this. Basically she thinks if I seem annoyed in the way I answer it means I’m annoyed or mad at her but wtf sometimes she accuses me of this when I’m going through something personally on my own. In general, she’s “the sensitive (and loud) one” whereas I’m “the quiet one” in the family. She’d always say that she’s the emotional one but so am. Only difference is that she’ll always tell our other family members, even relatives when they come over (probably an attempt to embarrass me, idk) and then I’d be dealing with it on my own. I’m always swallowing my feelings because I’m the youngest one and have always been left out (we have an older brother that she’s close to ever since I could remember). 

Also, I am about 70% confident she’ll do something passive aggressive like she’s done before, in the next few days if she continues not talking to me. (Example: One time she vacuumed under our bed but only her half lol. Or another time she messed up my side of the table or some other petty shit). Also ever since I was little, there was a hierarchy established by my parents because “she’s your older sister you must be nice”. So if I’m mad at something I can’t show it?

Kind of have more to say about our relationship but unrelated to yesterday’s story.

"AITA for teaching my son to respect women while at the beach      This is a throw away account 

     For starters I (38f) am a mother of two children, one 7 year old girl and another a 14 year old boy.

     We recently went on a vacation to the beach. We were setting up our towels and chairs when I noticed my son trying to hide and erection. I immediately grabbed him by the wrist and took him back to the car and drove back the hotel (I left my daughter with my husband). The entire ride back I lectured him about how disgusting his actions were and that he should be ashamed of himself. He tried to apologize but I wasn't having it, he needed to face punishment for his actions.

So I took his laptop and the remote for the hotel tv and restricted him from going to the beach for the rest of the vacation. I then went back to the beach leaving my son at the hotel (it was only 15 minutes away.) 

My husband asked what happened so I explained what our son did and the punishment I gave him and he got really mad at me and called me an asshole because ""he cant control that kind of thing"" and I ""made this decision without him"" before he left me with our daughter to get our son and bring him back to the beach and I got mad at him and yelled at him when he got back saying he was undermining my authority as the mother and was letting our son get away for such a horrible and dicussting thing.

"AITA for asking for the book I wrote handwritten poetry in for my ex, back? I don't know how big this post is going to be, but I'll keep it short. In June 2023, Me(21M) and D(21F) were in a relationship. It was going pretty well, and we were like most 21-year-old, sappy idiots in love. Back when we were together, I'd written some of my poetry in a small notebook and given it to her, as soon after that our relationship would become a long-distance relationship, with her moving to New York and me being in Vancouver.  


It was supposed to be this kind of memento that she took along with herself to New York, something to remember me by while we were in different countries. And on the rare occasions that we would meet (during vacations or other occasions), I would update the book with new poetry I'd written while she was away, and she would update it with art she'd made. (She's an artist.)

&#x200B;

Long story short, it never got to that point. She would break up with me out of the blue in July 2023, saying that she just didn't feel the same way about me anymore. I couldn't save it even though I tried. I was visibly upset about this, as this came out of nowhere. It was surprising to me because I had received an ""I love you"" upfront about a week before the breakup, and she'd even made art of me about 2 weeks before she said she wanted to breakup with me.  


I don't want to speculate on what went wrong within the 2 weeks between her finding our relationship worthwhile enough to make custom art of me and wanting to breakup- as pontification about whether it was mental illness or I got cheated on is pretty pointless in my opinion. Regardless, when we broke up, I got very upset and asked for the aforementioned book back.  


I said I'd give her art that she'd made of me back to her too. I thought it was pretty pointless to have this memento with the both of us, since it wouldn't have the opportunity to be updated anymore after the breakup. The art also had a short note at the back of it she'd written about ""how we'd last forever"" which was bothering me a lot.  


I thought I would probably get rid of our memories eventually one way or another, and I thought I was more comfortable getting rid of my own art( my written poetry) rather than something she'd spent hours making, so I asked to trade stuff we'd made for each other.  


Am I the Asshole?

According to him, he needs ""minimum 45 minutes"" of bathroom use in the morning. I can manage in 20 minutes. We both have 8am classes. So he says, I should be done with the bathroom by 7:15 am since I ""already wake up early"". 

I told him that he can wake up early if he needs that long in the bathroom, and I'm not going to be ready 45 minutes before class, since I don't even *need to* use the bathroom that early. He says that I can't be the one to decide when he will wake up. Also, on many days, even if I am done by 7:15, he just continues to sleep through his ""slot"" and proceeds to not go to class anyway so the bathroom is just there, unoccupied. Even then he says, I must be done and the bathroom must be empty at 7:15 onwards regardless of whether he uses it or not as it is his ""slot"".

I have told him that I cannot shit that early but he says ""idc but you must be done by 7:15"". He says, I cannot be the one to decide when he wakes up, not how long he takes in the bathroom.

"AITA for telling my family my brother should not have planned his wedding before mine without asking me? AITA for wanting to mention to my family that I’m upset that my brother planned his wedding ahead of mine?

AITA for considering telling my family I’m upset about my little brother booking his wedding before mine?

I (F32) and my partner (M31) have been together for 5 years and have been engaged for 4 months. We’ve begun planning our wedding and we’re really looking forward to it. Recently my brother (M30) had been shopping for an engagement ring to propose to his girlfriend (F30) with. She’s his first proper girlfriend and I was really excited for him to get to enjoy getting engaged and planning his wedding too. They’ve been dating for a year. She’s very Christian and as such is holding out until the wedding night. 

Almost the day after he bought the ring his girlfriend hit me up asking a million questions about my wedding, including what the date for it was. I thought something must be up and that her best friend, who knew about the ring, must have told her and ruined the surprise. 

The next day my brother called me to tell me that they are getting married, he gave me the date and it was way before my wedding. I said I was surprised as he had not proposed yet, and he said she had told him she just could not wait any longer and that they had to plan and book their wedding now. I was pretty shocked at the time so just said congratulations.

After the initial shock I was also upset that no one in my family had said anything about not taking my wedding into consideration. If he’d asked and said can I go first it’s not the best look I obviously would have said yes of course go first, it’s just the general disregard for my feelings. Accompanied with her shadily going behind his back to find out everything about my wedding. 

My brother is generally oblivious about social cues and so is my Mum so it makes sense that neither of them has considered that it’s normal to just plan ahead of me without mentioning it at all. My Dad is aware of how clueless they are so has either considered it and does not want to upset them by calling it out, or also just doesn’t get it. Back in the day my parents were very Christian and got married when they were teenagers so they would also not be concerned about a rushed wedding. 

I know that weddings are not a race and it’s not a competition. I just feel that I’m being forced to be the bigger person here and wish my feelings had been considered the tiniest bit. 

Would I be the arsehole if I were to say something to my family? Nothing wild, just something along the lines of I’m happy for my brother but I’m upset that none of you have stopped to think about how this makes me feel. I probably wouldn’t even say it directly to my brother, I genuinely want him to be happy.",0.8
"AITA for telling MIL she overstepped? MIL watched my 20 month old tonight and she had to put him to sleep. She asked if she could give him a blanket and we told her no.

He has never slept with one before and I didn’t want him with one for the first time overnight because I can’t keep an eye on him. 

I told her that she overstepped by doing something I said no to. She argued with me saying it’s too cold for him to sleep without one and she just wanted to do what was best. I told her as the Mom, I know what’s best and that if he’s dressed warmly he’s fine without a blanket. She basically disagreed and said it was unfair that I’m making it seem like she’s done something with ill intent when all she wanted was for him to be comfortable.

"AITA for wanting to work on a school project with my ex even though we've been best friends for 7 years First things first, background context. I, (17 F) have known Star (17 F) since early 6th grade. We had been each others first friends in middle school and have been one anothers closest friends since. We know pretty much everything about each other, secrets and all, and have always been each other's first choice when needing a shoulder to lean on.

In Sophomore year, the two of us had begun dating, but eventually, we decided to split off around July before Senior year (2023). We had a very loving and respected relationship throughout our time together, but in the end, Star felt that she wanted more experiences as we were each other's first serious relationship. The breakup ended on a good note with no hard feelings between one another, and we continued on living our silly teenage high school lives.

In September, Star showed interest in a guy named Spot, eventually dating in October. At first me and our friend group were supportive and happy for her, but over the past months he has proven to be toxic and manipulative towards Star. No matter how many times we have assured Star that she deserves better, she continues to date Spot.

Me and Star havent shared a single class since 6th grade, but this year of high school though, we finally were able to have Gov/Econ with each other. When I found out, I eagerly expressed how happy I was to finally have a class with Star and be able to work on projects with her. Along with her and I, Spot also shared the class with us, often pairing up into a group to work together. At the time, I didn't mind at all, even if Star was my ex, I saw the situation as a chance to get to know Spot and become friends. That feeling diminished after learning about his toxic behavior, but I still acted friendly towards him in order to keep the peace.

Today, I had asked Star if we could be partners for the next duo project within our class, but she quickly answered no. When I asked why she explained how it would be ""really screwed up in all seriousness if I chose to partner up with my ex instead of my current partner."" Immediately I was hit with a wave of despair. Yes, we did date for two years at the start of high school, but we have also been each other's closest friends for seven collective years. When I had brought this up, she only reinforced the fact that Spot and her believed us being exes made the situation wrong and that it would be horrible for us to be partners. The entire conversation was crushing, I really thought that our friendship had meant more in the end than our past relationship, especially when we have been entirely chill with one another since our breakup. No matter how much I tried to reason she still wouldnt budge, saying how I had a lack of understanding for how Spot felt and that I needed to be more empathetic towards his feelings. I understand how much she loves him and that romantic relationships are important, but in the end I still feel that our friendship should overshadow being exes in this situation.",0.18

"AITA if I kept a cat that isn’t mine? pardon my english

today I fucked up by finding my cats ”real” owner. I wonder if I’m the asshole if I keep her. 

I keep my home open to shelter homeless cats. this july I got a call about a starved and dirty cat that was found in a locked up parking lot. this same cat had been spotted 10 miles from there a couple of weeks before, so she had been on quite a journey. 

when she first came to me she was scared to death but I loved her from first sight. 
She was an easily frightened and startled cat. I sat with her when feeding her because if I made ANY sound, she’d run under my bed and hide. If I had a visitor- she’d hide. If anything was loud - she’d hide. She was a silent and scared cat.

It’s been 7 months now. The first 3 months I kept updated on sites that looked for lost cats to find her real owner. After 3 months I stopped. I was occuppied with loving her and making sure she was happy. 

She isn’t a scared cat anymore. She speaks with me CONSTANTLY. I’m overjoyed she found her voice. She is a diva that demands attention from the second I’m home until I leave for work the following day(I’m saying this with love). This christmas we even went on a train to visit my dad, and she curled up in my lap to watch the views(without a leach, and didn’t try to run).

What I’m trying to say by this is that she isn’t scared of strangers anymore. She used to run and hide when the doorbell rang. Now she runs towards it, looking forward to meeting new people and getting their attention. She’s a completely different cat. I love her more than anything else in the world, and I think she loves me too. She gives me kisses everytime I come home from work. She’s the light of my life and I do everything to make her happy, and I think and hope that she is. 

Yesterday, idk why,, I decided to check the website for missing cats again, and saw her. They had put out a post 5 months after she went missing, and one month after I stopped checking that same website. She has traveled over 30 miles in total, her original home is in the same region as mine but two cities over. They describe her as a shy and scared cat, something that I experienced the first months of her staying with me but she is completely changed now. Such a outgoing, curious and talkative little lady, that loves treats. I’ve taught her to sit and to do a twirl even. She’s the smartest cat I’ve ever met and my love and dedication to her goes to the moon and further. 

I know it’s wrong to keep her. Morally and by priciple . But I wonder if she was brought to her full potential at her last home, since they describe her as scared and startled, something she’s stopped being with me. It sounds so selfish, and it is selfish of me to want to keep her. She is  two years old and has spent 7 months with me. She’s my baby, my darling and my kid. I sound crazy, sorry. I really don’t know what to do. I love her more than anything. But I know I’m in the wrong probably.

"AITA for telling my new co-worker to 'stop bitching, bitch' So I (28F) and my co-worker (21F, let's call her Amanda) work in a restaurant as waiters. I've been working here for 2 years-ish and Amanda for a month. Since I'm one of the more experienced waiters in this restaurant, I have been given the task of training new hires.

Ever since this girl, Amanda who is the restaurant manager's daughter, came here to work she has complained about everything. And I mean EVERYTHING. She seems to only do the bare minimum mean while all the other waiters (12 people) have to work extra hard to cover for her laziness. While we others are working, she literally just swipes on Tinder, scrolls on TikTok and gossips with the chefs.

One day I hear from one my chef friends that Amanda 'hates my entirely personality and how I look'?. Like I get it, I'm a waiter and don't make too much money and can't spend a ton of money into nice clothes, but I think that's just over the top. She also complained that I 'try too way much for a measly $15/hour"".

Hearing her speak very bad things of me and all the other waiters was the tipping point for me. I went to confront her about these things she has said and we got into a pretty nasty argument.

I yelled her to ""Stop bitching, bitch"". 

""All you do is sit in a corner complaining everything we (the waiters) do. Do you even understand how much extra work we have to do in order to cover for you!"".

At that point I had to leave to serve a customer. Later that day I hear that Amanda left work early crying. That ended up with me getting yelled for 20 minutes by the manager (Amanda's father).

Me and Ellie were never really close, we made some occasional conversations when I hung out with the group and sometimes I would sit with her during lessons.

The next day when I went to uni Ellie approached me and said that what I wrote in the gc was insulting to her since she called herself a “religious person”. As I said before, me and her were never really close but what I KNEW about her was that she never goes to church, she parties and drinks a lot and hooks up with a lot of guys, which is absolutley fine, but isn’t really “religious and christian” from her. So I told Ellie that I didn’t know that was so important to her, and that I didn’t understand why she was coming at me like that since other people wrote that word multiple times in the gc. She straight up told me “Well it was the guys that wrote that more frequently, it’s normal for them, but I thought that you knew better as a girl”. This really irritated me and I told her if she didn’t like to see a girl curse she could leave the gc. She got extremely angry and told me that she would start to write the n-word and f-word (she is white and straight of course) since those words “triggered me so much” because for her “there was no difference between a blasphemy and a slur”. This is where I might be the AH because I straight up answered her “There is a difference because black people and gay people exist, while god doesn’t”. She was furious for that and demanded the other uni friends to kick me out from the gc but they refused so she abandoned the group instead.

He seemed really really keen on her, and she was absolutely smitten with him. She came back from their trip, so happy and said everything was perfect.A few weeks later, after things continued to go really well, he just stopped texting her and she hasn't heard from him in maybe two weeks. my sister has an undiagnosed form of autism where it is difficult for her to understand emotion and behaviour when things aren't explicit. so she won't pick up on tone or little hints. She cannot understand why everything went from being so nice to him being completely silent.She also has a condition that impact her digestive system, which can flare up with stress and anxiety. Hence why we are here! She has been thinking and talking about him non-stop and just cannot understand why this has happened to the point where she is making herself unwell despite knowing what she's doing is making her unwell. her stomach has been giving her a lot of problems, and it's also caused inflammation in her eyes which she has had to go to the emergency room because she's in so much pain.It doesn't matter how many times you tell her that the more she thinks about it the more it will impact her health because she just can't think about anything else. She gave me his phone number when they went away in case of emergency. So today I decided to send him a message to ask that if he is no longer interested in her, could he please let her know. I said she doesn't know I am getting in touch and I would appreciate if he kept it that way. He hasn't responded, and as far as I can tell he hasn't read the message, but I feel so worried that I've done the wrong thing.

"AITA for not including my husband in friend activities? this is the very short version. my partner and i have been together for 6 years, we used to have a lot of mutual friends and hang out all the time together but about 4 years ago i had a baby and we stopped going to events together etc. since our daughter is a bit older now ive found im able to have more free time and experiment with new hobbies. last year i tried LARP (live action role playing) for the first time and adored it but my husband thinks its cringe - im okay with that though! we don't need to have all the same hobbies and we have other things in common. 

we also had a HUGE amount of problems in our relationship last year that i won't go into detail with and actually separated multiple times. during this time i would get a lot of support from my friends in the LARP group. of course though they have a very negative image of him from what i had said, i told them about the worst of our arguments looking for support and i understand now why this was a mistake. during this time he would also speak badly about my friends and their attachment to larping. this also adds to the problem that if they were to hang out i would feel like my friends were being judged and criticised even if this wasn't expressed out loud. 

i still did try to explain to them that the last year we both weren't ourselves, we were going through really traumatic stuff, and both of us were incredibly emotionally unregulated and regret the way we both behaved and were trying to get back together. 

because of this though, they don't want him at events or get togethers. for example, there's a game night happening weekly with my friends and i asked if they would be comfortable with him being there and they said right now they wouldn't be comfortable but maybe in the future it would be okay. he expects me to tell my friends that we are a package deal, and if they aren't friends of the marriage then aren't friends of mine. he thinks that it shouldn't matter if they are uncomfortable with him there if we want to be together. 

my worry is that this leaves me feeling quite isolated although i can't help but feel like my partner also has a point that getting back together would be difficult if my friends all have the opinion of him that they do.",0.65
"AITA for demanding my sister to buy me expensive markers? (Excuse my English if i make any mistakes it is not my first language)

I (20f) Demanded that my sister (16f) buy me expensive watercolour markers. 
My little sister has just started fashion school and asked me if she could borrow my set of watercolour markers. Its a huge set i got for my birthday when i was eighteen. So my sister borrowed them and I made her promise she would be carefull with them.

A few weeks later she gave me my markers back because she got new alcohol markers from our parents. When i went to use the markers the soft tips of more then half of them were destroyed and the rest of them either had different colours on the tips or were completely empty of ink.

And i mean being empty of ink is okay but my markers being completely destroyed is not.

So I asked my sister to buy me new ones and she offered to give me her alchohol markers. However there were fewer colours and i prefer watercolour ones. I thanked her for the offer but explained that i needed more variety in colours and that I preferred water colour.

She gave in and asked for the amazon link. I sent her the exact brand and set that i had had before I don’t know exactly how much it was when i got them but now to buy it new it’s 40 dollars on amazon.

When my sister saw the price she EXPLODED she has an income but 40 dollars is a lot for her (which i do understand). But she started to scream at me and accused me of picking a more expensive set.

I showed her the set she destroyed and that it was the exact same and told her that SHE destroyed it so SHE had to buy it again.

So AITA?",0.04
"AITA for talking over, ignoring and insulting my sister? I (17m) have been hanging out with friends my parents don't like. I've been keeping on doing it, but recently my sister and her husband called me and said if I don't stop wasting my life with them, they'd drive over and take something from me.

I decided I was close enough to adulthood to keep my friends waiting for me, and stopped hanging out with them for now. 

Driving home from school, my car broke down, and I had to spend three hours trying to get it to work. When i got home, my dog was gone. They'd sent her to a farm they've yet to disclose to me.

I said nothing and walked to my room. They stayed for dinner, so I had no choice but to sit at the table with them. They didn't believe that my car broke down, and laughed about my dog.

I talked over my sister, ignored her, and when she raised her voice to get a word in, I said something I'd whipped together in my room.

""Sitting here, I am faced with two options. Either the ghost of a 9 year old girl is screaming into my ear, or the fat, squelching pig that continues to leech of my family and has the gall to call itself a person has decided to open its mouth around me. I don't like either of these options.""

"AITA for the way I reacted when my mom woke me up? Or is my mom? Ok, so for some background. 1, I wake up early everyday because of the dog. My mom and I take turns going out with him in the mornings every other day while the other makes him breakfast. 2. My mom is the type of person who gets quickly agitated, angry, and stressed, not only that but she's kind of an instigator. So, on with the story. My phone was stuck under my pillow and I didn't wake up at 6 like normal, so my mom came to wake me up. She shot the door open and let the dog run in and run around in my room, and I quickly sat up, not even getting enough time to really wake up. 

Now, in the past my mom has gotten mad for people not waking up quick enough, or if I groan while waking up she'll get mad at me, so I made it an automatic reaction to just sit up. My mom then tells my dog ""Bite her in the nose.""
I'm like, ""Really? That's the first thing you say to me? No Hi, no good morning, not even a 'a wake up'? How are you treating me?"" And she gets pissed, does the thing she always does and tells the dog to leave and shuts the door. I rolled my eyes and just got out of bed, got my coat and went to the living room to dress the dog and myself. 
She's getting progressively angrier, telling me to leave and I just tell her to leave herself. She's just slamming everything at this point, the coffee maker, the fridge, the milk, the dog's food container, the dog's bowl, cursing me out, asking ""Was it that serious?!"" And as I'm trying to talk to her, she'd like ""Don't talk to me."" And I can't help but feel like I'm not in the wrong. 
The thing is, if I made a joke like that to her, she would be so pissed and what I'd say is ""Okay sorry, geez"" and move on. Also, the way I wake her up is the complete opposite, I quietly open the door, say ""mom"" or ""wake up"" in a whisper a few times and leave, giving her time to wake up and get out of bed. No shooting her door open with a riled up dog jumping everywhere and telling him to bite her nose while she's already sitting up to try to wake her up. 
Now I'm thinking about doing that to her too. 
It's like she has this notion that just because she's my mom, so she's better than me and she can do dumb crap like this. It doesn't help that she's low-key kinda narcissistic. I mean how do you deal with a person like that? 
And she tries to guilt me by saying ""oh, and look, I have a stress test today at the doctor's, so thanks."" LIKE WHAT?

"AITA For not asking if my partner needed groceries? **Small context:** I (38M, autistic) live with my partner ""Ash"" (44NB) and my SIL ""Darcy"" (40F). My partner has joint custody of their daughter ""Kit"" (10F), and we have her 2 on, 2 off, and every other weekend.

We're in the PNW so we've been snowed/iced in with the nasty winter storm, and we're all going a bit stir crazy- Ash and Darcy work from home, and school's been cancelled. With the schools closed and the roads iced over, Kit's been here all week, and unfortunately, her ADHD meds are at her dad's house. She's been bouncing off the walls, and driving us a bit nuts.

There was a brief window where the roads were drivable, so I mentioned going out to grab a few groceries, but the snow behind our cars was frozen solid, and we couldn't break up the ice, so we dropped the subject.

Now, every time I ever go to the store, I ask if they need anything, because I'm paranoid about being inconsiderate when it comes to getting groceries. Last time I did this, Ash said, almost annoyed: ""If I need something, I'll tell you.""

Not once during our talk did either of them mention that they NEEDED stuff- they weren't even going to go with me. So I ordered a bit of groceries from instacart using my money. It shows up, I put it away, and go to bed. (I have odd sleep hours due to health issues, so I grab sleep when I can.)

A few hours into my sleep, Ash bursts into my room, all but yelling at me ""What the actual fuck. Why didn't you ask, you could have used my card, we're running low on milk and now we can't order anything now because it's an ice rink out there and no one will be driving, and what are we supposed to give Kit???""I'm sleepy and confused as hell, but they just slam my door shut and storm off. 

Meanwhile, I'm freaked out by this, because it's VERY out of character for them. They don't yell, or slam doors normally.

I didn't even REALIZE we were low on milk, because apparently, Darcy bought two half gallons of EGG NOG instead of milk, and now they're all ""We're low on milk"" even though we have plenty of Kit's favorite foods- fish sticks, stuff to make homemade pizza, ham/cheese sandwiches etc. She won't go hungry. Not only that, but Kit actually loves ice water more than any other beverage. She hasn't complained about food or drink, just that ""This snow sucks, I can't play in it.""

Meanwhile, I've actively been hiding in my room to avoid a confrontation because I honestly have no idea why Ash exploded at me. Part of me thinks they're just overwhelmed from everything going on, but I have no idea how to express that I didn't mean to be malicious, selfish or what have you.

My autistic ass didn't hear ""We need this"" so I didn't bother, because the last time I asked, I was told ***not*** to ask...

...so AITA??

"AITA - telling my boyfriend I dont want to live with his parents Me and my bf (both 29) have been together 9 years. Him and his family moved to the UK 11 years ago. We met randomly, hit it off and have been together since. Since then he's become an important part of my family's life and he's been with me through some difficult times. It was rocky at first as he did not tell his parents about us for 6 years.   
I moved in with him and his parents (both early 70s) a year ago. We have been saving just the 2 of us for a deposit. His parents have not got a huge amount of money and whilst they've worked since they moved here they havent thought long term. Neither qualify for a state pension, and once the exchange rate was taken into account with the money they brought over it wasnt a lot. My bf's sibilings (early 40s) seem to have left us with the problem of seeing what the best option is.   
My BF admitted he feels stuck between choosing whats right for us as a couple or supporting his parents. We both want to be married and start a family but feel as we would be having to compromise how we want those things to happen if his parents lived with us. They both are fairly religious and his mother has made comments on the miscarriage we had a couple years ago and the fact i do not go to church.

"AITA for calling my ""friend"" names in front of our friend group because of what she said? I (17f) was having lunch with a couple of my college friends. FOR CONTEXT: We've all only known each other for less than a year still I'm close to pretty much the majority of my friend group of 7 people except there's one girl in particular who I'll call Kim that I'm not particularly close to. We're civil with each other but don't really have much in common. She's always been vocal about how she doesn't believe in god and ghosts and other supernatural stuff like that and I actually share her views.

Now this is where the problem arose. While we were having lunch the topic of deceased relatives was brought up. I told them about an uncle of mine who died during the pandemic in 2021 due to covid. I was really close to my uncle so much so that I considered him my second dad. He was always supportive of me and always bought me everything I ever asked for. I'd call and talk to him almost everyday. So when I lost him, I honestly feel like I lost a piece of myself. I told them that once we were done with the funeral rites for him, my family and I were sitting around when the light in the room went off all of a sudden and I felt something on my head almost like a light touch from someone's hand. It was probably just the wind but I truly did think that was a sort of final farewell from my uncle.   


When I finished, my friends thought it was rather sweet....except for Kim. I didn't even ask her but she said that it was most definitely not my uncle cause no ghost was that sentimental and to grow up. She said it was ""cringe"" and to not make up ""bs sentimental nonsense"". I was honestly just speechless. I just said ""You're such a fucking bitch get tf away from me you pos"" and this just seemed to make her tick. All i remember was her saying something along the lines of how i should be grateful that my uncle wasn't here to see what a pos I was. I think about there must be some underlying hatred because of that outburst but i genuinely have never said or done anything to hurt her.   


Most of my friends are on my side except one who said that what I said hurt her really bad and now she's crying and upset all the time because I insulted her in front of everyone.

"AITAH for wanting to go to midwife appointments. So my (M42) Fiancée (F35) and I would like to have a child together… if we can. I have had a vasectomy (reversal is being booked soon) whilst married to my ex and she has had some medical issues. The odds are already stacked against us but we would like to try. 

She was recently at the hospital on an unrelated manner and mentioned a couple walking to the antenatal center whilst on the phone to me. I thought it sounded nice and said ‘you never know that could be us soon’. She seemed pretty put out by that and said ‘I don’t need you to hold my hand whilst I’m having my blood pressure checked or my urine tested!!’

We have been going back and forth about this subject, we don’t really argue… we talk things through but I just don’t seem to be able to convey that I want to be a part of this. I don’t expect I will want to go to every single meeting with a midwife… but I’d like the option. I want to be supportive for one, and I want the opportunity to ask questions and get to know the midwife etc. I just want to feel connected to the whole process and not just turn up when it’s a scan or whatever.

She has said she wants me there for all of the scans and the important things, everything else she wants to do herself. 

She is fiercely independent, I love that about her. But I want to share in the whole experience and not feel like I am being told when I’m welcome and when I’m not. 

She has been with some manipulative people in her past and I think some of the concern is about me making decisions about her body or the birth… that isn’t me. I have reassured her but I think there are still some walls up. 

It’s all moot as she isn’t pregnant anyway, it just makes me question if having a child is a good idea if I feel like I’ll be on the outside of it and not be an active part of the meetings… even the mundane ones. 

We have both had children before. Our experiences were very different. I was in a stable relationship and would be at almost every visit. She was with a husband who really wasn’t interested and went to none of them. 

AITAH for not wanting permission to go to prenatal appointments (other than the scans etc.)? I guess I’m more put out that I need permission, it’s unlikely I would want to go to them all anyway. I just want the option.

This all comes from a good place. I’m not controlling or coercive, I would certainly have an opinion though if a decision needed to be made, but I totally respect it’s her body and would not make things difficult if we disagreed.",0.3
"WIBTA if I got the address of the guy who scammed me on FB marketplace and reported him to the police? Alrighty so, I purchased a guitar pedal on the FB marketplace, something I've done a few times without any drama or fanfare.

However, its been a few business days since and Bob fully ghosted me.

Bob has other items for sale on their page that aren't music related, there's a part of me that wants to make a new Facebook account, get his address and then send the cops on their ass for scamming me.

"AITA? Because I “stole” a cat? Hey let me give you some context. 
At 5:40pm on Tuesday, Jan 9th, one of my friends texted me, panicking. She asked me to call her, I did so. Over the phone she told me she had found a small kitten on the side of the road in the snow. The kitten looked to be in bad shape, she said she didn’t have the money or space to take care of the cat (she lives in a small camper with two large dogs). 
I told her I would talk to my parents and possibly take off to take the cat in (I’ve taken rescue cases in the past). My parents agreed. At 6pm I took off on a 2 hour journey on super icy, snowy roads with more snow coming down. My 2 hour drive turned into 3. I arrived at my friends place at 8:45pm (not that that makes any real difference). My friend met me out at my car, and handed me the kitten. At first glance I could tell the kitten was super skinny. But looked okay. My friend had told me she had given the kitten a bath (there was no evidence of her giving this kitten a bath, the kitten was FILTHY). 
I hurried home the best I could on the bad roads. I arrived home a little before midnight. After I got everything set up and the kitten settled in, my friend texted me wanted the kitten back. I told her no. (Am I in the wrong here?). I told her the kitten is far too weak to be traveling around, I also told her with her living situation (no offense to her), she would not be able to give the proper care to the kitten. She fought with me on this. But I kept it firm that I’m keeping the kitten so she can receive the proper care. 
Let me add, my (ex) friend, was planning on feeding the kitten straight MILK as food instead of getting her kitten food. Anyways, she finally agreed to have me keep the kitten, I thought that was the end of it. But no, she started back up the next day. Her “fiancée” was apparently crying and wanting the kitten back. I once again said no. I already had a vet appointment set up, and the kitten was extremely happy where she is at. My friend ended up blocking me at the end of it. 
I’m now hearing from mutual friends and other sources that my now ex friend is trying to seek legal action on me ? OVER THE CAT? She apparently has been in contact with a police officer? I’m calling bull on that, due to the fact, if she actually did, wouldn’t I have gotten a call of some sort of contact from a cop? She apparently is trying to take me to court bc I “stole” her cat. She’s now making bold face lies saying she owned the cat before hand and she ran away. 
Which I know is NOT true. She has never owned a cat. She also said that the cops said it’s fine her dogs are unlicensed and unvaccinated?? What kind of cop would say that? (We live in Michigan btw, it’s illegal to have your dog unlicensed). 
But back to the story, The kitten has had her vet appt, she’s completely healthy! Besides extremely frost bitten paws, being super underweight & very dehydrated. But besides that she’s super happy and has a little belly now!

"AITA for not wanting to pay my parents for a car they bought me I (f18) had a car that used to be my moms since I was 16. It was a 2010 and became no longer safe to drive (something was wrong with the axel? I don’t really know). The car was worth less than the amount it would have been to fix it. My parents graciously bought me a new car that I am very thankful for. They were set on this one used car that was a cheaper option and I was okay with that. While we were at the dealership to test drive, they saw a new one that we all really liked that was about $4000 more than they were planning on spending. When we got home I told them I was okay with either and I’m not gonna be picky since they are the ones buying it. They should just do what they think is right. The next week I was told I was getting the cheaper option but they came home with the new car. I was very happy and thankful that I had a car at all since I have to drive an hour everyday for work and I was ubering for the time being. They then told me they bought it in cash and SINCE they got the new car, I should pay them $500 by the end of the summer for it. That’s a bit under what I make in a week but I only work during the summer and a few weeks in the winter since I am a sophomore in college. The car is under my moms name, not mine. I am not sure if/when it will be transferred to mine but I am assuming when I’m done with college. I would be happy to pay any amount for it then since it will actually be mine. I have always paid for my own gas but they pay for my insurance. I If they had told me that the new car would cost me $500 beforehand, I would have made them get the cheaper option. I genuinely would have been fine with any car if it meant I didn’t have to pay and they knew that. I also go to school 8 hours away and as of now there is no point in me having a car on campus so I leave it at home. They also just don’t want me to bring it to school even if I wanted to since it would be a burden on my dad. I feel it is unfair for me to pay for a car when I can really only use it for 5 months out of the year. I wouldn’t mind paying for it when I am able to bring it to school since I will be the primary user. My dad also uses the car sometimes when I am at school since he doesn’t want to put miles on his. I also want to reiterate that my parents did not buy a new car out of the kindness of their hearts. It was obviously very nice of them to lend me a car at all but they got the new one because they want to show off to their friends. I am aware I am very fortunate for getting a car at all but AITA for refusing to pay for the car?

Edit: the car is in my mom’s name for insurance reasons but they will switch it to my name once I’m out of school. They know I am very appreciative of the car but they wanted me to show my grate-fullness by paying. I would have been okay with literally any car that worked as I do not really care for materialistic items. They have always been into a flashy lifestyle and wanted to buy me a version of my previous car so it would look good in the driveway. I told them no since that would be ridiculous and I didn’t want to pay for premium gas. Even if I pay the $500 the car will NOT go in my name.

Another edit: I know it sounds like I am super ungrateful and I am aware $500 for a new car is a great deal. That’s not the point. No one sat me down beforehand saying this is what was going to happen. I went into the whole car process under the impression I wouldn’t have to pay. That was the deal until they brought the NEW new car home. Then they decided I was gonna pay $500. If someone had told me beforehand, I would happily help out. The money is less of the problem than the fact that they sprung this on me without talking to me first. This makes me not want to pay anything. ",0.29

"AITA for wanting my boyfriend to clean? I (27 F) am a nurse and work 12 hour nights- 7p-7a. I often work stretches of 3+ nights in a row. During these stretches, I barely have time to sleep much less do household chores. My boyfriend (28 M: let’s call him James) and I have been living together for almost a year, and been together for 2 . I recently worked a stretch of 3 nights, with one night off, followed by another 4 nights. To say I’m exhausted is an understatement. James works a typically 9-5 office job and has a fair amount of free time in the evenings. I’ll admit I’m not always the cleanest person and often leave clothes everywhere, don’t always do my dishes immediately, and just generally forget to pick things up. When I’m not working a stretch, I try to be a lot more conscious of this and do my best to pick up the house more. When I am working a stretch, however, this all sort of goes out the window- and it’s nothing crazy, just maybe forgetting to put a few things away or leaving dishes in the sink. My issue is that when I come home from work and I’m mentally, physically and emotionally drained- the house is a mess. Everything is exactly how I left it, but with the addition of his dishes in the sink and his stuff laying around. Coming home to a messy house is really stressful to me. I understand that my mess is my own problem, and I’m not expecting him to necessarily clean up after me- just to make a little more of an effort to clean when he knows I’m working a lot. I tried talking to him about it by just mentioning how much I’d appreciate it if he cleaned one day while I was asleep before working another shift. He was fully taken aback and responded with “sure I guess….” Followed by “well you didn’t clean this past week when you weren’t working, so I’m just confused why you expect me to clean.” For the record, I hadn’t cleaned that week, but my childhood pet had passed away at the beginning of the week and I was feeling really down.

"AITA for not replacing my sister‘s expensive bracelets? For context me and my two sisters live in different countries.
My (27f) sister (30f), Christine and I planned a trip to visit our younger sister (26f), Alexandra in the US.

I still live in our hometown and Christine moved to Asia a few years ago. Christine had left her very expensive bracelet in our hometown and asked if I could bring it with me when we go visit Alexandra.

I got to the US before Christine and brought the bracelet with me but Christine ended up missing her flight and decided not to come on the trip.

Fast forward 3 months, Christine asks me for her bracelet. In all honesty, I had completely forgotten about it as it hadn’t been brought up since the trip. 

I looked high and low for it and asked Alexandra if I might have left it in her apartment - she couldn’t find it either.

Christine is understandably upset and wants me to replace the bracelet. My pov is that I was doing her a favour with bringing the bracelet and fulfilled the favor, it was up to her to follow up on it because the bracelet  not my responsibility once it arrived in New York.

It started last fall when she decided to enroll in culinary education classes. One of the instructors, a man in his 40s, had Anna in his office for a one-on-one discussion about some exam, and he apparently reciprocated her flirting. She’d been telling me since the classes started that she found his attractive, and I tried to remind her that he’s her teacher, probably married, and that her last relationship with a man more than twice her age didn’t pan out (she really likes older guys).

She brushed me off, insisting he wasn’t married because he didn’t wear a ring, and that this was all legit because he told her he’d “never even thought of doing something like this before.” I didn’t believe it, I didn’t trust it, but I didn’t want to act like an overbearing mother (she got very upset and defensive any time I tried to point out that this seemed fishy) so I stepped back and let her make her own decisions. Just before winter break, Anna ended up finding out that he IS actually married, that this isn’t his first affair, and it wasn’t even his only affair going on at that time. She has been swinging back and forth between anger and sadness over this whole thing, and I honestly believe she kind of manufactured her misery here. Even under better circumstances, pursuing staffers at your place of education is a bad idea for everyone involved.

When the topic came up between me and another friend, I confided that I thought Anna was naive for going after the guy and believing the most cliche explanation ever (the “I’ve never done this before” thing). I thought I could trust this friend to keep it to theirself, but they told the entire friend group, including Anna. I got mixed reactions. Some friends are berating me, some are on my side, and some think I was right but should’ve kept it to myself. Anna is PISSED and hasn’t spoken to me since it happened, after which she sent me a long paragraph text about what a bad friend I am and then apparently blocked me. While I would have never told Anna to her face, I do still think that she was naive and that I’m not an ahole for feelings that way or for telling someone who ran their mouth. Can I get some outside perspective here?",0.29
"AITA for letting my grandson sleep hungry when he didn’t like the food I made? Hello all. I’m 59, my daughter is 31, she’s been living with me for the past few months as they’ve had some financial trouble. Her husband is 38 and they have 4 children from 5 years old to 9 years old. 

I’m vegetarian so I don’t cook meat in the house, but her youngest is picky and usually doesn’t like my food. My daughter cooks a few meals a week, and she’ll usually make something for the kids if I’m making something they won’t like. Last weekend my daughter said she was going out with her friends and I assumed she would be home by dinner, because she didn’t say anything specifically to me about doing anything for the kids. She wasn’t back by 9 and the kids were hungry, so I called her but she didn’t pick up. Phone probably dead. I’d just made rice and steamed veggies for myself because I wasn’t too hungry or in the mood to cook properly. I offered some for the children and the two older ones ate, the 5 year old was upset though and asked if I could make chicken nuggets for him. We did have chicken and breadcrumbs and I know how they’re made, but I didn’t feel good about cooking meat so I told him he can wait until his mom comes home. He got upset and threw the plate of food down and it broke. I picked up the ceramic pieces but had him help clean the rice, he was upset about that too. My daughter wasn’t back until 11 and the kid went to sleep after a little while. 

My daughter was really upset that I let him sleep hungry, and I said it was one evening and he’s not starving. She said I could just get over myself and make the damn chicken. Then I told her he broke a plate and she got even angrier that I asked him clean like a “maid” when he’s a little kid. I think she coddles him and I told her so, what do you think?",0.33
"AITA for ""not hanging out with my wife"" Quotations because I don't know how else to describe the issue succinctly. 

My (29M) wife (27F) have had a repeat discussion going on for a few months now that I'm going insane over, so I'm seeking some outside opinion. 

My hobby/socializing with many of my friends is playing some games on my PC in the evenings. Many of us live a good distance from each other and work busy jobs, so our only real form of socialization is jumping into discord and chatting while we play some games. 

My wifes in school currently, but if she's not doing homework, she likes to watch TV, color/draw, or play board games/cards/etc. We do this things together pretty much every day. 

Usually when she gets home (I work from home) we go to the gym, make dinner together, and watch TV while we eat together. After we might take showers and then I'll usually go hang out with my friends as described. She always tells me it's fine at the time, and I usually ask, but then a couple days later she'll start making allusions to being lonely and having to hang out with her imaginary friend.

I always tell her that if she wants to watch something with me, all she has to do is walk into my office and tell me so, literally 10 feet from the living room, but she never does. Her excuse for not doing is always something to the effect of ""well you're having fun with your friends and I don't want to bother you"" but then she proceeds to guilt trip me and make me feel like a bad partner for not ignoring my hobby to sit in front of the TV with her. 

I've told her time and time again that I have NO PROBLEMS telling my friends ""hey guys can't play tonight, gonna watch a movie with the wife"" and theyre all in relationships too, total understanding; but she never does this. She just lets me do my thing, I assume she's content doing her thing, and then she makes it a problem 3 or 4 days later. 

I have to assume that the issue is that she perceived me not wanting to watch TV with her every night as some kind of personal attack, that I like my friends more than her, or something to that effect. The reality is that I just don't really like watching TV and I'm 10 feet away, always make it explicitly clear that she is welcome to come pull me away at any time, and I even have a TV in my office that she can play games on or watch TV on if she wants to hang out in the same room, but she refuses to do any of those things.
I've told her that she needs to just communicate if she wants me to not be on my computer, but she basically always just defends not doing it by saying 'I don't want to bother you.'

"AITAH for not giving my mother my password? Hi, I'm 20f and I'm a first year medical student.   I have a students portal and obviously it comes with login details like my student number and password. My mother literally knows everything that happens in my life despite the fact that I'm schooling in a totally different country.  If I'm on a call with her and another call comes in she'll always want me to tell her the person that called and what we talked about.  She calls me every single day and she wants to hear every single thing I did that day. She literally has the phone number of everyone i know. If i accidentally mention someone new shell make me send the number. At first I didn't mind but now I feel like I'm monitored. So the new semester started this week and as usual she asked for all my timetables and class schedules, I reluctantly gave it her but when she asked for my school portal login details I immediately caller her and told her that I didn't want to give it to her. She was furious and demanded for my details.  She said 'I'm investing in you so I have every right to know what's happening in your life'. I asked her why she badly wanted my it and she said that she wants to be checking my portal when ever she feels like, for example she wants to be checking my results (which I always send to her once it's out) and so on. I told her that although I'm not hiding anything from her I would like some privacy, if she ever wants anything relating to my portal I'll screenshot it and send to her. She started crying and saying stuff like I'm hiding something and I want to deceive her like my older brother ( he dropped out of college for years and never told anyone for a long time). Then she cut the call.
This incident happened this morning and it's been bothering me. I feel really bad for what I did and I'm contemplating sending it to her but for once I wanted a little privacy in my life.

"AITA: My wedding and my cousins For context I got engaged March 2023. My cousin proposed to his now fiance in October 2023. I’ve said since about May 2023 that our wedding is the first weekend in June of 2025. When he got engaged his fiancé INSISTED their wedding should be late May 2025….
So when I heard this I got upset rightfully so. I discussed it with my mom and she understood and talked to her sister about it. My grandma and aunt felt the same way, they said I got engaged first so why would I change the date of my wedding. So my aunt talked to her son and his fiance about changing the date. She won’t budge and is still not going to change the date. Since my aunt has a son she thinks she can’t force her to change it since weddings are things women care more about. So now I’m upset cause our weddings are 2 weeks apart. I had the date set way before they got engaged anyway and just think having a wedding that close is going to be so chaotic and not even fun for my family. AITA for being upset and all worked up over this? I haven’t confronted her face to face about it, just my aunt.",0.67
"AITA because I can’t handle people being rude to me on the internet? I have a boyfriend. We’re both gay. He tells me I need to have thicker skin because anytime someone is rude or harassing me online I end up inconsolable and depressed for hours on end, to the point I can’t even function as a person.

I told him it’s not fair that people like us constantly have to face harassment and mean people online when pretty much nobody else has to. Most people online are treated with respect and kindness 24/7 no matter what, it’s only people like us who ever have to face any kind of disrespect either online or in person.

He told me that I’m being ridiculous, that pretty much everyone has to deal with being disrespected in their life, including online, that other groups of people too have to put up with blatant harassment and unkind behavior. I told him that people like us face it the worst, and he told me I shouldn’t try to quantify who has it worst and I should instead be growing thicker skin.

I told him i shouldn’t have to grow thicker skin, other people should just be kinder, he told me that’s not gonna happen. But the fact is nobody else ever has to deal with people being mean to them. Nobody else ever has to grow thick skin. So why should I? Why is it on me to not let people destroy my self worth happiness, and not on other people to just be kinder in the first place? I’m a very fragile person who emotionally breaks  down very easily and there’s absolutely nothing wrong with that. 

Why can’t other people just be kinder? Why does nobody else sympathize with me? Why is it on me to grow thicker skin when others should be better, not me? Especially considering I’m one of the only people who ever has to put up with being disrespected.",0.4
"WIBTA for reminding my friend I dislike dogs? At the start of any friendship, I make it known that I do not like dogs. There is a lot of backstory to it that doesn't matter too much, but the main reason is that barking causes me severe distress as I have very bad sensory issues. 

When I met ""Amy"" two years ago, one of the first things she brought up was having two dogs that she loved. I immediately told her that was cool, however, I don't like dogs and we should probably just hang out outside and I wouldn't come over to hers. Then one day when we meet up (she takes the bus to meet me), she brings one of her dogs. It's a small dog she can fit in her backpack and it never stops barking. I politely tell her that I *cannot* handle the sound of barking as it literally makes my head pound and she does what all dog moms do. 

""He's just a baby."" ""He's literally fine don't worry about it."" ""There's nothing wrong with him barking you'll get over it."" ""It's so cute how he's barking at the other dogs, he's talking to them!""

When she *also* knows that I have severe sensory issues (another one is that I **cannot** be touched and that one can be respected just fine.)

Anyway, this has happened multiple times over the last two years and I've just dealt with it as I love Amy as a friend. I usually just bring earbuds or make sure the dog stays away from me at all times. Except now she keeps talking about moving in together once our leases are up this year and I was into it at first until I remembered she has dogs (object permanence). 

I guess I'm asking for help. How would I even go about reminding her of this? I feel like a b\*tch. 

WIBTA if I told her no, I don't want to move in because of your dogs? ",0.22
"AITA for keep on postponing my joining date for a job 
I am 22(F) college student ,currently in the last semester. I landed a job offer in another state for which I had to start the internship from the starting of January. First time I talked to the HR to postpone my joining date by 2 days as my flight was booked late. Then she reached out again to me about my joining date to confirm it and I informed that due to the bad weather the flights are getting either delayed or canceled so again I'll have to  delay my joining  by 1 day more and she accepted my request.
Now on the same day unfortunately I met with an accident ,fracturing my arm and also having a ligament tear in my leg. I was unconscious for a long time and as soon as I got up, I informed the HR about my situation how everything turned out and even send her the X-Ray pictures and medical report the next day. I asked if my joining date could be delayed further by a week or two and she told me that I am  not responsible and don't even deserve a job offer.
Was I on the wrong here?",0.83
"AITA for not buying my girlfriend flowers? My (33M) girlfriend (28F) have been together for almost 4 years, but only began living together just over a year ago. Before that we were long distance and I used to send her flowers for special occasions and sometimes just because. I often spent a good deal of money on a dozen roses. She was very grateful and would say how when she looked at them it reminded her of me and made her smile. It might be worth noting she never brought me flowers, but that didn't bother me as its a bit of a girly thing (no judgement or whatever, but honestly I could care less about flowers).

Anyway, now to the issue at hand. Since living together I haven't brought her flowers - honestly I hadn't really thought to, because I'm right here in the same flat and so she doesn't need a reminder of me. Well just before Christmas she brought a Christmas flower arrangement, which I figured was just part of decorating for christmas. Early January she threw it out, and in its place appeared another vase of flowers, which I didn't say anything about because she was not working (she's a private school teacher and was off for their Christmas holidays) and I figured she's just bored. But I guess they died and now there's another vase of flowers in its place, and this time it's a dozen roses!

I asked her what was up with the roses, and she said she likes flowers and that as I never buy her them anymore she has decided to get them for herself. I didn't say anything at the time but this has really got to me questioning her. It seems really passive aggressive to go out and buy roses for yourself just to make a point (literally identical to the arrangements I brought for her!). And now every time I walk into the kitchen I am hit with how shitty a boyfriend she thinks I am.

Edit: I appreciate the comments, even though some of them were hard to swallow.   
It seems the jury is split, I’m either an unloving asshole because I've overlooked an obvious hint to gift my girlfriend flowers and make her happy, or I’m a self-absorbed asshole and her purchasing flowers isn't anything to do with me. Either way though, it seems like I’m an asshole. ",0.8
"AITA for not loaning my friend my car? This friend is a close friend. I'm the godfather to his son. He isn't some needy friend that is only around when he needs help. 

To set the stage, I live in the Midwest and we're currently experiencing extremely cold temperatures. I'm in the middle of a month long medical treatment and he is driving me to/from the appointments once a week since I cannot drive afterwards. I make more than 2x the money he does, and there is some jealousy there. This allows me to have a nice car for good weather, and a paid off beater for bad weather. I cannot drive the nice car when there is snow or ice as the tires are performance tires with zero traction on snow/ice. I really shouldn't drive on them under 45⁰F, but I do. There is currently snow and ice on the roads. I work from home, he doesn't. He has a single vehicle, a diesel truck. 

With the current conditions I cannot drive my nice car. Everytime the temps go lower than 0⁰ F, he asks if he can borrow my car saying that his truck isn't reliable in weather that cold and he can't afford to miss work and has no vacation because he's using it take me to my treatmens. I reluctantly agreed to let him borrow my car early this week. This left me without transportation Sunday through Tuesday. This feels awful because that's why I keep the car, to drive _me_ when I can't drive the nicer car. 

He cites that since I have more resources, I can afford being out of transportation whereas he can't, so it makes sense for me to loan him my car. I understand that, but since I pay for the car specifically to drive in these exact situations, it feels off. He asks without even knowing that his vehicle won't start, but knowing 100% that it will leave me without the car I pay insurance and taxes on for my benefit.

Temps are dropping again and he's asking again to borrow my car on the weekend this time, so he can take his kid, my godson, to an extracurricular school activity. Am I an asshole for asking him to find a carpool for his son and get a fuel additive to ungel his fuel before asking to borrow my car and leaving me stranded, again? I can see reasons to say no, and reasons to say yes. I have the car for exactly this situation, bad weather when I can't drive the sports car. If the roads were passable for the nice car, I'd have no qualms loaning him the beater car, and I have on many occasions. Right now it feels like he feels entitled to call dibs on my car because his needs outweigh me not being stranded without a vehicle. I'm just so conflicted here. I told him he can borrow the car from Friday to Saturday morning to take his son to the activity, but that I won't say yes again if it leaves me without transportation.  Does that make me an asshole?",0.44
"AITA for not wanting to pay my mother rent So basically, I (F18) have been debating moving out of my mothers (F58) house since the moment I started paying rent. It's not that I dont love my mom or think that I shouldnt pay her rent but I think its not justified if I do. What I mean by that is that my brother (M20) doesnt pay her rent at all. He used to pay rent after he got out of highschool but got paid a little more than I did. He got paid $16 while I get paid $14. Each pay check my mom took $150 out of his paycheck for rent since he got paid weekly, but since I get paid Biweekly it always seems to be a bigger amount for me since I have to give $300 but at the same time he got paid more than me so the rent is a more significant amount. But anyways, back to why I dont want to pay rent at all or at least a lot less. 

I'm barely at the house, I work 2-11 while I stay at my boyfriends house usually on my off days and after I get off from work. I dont eat anything I dont buy, mostly because on my lunch break I just go out to eat and I dont eat breakfast or lunch at my own house. Nevertheless, my brother, may I remind you again who is 20 years old, has no job and just plays video games all day. He hasnt had a job since he got fired from his old one which has been about a year and a half. My mother babies him and whenever I bring up that he should get a job she shuts me down and tells me that he doesnt have to because hes ashamed of how much he weighs. Yes, my brother is a pretty hefty guy but its not so much where he couldnt work. Ive offered to get him a job where I work but everytime he says ""I dont want to work yet"". So while I'm working 8 hours almost everyday to get money that i wanted to save up for to get a car and now almost half of it is going to rent, my brother gets spoiled by my mother without having to pay rent. She bought him his own car, pays for his food, pays for his gas, is paying $10,000 for a weight loss surgery for him, and so much more while now what he uses for free (plus more) I'm having to pay for my own for which I barely use.

"AITA for scolding my roommate for taking ""his"" Wii? Years ago, when I was in high school, it is possible that my now roommate could have given me his Wii. The fact of the matter is that neither of us can definitively say that it happened at all. It was several years ago. Fast forward to yesterday, now he's my roommate. He sent me a message-- this is  our correspondence

&#x200B;

RM: did I give you the Wii that's in the living room?

&#x200B;

Me: no... I don't think so?

&#x200B;

RM: hmm, I'm missing a white Wii but I couldn't remember if I gave it to you. then again, I'm also missing some games and stuff but you don't seem to have those

&#x200B;

Me: I don't think it's impossible, but I thought I got this on eBay or something. It could have been yours though.

&#x200B;

later, when he got home, we talked about it a little bit. He had another Wii in the living room, a red one. he wanted to homebrew it for his girlfriend. he sort of fixated on my Wii, though, asking many questions about it. When we turned it on, I realized that the Wii was mine from childhood. I had bought another Wii online years ago after this Wii had stopped working. but when the eBay Wii arrived, I realized the only thing broken on my own Wii was a single cord. so, I stored away the eBay Wii and kept mine. but I didn't explain all of this to him, because it wasn't particularly relevant to him homebrewing an entirely different device for his girlfriend.

&#x200B;

That is all to say that when I went to bed last night, He thought the white Wii was once his, I knew it was mine, and his girlfriend still needed a homebrewed Wii.

&#x200B;

When I woke up today, I went to the kitchen and saw that my Wii was missing. I texted him again and asked where the Wii was. He responded that he took it to his girlfriend because it was already homebrewed, and that he'd homebrew the red one for us to have in the living room. I told him that it definitely wasn't ever his Wii, and that it was mine from childhood, to which he responded: sorry I thought it was mine to begin with. This made me a bit mad, which is where I might be the AH. I said ""even if you did give it to me in high school, it wouldn't be YOUR Wii, it would be MINE!""

And since leaving, i have told my friends and family (and im kinda telling the world now) that German Doner Kebab (my old place of work) reheat their meat and serve it to customers, sometimes days after it was cooked. I find it absolutely disgusting and misleading to customers for the prices they are paying for FRESH MEAT. And yes, it is known in the work place that many other GDK restaurants globally also do this..which is sick. I have told people about this and some have fed back to me that i am ‘wrong’ for letting this information out, as i was trusted when i worked there.

"AITA for asking my boyfriend not to drink but drinking myself? My boyfriend cannot handle alcohol- he drinks way too much and becomes an angry drunk. There was a time when he was an alcoholic (drinking every day, all day). We’ve had many bad episodes until one day there was such a bad episode bordering on abuse (throwing things near me) that I gave an ultimatum to stop drinking. Since then, he hasn’t stopped drinking completely but drinks comparatively less (not to the point of getting piss drunk where he remembers nothing the next day) and is not as much of a mean drunk. 

The problem is that a few times the past week he has gotten piss drunk again and while nothing bad happened, it gave me PTSD that a bad cycle may start again. He told me that he would stop drinking completely and he’s a new leaf (he is moving to join me in a new city). However for this weekend he requested if he could drink for a road trip with his friends. I said no. However this week I also got promoted and my friends were thinking of a celebration. 

I would like to preface this by saying I am not a drinker (I will have like two drinks in three months). I’m also a workaholic and right now really feel like blowing off steam by having a drink or two with my friends, something I usually avoid doing since I’m so cautious monitoring my partners intake.

"AITA for not going to my nephews birthday party? . I’m F 19 and I’m the Godmother of my two nephews who are 6 and 1, and my sister is F 22. My mom’s side of the family was always very rude to me growing up and very problematic, and I hate visiting them. But my sister always has birthday party’s and events that include my whole family. Yesterday was my older nephews birthday and I told my sister I would go. When I was getting ready to go I was just absolutely dreading it. I had already seen my nephew that day, said happy birthday, and given him a present. I thought to myself why am I going to go put myself through an evening of being surrounded by these shitty people who make me feel like crap? So I didn’t go.

 It wasn’t the first time I chickened out of a family event, a couple months ago when it was my younger nephews birthday I didn’t go. My sister got mad at me, I apologized and said I was uncomfortable going, and we got over it. But my sister is PISSED about me not going to my nephews party yesterday. She said she was disappointed in me and I replied to her text saying that I’m sorry she was hurt and I should’ve told her sooner I wasn’t going but I’ve decided to no longer visit the family. It felt like a weight had been lifted off of my shoulders, finally saying that I’ve had enough. My sister than texted me saying

 “Well you know what maybe I shouldn’t of made you the godmother if you can never show up for my kids or me that’s how I feel. Do what you want don’t expect anything from me”

To which I replied,

“I’m always there for you and your kids, and respectfully, you need to understand and respect my boundaries. Your family is not my family. They have hurt me in the past and it is my choice as an adult to not have a relationship with them. I am always there for your children and I always will be. I am your sister, and I hope that you can remember that and understand that my choices are my own and are not made with the intention to hurt you. I’m setting boundaries now that I am building my own life and growing up and this is one you’re going to have to learn to be okay with. I will still always celebrate holidays and birthdays with you and your family, but not together with everyone else. That is going to have to be enough for you, because it’s the way things are going to be now. 
I’ll be here when you’re ready to move past your disappointment “.

I haven’t gotten any response and I am hurt to say the least. I am autistic and my sister knows that, and she knows I’ve always struggled with boundaries and sticking up for myself. Now I’ve finally done just that and she’s punishing me for it and saying she doesn’t even know why she made me a Godmother. My mom agrees with my sister that I was wrong but my brother (M 18) agrees that it’s not a big deal.

"AITA for assuming« all-access » consent (sleeping included) does not need to be confirmed before the act ? We had a long debate at work regarding kinks and consent.

Let’s say a person I’m in a sexual relationship with gives me consent to have sex with him/her while he/she is asleep. 

Regardless of the reason why, is it ok to act on it without waking them up to confirm the consent before acting on it ?

One of my female coworker defends aggressively that under no circumstances should I engage sex with someone unconscious (asleep), regardless of any previous consent given specifically on the subject or any relationship duration.
Her thoughts being that the person could change his/her mind/mood while sleeping and wake up during a sex act he/she does not consent to anymore.
While I can understand this position and respect it, I believe it would deny this person his/her favorite kink, or maybe the pleasure of not overthinking the sex part during foreplay. I mean, if that specific consent has been given, it’s for a good reason in my opinion.

Please note that I am talking about something both partners would have talked about in great details and set specific boundaries and safeguards.

I made the connection with BDSM to my coworker, saying that - with consent - it was ok to do certain things that would otherwise not be considered ok by the majority of folks.
She replied that BDSM partners are « conscious » and therefore can revoke consent at any time, while « asleep » partners cannot.

AITA to think it’s ok to assume consent when your partner gave you specific consent to assume consent while they’re not conscious to revoke it ?",0.47
"AITA for telling/ not telling my cousin’s bf the baby might not be his? My cousin and I moved in together recently since she broke things off with her boyfriend and was officially ready to move on. She had a tinder and was talking to multiple people, which is fine, however she found out she was pregnant not long after. There are 3 or 4 guys I know she was hooking up with during the time she should have gotten pregnant (I calculated this based on her official due date). She told her ex boyfriend and claims it is his and I don’t think he has any idea she has been hooking up with other people. I asked her if she’s sure it is his and she said yes, but she can’t possibly know that. I don’t think he was even around during that week of conception, but could be wrong. Even if they did, there’s still a chance it’s not his. They also were together for years without getting pregnant and did nothing at all to prevent pregnancy so she said in the past she thought she was infertile. Now I’m wondering if maybe he is the one that can’t have kids. It has been weighing on me as I am the only person that knows this information. I don’t want to go behind her back and tell him and leave her in a bad situation as she currently has no car or job and relies on him to get where she needs to go but it’s still pretty fucked up to me that she wasn’t honest and didn’t think to do a DNA first. Maybe she is scared or clueless I don’t know. I asked my mom what she thinks I should do and she said to mind my own business and hopefully if it’s not his the truth will come to light. I have severe anxiety and confrontation does not come easy to me. I was thinking of sending an anonymous message to him but don’t know what to say or how to do that. His family is also already super invested and she spends most of her time with them. If the baby is not his, it would crush them. Would I be the ahole to say something? Or am I the ahole for keeping quiet?",0.59
"AITA for not going to my friends graduation? This happened last year, in December.

My friend was able to graduate early, so she finished her diploma last semester. People who finish their college degree early at my university don't get a graduation service until May (that's when most seniors finish their coursework), so because my friend's graduation is far away and she wasn't sure whether she was going to make it because she was moving for a job opportunity, we decided to have a dinner. Unfortunately, her family couldn't make it because they live abroad and plane tickets were just not something they could afford, and her other friends either lived in another state or country; she only had me. She was pretty down about not having her parents and siblings.

Fast forward to the day of her graduation dinner, which was just the two of us. She is having a photoshoot around campus, and I wake up to a sick dog in the middle of the night. There was no 24-hour vet, so I had to wait till morning. When my dog was checked out because he had been vomiting and feeling ill, the doctor gave me options and medication for my dog and basically told me to keep an eye on my dog, so I had to monitor him. I called my friend; she didn't answer initially because of the photoshoot she was having, and when she finally answered, I explained what was going on and told her I would make up for it on another day. This is not her graduation day (it was a random day we decided), and she had already picked up her diploma days before. She tells me not to worry, and I tell her it's ok, we can reschedule, and I will get another reservation, but she keeps saying that it's ok, I should take care of my dog, and she seemed to be really empathetic at the time.

Weeks pass, and I call and text, but she doesn't return my calls and gives me dry messages. Then yesterday, she texted me that she believes she owes me an explanation and basically says that we have outgrown each other and that she didn't feel like I valued her as a friend because I prioritized my dog (just that one time) when she didn't have anyone else. and basically says that we shouldn't be friends anymore. I have just been left thinking, Was what I did so bad that she dropped me as a friend...",0.05
"AITA / for not telling my siblings my mom is dying ? I am a 30yo f, youngest of 5 siblings. I am the primary caregiver for my elderly parents and i live with them. I dont have a significant other or family of my own(i.e. kids etc). All of my siblings do and are living separately but still within 40 mins drive of each other. Over a year ago my mom was diagnosed with cancer. The family knows this. A couple months ago it was discovered that her treatment isn't working that well anymore and she would have to transition to traditional chemo.the treatment still semi works but not as well as it did for the past year. After weeks of deliberations and discussions (mom, dad, and i along with her doctors), my mom has decided to not do chemo but rather continue the current treatment until the end. The oncologist cannot really estimate how fast the cancer will grow but estimates my mom to have 3 to 6 months.  Physically looking at her no one would know she has cancer, she just looks like a normal old lady. Since the beginning all my siblings were pretty hands off with her treatment, past the first couple months no one really brought up the subject. It was me shouldering everything alone. Taking mom to appts etc. Which i dont mind because shes my mom, but it bothered me that everyone swept it under the rug. They would do the normal greetings and visits and they continued to live and not ask about the cancer as if it doesn't exist. I am hesitant on telling my siblings because I honestly don't want to deal with them pestering me with questions about this that and the other when for the past over a year none of them asked how mom was doing related to the cancer treatment. It emotionally upsets me and my mom when we talk about it so I also don't want to upset her. We only recently officially told the oncologist that she does not want to do chemo and it was a very difficult appt. My mom and I are pretty similar, she would rather not be sickly/hospital bound only to potentially live another year or 2, because to her its not really living at that point, it's not comfortable. She also does not want people to fuss over her. I am conflicted on what to do and I keep pushing back when I should tell my siblings if at all. And I don't know how to even bring it up without having a whole sobbing session.",0.07
"AITA for 'stealing' dog poop bags from an apartment I lived in? I (35M) rented an apartment with a $750 dog fee charged upfront for providing dog waste bags and maintaining the onsite dog park. Yes, kind of absurd, but I had to pay it in full. I only lived there 5 months, but the fee is for a year. I finally bought a house and moved out 9 months ago. 

By chance, I drive by my old complex about once a month, so I stop in one of the garbage areas where there are several rolls with a thousand bags in them and unravel 60 bags to get me through the next month. Nobody that lives or works there ever seemed to care possibly because I still have out of state license plates and the apartment is a hot spot for new transplants to the area.

Today a woman got out of her car and started harassing me for taking too many bags calling me a 'klepto' because when older residents in the complex need a dog bag, they end up walking around in the freezing icy cold so they can be responsible pet owners. I pointed out that there are several stations with hundreds of bags in each, but she threatened to take a picture of me and call management since she never saw me or my dog before and that it was 'theft by unlawful taking'. I apologized for not knowing better and got the heck out of there.

"AITA for telling my sister she's being a bit of a hypocrite wanting her kids to have old fashioned name but not liking when people refer to them as old lady/old man names? My sister had boy/girl twins in September. The babies were long wanted and she had names picked out years before. She has always had a love for old fashioned/vintage names and has been outspoken about her joy that they are back. She has also been judgmental of my choice of names for my three children because they were more uncommon and not classics. But she thought everyone would love her kids names which are Barbara and Douglas. I think she did get some positive comments. But she has been annoyed of late because people will say they are sweet ""old lady/old man"" names and that bothers her. While some have told her they don't like them because they're old lady/old man names.

My sister has snapped at her best friend and at people in her mommy group over the comments (that I know of). Her best friend didn't offer that up immediately either. My sister was bothered by her lack of comment on the names and begged her to give an honest opinion. It does sound like the names are loved at the mommy group though but my sister takes offense to the way they are complimented.

She mentioned this to me three different times. The first time I said nothing and let her talk. The second time I asked her why it bothered her when she said she wanted more old fashioned names to come back and the older the better. Her answer was those are the best kinds of names and just because people like me don't appreciate them, doesn't mean they are just for old ladies and old men. The third time is when I called her a hypocrite and this was after she described a couple of new members of the mommy group cooing over the names and then saying the dreaded ""old lady/old man"" thing and she lost her temper with them over their description of the names. I told her she's a bit of a hypocrite to hate even the positive comments about the names that mention they are names you expect on old ladies and old men when she intentionally wanted her kids to have old fashioned names.

She told me it's very different and I'm just showing how much I hate her children's names. I have never said this to her and unlike her, I would never disparage names someone else chooses, especially someone close to me. But she insisted that calling her a hypocrite is wrong when it's different to like old names vs calling them old people names.

"AITA for stealing my little sisters stuff and threatening to burn her favorite doll? I, F15 have a younger F9 sister. She has a really bad habit of stealing my mom's stuff and my stuff. Recently I bought these really nice earring with stars on them (they were around 70$). Eventually I lost them but I wasn't surprised considering I lose alot of things due to my memory issues. Since my younger sister is 9, shes not allowed a phone but recently when she went to her grandmas, she stole one of her grandmas phone. Grandma called my mom and said to check younger sisters room but while my mom and I were looking for a phone, I found my earrings I've been desperately looking for. I stood up with anger and thought of something to do. She was outside playing in the snow so what if I stole her stuff? I look around and I see her favorite doll. I take the doll and shove it under my bed until my younger sister asks where it is. Then I will bring up how she always steals my stuff and that I will burn it if she continues to steal my stuff. A bit harsh, I'm aware but she's been stealing my stuff for a year and I'm tired of buying myself nice things and losing them to a entitled iPad kid. I will be setting up cameras in my room without telling her and the next time I see her come in my room, her doll gets burned to death.

"AITA for telling my girlfriend to stop bragging about me in front of our friends? I (M26) have a side job as a model for about 3 years now. I usually do some photoshoots for smaller fashion labels, Iʼm not in magazines or on billboards, my photoshoots just get posted on their social media accounts or their websites, so itʼs not really a big deal. I met my girlfriend Cassie (F25) through a mutual friend, weʼve been dating for almost a year now and weʼre planning to move in together. 

Cassie really likes the fact that I have a side job as a model, itʼs always one of the first things she mentions when we meet someone new. She also does it whenever weʼre hanging out with our friends. She often gushes about how handsome and tall I am and jokes that she feels sorry for other women who date less attractive men. At first I was flattered, but after a while it got awkward. The guys in our friend group have started resenting me, because theyʼre not exactly conventionally attractive and when I was single, I would often get all the attention from women at the club while they got overlooked.

Yesterday Cassie and I were hanging out with our friends again, Cassie also brought her new friend along. Her friend got a bit tipsy and made a sexual joke about her husband. Cassie laughed and started bragging about our sex life and casually mentioned that I have a big penis. My friends rolled their eyes and at this point I had enough too. I pulled Cassie aside and told her that her constant bragging about me is getting insufferable and that she needs to find something else to talk about. This started an argument and she claimed I was being rude for calling her insufferable and that other men would be happy if their girlfriend was proud of them. We went back to our friends shortly after, but the mood was obviously ruined. Cassie didnʼt want me to drive her home and drove off with her friend instead. She ignored my texts as well. Iʼm conflicted, because Cassie didnʼt really do anything wrong and I never mentioned that her compliments bothered me until yesterday. So she thought I was being happy about it. But her constant compliments were also condescending towards our friends and sharing intimate details about me was inappropriate and crossed a boundary.

"AITA if I don't pay my ex-gf's storage anymore? Last June I (49M) matched with a woman, Kelly, (40F) on a dating site. We had immediate and strong chemistry. Things got intense really fast, and we had a whirlwind romance. I ignored some pretty serious red flags; she had just lost her job right after we met, and her ex had stopped paying half the lease on her house. She was obviously stressed about all that, so when she was especially sensitive to any perceived criticism, and would react with remarkable anger, and would be a long time cooling off, I figured it was a product of al that stress, and went out of my way to smooth things over.  

We had many arguments, during which she'd take any cheap shot she could think of to hurt my feelings.It all came to a head when I went on vacation. I'd helped her out with her lease, but despite giving her more and more money she had to move out. She house-sat for me while I was away, and put her stuff in storage, which I paid for. She took her essentials to my place while I was away. 

She picked fights over imaginary stuff almost every day I was away and did a terrible job looking after my place. When I got home, after a couple of days having anxiety attacks whenever I walked in the house, I told her she needed to move out and find her own place. She'd already registered herself to vote at my address, and registered her daughter for school in my neighborhood, and I felt really guilty because she still wasn't working. I offered to help her find a decent but affordable apartment in the school district, which she refused. I told her I'd pay her storage through the end of the year, but not after that.

What followed was a nightmare where she maligned me to anyone she had contact info for, threatened to sue and had a lawyer send an ""illegal eviction"" notice. She went to the police to get a TRO when she came to pick up some of her stuff, and I was there, working from home. She claimed I was ""trying to coerce her into the house against her will"" and in her mind, that was DV. Anyone who knows me knows what a ridiculous claim that is, and I've never had a physical altercation with an SO in my life, certainly not with her. She was angling to get a legal order to let her back in the house, with a restraining order so that I couldn't be there at the same time, effectively stealing my home from me. It didn't work, because none of these claims were remotely true, and as far as I know, she never even got as far as officially filing anything.

This was all late last summer. It is now 4 months later. I've paid for her storage since then, but when I got the bill for January's storage fees, I removed my credit card from the account, and told her the same day that she'd need to arrange to pay it herself. Today she insists that I owe her still, and should continue to pay for her storage …by sending her cash via Venmo, no less, not directly to the storage company.  AITA for not continuing to pay? She says she has no job and can't pay, and it's all my fault so I owe her.",0.06
"AITA for not including my in laws on a family trip? Am I the asshole for not including my in laws  on a family trip. My husband and I have planned to take our children (5 and 7) on a family hot holiday. Initially we thought we would open it to others so our kids would have others to play with. We had originally spoken with my SIL to see if they would be interested and they were. They have not mentioned it since, have not contributed to ideas on a location or anything. My husband and I decided we just want it to be us and our kids so that we are not on anyone else’s timeline, the other couple fights a ton and their kids just play on their phones when we are together and we are worried they will do the same on the trip. They are always running late and the kids rarely participate in any activities my children suggest.   This is our kids first hot holiday and we want them to be able to do whatever activities they want whenever they want and not worry about anyone else.

"AITA for not giving my FSIL a plus one to the wedding?   
Changing actual names.  
My fiance, John, (26M) and I (25F) are getting married in September. We intended on having a small wedding with just close friends and family, however my family is very large. In total our guest count will be just under 60 people.  
During John’s family’s dinner we were discussing the guest list, when Martha (FMIL) brought up Jane (FSIL&MOH) and her plus one. I pulled John aside to discuss how I am uncomfortable with an open plus one for the following reasons:  
\-Jane is not currently interested in anyone. If she did start dating someone we would have no problem inviting them, it’s just the idea of bringing someone we haven’t met just to bring someone  
\-I am socially anxious and being around strangers in general is hard for me let alone showing PDA in front of them.  
\-Jane will be busy all day and sitting with us at the reception. I don’t want a stranger sitting at the head table with us and our families and being in every picture, and I don’t see a point in having someone there just for them to be alone the whole time  
\-We are trying to keep the wedding as small as possible and there won’t be a whole dance or anything she’d need a partner for   
\-No one else is getting an open plus one  
John agreed with me and we decided to talk to her one on one later. However, when FFIL (Henry)  brought up her plus one again I was visibly anxious, he saw something was up and kept pushing me to say something. I told him I’m not comfortable with an open plus one. He then argued with me about it in front of Jane. Jane left, obviously hurt. We talked with her later and she understood, but my in laws were still furious.  
Henry said I should give her a plus one because what if she meets someone she wants them to meet? Martha said I was being selfish and asked why I brought up the guest list in front of Jane if I didn’t want her to have a plus one. I tried explaining that I was not expecting that at all, and it was pried out of me. Henry said I was being too sensitive.  
I tried to clarify that I’m only uncomfortable with an open plus one, and if there’s someone she meets we would be happy to invite them. They were still angry when the conversation ended.   
Martha now wants to meet me for lunch, and idk if I can handle my own and defend my position again. I’m not sure it’s even worth the tension if it will just make me uncomfortable for one day, even if it should be just about John and me.

"AITA for not letting my fiancé hire somebody who doesn't have health insurance? My fiancé and I own a house together and are building a garage starting next month. Other than paying someone to pour concrete, we pretty much plan to do the work ourselves with the help of his very experienced father. 

My fiancé has a friend (who is currently living with us to save money, he pays $300 a month rent) looking for side jobs (cash work) and my fiancé wants to pay him under the table to do work for us during the process, just paying an extra set of hands. 

However, I don't feel comfortable hiring somebody to do side work on our property that doesn't have health insurance. There's going to be a lot of physical labor, big equipment, and tall ladders (which are more dangerous than people seem to think). I just worry that if something were to happen we could be on the hook for a lot of medical payments and damages. 

The friend/roommate has the opportunity to purchase insurance through his job, and chooses not to to save money. (Idk if relevant, but I get the hint that these things he does to ""save money"" are not to put money into savings, but to spend on other things like weed and cigarettes because there's no evidence he's saved anything and he's frequently stoned)

"AITA for refusing to alternate weeks with another DM? Hi, so, just a bit of context here, I (16 Genderfluid) am in my schools dnd club, and there's a dm who we'll just call M for the sake of this story. M was previously a DM for the first few months during the year, and wasnt very good at it. She played favorites, changed rules constantly, her campaign was a Carbon copy of a dnd podcast, and didnt let us do much if it didnt have anything to do with what she wanted. For example, the dr1nking age at the beginning was 16. Then it was raised to 22 just two sessions later, and my character is the oldest, at 21. Another instance, we were in the forest, about to go on a quest because one of the party members wanted a pet dragon, and we all agreed to do it, but M decided she wanted to do a beach day instead, even though she promised we would do the dragon quest. Anyway, one day she wasn't here, and I was allowed the opportunity to DM, since by the time we were all informed that she wasn't coming, our busses had already left, and those who got rides home every day wouldn't be able to leave until 3. Everyone in the party decided that they enjoyed mine more. So, we've been doing mine. The next week, M tells me we're going to be alternating weeks. She doesn't ask, or suggest it, she states it as if it's a fact.

Yet she continues to push. I eventually told her exactly why I wasn't alternating(because I didn't want to and the party members don't even LIKE her) and now she's being very rude towards me and called me Miss-Know-it-all for 'putting words in everyone's mouths' and that if everyone has a problem with her, then they can tell her themselves.

I held firm that this was my day and it would be tacky for Matt to turn it into his engagement party. I am really happy for them and I am super proud of him too.

"AITA for blaming my friend for knowing about my personal sex life? I (27F) have (had?) two close male friends, let's call them A (27m) and B (25m).

I used to have unrequited feelings for B for over a year. At some point I hooked up with A a few times, which I now regret. We decided to stop the hookups and remain friends, but I wanted this to remain a secret, especially from B.

A few months passed by, and during a party, B drunkenly tells me he knows about A and I. I asked him how he knew, and he tells me A told him, several months ago (circa October of last year). I was also drunk so I lost it at the party - I angrily confronted A in front of a room full of people and called him a fucking asshole for telling B. Then I went home.

After having some time to process what had happened, I decided I was also angry at B for not having told me he knew sooner. He waited several months to tell me and only told me bc he was drunk. During this conversation, he told me that he felt he ""had a right to know"" bc me and A were his closest friends and we ""were doing things behind his back"". I ofc strongly disagreed with this and I don't think he ""has a right to know"" about my personal sex life at all, no matter how close we were.

We went back and forth for a while and it was very obvious that we weren't going to see eye to eye. He thinks he has a right to know about A and I, and he feels rightful in not having told me he knew sooner bc he thought I ""was in a bad place mentally and couldn't take knowing that he knew"". I disagree with this bc I don't think he has a right to know about my personal life, & I think he treated me like a child for having made the decision for me that I somehow couldn't take knowing that he knew.

In the end I told him he had broken my trust in him and I don't know if it can be fixed. But he stands by everything he said and he doesn't think he was wrong for not telling me. We're not currently speaking and now I'm wondering if I'm TA for blaming him for knowing and not telling me sooner.

Tl;dr: I hooked up with a friend, who then told another friend about it when I wanted it to remain just between us. Second friend hid he knew for several months & now I'm angry that he knew for so long without telling me. AITA?",0.89
"WIBTA if I don’t pay half of a toll bill my ex charged using a vehicle we used to share? So a phone call I (26F) got last night was my ex(29M) and he said he got a letter in the mail from the express tolls that was over $900 and he wants me to pay almost half of that but here’s some background about the car and situation.

1) He got the jeep back in June of 2022 and we shared that jeep up until July 2023. He used this jeep for his traveling job AND his new construction business so he traveled a lot and for sure took tolls roads since June 2022 till July 2023 when I took over the Jeep as we broke up and I moved out. 
2) he has NEVER paid a toll road bill for this car
3) because he never paid one he racked up over $572 worth of charges on the toll roads back in July and never paid it thus leading to more late charges
4) we just recently learned anytime I used to a toll road it got sent to him instead of me because he is the main name on the loan. I had no idea how much I owed to them and that it wasn’t getting paid. 
5) if you add up what I actually did on the toll roads from July until today it’s only $85 without any late fees 
6) because he never paid it added another $440 worth of late fees, civil penalties, etc to where it’s now he can’t register any vehicle 
7) he never ever checks his mail so that’s why we are just now finding out about this 

Because of this he wants me to
Pay like $350-$400 of this bill but I don’t think thats fair at all. Am in the right to not wanting to pay that much?  

To add to this this relationship did not end amicably. He was very emotionally abusive to me and said things that I still struggle with today. When we were in a relationship I helped him finically all of the time (I’m talking maxed out credit cards in my name, gave him money when he didn’t have a job at one point, got into serious debt for a while, etc). I was also the one who did most of the housework, animal care, etc. There were times where he really provided and helped but it definitely wasn’t a 50/50 relationship.",0.22
"AITA for overreacting to parenting criticism I (33f) and my partner (39m) have a five month old baby. We've been together for almost a decade, married for three.

Background on me: I was raised in a mildly abusive household, and I've dealt with depression for as long as I can remember. I was diagnosed with CPTSD, Bipolar II, and ADHD in my late twenties. I've been medicated for all these things for about four or five years, with no major issues. 

Background on him: normal dude.

Despite the absolutely indescribable happiness that my daughter gives me, I have experienced an increase in depression and anxiety. I'm terrified of being a bad or neglectful mother, and I've confided in this to my partner. I don't feel like my daughter and I have developed a solid bond, and I've told him that I'm scared that people are judging my parenting skills and that she cries more when she's with me. When prompted to, he reassures me this isn't the case.

The other day, on a good day, completely out of the blue (at least to me) my partner told me that I seemed overwhelmed by our daughter and asked if my BP or ADHD were contributing towards my lack of attention* of her, by making me delay my reaction to her crying. I tend to think too long about what might be making her cry rather than simply trying to stop the crying. He confirmed that she does cry more with me and said I don't do enough to try to keep her distracted. Sometimes I feed her her bottle with one hand and I am on my phone with the other and that makes him uncomfortable because I'm not giving her my full attention. 

He later said it was uncalled for and is acting like everything is normal again, but I just can't, and I can tell my distance from him is bothering him. I can't make myself be even just affectionately physical with him, and it's hard to be in the same room with him. 

But *is* it uncalled for? Am I overreacting? He really didn't say anything I hadn't felt or said before. AITA for giving him the cold shoulder and clinging to how I feel about that moment when he said those things, when it is all plausibly valid criticism?

"AITA for skipping basketball practice because my armrpit hair showed. So, I forgot to shave the night before and I changed into a short-sleeve shirt, where my armpit hair was quite visible. My team can be judgemental about like appearance and stuff, so i didn't really wanna get judged for my armpit hair and figured I'd just skip this practice and go to the next one when I'd bee shaved.

I'm a girl btw",0.82
AITA I just wanted help around the house. I (46F) and Husband (47M) just recently became empty nesters. So I figured it was a good time to start really splitting up the to do things around the house. So I asked for hubby to help me out by doing the dishes that were in the sink. Well he balked at first but then reluctantly did a few. While asking me where something goes. I answered and instead of putting it up. He just sat it down on the counter and said I could do it. I said then when will you learn where everything goes if you don't do it for yourself. Then he proceeded to get angry and called me a horrible human being. Well. I of course was upset and just walked out of the situation. Ever since that blow up . He's kinda snidely making comments about what I want for dinner. Mind you he's thinking of he does the cooking then he won't have to do the dishes again. I have said that we can both do them together. Then that pisses him off even more. What the hell. I feel like he's mad because after 25+ years I'm asking for him to finally get with helping me around the house. And honestly he's the biggest mess maker. AITA for wanting him to do his part now that there's just us two and the kids aren't around to help me anymore? How do I gradually get him to do this. Old housewife in Tx.,0.43
"AITA for telling my step-son he's more than welcome to leave? I (F30) married my husband (m42) a year ago, although we have been seeing each other for close to 5 years. I knew that he had a son from a previous relationship from the start.

Since meeting my step-son, Liam (18), I've noticed that he seems to have many self-inflicted problems and no desire to help himself. He had moved in with us two years ago, his relationship with his mum had hit a point where he just could not live with her. 

I've tried my best with Liam, I've gone out of my way to help him. I've convinced his dad to move him to a private school from the underfunded, overcrowded one he'd originally been at, I've made sure that I was always there if he ever needed anything, I spoiled him with gifts, I've assisted him with applying to university and helped him study for his A-levels, and much more.

Recently, We've had to attend a meeting at his school, he had been suspended for drinking vodka in the study room and they were concerned about his grades too, he hasn't been doing well in his class assignments. In the same week I had found out that he had managed to knock up a girl, a sister of one of his friends. It's been an absolutely treacherous week.

I can't lie, after finding that out, both his father and I went all out on him. We grilled him about what he plans to do with the rest of his life, seeing as he's actively trying to ruin his education. He didn't seem quite bothered about it all, just started whinging that it's all too much for him to deal with and that we are too hard on him. It was then I told him that he is more than welcome to leave and sort out his own affairs.

Since then, Liam's been largely ignoring me, and even my husband has said that I shouldn't have blown him off like that.",0.33
"AITA for not wanting to go to close friends' wedding this year. Am I the asswhole for not wanting to go to a close friends wedding in May. For background, I have been with my husband for 8 years in March and we finally decided to get married in 2023 after a lot of back and forth over the years if it was even needed to be happy.  My now husband's friends are getting married this year in May after being together almost twice as long as my husband and I. The problem is its the exact same day as my wedding. Now, I do understand it is just a day but its more than that. They choose a ""random Saturday"" in 2024, with similar colors and theme. Her dress is a similar color as mine (I choose to wear purple because traditions aren't my thing) and style. Now I am being asked to go to ""their"" wedding on my first anniversary and I don't want to go.",0.64
"WIBTA for driving my truck with an oil leak until I can get it fixed? I noticed some oil swirling around in a puddle under my truck. I got under my truck and there is dark brown fluid dripping off of the bottom. I took it to a mechanic, and they found the leak, and told me what parts I need to fix it, and they would order them, and fix it for me. The thing us that probably won't be until next week. I have another car, but it is leaking on the roof, and there is mold, and water everywhere. Also the check engine light is on in that one.
