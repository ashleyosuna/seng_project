"AITA for telling my friend she is jealous I (16f) have a friend also (16f). So I have a tiktok and this is kinda where it started. I posted a video and it got more likea and she kinda told me a backhanded compliment the next day. She told me ""wow I bet you didnt know people could get likes for pretty privelage."" I was kinda hurt but just left it alone. Well the other day this week we had a football game (im a cheerleade) and I was talking to the guys off my team and she cane down and looked sulky and didnt talk much. I know she get kinda nervous around this group of my friend but i never asked her to come down. We also had a thing where we wore jeans to school and I tied my shirt up and made it look tighter on me. She saw and rolled her and said I dont have to try to look good for guys all the time. I ignored her and left to go talk to my other friends. The same day in class me and them werent paying attention and were laughing and she called me over and told me I better pay attention before she tells the teacher. I didnt and said Id talk to her later. After school I was walking out with them and did this thing with a boy. When I went over to her she said that im such a pick me and I dont always have to be with the other ""popular people even if I am. I told her what I thought and it was that she was just jealous of me bc she was ugly and it wasnt my fault no one liked her bc and maybe that it was bc shes a bitch.",0.98
"AITA for not letting my friend stay at my house? I (31 f) have a chat group with two friends. We met though social media years ago, and we have met in person several times, but we live in different cities so we are not very close.

One of them (let's call her Brenda) wrote me like a week ago to tell me that she was visiting the other one (Anne) in October to celebrate her birthday (Brenda's birthday. Sorry if this is confusing but English is not my first language).

Brenda wanted to stay at my place before going to Anne's house, as my city is right in the middle of theirs. She also told me that she was dating again her ex boyfriend and he was coming with her.

I felt a little left out because she didn't want to spend more than one night with me, and she hadn't told me about her boyfriend until she needed to stay at my place. Also my wedding is in October and I couldn't invite them to the ceremony due to covid restrictions, but I asked them to come one weekend to celebrate it and they never closed a date.

I told Brenda that she couldn't stay. I really felt like she was using me as a free hotel. But I don't feel quite right as I have stayed at her place twice while visiting her city, and I even went with my SO once.

Should I tell Brenda that she can stay even if I feel left out? AITA for saying no?",0.06
"AITA For reacting negatively at a ‚Äújoke‚Äù Okay, I recently started my first job 2 months ago. I worked with my best friend and her mother. It was a heavy labor job but I was just glad to be working. I had to quit working with them after 2 months because I was simply spending too much money on gas. I had to pay about $72 usd every week on rides to and from work. I went to work with my parents instead, also in heavy labor but doing something different than them. 

Anyways my best friend has been wanting to invite her boyfriend to work with her since I began working and he had never accepted until now. She informed me he finally went with her and I asked her if he was enjoying it. 

She replied with ‚ÄúI think so dude, we made # of boxes on his first day and on his second even more. I was like damn why you gotta show up Jessica (me) like that üò©üòÇ‚Äù 

I found that to be a bit bitchy how she compared me to him but I ignored the comment and asked her if she thought he was going to finish the season with her which she replied with ‚Äúyes ma‚Äôam he is, he‚Äôs actually getting the hang of it quick and he actually listens to me unlike you and meno (her step dad)üåö‚Äù 

This pissed me off since the first comparison has already upset me and so I confronted her. I asked her to stop being a asshole, that was my first job in my life, her bf has been working for years. It‚Äôs not fair of her to compare someone with so much experience especially when she‚Äôs been working for years as well yet she still doesn‚Äôt listen to her mom and is the slowest one at work. 

This made her angry, she called me dramatic, she said there was no reason for me to be angry. What made me more upset is these were her exact words,

‚ÄùSuch a small thing for me to mention, want me to tell you how we already made # boxes on his third day? Because I know that would hurt your feelings more than my comment about you not fucking listening to me.‚Äù 

This comment makes me think she thinks I‚Äôm upset because I‚Äôm jealous. That makes me angry because I clearly stated I was angry over her comparing me to him. 

She told me not to message her until I‚Äôm not upset anymore and she won‚Äôt open my messages explaining why I‚Äôm upset. Am I being an asshole for overreacting and refusing to make amends until she apologizes?",0.45

"WIBTA if I [M16] told my friends I‚Äôm pissed at them for making major plans without me Basically, my friends are planning a Halloween get-together and have absolutely no intention of involving me whatsoever.

Just for clarity‚Äôs sake, I know this because they‚Äôve been talking about it in front of me for around a week now and told me it was nothing. They‚Äôre not very good at keeping stuff clandestine.

I‚Äôve felt like I‚Äôve been missing out on living life for a year or so now. I want to do normal teenager things and just be young with my friends. So when my friends told me they were thinking of having a Halloween party, I was really excited, which bummed me out even more when everyone cancelled. 

But then I‚Äôve started catching osnippets of conversations that tell me they‚Äôre still planning something for Halloween (‚Äúwhat day is the 31st?"" ""are we wearing costumes?"") and I'm not an idiot so I was able to figure it out. 

I got told from a mutual friend of one of the organisers that it‚Äôs cos she‚Äôs only allowed so many people over on the day. I hate being manipulated and given a second-hand excuse from another friend. If I‚Äôm not gonna be involved she should probably message me and let me know.

"WIBTA for asking my brother for my money back, which he borrowed years ago? About ten years ago my(f33) brother (m28) borrowed 1500‚Ç¨ from me because he was in trouble. Since then he has been struggeling and has never been able to afford to pay me back the money. In the first years he always said that he would pay me back when he got his inheritance from our grandmother. He has not mentioned this again the last few years.

Now we are about to receive our inheritance from our grandmother (20000 ‚Ç¨ each) and he has not confirmed that he will be paying me back. I think that he has forgotten about it. 

I happend to talk to my sister about it, I said that I was expecting our brother to pay me back, and now she thinks I am an AH for wanting the money back. She said that I already have a lot of money saved and a well paying job, so why do I even need the money back? All of this is true but I don‚Äôt think that I should be requierd to not be payed back just because I have good finances. 

She also said that he needs all of his inheritance so he can get back up on his feet and start a new life. She said that she herself would never have asked for the money back because she feels sorry for him.

Truth is that I could spare the money easily and that he do needs it more than me. I just don‚Äôt feel like gifting him the 1500 he borrowed.

"AITA for taking away a hobby my daughter loves ? I F25 have a daughter that is 7 year old that is a cheerleader. when I initially signed her up it was just for her to have hobby, my daughter absolutely loves cheering and with everything that is going on between my ex husband ( aka her dad),I was glad she found an outlet to get her mind off all the family drama. Through out the summer my daughter spend majority of her time training in gymnastics and dance. But In her gymnastics class her coach really took a liking into my daughter and my daughter also adores her back..but sadly this summer she spent most of her time with her coach more then me‚Ä¶.given Because I‚Äôm single mother and it sometimes hard because I also have 4 other kids besides her, so it could be hard finding that 1 on 1 time with her. 

My daughter talks about her coach non-stop and all the things she does with her and even other moms tell me that my daughter is the coaches favorite and paranoid side of me starts thinking is this relationship weird because when I looked at my daughter and the coach together it was literally looking at mother and daughter..when school starts to start backup again I told the coach she can‚Äôt come as much anymore because school is starting backup and she starts kinda getting visibly upset that I was putting school first before cheer, she then offers that she comes straight after school for an 1hr and half fully payed for..my daughter really wanted to still attend her class so I agreed..but now this week she asked me if my daughter can join her elite team..but that means more time my daughter will have to spend training and i can‚Äôt travel with her all the time because I have other kids plus I have a custody agreement with her dad so it‚Äôs really not in the cards.so I told her she can‚Äôt and we got in disagreement and she told me that I‚Äôm holding my daughter back and she can be in the Olympics and that I‚Äôm neglecting her and that she‚Äôs trying to save her to become like me ( which was a mom at 18) . That was yesterday and I lcried when I had time to myself. Because she made me feel like I didn‚Äôt care about my daughter..right now I‚Äôm feeling like I don‚Äôt want my daughter back with that teacher, it would crush my daughter if I told her she can‚Äôt see her coach anymore so am the asshole for taking away a hobby my kid loves ?

Edit: more information on the coach she litterly an Abby lee miller if anyone has watched dance mom she‚Äôs very intense when it comes to training the kids at her gym, the elite team the coach is referring too is a travel team that age group is 9-12 year olds also I did try to look into a transfer gyms nearby deadlines for registration already past.",0.33
"Aita Act of kindness? D for Daughter DF for Daughters Friend and EC for entitled child.

During covid while they were in primary school df said to me she was interested in learning to crochet I offered spare stuff Then another lockdown hit so i was unable to. 

starting secondary school this year.df is struggling I tell d that crocheting can be relaxing Df still wants to learn so i go through my stuff and give her my spares

Turns out in a group chat. Df had mentioned gift EC questioned why and she didnt recieve anything like that.D said you never said anything.

That night both d and df wanted to start learning so i taught them both with df being on a video call EC was also on the call even though both d and df told her that they would be learning  EC didnt care she wanted to video chat. So they did.

As im teaching EC sighs and goes quiet during the call. Both girls ask EC if she is ok. EC says shes fine EC gets in a mood and leaves the call. Both d and df are confused and message EC to see whats up. EC then states shes upset as she felt ignored and left behind while they are crocheting and they didnt notice that she was crying on video call. Both girls tell her they asked multiple times if she was ok and she said she was fine so what were they supposed to do EC messages again saying she wants to go on a video call both girls message saying if she wants to but again they are crocheting. Ec says thats fine and tried to start a video call. Both girls were unable to answer Once i was done teaching and they were ready to include her in the call EC messages back not to bother as you didnt answer the call so clearly you dont wanna talk. Again both d and df explain what was happening and started up the 2nd call.

And as you can expect EC started the convo with shes being ignored and they didnt notice she was upset. Daughter promply tells her well we told you what we were doing and you said you were fine with it we also asked you many times on the previous call if you were alright and you said you was. EC hangs up.

Next day
Daughter proceeds to tell me that EC is upset that she didnt recieve anything. And asks me if i have anything spare that she can have.i dont that it all went to DF i also made sure d messaged df to make sure that EC doesnt guilt her into giving her something from the gift. Turns out EC already tried df was close to doing it
EC is again complaining that she didnt get anything and could df give her something
D puts EC in her place saying no it was a gift for Df and its rude to ask. 

EC comments that shes leaving the chat and is no longer going to be there friends as she is being left out. And my daughter is apparently being rude. Messages are sent back and forth eventually a video call is started because EC wants to know of my d is being rude on purpose.

first thing that comes out of EC mouth is shes not happy that DF got something Again d explained that you never told me you were interested.After awhile EC had to go and the chat ended.",0.22
"AITA for blowing up on my cousin over a joke? This all happened today so I'm a bit heated still, but it started when we had to go to church today. Now I normally don't go to church unless it's Easter or some other occasion. And today's was a baptism. My parents mutual friends were baptizing their 2nd born. And once the baptism was over, they had an after party. Everything was fine until my uncle kept throwing these passive aggressive jokes my way for absolutely no reason. (U = uncle Me =me obvi)
U: wanna know a joke?
Me: shoot!
U: wonder why you don't have a girlfriend?
Me: uh, why?
U: look down. 
And I was my phone in my hand open on pokemon go. Now, I enjoy playing pokemon go sure, but in no way shape or form am I addicted! I play for 10 minutes, and I'm done! Fast forward about 20 minutes and my uncle has made various jokes along the same lines. ""You know why you don't have a girlfriend?"" And I'm sick of it. So I just secluded myself in a corner. But here's where I might be the asshole. After a good while of playing mobile games, one of my younger cousins around 10 or 11 years old walks up to me (keep in mind; she is the worst one of all. I have many storied of my cousin being an entitled brat.) She taps my shoulder. (C = cousin)
C: hey! Wanna know a joke?
Me: ugh, what is it.
C: wanna know why you don't have a girlfriend?
And at this point I'm fed up. I'm fucking done. And I snap back.
Me: you know what? That's rich coming from you. 
C: huh?
Me: you know, you and dad poke those jokes just because you are insecure about your dating status, and he hasn't been laid all summer because of you and your sibling's shit. Well I'm done!
And as I begin to blow off some steam, my mom intervenes and tells me to stop. Now, she was aware of all of this back and forth from me and my uncle so she didn't expect me to apologize thank god. But then my cousin says that she wasn't going to say what her dad was saying. But then I turn back.
Me: I don't give a shit! It's all just you trying to get on my nerves because you guys have no other better things to do then to pick on me.
I'm fucking through with my uncle.

"WIBTA if I told my parents they aren‚Äôt allowed to use my car anymore? My (20f) stepdad (51m) has been using my car for his second job. He does door dash and will do it for multiple hours multiple nights a week. I have a Prius so my can is more fuel efficient than his truck. They will reimburse my gas sometimes but not all the time. My stepdad has also left my car messy with stains and there was even peanut shells all over the floor one time. Granted he cleaned up my car once it was brought to his attention but I still think it is unacceptable given that it is my car and should be treated with the same respect of a borrowed car. My stepdad also leaves my headlights on. They turn off after a little while I think but still are on for a while. One of my headlights burnt out and my mom and stepdad expected me to pay for it even though I only use my car at night once a week whereas my stepdad uses my car mostly at night. My dad payed for the bulbs but my mom and stepdad do not know. I changed my oil three months ago and now the light is flashing saying I will probably have to change it again soon. It will be expected that I pay for that too and they always want me to go to the dealership to do that, which is about $200. I use my car a fraction of how much my stepdad uses it weekly. They pay for my insurance and I appreciate that but I feel like I shouldn't be having to pay for my stepdad using and abusing my car. 

The last straw came when today I got a call from my mom for the first time in a week asking for him to use my car because he has a flat tire. I am at my dad's house because I transition every two weeks. My mom has a Lexus that is more fuel efficient but she never offers to have him use it. I work on the weekend and like to have the option to use my car especially when I am not at their house. I said ""I guess"" and my mom got mad that I was not jumping at the chance to help them even though it should not be an expectation that they use my car. She talked about how much it inconveniences them for him to not be able to door dash today. I started crying. I do a lot for them already I give my sister rides. I run errands for them, help with chores and do a lot more even though it inconveniences me. 

My stepdad used my car today and brought it back at the time I said I needed it back but with less gas while there‚Äôs a gas station a block away from where I work. My headlights were also on for no reason because he brought it back at 3pm and it is super bright outside. 

They say they need the money but they took three trips back to back this summer and we all went to California for a road trip for my spring break. They are planning another trip this winter. They‚Äôre using door dash to pay them off. They take multiple trips a year that are not cheap. Many trips they have taken have been out of the country. I don‚Äôt think that I should be paying extra for maintaining my car so that they can pay off multiple expensive trips when I have only gotten to go on one.",0.12
"AITA for resigning on the spot and threatening legal action over one dispute? This situation involves me (20f), my mum (50f), and my bf (42m). 9 months ago I started working with my mum at her job, which including me included 3 people, the other of which being our boss (medical field). We both did the same job but she was our manager, and I worked generally offsite due to covid.

Mum and I have a rocky relationship, but taking this job I thought would mean we could still be connected but not in a personal way.

After 9 months of work, we have caught up on the backlog I was employed to deal with and I want to learn how to make sure that doesn‚Äôt happen again. My bf has a roommate who works in the same field as my employer, so it‚Äôs academic that through conversation he invites me to come to his business, to see how they run and to chat to his reception staff.

The opportunity was extremely informative. I learnt a lot watching how they functioned. Their workplace is a couple years more mature than mine, so i got a lot of great pointers as to ideas that we could implement for the future. 

A couple days later, after I‚Äôve written up a document summarising what I‚Äôve learnt. I tell mum about it. Her reaction was strong to say the least. She said I should‚Äôve told her, and says I‚Äôve risked our jobs, inferred she‚Äôs bad at hers, have breached confidentiality and have acted inappropriately. Mind you that‚Äôs a summary. She demanded an apology and I wouldn‚Äôt, as I maintain it was a great experience. She says it‚Äôs strike 1, and now the topic migrates to my bf, and the issue she has with his age. Without being specific, profanities and general insults are screamed at me and I just resign on the spot.

Next day she calls me to demand details about my work experience trip ie ‚Äúthe incident‚Äù. Within 6 minutes she‚Äôs screaming and crying that she‚Äôs going to lose her job because of it. Lots of insults. Demanding an apology. I maintain it‚Äôs been taken way out of proportion and that even if it is an issue, I‚Äôve done the right thing and resigned so she‚Äôs not in risk of her job.

Next day she contacts me to say she‚Äôs changed her mind, has told our employer and she hopes I‚Äôll ‚Äúhave an open mind‚Äù about continuing to work with her. I don‚Äôt budge. 

If I resign, she says it‚Äôs non negotiable that I hand in all my devices (3 laptops) to be searched by our ‚ÄúIT support‚Äù (her husband) to make sure no work related material remains on it. I threaten legal action if that‚Äôs how she wants to go ahead. These laptops were not provided by the workplace so she has no right the way I see it, and after reviewing the employment contract I am not in breach of anything. My family are not fond of this decision, and after a phone call with my employer he wants me to let this be water under the bridge and continue employment. I just have an awful feeling that I‚Äôm being too harsh, especially since my family and employer want me to continue working.",0.11
"AITA for cutting my son's hair? My wife and I have an 11 month old son. We are both working from home but inspite that, we still need support in taking care of our son. So every two months or so, we alternate going to and from our parents' houses. We are very lucky that both set of grandparents are willing to take the three of us in their home, cook food, do our laundry and baby sit our son. We just give them money for the expenses.

Currently we are in my in laws. And for a bit of background, their side are very catholic and superstitious and im a closet atheist. I dont really have very close rapport with my MIL and im just trying to be civil while we stay at their house. There are few instances that are decided based on religion/superstitions and im a bit annoyed, although not a big deal. 

The issue right now is my son's hair is kind of the length that it's poking inside his ears, cover his eyes, and also irritating his neck. NO SKIN PROBLEM. I believe its annoys him, makes him uncomfortable and this cause him to scratch the inside his ears and sometime around his eyes and will have slight cuts inspite making his nails short as possible. My wife initially wants to cut it after he turn one year old for whatever superstition/tradition. But i'm convincing her that we cut it already. She is kind of convince and yesterday she brought it up to my MIL. This is when i found out that my MIL is the one who really wants to delay the cutting of hair and told my wife to just follow her and there is nothing to lose. I'm so pissed because my son is already suffering and im afraid he will get long term scar in his ears. I told my wife i will cut it myself and did it within the day. When my MIL found it out, she expressed her disappointment and rant for a while. My wife is in dilemna whose side to take on. We are still scheduled to stay there for the next 4 weeks and that includes my birthday, both parent in laws birthdays. And we plan to leave and celebrate my son and wife's birthday on my parents house. Yes, we are all Octoberians! AITA for cutting my hair's son against my MIL will at their own house?

"AITA for not wanting my boyfriend‚Äôs sister to spend 2 days with us every Thanksgiving and Christmas? In March of 2020, my boyfriend and I bought a house after dating for 3 years. I was looking forward to our first holiday in our new home. I had big plans, but Covid, so we canceled the huge family gathering I had cooked for. Fine, we kept it small and his sister came over for Thanksgiving for 2 days. As we approached Christmas, I said I wanted a small affair and to serve prime rib (if I never eat turkey again it will be too soon). Boyfriend says his sister wants duck. I said I didn‚Äôt want duck, I wanted to splurge and have prime rib. It‚Äôs our first Christmas in our new home. Then he says that she would be willing to buy it. So we had duck. And she moved in for 2 days at Christmas as well.

She and my boyfriend have always gotten together at the holidays and watched zombie movies. I don‚Äôt mind the occasional zombie movie, but I can‚Äôt do a marathon fest, so I didn‚Äôt participate. Watching zombie movies is not how I celebrate Christmas. Sister tells boyfriend I have no respect for their family‚Äôs traditions.

I can understand that she is excited for us and our new house. It‚Äôs huge and roomy and there is space for all of us to do our own thing. I do believe she wanted to do something nice for us. I feel like my boyfriend didn‚Äôt take me or my traditions into account at all and they just did their own thing. Again, new house, everyone excited. I get that.

I spoke to my boyfriend after Christmas last year and told him that I was angry about what she said. I said that you and I are a family now and I‚Äôm not dating your sister and don‚Äôt we get to form our own family traditions? I feel like he brought his sister into our holiday without asking me about what I wanted and when I mentioned what I wanted, it was ignored and when I didn‚Äôt join in with their thing, I was accused of not respecting their traditions. I also asked if we were expected to host his sister for 2 days every holiday every year until we die, because that‚Äôs not fair. So this year I said she can come over Thanksgiving day for dinner only and go home like everyone else does and for Christmas she can come out Christmas eve, sleep over, stay for dinner, and go home. Max. I would prefer she not sleep over at all. I told him I wanted a quiet holiday this year and not be obligated to entertain people, but I am willing to compromise. Boyfriend doesn‚Äôt like confrontation and I am fairly certain he hasn‚Äôt mentioned any of this to his sister because last week she said to us that ‚Äúwe need to figure out what we‚Äôre doing for Thanksgiving‚Äù. I feel like they both just assume that the 3 if us will be celebrating every holiday together in our house. And no, she can‚Äôt really host because her townhome is small and hoarded. She did it once a few years ago. I had to sleep on the couch and my boyfriend on the floor because you can‚Äôt get into her spare bedroom.",0.2

I didn't know the reason why cedric said don't invite nathan and didn't want to say ""we don't want to bring you with us"" that thought to me as rude and mean. So I said I'd go out by myself and eat somewhere. He agreed to the idea and we all went our separate ways. I met up with cedric and his GF and had lunch. All was well. No ones angry. Next day everyone's pissed. Nathan found out where I went and saw that I lied about where I went to eat and was angry about it. I talked to both cedric and trevor about it.

"AITA for being upset that the guy I‚Äôm seeing wants me to take care of his dog? 
So, I‚Äôve been seeing this guy for about 6 months now. We aren‚Äôt dating, we both just enjoy what we have and being casual. Recently, he got a dog- a 3 year old German Shepard named Bailey. And while I do love the dog, he‚Äôs been putting a bit more responsibility on me than I think he should. So Bailey is sick, and he‚Äôs had to put him on a diet of boiled chicken and rice. He also gets up for work really early in the morning and doesn‚Äôt want to wake up even earlier to take Bailey on walks.

The other day he got upset with me because I didn‚Äôt go buy Bailey some more food, and he even asked me to go over to his house once while he was at work to let Bailey out. Now, I do all of this without a complaint because I do feel bad for the dog. Of course I‚Äôm not going to let a dog starve and I‚Äôm going to take care of Bailey.

"AITA for inviting my new roommate out to drink? So my friends and I are all over 21 and my roommate is two years younger than me, 19 years old. I thought it would be nice of me to ask her if she wanted to drink with me and 5 of my friends at one of their apartments, which is a 3 minute walk from our apartment. 
Halfway through, her mom facetimes her and she admits to her mom that she‚Äôs drinking for the first time and her mom flips out on me. Tells me to take her home and stay with her for the rest of the night because she should not be drinking and if anything happens it would be my fault. Her mom actually knows my mom, and so she said she was going to tell my mom about this, which I thought was okay because if I‚Äôm thinking about myself, I‚Äôm allowed to drink and my mom knows. 
I proceed to tell my roommate‚Äôs mom that she wanted to come despite knowing that we were going to drink and was curious to try it out. Obviously I knew if anything happened to go wrong I would be liable, but I was keeping an eye on her and kept checking up on her, like I would anyone who‚Äôs drinking, first time or not. 
On one hand I get why her mom is mad (she‚Äôs her only daughter too), but on the other hand I don‚Äôt think I deserve to get this blame. So here I am in my apartment, her mom is still on FaceTime with my roommate who‚Äôs trying to tell her mom that she‚Äôs okay and stuff and I‚Äôm starting to feel bad because if I didn‚Äôt allow my roommate to drink this wouldn‚Äôt be blown into proportion.

"AITA for not telling my friend's mom that my brothers would be in attendance before inviting them to dinner? I (14f) invited my best friend and her mom, who I'll call Kate, over for dinner on Saturday.  Both of my older brothers were there too.  Kate is Christian and she doesn't like my brothers.  My oldest brother (31) is married to a man and has a son.  My other brother (21) is atheist and has Flying Spaghetti Monster and Darwin fish tattoos in very visible places.  He also wore a t-shirt with ""Hail Satan"" written on it.  I think that was a little over the top, especially since he knew Kate was coming.  At the dinner, religion came up and my brother said that God isn't real because there's no proof for it.  Him and my dad then had a discussion about all the inaccuracies and plot holes in the Bible.  Kate looked really uncomfortable through the whole thing but she didn't say anything.  Today I went to their place after school and Kate told me that she didn't feel comfortable there and she didn't want her daughter attending events with my brothers again either.  She said that she thinks my brother and BIL's lifestyle is immoral and my nephew is not getting a proper upbringing.  I understand that she has different beliefs, but it's not like they were making out at the dinner table or something.  She doesn't want her daughter to be exposed to my brothers and she says I should have told her they were going to be there.  Am I the asshole?",0.31
"AITA for telling my brother what my nieces said about him? I have one brother who is almost 30. He has an older son who is 10 that he has full custody of. (His mother is in jail for drug charges)

He also has two daughters from a previous marriage. A 7 year old and a 5 year old. They live with their mother and visit my brother. He is supposed to get them every other weekend. 

He is married again and has a month old son. It‚Äôs worth mentioning that he met his now wife in 2016 but him and his ex didn‚Äôt even begin divorce proceedings until 2017. He started having an affair shortly after his second daughter was born. 

He hardly sees the girls. He can go anywhere from a month to several months before picking them up. His ex that he cheated on is remarried and has two little boys 3 and 1 with her husband. They live about 20 minutes away form my brother and myself. We share a duplex so I know when he gets them. 

He had not seen them at all since they baby was born and only 3 times in 3 months before that. He recently picked them up and I was sitting on the couch with the girls. 

The 5 year old was crying and wanting to go home she said I don‚Äôt like my dad he‚Äôs mean and makes me leave home. The 7 year old looked at me and said ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been wondering who my real dad is? Is it (brothers name) or (stepfathers name)? I told her it was (brother) and she looked at me kind of weird and said I wanted it to be (stepfather) and started telling me how great he was and how he had took them to the pumpkin patch and how he braids their hair while they watch cartoons in bed and eat cereal. It sounded very sweet. 

I then felt that my brother needed to know this and that he needs to straighten up for these girls. I told him and he exploded on me and said I told the girls to say that and now he is mad at them for ‚Äúlying‚Äù and they are both crying to go home with their mother.

"AITA for wanting my bf to distance himself from his parents? My boyfriend (26 M) and I (26 F) have been together for almost 6 years. His parents relationship has never been the best, but at the beginning of this year it went completely down hill. There‚Äôs been accusations of cheating and scamming; literally everything under the sun you could throw at a person at the end of a relationship. They have been putting my boyfriend and his brother through the middle of it all and trying to get each one on the other‚Äôs side. I‚Äôve seen the terrible emotional toll it has taken on my boyfriend and it breaks my heart. His mom and dad have finally landed on getting a divorce which I thought might finally put an end to things. Well it looks like I was wrong. They have both been going through my boyfriend to basically argue and negotiate with the other about the terms of the divorce. I am a very family centered person and always wanted to have a close relationship with my in-laws but at this point I‚Äôve had enough. It‚Äôs so hard for me to see what my boyfriend has been put through and I feel as though enough is enough. I really wish he would set boundaries with his parents because now I feel as though these constant issues are leaking through into our relationship. I feel like I‚Äôm walking on eggshells some days because I don‚Äôt want to say something to start an issue.

"AITA for ending my contract with my client abruptly and refusing to refund them? In August, I got hired to be a social media campaign manager for a streetwear startup. The client seems nice because they're willing to pay my service with a good amount. Of course, if the client pays well, you give the best service, right? That's what I did.

Now, here's the problem: they're pretty uncooperative. I've been requesting materials that I'll put on their pages, and they barely gave me anything. They only gave me a set of photographs of their existing products -- you know, the type of picture with white background? That's just it. I told them that the younger audience (which is our main market) prefers candid shots, rather than the catalog type. I've been reminding them non-stop, but they still won't work with it.

So earlier this morning, I decided to give up on them. I terminated our contract. 

Now, they're demanding demands because they didn't get customers while I'm working with them, and they're accusing me of scams. In my defense, it is NOT my fault they could not give convincing material. I even sent them screenshots of me reaching out to people online out of hope of them buying the products. Most messages are left on seen, though. Now, they're leaving bad reviews on my LinkedIn and Upwork page, claiming I scammed them.

I asked my friend about it, and he said I should just refund because what I did is an asshole move. But I think it's unfair because I still worked hard, despite their deficiencies and incompetencies.

"AITA for asking my husband to work toward a better sleep schedule? My husband and I have a 1 year old and a 3 year old. He has a very flexible job in which he can work from home a lot, go in late, etc. My schedule is very different. Mondays and Fridays I get to work at 8am, and Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays I get to work at 6am. I work significantly more hours than he does.

On Mondays and Fridays I get the kids up and get them ready and take them to daycare before work. On Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays my husband gets them ready and takes them because daycare opens at 0630, so I leave the house before they even get up. So on the weekend we each get a day to sleep late. However, when he sleeps late, he‚Äôll sleep until 11, 12, or sometimes 1pm. So I am taking care of the kids by myself for 6 hours sometimes. When it is my turn to sleep late, I only sleep until maybe 8 or 9. 

The problem is that he is physically unable to wake up in the mornings. He stays awake until midnight or 1am watching tv. Half the time when it is my turn to sleep late he won‚Äôt or is unable to wake up. If he does get up, he will get up with them but fall back asleep. Our 1 year old is all over the place and loves to put chokable things in her mouth. I feel like him being so sleepy in the morning that he is unable to function and watch our kids properly is a safety issue. Once when I was out of town our son got out of the house and walked to a neighbor‚Äôs house. My husband had no idea until the police knocked on our door. He denies that he was sleeping but I know he was. 

Sunday it was my turn to sleep late. Our son got up at 6 and my husband went into the living room with him. Our daughter woke up at 0630 and I went to ask him to get her. He was asleep on the couch and I woke him and asked him to get our daughter up. 30 minutes later I woke up to her crying, still in her crib. I got her up and fed her, my husband got back into bed and slept until 11. 

Sunday evening I told him we need to do something about his sleep schedule because it is a problem. We have had this argument several times when I get upset that I don‚Äôt get even one day to sleep late in a week and he gets 4. Well he lost it on me. He said he‚Äôs always slept this way and I can‚Äôt expect him to change now, that he works hard and makes most of the money so I should let him sleep late. He got very angry that I said it was a safety issue and left the house because he wasn‚Äôt going to be told that he can‚Äôt take care of his kids. 

We haven‚Äôt spoken to each other since, except stuff about the kids. He seems extremely angry and I just don‚Äôt understand how I am in the wrong here. Maybe there is something I am not understanding. My husband has a very hard time with criticism. Any time I express an issue with something he does that I am not happy with, he blows up at me. It makes me very hesitant to bring any issues up with him but this is about the safety of my kids. 

So AITA? Please someone explain this to me.",0.22
"WIBTA if I told my friend to stop mentioning how I left her? 2 years ago my friend, me and this boy from our school were at the train station, heading home from school. During our way to the train station my friend and the boy started to argue. 

The boy was trying to manplan stuff to her and when she told him to knock it off while I told him to leave her alone.

The conversation turned awkward since we cornered him so he tried to joke around and call my friend a bitch.

The conversation turned bad since my friend started to yell at him to never call her that, how they are not friends so he can never say that to her even if he was joking.

I didn't say anything because that's when I started to get anxious. Growing up my parents always argue in front of me so I always get scared when people yell even if it's not towards me. I knew I was gonna get a panic attack since not only was my friend yelling so close to me (I was stuck in the middle, between them) but the situation resemble so much like my parents so I got up and move away from them, like 5 feet away to calm down. We were in a public place with many people surrounding us  and it was daytime so I knew that she wasn't in danger. They both followed me and they stopped arguing when our train was here.

Now my friend like to bring it up how I abandon her while she was in the middle of fighting someone. Even when I told her why I had to leave and apologizing several times she goes, ""Yeah but still. You're my friend you have to be by my side.""

This morning she brought it up again with our group of friends as a way to make funny of me and I feel so upset about it. I didn't say anything because I didn't want to lecture her in front of them but now I'm think if I should just be honest and tell her to stop.

I feel like where I went wrong is that I did leave her, even if I knew she was safe I still left her alone in a tense situation. I think I'm overreacting and so I shouldn't be uncomfortable about her talking about it since it was a tense situation for her and she likes to joke about her trauma.",0.04

"AITA for not wanting my cousin/fiance's former fwb at my wedding? I 27F am planning my weddin for June. We are getting our save the dates out. Thing is in college my Fiance ""Jack"" and my first cousin ""Cass"" were apparently friends with benefits off an on from Freshman-Junior year. I never knew because we met after college and since it was so casual, they never had pictures together or anything. It was definitely awkward when I found out, but it was before we met so I cant really me mad about it.

Im working on the list with my mom this past weekend and she has all the cousins invites laid out. I told her that I dont want Cass there because its awkward for me if a woman my soon to be husband has ""been with"" over 100 times is at our literally wedding. It just seems so weird. My fiance said he doesn't care either way but sees how it could be weird for me, so he's cool with it.

My mom however is flipping out. She's her goddaughter and says the past is the past and its not like they cheated so she should be at her cousins wedding. I told her its my wedding so I should have to approve all  guests but she disagrees saying a wedding is about the whole family not just the bride and groom...she even called her sister (Cass' mom) who then called me and said I need to get over it. I texted Cass and she was kinda short with me about it. She said she gets it and didn't really argue but her texts were very short and way more formal than she normally is if that makes sense.

"AITA for wanting my GF‚Äôs brother out of our house? My girlfriend (f31) and I (m28) have been together almost 4 years and bought our first home together last April. We almost completely remodeled in order to make it more like home for ourselves and to build our life in. Her brother (m27) helped with a good chunk of the remodel work. He‚Äôs more handy than I am and my lady is very particular about how she wants things and he was able to help in that regard. Six months later, we‚Äôve just about finished remodeling and he‚Äôs now living with us. He did some of the work, so it‚Äôs fine if he wants to live here for a little while. 

Now it‚Äôs been a year and a half, he still has no job, refuses to get one, pays for nothing for the house (no groceries, no utilities, nothing), and doesn‚Äôt clean up after himself or contribute in any way other than mowing the lawn, cooking dinner (on nights where he feels like it), and doing small jobs for my gf around the house when she asks him to and when he feels like it.

"AITA for disconnecting my Grandma's tablet from my Amazon account because of my Aunt? Back story: I like to do nice things for my family members since all of them have always been so supportive of me over the years. I'll do that with random greeting cards, gifts and also share (with select family) my Netflix/Amazon Prime/etc. I have no problem sharing and several of my family members use those accounts regularly. I also have had a problem in the past where my Amazon account was hacked and items were ordered-Over $1200 worth. It took me several months to get all the money back but it‚Äôs left me very wary. One Christmas recently my cousin and I split the cost of the latest Fire Tablet for Gram and I set up my Amazon account on it so she can read books and play games, watch movies etc. I have an old Amazon prime account that is very inexpensive, if I create another profile or share my prime benefits, it makes me upgrade and pay more. Gram loves it and spends hours on it daily. My aunt, we‚Äôll call ‚ÄúLisafer‚Äù, my aunt's wife and Gram all live in the same house. My aunt is older,(in her 50s - I am 42)spoiled, entitled and gets her way, etc. A year ago, the name on my Amazon account was changed to my Grams name. Not huge, it was clearly someone in that house, but still a cause for concern that boundaries were crossed. I called the household and explained that they shouldnt do that and there was some yelling on that end, but I thought it was sorted.  At the beginning of this month strange items were added to my Amazon cart. I called Gram to see if she had accidentally done it (honestly I don't think she would know how to) and she said no. She said maybe Lisafer did it. I messaged Lisafer and asked. She denied it-when pressed, she admitted to adding things because she was ‚Äúchecking prices‚Äù. Same discussion followed, please dont do this etc, After we spoke she texted me from my Gram‚Äôs phone- she would get Gram a new tablet and new account so there are no ""discrepancies"". I said ""Ok, sounds good. The device is hers to use, just needs a new account"" I disconnected the tablet from my account. That really upset Gram because she missed her books and games-eventually I added her back with the provizo that Lisafer was not to use my account again. (I told Lisafer this as well.) A few days ago, I found items in my Amazon cart again. I called Gram and found out that they were Lisafer‚Äôs items--again. I sent a message to Lisafer and to Gram stating that I would be disconnecting Grams Kindle off for good bc I cant go through this anymore. It makes me incredibly anxious to see items in my cart and I feel Lisafer was disrespecting my boundaries. Gram was near tears  when I made the follow up call, Lisafer and my other aunt have been cussing me out and telling me to set Grams Kindle back up (in the background while Im on the phone with Gram).Gram says she understands how it makes me feel and sees it is not her fault or mine, but still I feel guilty.

"AITA for saying that I barely have anything to do on my new job in front of my director and manager? Basically, my director, which I will call them B, (manager's boss) came in and ask me how I am doing so far as I just started my new position 3 weeks ago. I responded hastily saying I wish I had more to do but because this is a small org, I understand that there are not much things going on that could utilize my assistance. B then confronted my manager, which i will call A, saying why aren't you giving me more things to do? (Not in a harsh way just asking why). A said that they got other things to do and that there are not much tasks they can give me since I am still new and needed more admin privileges (I wouldn't give me admin privileges either if I were A so I understand). I also told B that A is busy with other projects as well.


I feel like I backstabbed/snitched on A because they've been so nice to me since my arrival, mentoring me whenever possible and making me feel welcomed to my new role.

"AITA FOR CALLINGS SPANISH SCARY? I know this sounds bad, but I don‚Äôt think it really is, but maybe I am just a straight up asshole. Today I (17F) was talking with one of my friends (17F)  and behind me someone I know (one of my friends (18F)) was talking to her mom on the phone in Spanish. (EDIT: ALSO BEFORE AND AFTER THIS CONVERSATION SHE WAS TALKING TO US IN A BIG GROUP AND WAS SAYING WHY SHE WAS MAD, I wasn‚Äôt just listening to her conversation she invited me in) She was whispering and was mad, so it sounded scary and I told her as a joke she sounded scary. She kind of got mad and said it was a micro-aggression, so I apologized but I was a little confused because I didn‚Äôt think it was that bad. I also clarified with her later I was talking about her tone of voice, not her speaking Spanish and she was still mad. If anyone is familiar with princes protection program on Disney, it sounded like the evil guy for reference. The only reason I didn‚Äôt think it was bad was because I was taking about her tone of voice, not just Spanish in general. Like in English you can make your voice sound very different, like for example very deep and scary or really high and 
Munchkin like and if someone said I sounded scary I wouldn‚Äôt think much of it, but also I am a white girl who has never experienced racism and I live in a very white town with little diversity. I just want to know if I was totally in the wrong and was a complete asshole because I do feel bad.


Also I know this all might sound stupid, but I just feel bad and anxious about this so I just want other peoples opinions.

Also I wish I could change the title, I didn‚Äôt call Spanish scary, I told her it was her tone of voice and has nothing to do with her speaking Spanish. I said ‚Äúthat was scary‚Äù after she got off the phone. I‚Äôve heard her speak multiple times to her mom on the phone and her tone never sounded like that, so I also had something to compare it too, it wasn‚Äôt just her regular speaking voice, she was mad and I could tell from her voice.

"AITA for lying to my boyfriend about another guy not wearing pants around me? edit\* I accidentally said boyfriend in the title but he's my husband

Okay so a little backstory, I (20f) am married (21m) and my husband is in the navy stationed on the other side of the country. I can't move with him until he graduates, so I decided to go ahead and finish my university credits until December when he graduates.

My brother (22) lives with his roommate (m22) in the town our university is in and because I didn't decide until way later, I couldn't get a dorm. My brother and I shared a bedroom growing up (small house and we're very close) so he and his roommate offered for me to stay with them for the semester free of charge. (I buy extra groceries or clean up more sometimes, they both have terrible adhd and i''m amazed they survived this long on their own).

Another piece of information that I feel is important is they're both gay. They actually dated for five years before breaking up but are still best friends. Their apartment had two bedrooms, so roommate (J) moved into that room and they have no issues. Honestly, it still feels like they're together sometimes. Anyway, my brother (H) and I share the master room and J lives in the room at the end of the hall.

I was on facetime with my husband as we do every night when J walked by in boxers and a hoody. It's still really warm where we live (high 90's every day) but they keep the apartment kind of cold, so we usually wear sweat pants / hoodies, but J gets hot really easily and usually either wears a hoody and boxers, sweatpants and no shirt, or no shirt. It doesn't bother me for several reasons. For one, he's never made me uncomfortable. He's been around since I was a freshman in highschool and he's always treated me like a little sister. Two, he's gay. Three, I've never been attracted to him.

My husband sees him walk by to fill his waterbottle and throws a fit. I was wearing headphones so J couldn't hear it, but hubby started demanding he put on pants. Throwing a huge fit about how it was 'inappropriate' for another man to be walking around 'half naked' around a lady, especially one who is married. I told him that this is J's apartment that he is graciously letting me live in for free, and i'm not going to tell him what to wear in it. My husband continued to freak out, so I just said okay and let that be the end of it.

Well, it happened again today (J was taking a dirty plate to the kitchen and going right back to his room) and my husband is livid. He says I lied to him by saying okay and not actually enforcing a pants-required rule. I yet again reminded him that this is not my home, and J definitely isn't doing it to bother me. He's currently not speaking to me because he says I've 'betrayed his trust'

My wife has a niece (5f). She was her niece's guardian from when the niece was 3 weeks old until her niece was almost 2. After she had to give her niece back to her brother and his girlfriend, she continued to watch her niece almost every day and had the niece sleep over occasionally, so she kept her niece's room. Her brother cut contact with us a shortly after my wife and I got married because niece said that she likes us better than her parents and told her dad that she wants to go home (our house). 

My wife has been a wreck since. She says it's like losing a child. She's been in therapy since her brother stopped letting her see/talk to her niece and is slightly better.

I told her that I understand she's hurting because she's not allowed to see her niece but her brother's been clean for 3 years now and I doubt he'll lose custody of niece again. 

She doubled down and said that she needs to keep her niece's room the way it is and said it's nonnegotiable. I told her the guest room is more important than her niece's room because most of my family lives in another state and they need somewhere to stay when they visit, and I doubt she'll see her niece for a long time so it doesn't make sense to keep her niece's room.

"AITA for pulling out my nintendo switch because my coworker was on her phone? So my coworker was on the phone at work, on speaker, talking about house hunting or whatever, something I could hear word for word, very loudly. 

While this was happening I pulled out my switch, trying to distract myself, I had forgotten my headphones this night, so I had nothing to listen to or do. (My switch was on silent.) 

This went on for at least 20 minutes, of her yelling at her speaker phone, bitching and whatnot. 

After this phone call, she had told me that I was being unprofessional, and unattentive.

Akira‚Äôs restaurant had to close due to the pandemic, so things have been tight for him.

We‚Äôve seen him a few times at his apartment since his restaurant closed, and he always charges us $50 each so he can cook for us. The last time we went though, it was just frozen Takoyaki (octopus in batter) and leftover wine from a night with his girlfriend.

My SO has always been close to Akira so he reached out to him ‚Äî he said he wants to see us, but we have to pay $50 each for dinner and also bring beer and snacks.

Akira is a good friend but I feel like he‚Äôs trying to take advantage of my SO (he‚Äôs an attorney) Akira is also retired and lives off his social security, so he is not rich. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs right to have to pay to see him, but I know he doesn‚Äôt have money. I don‚Äôt want to feel like he‚Äôs taking advantage of us.

"AITA for giving some tough love to my husband who lost his job recently So I recently got married and a few days after my husband got fired from his job. Of course he was saddened by the abrupt news but for me deep down I had a feeling it was coming. How? Because he had a meeting with his boss twice befire about his performance. There weren‚Äôt formal writeups but more of a ‚Äútalking to‚Äù. I warned my husband before that he needs to really should focus on his work.

I let him mope around for about a week and it‚Äôs been close to a month since the firing and he has been applying for jobs and has had a couple of interviews but still no job yet. He doesn't do well on the technical interviews and to me I think either getting a certificate or self teaching himself is better. I've never pressured him to find a job asap and if he needed, my income can support both of us.

Frequently in passing, he says ‚ÄúI really want a job‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm depressed‚Äù. I usually respond with ‚ÄúI'm sorry but I think you should work on getting a certification since I think what‚Äôs hindering you from getting a job is your lack or knowledge in the area‚Äù or ""maybe learn this to help you pass the technical test"". I've asked him if he really feels depressed and if he should talk to someone else and he says it's just the situation that he's in is what is making him sad. Now he's saying that I‚Äôm not being supportive or encouraging. I think he wants me to say ""I'm sure you'll find a job soon"" or other assurances but I honestly don't think saying that will actually get him a job because I think what he really lacks is the necessary skill which is why he got fired in the first place.

"AITA for not going to my finance's cousin's rehearsal dinner to attend a concert? Let me preface this by saying we are going to 3 others weddings together in the next couple of months.

Okay so my fiance's cousin is getting married in a couple weeks, and due to unfortunate timing I can't go to the wedding because one of my oldest friends is getting married the same day, 6 hours away. Both weddings are on Saturday, and her cousins rehearsal dinner is on Thursday. 

Now I have another friend who lives nearby the wedding I'm going to (totally different friend group, he's not going to the wedding). It just so happens that a band we like is playing in his town that Thursday night. Given that he lives 6 hours away and we don't see each other often, this was a pretty logistically simple plan that just kinda fell nicely into place. Gonna crash with him on Thursday after the concert and then head over to the wedding on Friday and have a nice relaxing day off before the wedding on Saturday.

Just this week my fiance said she would really like me to come to her cousins rehearsal dinner and then drive the 6 hours on Friday for my friends wedding. We see her cousins frequently, like once a month at least. I gey that it's a big day but my plans have been set for a couple months and this was sprung on me at the last minute. I don't think it's unreasonable for me to stick to my original plan but my fiance said I'm being a selfish ass.

So AITA for not going to the rehearsal dinner so I can see my friend and go to the show?

Edit: seems like early judgments side with me but I think I did leave out a couple important details. Firstly, my fiance is in the wedding party, so it's not at all odd that she's going to the rehearsal. Second, I didn't even know about the rehearsal being on Thursday until the other day. It's not like I knew it was a possibility and made other plans anyway. Third, I get on with her cousins fine, but they make very little effort, it's all because my fiance is a proactive and thoughtful person. Whenever we see them it's at a restaurant, or their house, or another family member. They have literally not once stepped foot into my home even though we've lived together for over 3 years. I know I would be there to support my fiance more than anything else, just feels like I don't need to bend over backwards for her cousins, who don't ever for me (not that I ask them to).",0.27
"AITA For ruining my girlfriend's good day? The good day starts with me asking her to get some stuff done around the house while I'm at work. Cleaning the bathroom and laundry and such. We have a little date night planned after I get home. 

She gets all the stuff done around the house, showers, dresses up for date night, and I pick her up right after work. She's feeling good about how productive she was and she's looking forward to having dinner at this fancy restaurant on the other side of town we've been wanting to try. We get there and dinner was awesome, absolutely delicious. 

She's having such a good day feeling accomplished and happy and we finally get home and start getting ready for bed when I notice some crumbs. She had been eating chicken and fries in bed. Normally not too big an issue if you're being careful, and crumbs are easy to wipe off, but it only started with just some crumbs and me telling her to be more careful eating in bed. 

I start to arrange my blanket and I flip over a clump of french fries. Again, I tell her to please be more careful when she's eating in bed. She sighs and says she's sorry, she didn't know they were there. I said that's the problem, you should know where your food is and keep it on the plate. She doesn't like that and says it's fine and that she already said she's sorry so just leave it. She asks me to put the last of the clean clothes away so we can go to bed. 

As I'm putting the clothes away I find more fries, and a greasy chicken wing in the pile. (The pile was on the bed before being put away) I pull out the food and look at her and say, ""seriously?"" 

At this point I had raised my voice and she had started tearing up. She says, ""how was I supposed to know those were in there?"" I tell her that not knowing it fell off isn't an excuse. She should keep her plate under control and not lose track of her food in the first place. She wants me to just stop and go to bed. I take the clothes that were in contact with the food and put them back in the dirty hamper. She huffs about how I ruined such a good day for her and says I'm being an asshole and why did I have to bring this up right before bed? Why couldn't I just let it go? I tell her I don't care if it's after a good day, I'm not going to sleep with spilled food in my bed.

Our son Jacob is 3. We live together on our own with him and a couple months ago I proposed to my girl. It‚Äôs gonna be a wedding with like 100 guests, many of them are my family that live in different states. We‚Äôre not close but for big family moments (i mean like weddings or funerals) everyone gets together. Idk why but since we started talking about the wedding my mom kept saying my son should be left with his babysitter so everyone can enjoy and he‚Äôs not bored at some adult party. But me and my fianc√©e want him there to share our special moment. Her older sister says she‚Äôll watch him and obviously we‚Äôll be there too so there really isn‚Äôt a reason for us not to include him. She still wasn‚Äôt letting this go. My mom was really insisting on it.

Then I found out the reason why was she doesn‚Äôt want the family to know about my son. As in my parents never told them that my girl and I had a baby together. She says it would be embarrassing, they don‚Äôt want to focus on that at my wedding and having others in the family maybe judging for having a baby ‚Äúout of wedlock.‚Äù And also obviously they don‚Äôt want them finding out that they omitted this info since my parents are the ones who talk to them all the time. We both were mad at eachother. She was still insisting that we leave our son with someone.

Best of the moment I told her and my dad since he was on the same boat with her that they not allowed at my wedding anymore. My fianc√©e wants to stand by what I decide. She‚Äôs mad about what they did too since it feels like they‚Äôve been fake with my son if this is how they‚Äôre acting about him with everyone in my family. We talked a couple more times about it with my parents but I still feel like my answer the same since they keep saying the same about my son not going. It‚Äôs dividing some of us.

Because of the multiple lockdowns, our usual visitation schedule got muddled up and now my ex just drops in whenever he is free to see our son to make up for the time he missed. Today he came over while our son was eating lunch. He started playing with him while he was eating and I asked him not to because when he gets excited, our son (he‚Äôs 2) has a habit of throwing food around. He kept telling me our son never did that around him so when our son got a little overly excited and picked up some food and smeared it on his clothes I started laughing. Our son tried to do it a second time, but he caught his hands before he could.  

My ex didn‚Äôt find it as funny as me. He got angry at me for laughing and then got even angrier when I told him to keep his clothes on and that I wasn‚Äôt going to help him get the stain out, even though he had a meeting he had to go to soon. In the end, his assistant brought him a new shirt to change into before the meeting, so it wasn‚Äôt a huge deal, but he‚Äôs still upset at me.

"AITA for telling my Stepdaughter to leave? This is a throwaway. My stepdaughter is 17  and I married my wife when SD was 13. We have a daughter who is 3.

My SD does not know her dad and has never met him. My wife really struggled to make ends meet so my SD didn‚Äôt grow up with much and I know she was bullied for it. My wife busted her ass and there were times she went hungry so SD could eat.Things are better now with two incomes.

My SD get along but we are not close and she told me she is happy for her mom.

Two nights ago, My SD had a breakdown. She was sobbing and could barely breathe. Like it was bad. She told her mom that she wished that she was never born and that her mom should have had an abortion. She said its so unfair that everyone was so mean to her because she never had anything when she was little and it was so hard not having any friends. She said its not fair that she has to watch my daughter get everything while she struggles with not knowing if she will be able to afford college (I will be paying).She said she‚Äôs tired of going on vacations that catered to the baby and that she wants to go on a vacation for her. She said she was clearly the f\*\*\* up child and that my daughter was the redo baby and that It was cruel to make her watch. She said it was not fair that she had to be born and know that she was not as worth it. She called her mom a w\*\*\*\* for sleeping with a deadbeat and getting pregnant so young (18).

She has never shared anything like this before and were shocked. My wife was sobbing. I was angry because it was obvious my wife did her best and her life has been better for the past 4 years.

I told her to leave the house until she could calm down and she went to my cousins house (my cousin grew up with a single mom and bonded with SD). She still hasn‚Äôt returned and won‚Äôt speak to us and my wife is miserable. My cousin said it was wrong to kick out a child who was clearly distressed.

So AITA?

edit: I didn't mean for her to not come back. By leave, I meant to go on a walk/run just until she calmed down so that we could talk. I didn't mean for her to go to my cousin's home and not come back.

edit 4: got her to come home and she told us a lot about what happened in those years that she was hiding from her mom because she didn't want her to worry. I feel awful. going to take care of her for the rest of my life. they lived in a very bad area and the woman who used to watch her had Sex for money while SD was there. Her teachers have said horrible things to her. Her classmates parents never let their kid be friends with her. Kids at school used to take her lunch and told her she better get used to not eating. Someone told her its good that she's good at gymnastics because maybe she'll get into college or use her flexibility to have another job. Im sick to my stomach. There's more. Ofc she's traumatized.

edit 5: told her therapy is non-negotiable and that we are pulling the parent card. Taking her out for a shopping spree and planning a vacation for the three of us (no baby).

"AITA for telling ex wife our child‚Äôs behavior is a mom/daughter issue? My (42 M) ex (40F) & I have 2 kids (M11) (F9). Lets call my ex E, my daughter M, & my son J. We got divorced 4.5 years ago, after I had an affair. I take full responsibility for my mistake. I regret it deeply & wish I‚Äôd been mature enough to tell E I wasn‚Äôt happy. We tried for a year to fix our marriage. We went to couples therapy to try to work it out. E said for the sake of the kids divorce would be harmful, but also, she‚Äôd never trust me again. After a year, I filed it. I‚Äôm not proud of cheating. I apologized to E in therapy. But E said I abandoned her & the kids. 

When I moved into my new house, M (then 6) really struggled. She acted out, was angry & sad. I‚Äôd say it took about 20 months for us all to really adjust, & over time I saw her sadness & anger fade. As she‚Äôs grown older, we‚Äôve talked more about it. She says she‚Äôs sad she can‚Äôt have access to both parents all the time, but she likes her life at both houses. 

Soon it will be 4 full years in my new house, 5 minutes away from E‚Äôs house, 50/50 custody. I love raising M & J, & watching them flourish. They‚Äôre both amazing & I‚Äôm happy! M is really close to me. When she‚Äôs cranky we‚Äôve worked on using words to communicate how she's feeling, or to take deep breaths. M, to me, seems well adjusted & happy. 

But E still says that M is not, & that it‚Äôs my fault because of the divorce. About 2-3x a year I get an email saying M misbehaved badly at her house. Last week she said from an email ‚ÄúYou probably don‚Äôt believe me, but M‚Äôs always yelling & takes it out on J. She hits him then storms off shouting idiot over & over. Then she completely wrecks her room, & tells me her room represents how she feels: bad. She told me she wanted to die.‚Äù E believes something is going on at my house that is making M upset & asks that I tell her. She said ‚Äúshe‚Äôs taking it out on me & her brother because we‚Äôre her safe space.‚Äù 

When communicating I use language like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm really sorry M is acting that way at your house. I am not dismissing your claims, it sounds really hard for both you & M. I can help get M set up with therapy.‚Äù Then she emails back saying I don‚Äôt understand & my advice isn‚Äôt helpful. 

This week I reached out to M‚Äôs school counselor & teacher. I told them I‚Äôm not seeing these behaviors at my house, but I want to make sure M is ok & to set up counseling for her. The school told both me & E they‚Äôre not seeing these behaviors either, & it sounds like it‚Äôs an issue between the mom & daughter. If we make it a big deal at school & my house, then M might feel worse. 

Well E flipped out at me, said I exaggerated M‚Äôs words about wanting to die, got the school involved too much, & ‚Äúthat I‚Äôm not taking responsibility for M's behavior.‚Äù I‚Äôm not seeing these behaviors at my house or in school.

"AITA for wanting support payment on time Needing some input
My ex and I have recently separated. We have a child together and were together almost 10 years. Although I worked more hours and was responsible for the drop off and pick up of our child and all our needs he was the bread winner. I put my school on hold which lead to my career being put on the back burner. I only recently found out he had been cheating during the entirety of our relationship. He always withheld money from me and now know it was going to his ‚Äúout of town‚Äù experiences. I left when I realized my car was about to be repossessed, our joint account drained as always, all of the bills in my name were being unpaid and he put it on me for dying my hair every 6 months. It wasn‚Äôt because of his new truck, quads, his activities, etc. He makes a lot more then myself but I have managed to pay all my bills and the rent that is more the half of one pay cheque. All I asked was for child support to be paid on the 1st of every month. Since it is shared custody it‚Äôs not an outrageous amount to be paid. Last month he had to split the payments and I agreed as he promised he would be able to pay the full amount on the 1st of this month. I waited all day for payment so I could pay rent and get groceries. It wasn‚Äôt until later in the evening that he told me he wasn‚Äôt going to pay the full amount because he‚Äôs going on vacation. (I agreed to take our child an extra couple of days on his week so he could go). I told him he would have to pay in full as he said he would make payment and I made arrangements for it. He told me it was not going to happen, I didn‚Äôt know what else to do because he‚Äôs putting me in a bind and told him he would have to pick up our child for his week. 
I would love to have our child all the time, I hate that I had to use the child like that but I felt I was being taken advantage of and it was going to continue to happen if I didn‚Äôt put my foot down.

"AITA for Not Sharing First Prize? I (male, 30) took part in a Magic the Gathering Tournament two weeks ago. A Pre-Release for the new set. Admittingly, it has been maybe 6 years since I last played, but I seek to get back into playing at a local game store I haven't played at before.

The tournament gave you six packs of cards to build a deck of 40 out of then, and it was a brand new set meaning everyone was pretty much on the same playing field. No advantages or disadvantages other than luck of the draw and knowledge of the game.

To say the six packs I was given were gold would be an understatement. Three Mythic Cards, one of which was holographic, and 4 of the same card pretty much guaranteed my victory of the whole thing. I kind of feel bad about how exactly one-sided the matches were, but I was out of practice and could have easily made a mistake.

The final round I was competing for first and second place. The one I was playing against, Chad, offered to just name me the winner without playing against each other, as he was certain I would win. We would split the prize pool of first and second prize, both of us getting 10 packs each. If I won fair and square, I would have got 12 packs, while losing would mean I only got 8 packs.

Since I was more there for fun and just to get back into the game, I denied the offer. I thought this would be Ok, because it still gave him a chance to win more packs than he expected. To his credit, he did win one round due to a poor draw on my half, but in the end I won the Match and the 12 packs.

My prize packs were meh, and I asked Chad if he got anything good.

""Would have got better stuff if we shared.""

Oooook?

Next week, I went to the draft that was being held at the same location. I learned that they played a format I still have legal decks for (Commander), so I wanted to join in a few matches before the main event. The table (which included Chad) refused to let me play. It was discouraging, but I let it slide. Just awkwardly stood around and watched.

This week, I went back again hoping to play, but I was told the following. This is word for word.

""You're a good player, but we feel you take the game too seriously to play with us. Your deck during the pre-release was too competitive, and you could have just shared the prize with Chad but instead you made him feel bad.""

I am at a loss. They are saying I am too competitive, but they started talking about travelling two provinces over to participate in Grand Prixs. I'm just going to have fun, but I feel like a fish out of water. Last week I got absolutely devastated at the draft and still had a lot of fun, but now I am feeling bad for winning the tournament the first time I participated. Maybe I broke some sort of unwritten rule or cliche or something, but I feel uncomfortable going back. I don't know, but I want to ask before I try another gaming store.

Am I the Asshole?

**Editted to Add:** Some people are asking about the Store Owners. They are wonderful people and were the official judges of the event. During the second week I was there they actually gave me free cards after I shown my Commander Deck. They were the ones who directed me towards Chad's table and his friends. (One of them quite an old card, Zombie Master, but someone was stupid enough to do their own custom full art on a $50 card and the store legally couldn't sell it competitively. But they said it should still be good if I have it in a sleeve. They are also on the look out for a ""Chancellor of the Forge"" for my Goblin Deck)

When I approached the table, and asked if I could join, they said they were at capacity. The Judge/owner said they could split off into two groups of three but they refused, staying in one group of five and one group of four.

Rather then going down next Friday, I am heading down tomorrow and ask the judges whats up, and see if they have anymore insight. The Store Owners/Judges, I really don't want to hold this against them because they seem like wonderful people. Will update when I have an answer.

**Update:** So a lot of people is immediately jumping on the band wagon and saying Chad's a Jerk. A couple people however offered some sound advice (which was mostly what I was looking for) and explained the PreReleases are not very competitive and that Sharing First, especially between friends, is actually a fairly common practice.

Some people seems to think that Chad was extending an Olive Branch, which could be the case, but I am still somewhat uncertain. There is still the matter of him sulking at the end, saying ""He would have got better cards if we split"" which is still a bit of a red flag to me. As I said, I'm going to speak to the store owners, see if perhaps there are other groups in the same venue I can participate in or if he thinks I can mend the bad first impression I might have inflicted.

Also, some players who play the game wonder how my combo. It was ""Brutal Carther"" with ""The Celetrus"", two ""Otherwordly Gazes"" and 2 ""Considers"" to go thru my deck, and a bunch of Counter Spells, four Component Collects to tap/untap things on the enemy side.",0.33

"WIBTA for bringing neighbor‚Äôs dog to an animal shelter as it seems they don‚Äôt care for the dog. I(23F) live in a neighborhood where there are some neighbors who own cats and/or dogs, and for the most part they are pretty well behaved. Though our neighbors who live in a house behind our house owns two dogs, and it seems that they managed to create a big enough space between our fences that one of the dogs were able to slip out and run from the house.

The dog in question, Rosie, is a two year old medium sized sweetheart who looks like could be a Doberman mix. Though she keeps managing to escape from her home and hang out at my family‚Äôs house, this has happened multiple times, and the neighbors barely try to get the dog back (the first time it happened, the neighbors were apparently away from the house, but their daughter was home and it was a few days before they got their dog back to the house). The second time however, was on the day of my great grandmother‚Äôs funeral, so we weren‚Äôt able to take care of the dog at the time. 

Once more, it has been nearly a week since it happened, and they only made one attempt to get the dog back and she managed to escape again 5 minutes later and was whining at our house.

I understand that the dog belongs to the neighbors, but I believe that they truly don‚Äôt want the dog, so WIBTA if my family brings Rosie to a non kill shelter? If I atm, what other things can I do to help the dog?

ETA: I apologize for not explaining this properly!

First, We wouldn‚Äôt be able to keep the dog as my dad doesn‚Äôt want to keep it, our neighbors already tried asking if we wanted to keep it and my dad refused. We also already tried asking our other family members if they would want to keep her, there was no luck.

Second, we would warn the neighbors first, and if they don‚Äôt do anything still, we‚Äôd bring her to a non kill shelter, as we wouldn‚Äôt be able to properly provide for Rosie.

This is my first post on here, and I‚Äôm not the best with explaining things, so I really am sorry for my shit explanation the first time!

Update!:

From what I heard from my mom, after nearly two weeks of Rosie being loose, the neighbors finally got her and are currently keeping her in a cage. I‚Äôm thankful that Rosie Isn‚Äôt on the loose anymore, I just hope that she‚Äôll be ok. Thank you so much to everyone for the judgement, I will try to do more research on animal shelters and laws in my area in case this occurs again!",0.6
"WIBTA if I skip my Dads 65th birthday party Dads birthday is tomorrow. I (20 M) heard two weeks ago the party was this Sunday (tomorrow), but said immediately I had a big exam this Wednesday and will likely be too busy. For context, I‚Äôm a mathematics student pretty far along in college. I‚Äôm in my senior year taking multiple graduate math courses. It‚Äôs a big deal for me to do well in these courses, but they are a lot of work. I tend to be very busy normally, but the exam this Wednesday is what really puts me off from going. Even if I would only be there like 3 hours. 

Additionally, until literally 1 hour ago my Dad was fine with me not going. His wife and my brother both really want me to come, both have called me today asking me to come. My Dad‚Äôs best friend called me about 4 hours ago asking me to come. After that, I called my Dad and ensured he was fine. He told me not to worry about it, school is priority, I‚Äôd see him soon. Then about 2 hours later he called back saying he thought about it more and thinks I should go. He thinks I should just make space for it, and that stuff like that is important in life.

Update:
Hi, wanted to make a quick update. Was surprised by some of the responses in that they didn‚Äôt sound like responses from people who know what it‚Äôs like to take college courses. 
I just see the exam as something which potentially can affect my entire life, while this dinner will be similar to the next dinner I have with my Dad. I will add I do see my Dad about once a week, most recently three days ago. 
Either way, because of all the responses, I decided I‚Äôll just go to the dinner. I‚Äôll post another update after my exam to say whether I failed or not, and if I think the roughly 3 hours mattered.

Update 2:
Hi, so I‚Äôm sitting here exhausted. I have about three hours before I should go to bed, I‚Äôve done about half of the minimum amount of studying I wanted to do. So basically I‚Äôm behind, and I‚Äôm too tired to catch up fully. The dinner ended up taking about 5 hours total, but roughly it cut into my work time by about 6 hours. The 3 assignments I had did not go well, which was my expectation, so those took about 16 hours to catch up on. Still haven‚Äôt finished one of them, but I did enough where I know I can do it before it‚Äôs due tomorrow night. I‚Äôve probably only done about 5 hours of studying, and it‚Äôs been slow since I‚Äôm so tired. I‚Äôve done like 21 hours of math in the past 2 days, which really is a lot. 

Nothing eventful happened at the dinner. My Dad told me he only asked me to come because everyone else was on him about it. Which isn‚Äôt surprising to me, I know my Dad pretty well, big shock. 

My Dad also apologized to me because on the phone he basically said I should just play less video games so I‚Äôd have time for the dinner. The next day he remembered I don‚Äôt have any video games at school because I‚Äôm too busy to play and they are distracting. So I leave consoles at home. So that was a little funny thing I guess. 

So basically I am behind on my work. Even if the exam goes well tomorrow, that‚Äôs purely luck at this point. So overall not exactly happy with the choice to go to the dinner. 

I‚Äôll try to get another hour of studying in, but I need to stop soon or else my brain will be too fried tomorrow. This was a good break to write though. 

Also, to the one person who basically said I may not be cut out for math if the dinner really impacts my exam, just want you to know I‚Äôm taking graduate courses for a reason. I am rather good at math, but it doesn‚Äôt mean the courses aren‚Äôt hard. 

I‚Äôll probably do one more update after the exam just to say how it went, whether I was overly concerned or not. Fingers crossed.

Final Update:
Took me a while to write this. Was busy the past few days. Short story, I walked out of the exam thinking I aced it. About an hour later I heard from a friend I did something wrong. And then the next day I heard something else was off. So it looks like I‚Äôm gonna get about a 60% on this exam. So yeah, not exactly happy. Wish I had more time to study for it. Luckily, I haven‚Äôt heard of anyone getting everything right, and the grades are based on the top score in the class. So maybe everyone got a question wrong. Keep in mind one question is like 25% of the grade.

So yeah, bit of a shit week. Could lead to my first B in a math course in my college career. The bright side is this weekend I only had 2 math homework‚Äôs instead of 3. So it‚Äôs basically a vacation for me this weekend. 

Anywho, thanks to all those who commented. This post really sped up my thoughts, saved me a lot of time.",0.71

"AITA for making my future mother in law insecure about her relationship? This woman is always making little jabs at me. She‚Äôs not vicious. That‚Äôs genuinely just how she is. If I needed something I could ask her for it. BUT at times the little remarks do hurt my feelings. 

I was drunk at a family gathering recently and she asked me why I was holding my boyfriend‚Äôs hand like it was weird. I said ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt hold your man‚Äôs hand? You might wanna look into that.‚Äù I was joking‚Ä¶ but not really. Then her man got up and left. She didn‚Äôt say anything. My happy drunk self went and sat at the uno table to play a game.

"AITA for being mad at my best friend for wanting to hang out with her boyfriend instead of me? About two years ago I moved to a new area about 30 minutes away from the area I grew up in and I haven‚Äôt seen my best friends much since, since I still can‚Äôt drive. 
My best friend, let‚Äôs call her L, got a boyfriend about a month ago and she sees him practically everyday (including some weekends). 
Every time I call her now she starts telling me that she was on the phone with her boyfriend. She only calls me in the mornings before class now and always promises to call in the afternoon but never does. 

Yesterday I was in the area for testing and a week prior I had asked her and my other two best friends if they wanted to hang out after our exam since I hadn‚Äôt seen them in almost 3 months. They all said yes but after the exam two of them were exhausted and went home so it was just me and L. 
I was a little bummed but still happy that I could spend time with L, or so I thought. 

After my other two friends went home L told me that she was suppose to go back to the school to help with a choir thing. Apparently she wasn‚Äôt required to and told me that she just wanted to go back to hang out with her boyfriend and one of our mutual guy friends. I was kind of hurt when she said she had nothing better to do and tried to hint at her that I just wanted her to spend time with me. I had even told her r earlier that day that I didn‚Äôt want to meet her boyfriend that same day but she forced me to.

"AITA My Son Refused To Borrow My Clean Underwear My 12 year old son's been spending way too much time on Youtube and Fornight. It's past time that I insist on healthier choices from him, as to how to spend his days. Each time I attempt to get him on a bike, gym matt, or go outdoors and move a little...I get excuses and pushback.  It‚Äôs becoming increasingly more difficult with each passing day, getting him off screens without tears and mini meltdowns. Today, his reason for not wanting to go shoot hoops and get a smoothie is that he had no clean underwear. We wear the same size and brand. I told him he could borrow a pair of mine, they had just been washed. My wife does all the laundry. He freaked out. I hit a regrettable level of frustration, after enduring his lethargy for a long time now. I asked my wife to voice her opinion, hoping she‚Äôd back me. I was disappointed and surprised that she took his side in front of him.  According to her, no kid would agree to wear his dad's freshly washed underwear. To be fair, I can't say 100 pct. that I wouldn't have thought twice about it as a 12 year old, but don't think I would have.

"WIBTA if I emailed my therapist? mobile post

I (f22) started seeing my therapist ‚ÄúLinda‚Äù during college at 19. She is trained in EMDR therapy which is uncommon, and since I have CPTSD this has been a lot of help. 

Anywho, I googled Linda a few days ago as I have been wanting to begin our sessions again after taking some time off due to COVID and life just getting busy. A website popped up called ‚Äòcertain political ideology‚Äô therapists. The homepage begins ‚ÄúDear American Patriots‚Äù so I‚Äôm sure you can read between the lines. The website was created this year and her husband is one of the creators, she is listed as a potential therapist to choose from.

I cannot stress how much I don‚Äôt think political affiliation matters when it comes to mental health treatment, which is why I find Linda‚Äôs website to be so alarming. They specify that if they have liberal clients, they do share at least some conservative values, which indicates their belief that your political ideology must align with their own for them to treat you. The website publicly denounces my way of thinking, labeling it as abusive and the voice of censorship.

Under Linda, she lists ‚ÄùConservative Issues You are Most Affirming of: Support for Law Enforcement Officers and Military Personnel, Second Amendment Rights, Pro-Life, Pro-Capitalism (Against Marxist/Socialist Agendas), Pro-Nuclear Family‚Äù, and that‚Äôs the tip of the iceberg (WC). Imagine if I had gone to her after having an abortion, seeking guidance and she turns around and says I don‚Äôt agree with your actions. I feel like I‚Äôm owed a disclosure to some extent if her practice operates with politics in mind.

I also found an article where Linda mentions how the constant urge to avoid potentially offending people from groups labeled as oppressed can lead to codependency‚Ä¶ like wtf?! If that‚Äôs what she believes codependency is, then her personal values bleed directly into her care.

Idk if I‚Äôm being a drama queen but I am upset because I have spent years developing a vulnerable relationship with her and I don‚Äôt want and start all over with someone new. I showed the website to my parents, boyfriend, and a few friends, they were horrified and told me I should email her asking about the website and express my concerns. I feel like I‚Äòd be an asshole because to her credit I never felt like her ideologies or political affiliation impacted my treatment. She really helped me, but at the same time, I never went to her regarding anything that could be deemed political. 

I just feel so caught off guard and am looking for a way to rationalize salvaging the relationship but I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm capable of doing that without addressing what I know now and why it makes me uncomfortable. Do I even have a right to feel this way? Am I being insanely biased? 

I don't want to have a political debate, and please do not try to google my therapist and then contact her, that would be insanely disrespectful and honestly weirdo behavior. I just want to ask a question and receive an objective answer, no drama :)",0.12
AITA for not going on vacation early with my boyfriend and his mom I female (17) am supposed to go on vacation with my boyfriend (18) and his mom for a long weekend.

"AITA adopted child conversation My wife and I adopted our son 11 years ago.  He know he‚Äôs adopted and we have  talked about his birth mother and how much she loved him and she wanted to give him a better life-which is true.  
We decided not to tell him that he has 2 1/2 brothers and a full sister ( a baby she had after he was given up for adoption).  Our reason was that we thought it was too complex for a child so young and that we would fill in the blanks when he was more mature.  We would also support him reaching out to his birth parents who are in another country once he was a young adult and mature enough to handle such a meeting. 
My son was asking questions in the car today which is completely normal and my wife decided to tell him the whole story. He came home crying trying to understand why he was given away and his siblings were not ( a very normal reaction).  I am livid - we just moved 6 weeks ago so he‚Äôs been going through a lot of adjustment - new school, new sports etc.   and now is stressing over this- my my wife says I‚Äôm over reacting and she didn‚Äôt want to lie to him - my point is that she should have explained in that this was something we needed to talk about as a family and at least consulted me to get my view as to best way to answer questions like this.

"AITA for reporting my college roommates' underage drinking? I (19F) recently transferred to a different university for my second year of college and am living in an on-campus apartment with two other girls. I'm not great friends with them; we don't often talk since I'm mostly in my room but they seem to have been friends since they moved in, about a week before I did.

From the beginning I was aware they drank, and one of them smokes weed in her room. I didn't really have a problem with it‚ÄîI mind my business, and it has nothing to do with me‚Äîbut the drinking has caused some issues.

Recently, I was woken up at 4 am, the day of an exam, by drunken yelling in the living room. They had invited multiple other people over. My room is on the end, so I can hear pretty clearly what goes on out there. This was not the first time their drinking behaviors have bothered me, but it was the most severe. We agreed since I moved in to keep noise down, especially late at night, considering I am obviously the most impacted by it. I proceeded after this incident to text them both in our group chat about this, and made it clear that we had discussed the issue beforehand. They didn't respond.

Two days ago, I realized my text had made little impact. One of my roommates had her boyfriend staying with her for multiple days on end, and my other roommate is clearly friends with them both. I'm not sure how late they were up, but they all hung out in the living room for a while, playing music and drinking. I simply decided to deal with it that time. But I woke up the next morning to empty alcohol cans piled on top of the trash cans and a sticky note saying ""We agreed to rotate through taking out the trash"" to tell me it was my turn to do so. I have indeed agreed to this, but they have failed to communicate with me who had taken out the trash before and when. I've suggested that we write a schedule, but to no avail.

So, when I got home after classes today I decided to go to the office in our building and report their underage drinking. The RA who came to our apartment saw the alcohol in the fridge. Me and the one roommate who was home had to poor it out‚Äîactually, she was told to, but made me help her for some reason. Since I had told the RA that I was concerned about retaliation, when my roommate asked if someone had reported he made the excuse that he came because he had heard a noise. I'm not sure how believable it is, to be honest.

I'm pretty sure my roommates have put two and two together. They were talking in one of their rooms just after the RA left. 

I plan on holding my ground and denying any claims that I reported, again because I fear their possible retaliation. I could understand them feeling like I'm a snitch trying to reign in their fun, or just a stickler for rules, but I've never expressed any such things. I only reported because I feel uncomfortable in this situation and my efforts to communicate with them about it have done nothing to change it.

"AITA for rehoming my cat? Hi everyone. I won't be using names or genders in this post.

When I was 7 years old (I'm 21 now), my mother decided to adopt a 2 year old cat from a rescue centre. This cat had previously been a street cat. Despite my various attempts to become ""friends"" with the cat, it never really took to me. By this I mean that it would never let me near it's food, would hiss at me if I went near it's belongings, and would claw at me if I petted it in the wrong place. We eventually learned to coexist.

Recently, I encountered a stray Bulldog in our local park. After taking this dog to our local vets, doing the appropriate checks, and ensuring that no one wanted to claim the dog, I decided to adopt the dog, since I didn't want it to end up in the system. My family was ok with me adopting it. The cat, however, was not. We made sure to keep the dog away from the cat behind closed doors during the adjustment period, we tried to introduce them via smells, but to no avail. Eventually we accepted that they'd never be best of friends. However, the cat began to actively seek out the dog to threaten it. There would be times where I'd be playing with my dog on the floor, and the cat would began hissing at us both. This came to a head when the dog was sleeping on the sofa, and the cat leapt at him.

I'm normally of the opinion that the older pet should stay if a situation arises where one would need to be rehomed. However, sending my dog back into the system on account of the cat trying to hurt him seemed like an awful thing to do. I voiced my concerns to my mother, who agreed with me, since I think, as bad as it sounds, she was just waiting for the cat to die, since she felt bad for it. We took the cat to our local animal shelter.

My friend recently called me to say that she saw my cat on the shelters website. When I told her what had happened, she blew up at me, saying that I'm ""disgusting"" for choosing an ""ugly"" breed of dog over my cat, and that I'm a terrible pet owner. I would go into more detail about what she said, but I'm aware there's a character limit.

AITA?

EDIT: My ""friend"" has said that she will adopt the cat. I'm no longer speaking to her as of now, and I also don't want anything to do with the cat, but maybe the overreactors can stop sending me threats in my dm's now. :)",0.89

"AITA for not keeping in contact with my inlaws anymore? Hello all! Sorry for the long post. I would like your help to see if I am an asshole or not. Please bear with me as english is not my 1st language.

Me and my husband have 2 boys (3y, 11mos). We just celebrated our oldest son‚Äôs birthday last weekend. Weeks before the party, we made it clear to our parents (both mine‚Äôs and his) that it is a children‚Äôs party and to not invite anyone else. Reason mainly is to lessen the possible risk of exposure to covid, considering that most children there are unvaccinated. Also, we want to keep the numbers to a minimum ‚Äòcus our house is not that big to facilitate a large crowd. 

Days before the party, my inlaws asked my husband if they could bring 2 guests. These guests are from another city, who came over to do an agency shift in a hospital in our city (they work as a nurse) and they are strangers to us. We said NO to this and reminded them of what we said before.

On the day of the party, me and my husband are quite shocked to see my inlaws arrive with not only 2 guests, but 3. Worse they came straight to our house after finishing their shift in the hospital. The other children‚Äôs parents also expressed their concerns to us about it. My husband talked to my MIL privately to ask what is going on and she just ignored him.

The day after the party, my husband called my MIL to ask her about it. My MIL became angry and said that it already happened and there‚Äôs nothing they can do about it. My FIL started raising his voice in the background and they ended the call without my husband explaining his side and concerns. FIL then proceeded to bombard our family group chat (his side) with messages about us. Basically saying that we might as-well not invite them next time and if we do, they are not attending (it‚Äôs my youngest‚Äôs birthday soon). He also sweared at us and said that my husband has no right to speak to his mother(MIL) like that. My husband hasn‚Äôt even spoken a full sentence when they started yelling at him and ended the call. My husband‚Äôs siblings were so lost at my FIL‚Äôs messages that they started calling my husband. My husband explained to them what happened. We also just found out that FIL deleted my children‚Äôs netflix sub account in his account (he offered for us to use it before and he even made a sub account for my kids). I don‚Äôt understand this, are they bringing my kids into this?

I am so shocked and angry at the whole situation because this is not the 1st time this happened - them bringing a guest to our house without notifying us first. They treat our house as an extension to theirs (I am not going into that as it‚Äôs another whole can of worms) I feel like they don‚Äôt respect our wishes and boundaries and is willing to compromise our children‚Äôs safety for these strangers. I haven‚Äôt spoken and contacted them since, nor I even want to, ‚Äòcus I am fed up with them overstepping their boundaries. His family thinks that we are assholes for not apologising to the inlaws and not contacting them.

"AITA for missing my girlfriend‚Äôs brother‚Äôs wedding to study for exams? My (23M) girlfriend (23F) have been dating for 3 years. We were recently invited to my girlfriends older brothers wedding, which is taking place in a city two hours away from us, in mid December. The idea would be to go to the wedding then stay the night at a hotel before going back early morning to study again.

The problem is this: the two of us are in law school. For those of you who don‚Äôt know, law classes generally administer a single 3-4 hour exam for each class, each worth 100% of your grade at the end of the semester. My last exam is two days after the wedding day, while her last exam is three days after.

Knowing our situation, my girlfriend asked how I felt about going, and I said I felt like I couldn‚Äôt because I‚Äôd be too stressed out. For starters, I didn‚Äôt too too well in my first year, which has greatly impacted my ability to get jobs and internships in a field that‚Äôs hyper competitive. It‚Äôs my goal to do as well as possible this year in order to bring my GPA up. I‚Äôm concerned also about the amount of time studying I will lose simply commuting and preparing for the wedding,not to mention having to potentially study in a hotel room instead of the library.Finally, even if we left early the next day, I‚Äôm worried I will still be exhausted from the celebrations to effectively study the day before my exam.

"WIBTA? Stood up to my mom at a restaurant on her bday and now no one gets to go out to dinner on their bday My mom's birthday was in late July. It's a tradition to go out to dinner to the place of their choice. My dad was pushing that we go out and my mom didn't seem really in the mood but said okay. As the hostess is leading us to a booth, my mom is ragging in my ear every five seconds not to tell them that it's her birthday (they'd announce it to the whole restaurant, grab lighting fixtures and wave them around, all that jazz) and I laugh but don't say anything.

You can hear others are getting their birthdays shouted out. I laugh, shake my head and look up at our fixture. I wonder if one's ever fallen down. This prompts mom to hiss at me again while she's showing coupons for a free appetizer for her birthday to the server. I laughingly say, ""Why would I need to tell them? You already have.""

After the appetizer is served, she's still sniping about it. This has gone on for nearly 30 minutes. I'm sick of hearing it.

What did I do? I tell her quietly but firmly, ""If you don't stop with this, I'm going to ask them to box up my meal, pay for it and I'm going to get an Uber home.""

She immediately stops talking and doesn't say anything for the rest of the meal. Neither does my dad. I realized she's probably embarrassed but I don't apologize. We'd told her we weren't going to say anything at least twice. Since she doesn't seem interested in talking or being nice at all, I don't address her for the rest of the evening.

Fast forward to my birthday on October 1st, a Friday. I have been expecting the whole day that we are going to go out for a meal but I don't feel well. I tell my dad that I'd like to go out for my birthday during the weekend. He tells me we'll be ordering whatever I want to go and eat here. I insist that I do want to go out, I'm just not feeling up to it that day. He repeats what he said before. I'm tired, I've had a lousy day at work, I've got a headache and I don't understand what's happening.

My mom then tells me the same thing. We're not going out for my birthday, period. By this time, I'm in tears because my head hurts so bad and I'm confused and hurt. Then she tells me *why*:

""We're never going out to eat on anyone's birthday again because my *mine* was so horrible. No one spoke to me. I'm never doing that again.""

I cried but I went along with it this time.

She is basically punishing us by destroying a tradition we've had my entire life because she had *one* birthday that she was unhappy about. She does this kind of thing for everything where she's unhappy with how things went for her. Someone makes a comment she doesn't like about her singing? She's never singing again. I have examples like this that can go on forever.

Now I'm livid. I want to call her out for her petty behavior. I want to tell her that one bad birthday for her doesn't mean she gets to ruin everyone else's birthday for the rest of our lives.

"AITA for asking my parents not to bring my brother to my wedding? I (26f) am getting married this spring! He's the love of my life and I'm honestly so happy.

The issue comes from the fact that I have a brother (20) who has several conditions and diabilities. I want to make it clear: I absolutely, positively, love my brother with all of my heart. My problem, though, is that when we were growing up, everything was always about him, and I was the backburner kid because I was older and able-bodied. My parents also wouldn't let me participate in anything that he couldn't be directly involved in, too, so that made it hard especially because I loved things like camping and road trips that I remember us doing before he was born, but all of that came abruptly to an end. When we look back on memorable events, such as my graduation photos, its always remarked on as ""oh this is when brother was getting xx done"" or ""that was the year brother did xx"". I was also relied on a lot for care, and they're so busy planning for his future (which is admittedly more expensive) that what was put away for me before he was born has been used up and they've never been able to plan for mine. They weren't bad parents or anything, but my brother just needed more everything.

Fortunately, I managed to get into a decent college on a scholarship, and that's where I met my fiance!  He's really into outdoorsy things, too, and we are in the process of planning and saving for our dream wedding with the help of his wonderful parents. We plan on getting married at a national park about two hours away by car from my parent's house, and plan to have about 30 people at the wedding.

My parents have told me that this won't work. Its too hard to take him that far, the wedding times we have planned are too long, the guest list is too much, and the environment and activities we have are not friendly for my brother. My mother asked me to get married at a local courthouse down the street instead and to only invite my parents, his parents, and my brother (excluding his siblings), and we can then have a ""reception"" back at their house, and I said no. My dad counteroffered with a small, local place with a courtyard, but I said no, I've dreamed about being married at the national park.

After much back and forth, I just finally asked my parents how they'd feel about maybe my brother not going to the wedding, and we would cover half of the cost for making sure he has the care he needs for the event. They were shocked and called me selfish, and I tried to explain that I just wanted this *one day* to be about me, but they just told me they were disappointed in who I've become, and thought I was more mature and understanding than that.

My fiance is on my side, and in laws have offered to help us cover the cost for care for the wedding, but my parents said they can't support me if I can't support him. A couple family members reached out to care for him on the day of, but some others said they won't be going to my wedding unless he comes, too, and that I have no heart.

&#x200B;

AITA?

&#x200B;

ETA: I don't know if this is important or not but I want to add that I, fiance, his family, and our friends do not live in the same state as my parents.

ETA2: A lot of people have been asking. One of my brothers' disabilities *is* nonverbal Autism, but he is wicked smart. He can read and type. I've told him previously about the wedding, and he responded with some brother humor. My parents often make decisions on his behalf and baby him a *lot*. Looking more into this, I actually think he might be more embarrassed knowing that they made me change my entire wedding to be quick, small, and safe. I'm not sure how to bring that up to my parents at this point.

&#x200B;

Q&A and Update:

*Why can't you just livestream/get a carer/have two weddings/etc?*

My parents have a very firm belief that any level of ""accommodation"" that doesn't make him completely able to enjoy the activity or whatever exactly how everyone else will is only going to make him feel disabled, and therefore they want him to be there for the full celebration, as is. I'd be more than happy to livestream my wedding or do something with just him, but these aren't seen as okay. Not to mention, we live in a different state, so I can't just fly home a month later to have a second wedding.

*You must not love your brother because you don't want him there/ you chose a venue to purposely exclude him/weddings aren't about you, they're about sharing with your family and friends.*

I do want him there. As many people have pointed out, national parks *are* accessible. I would absolutely love for my brother to be there, but multiple new faces (even multiple faces of people he *knows*) can be too overwhelming. I've honestly just gotten to a point where it's gotten so ridiculous (especially not being able to *actually* share with family and friends) to where I'm personally overwhelmed by it and its just easier to throw in the towel and say that maybe its best he not go.

*How can your parents expect fiance's siblings not to go, just so your brother can?*

This one is simple. They believe that my brother is disabled and they are not, so they should understand.

*Who is paying for this? How much have they paid? Why are* ***you*** *not offering to pay the full cost of care?*

My parents have put forward no money for my wedding, because they can't. The wedding is being paid for by myself, my fiance, and my in laws.  I cannot pay the full cost of additional care because I cannot afford it.

*Why haven't your parents asked your brother? Why haven't you?*

Before I told my parents, I told my brother. Please read above. They tend to make decisions for him, and when we are together in person, they are always in the middle between me and him. He does try to talk to my parents, and my parents just sort of baby him about it.

*You must hate/resent your brother*

I do not. There was definitely tension between us when I was about 18/19, but that has since gone away and we have a much better relationship now, especially because we can communicate over text.

*Did your parents post here or there because I saw a similar post about a National Park wedding and a disabled brother.*

No. My brother is 20 and not adopted, my wedding is in the spring and not child-free, and I have literally no issue with my brother being there. My issue stems from the ridiculous length of accommodations, including not allowing any of my friends to take part of the event.

&#x200B;

Now for the update:

I spoke again with my brother (I sent him the post, too). He heard from my mom something about me not wanting him at the wedding, but he was horrified to hear the details and said he would be *mortified* if I went along with my parent's plan. He and I discussed some reasonable accommodations for the day (such as where we could go/ how we could get him out if he needed) and he brought that up to them. My parents didn't think that was appropriate that he might have to spend time alone/with one of them somewhere while everyone else had a good time, so it was shot down. My brother ended up saying that he'd like to go, but my parents weren't really budging and I should just have my wedding so long as I promise to show him the video.

I spoke to my dad this morning, and he told me I shouldn't have gotten my brother involved because he's sensitive to stuff like that. He seemed to feel like I made my brother compromise on a lot of things. With all of your advice, I explained that I love my brother very much, and would love all three of them to be there, but that my life cannot always revolve around him, and that I'm tired of being unimportant to them. His response is that because I don't have disabilities, I should be able to understand and accommodate, but I told him that its beyond accommodation and its bordered neglect. I spent over an hour having a conversation about this, and as a result of the whole thing have made the choice very clear that I would like to go no contact with him and my mother.

My mom tried to talk to me but I haven't answered. I took the day off work to just relax from the whole thing.

&#x200B;

So yeah, unfortunate situation. Still talking to my brother. He's giving me updates. I don't know who is going to walk me down the aisle but I honestly don't care at this point. Maybe one of fiance and I's friends or something.

&#x200B;

Thank you all for your kind words. Its an overwhelming number of responses and I cannot respond to them all, but I feel all of your love and luck for my wedding!

FAQ pt 2:

 *Why can't you walk yourself/have your brother walk you down the aisle? Why can't you and your fiance just walk arm-in-arm? That's empowering for me, so you should do it, too!*

While I completely understand that some people feel empowered by the idea of themselves or other women walking down the aisle on their own, or doing this or that, for other women we dream about our dads being there with us in that moment. It isn't because I need a man to ""give me away"" or ""transfer"" me. Its because I wanted to take part in that ritual of growing up and moving on from being a kid. That's what it represents to *me*. Its special to *me* for my dad to be involved in that part of the wedding, and to take the time to participate in something like that. I ask that everyone respect *my* choice as much as they would like others to respect theirs. Not to mention, one of the accommodations for my brother was that he would be fine *in the back, not involved* in the actual wedding ceremony. That was where he said he felt most comfortable so easy escape, and he didn't want to feel like all eyes were on him.

*Why can't you just ""kidnap"" your brother for the day and not tell your parents?*

Because they have power of attorney/guardianship, and this would actually be illegal. While he is extremely smart, his medical conditions make it so that he is not able to be fully independent. Honestly, the absolute *last* thing I need regarding my wedding is genuine kidnapping drama where police get involved. Because of the situation they do not need to wait 48 hours to act, and they can (and most likely will) press criminal charges.

*What exactly are all of your brother's medical conditions?*

Nonverbal autism is one, and epilepsy is another. I don't really feel comfortable putting every single one out there, mostly because its identifying information if I get into rare conditions.  ",0.09
"AITA for Grounding my Son for going Pee Pee in the pool? My son is seven years old, for starters. Last weekend, me and my family went to the pool since the kids had been well behaved. We were there for two hours, and everything went great until my son thought it would be an excellent idea to pull down his swim trunks and go pee pee in the pool. 

Peeing in the pool is one thing, but he was standing on the deck with his swim trunks down peeing into the shallow end. I was livid and grounded him for a month.

"AITA for inviting my boyfriend over my apartment? I (20F) have had my boyfriend (21M) over my apartment for the weekends the past 2 weeks. I live in the city close to my college campus, my boyfriend lives in the suburbs about 30 minutes away. I have a crazy schedule with barely any free time and I don't have a car so when we want to see each other, he comes over to my place. This schedule seemed fine and my roommate (22F) didn't seem to have any issues with the arrangement, she always goes out on the weekends anyway. Last night, my roommate said to me that she was freaked out when she saw my boyfriend on our couch the one day, and that him being here made her uncomfortable because she ""didn't like his vibe"". In her defense he was there alone and I forgot to tell her that he would be there for an hour alone while I was at a meeting. I apologized for that incident and told her that next time I would let her know. Instead she said that she doesn't want my boyfriend to come over anymore, at all because it makes her uncomfortable. I was shocked so I told her I would think about the situation and talk more about it the next day.

I brought it up again to her and asked if we could all get dinner and clear up any misunderstandings. She told me that she didn't think that would work and that there wasn't a single misunderstanding; she just didn't like his attitude. She then said she felt like he disrespected her because he didn't say hello to her while he was in the middle of reading. I asked her if she could at least try to go out to dinner once just to communicate and clear the air and she told me she didn't understand why she should have to do that. She then proceeded to double down on not allowing him to come over. I got fed up and told her to suck it up and get over herself because I am not going to just not see my boyfriend. I pay just as much rent as she does and I have never said anything to her about the people she brings over.

So I told her objectively speaking if 5 is average you're a solid 7. Her feelings as I anticipated were hurt and I told her that I think I'm a 7 as well. That while we're above average looking, if we applied ourselves we could both be more attractive. She replied ""I'm a 10 and I can't believe you think I'm mediocre"".

"AITA for staying distant with my mom for 7 months over what she said to me? Context: My mom and I have had our fair share of serious disagreements the past 5 or so years.

[Screenshots of the conversation days before my sisters first birthday (March 2021)](https://imgur.com/a/iLKqiFG)

Growing up my moms ex husband used to steal my electronics for money to fund his drug addiction on top of other traumatic things. Weeks later he would buy me the newest version of whatever electronic he stole and it used to leave me with a very  confused feeling as a child. I didn‚Äôt know if I should be upset in losing my old stuff or be happy that I have the newest tech. My mom used to tell me that ‚Äúhe was getting help and that when you love someone you don‚Äôt give up on them‚Äù in response to me questioning why she kept him around. 

In December of 2020 my mom and I were at a shaky spot in our relationship. It was making me very uncomfortable seeing her in person because whenever I would see her she would say something criticizing or bring up conversations on subjects that would make me anxious. 

So when Christmas at her house came around I found it to be something that took a lot for me to get up and go to. Sadly as a result it slipped my mind to bring my little sister a gift on what would‚Äôve been her first Christmas. It is something that I regret because whether or not she‚Äôd remember it I feel like it‚Äôs the thought that is important and I was too focused on mentally preparing myself to see my mom that I completely forgot it.

"AITA for saving a kitten? So, I was headed out to do some shopping. On my way to the store on a busy 3 lane road I noticed what looked like some roadkill in the middle lane.

I get sad anytime I see a poor animal has been squished and I looked in my rear view mirror after I had passed it to see what it was.

When I saw that it was a tiny kitten and it was looking around I immediately stopped my car, in the middle lane, and jumped out to get it.

***UPDATED TO ADD***
I did at least check to make sure no one was behind me when I stopped, and as I was rushing to the kitten I was waving my arms around like a mad person to make sure people saw what I was trying to do

I didn't think anything of it, my main concern was getting the kitten out of the road and to a vet.

(Kitten has a broken tail bone most likely  due to being thrown from a moving car window, but will otherwise be ok)

From my SO and my family I've only been yelled at, called stupid and other derogatory names, and mainly just been shit on about what I did and that I should have left the kitten in the road...

"Aita for telling my friend off when all she does is say harsh things about me and my decisions with life As the title says, aita for telling my friend off to go focus on her life since she said some pretty mean things to me like I'm stupid and my brain doesn't work just because I don't listen to her opinions and suggestions that I should do with my life? I feel horrible that maybe I'm a huge jerk for telling her off when I clearly got upset over her forcing her opinions on me.

So, I haven't really made the smartest decisions in my life and I always stuck with focusing on my happiness. If things made me happy, I'll do it. For instance, drinking one can of alcohol for celebrating my tiny breakthroughs at work or keeping in contact with my ex. Meanwhile my friend gets mad at me for drinking one can just because she lost someone to alcohol poisoning and she gets mad at me for keeping in touch with my ex. 

If I stand up for the decision I make whenever she says rude things about my decisions, she gets mad at me and would never apologize no matter how many different ways I rephrase that what she said is very rude and she needs to apologize. For instance, the day before she said I had no brain and that she would need to call for it since it left the building. It personally pissed me off a lot. I'm not a child and I know what I'm doing with my life. I'm aware my decisions are not the best but for now I just wanna be happy with what I have in my life. Also, I wasn't blessed to finish my university studies like her so calling me stupid personally pisses me off a lot.

So today I spent an hour telling her how she keeps forcing her opinions on me and how she never apologizes for hurting my feelings. I don't usually tell people off and I'm usually the type to apologize even if I did wrong since I value friendship but I couldn't take it any longer with her just freely running her mouth and calling people in my life names and calling me stupid and so on. She kept forcing her opinions on me to block my ex even though she knows by saying it a multiple times that I'm not going to listen to her. It just gets on my nerves that she just keeps repeatedly saying what she wants for my life. This is my life... the things I do is completely my choice and I hate this whole controlling behavior. 


Tldr, So she ends up calling someone I care for very dearly a d.ck and I tell her off that she's being disrespectful of my decision since respecting my decision comes with not saying rude things about the things associated to my decisions. We both argue and now I feel horrible like maybe I'm the bad person for not listening to her when clearly I know what I'm doing with my life. I want to do what I want in life but she stresses me out by talking all rudely to me when I don't listen to her. I have tried talking it out to her but she still won't listen.

"AITA for telling my roommate she shouldn't have gotten her cat I (21f) have had the same roommate (21f) for 3 years now. We are friends and know pretty much everything about each other. We are both in college, and she has to work a part time job to pay her bills. We moved at the beginning of the school year, and she insisted we move into this apartment that would be at the very top of her budget. She barely makes rent every month and more times than not has to beg her parents for money.

Right before we moved, she informed me that she would be getting a kitten. That was fine with me, I like cats. She got the cat a week after we moved in, but couldn't tell the landlord about it because she hadn't taken it to the vet to get adoption papers and its shots. She promised me that she would take the cat to the vet within the next few days.

And well, it's been a month and a half since she made that promise. 

The reasons are honestly out of her control, to an extent. Weird circumstances involved her batshit crazy mom, but also that mom said that she would pay for the pet fee so my roommate didn't dare go against her. 
Anyway, insane mom lets go of her chokehold on my roommate and so she is now free to take the cat to the vet. She says she can't take it during the week because she is too exhausted after work, but then has decided to go to her hometown and leave me with the cat two weekends in a row.

Now, with a free weekend ahead, I had asked my roommate again to get the cat vaccinated and documented. Apparently money is now an issue, because she didn't know that the required shots are about $100. I asked her when she would earn the money, and she said in another month and half or two.

It's clear she also hasn't researched how to take care of a cat because the cat is now 4 months old, was raised as an outdoor cat until my roommate got him, and has never seen a vet. Many websites say that kittens need to go to get checked up once a month and that parasites are very common, especially in outdoor cats. She says the cat doesn't look sick, so there's no harm in waiting.

Not only am I worried for the cat, but my roommate won't let me call maintenance for the troubles we've been having. She's afraid that the maintenance man will rat us out. We've had a leaky fridge, shower that emits a very loud high pitched ringing, and none of the outlets in my bathroom work. 

When she told me to wait even longer, I got mad at her and said that if she shouldn't have gotten the cat because she clearly can't afford to take care of it. My roommate said that I can't be mad at her because she's been trying and that I don't understand since I don't work during the school year. She's been giving me the cold shoulder for 2 days now.

"AITA for being upset with my friend for refusing to not say a slur? Just to clarify, I'm referring to the r word that is used as a slur against the mentally disabled. I don't know if I'm even allowed to type it censored.

I explained to her that it made me uncomfortable, and she said that she‚Äôd refrain from using it around me. While I appreciated that, I asked if she could not use it at all anywhere going forward, to which she said ""well sorry i'm still going to use it"". I hardly knew what to say except ‚Äúokay sorry‚Äù. I distanced myself from her in an attempt to get across the message and waited for her to text me about whatever. A few hours later, she texted me saying she was mad because her roommate was no longer going home for the weekend and so she couldn‚Äôt have a guy friend with benefits over. After this conversation was over, I brought up the slur she used again, asking if she she could promise me she would never use that word anywhere, to which she said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not gonna change for you sorry‚Äù. I don‚Äôt really understand why it‚Äôs so hard to just not say a certain word? I told her this, along with the fact that I‚Äôm not asking her to change just for me, but that so she can be a better person. She then claimed that I was just upset because I was jealous she was gonna have that guy over, and said I should take a breather. For context, I have feelings for her, but I am trying to suppress them so that we can remain good friends. We met on Tinder but I found out after a week or so that her intention was to only be friends. We‚Äôve had a really good friendship up until now. Anyway, I was hurt by the fact that she assumed I was attacking her because she thought I was jealous, and said so. I also set her straight that this was not the reason the argument started. I was going to bring it up again no matter what after she texted me again, no matter what she texted me about. While I was upset with her when she texted me again, I still wanted to give her the chance to vent, since she just texted ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so mad‚Äù. Then, when she said her guy friend couldn‚Äôt come over because her roommate wasn‚Äôt actually going home, I asked why that was the case just in case it would help her come up with a solution. Even though I was upset with her, I still wanted to help her before I brought up the issue again.

Sorry if any of that didn‚Äôt make any sense. I feel bad because before this, we‚Äôve had a great friendship (aside from me struggling to put my feelings aside). While the r word makes me uncomfortable, it doesn‚Äôt even make me as uncomfortable as it makes some others. I just wanted to do what‚Äôs right, and now I feel like I‚Äôm being punished for it. Like I created a problem for myself. I feel like if she was really a good person, she‚Äôd at the very least apologize for using the slur, or more ideally, I don‚Äôt know, STOP USING IT.

"AITA for telling my soon-to-be ex-wife (separated) I want the house to myself in the evenings? My soon-to-be ex-wife and I filed for divorce yesterday, and it will be finalized in 60 days. It's amicable without lawyers, and we are going through mediation.

I work in coffee shops from 10am - 8pm each day, and she uses the basement as a ceramics studio. I paid fir 85% of the house, cash and she paid 15%, cash, so we both own part of the house. She decided to rent elsewhere, so she sleeps at a rental of her own, but she continues to use the basement at the house we co-own during the days for work.

She is here 7 days per week from 10am through midnight...so 14 hours per day. I get no relief from her in the evenings. Granted, I spend my evenings in my office on the second floor while she is in the basement, it's wearing on me knowing she is here all the damn time, and I'd like time alone.

She wants to keep working this way through February -- even after we are divorced. She's really dragging this out.

Further, we live in an equitable distribution state, not a 50/50 one. I had all the cash used to buy 85% of the house before we married, and we've been married three years. Per our first round of mediation (one more to go), I'm only giving her back what she put into the house plus appreciation, and I'm giving her a $24,000 vehicle in her name (which I've made all payments for -- she made none).

I've told her I feel taken advantage of. I feel like she is using me to bootstrap her business, doesn't give back, and just complains. In fact, she has done so all our marriage: I've paid ALL her bills, she hasn't contributed financially (because she makes $15,000 gross per year and $8,000 after expenses), I've been emotionally available, and she doesn't reciprocate emotionally or intimately. She's withheld sex and even hugging for the latter part of our marriage.

She also has a trust fund with significant cash to fall back on.

I'm just sick of her being in my damn house all the time, and I'd like the evenings to myself. I'm sick of hearing her walking through the house or flushing the damn toilet and being reminded that she is here at 11pm at night.

Am I being unreasonable by asking for 8pm - 9am to myself without her her? She says ""It's really shitty of you to ask that."" She says this is the busiest time of year for her, considering Christmas is coming up, and that I should accommodate. But really...should I?",0.83
"AITA for basically saying ""I told you so?"" to my in-laws when it came to my cat being really sick? For context I am going back to school in January and my husband and I don't make a lot of money, so we live with his grandparents who raised him. My husband (M) and I work 12 - 12 1/2 hours shifts and wake up around 0630 and get home around between 2030-2130 depending what location we are at. I am 30f, my husband is 32m, and his grandparents are 78m and 74f.

So, Thursdays my husband and I work together and got home to being told my cat, Othello, was downstairs, which isn't unusual if there have been some loud noises. I am probably overly attached to my cat and went immediately downstairs to get some kitty snuggles and saw he was on my husband's computer chair. He was breathing heavier and immediately I thought ""he's dying."" (I just had this gut feeling he was.)

I called for my husband to come downstairs immediately. Othello wouldn't move without hissing or growling. I knew something was absolutely, seriously wrong. I also knew we didn't get paid until 0130 and didn't have the money to take him to the emergency vet, so I called around to see what I could do.

Grandpa and Grandma started yelling at M and myself saying we were overreacting and he'd be fine, that he just ate some of the dogs kangaroo food and he'd be fine in the morning. (I had a full blown panic attack and not proud, but screamed shut the f up repeatedly.) 

I drove Othello to the vet where we found out he had a bladder blockage. They wanted 3500 dollars. We only had 2900. So, we called his grandparents, saying we would absolutely pay them back. They accused the vet of lying and just being out for money. They wouldn't even listen that this vet took care of my dog's eye when it got popped out in 2010/2011 and did phenomenal work. 

We paid $700 to have the bladder flushed anyway at 0130 and took him to another vet later that morning. His (now old) vet couldn't squeeze him in, so I took him to the vet across the street. $1500. They emailed me his x-rays and you can clearly see the blockage and how large his bladder was. It was double in size. I showed it to them and said ""so... They're lying, huh?"" His grandparents felt bad and said they'd pay half. (Ended up not being $1500. Just under that.) 

But it stands to reason - if I had listened to them my cat would probably be dead so I've been doing a little bit of ""Othello sleeps with me every night, I knew something was wrong."" Stuff along those lines. His grandpa said no one likes an ""I told you so,"" but.... I feel like they deserve it. No, I didn't know it was going to be so expensive, but I also knew something was seriously wrong and they were calling me crazy.

So... AITA?

TL;DR: Knew something was wrong with my kitty, wanted to take him to emergency vet, in-laws were screaming at my husband and I, calling me crazy. Accused emergency vet of lying about bladder blockage. Got bladder drained and took him to a regular vet ASAP, he was blocked again within 7 1/2 hours. Got x-rays that showed his bladder double in size. Basically saying ""I told you so,"" now.",0.13
"AITA for embarrassing my friend‚Äôs obese boyfriend by making him sit on a chair different from everyone else‚Äôs at dinner? This happened a few weeks ago. I invited my friends to dinner at my house to celebrate moving into my new house, and my friend Katie asked if she could bring her new boyfriend Dale so our friend group can finally meet him in person. I said yes. 

There are two things I have to point out. First, my dining table and chairs are wooden furniture that have been in our family for close to a hundred years and have a lot of sentimental value to my family. They used to be at my sister‚Äôs house but she asked me if I can take them since her kids tend to jump on them during meal time and she was scared the furniture might get damaged. I don‚Äôt have kids and just got a bigger house so I have space, thus I happily took them. Second, Dale is morbidly obese. He is about 5‚Äô5 and weighs 300+ lbs. Given that my dining chairs are wooden and old, I didn‚Äôt want to risk them not being able to hold Dale‚Äôs weight, so I prepared a different, sturdier chair for him to sit on. I‚Äôve had overweight people sit on my dining chairs before, but none as obese as Dale. 

When Katie saw that I was asking Dale to sit on a chair different from everyone else‚Äôs, she got livid and told me that I was embarrassing Dale. I was shocked that she would get upset like that in front of everyone, so I stammered and explanation about how my chairs are old and I wasn‚Äôt sure if they would hold. Katie said that I was being fat phobic and said she couldn‚Äôt be friends with a person like me. They left immediately, while the rest of my friends stayed long enough just to finish dinner and we called it a night early.

"AITA for not wanting to lose 4 hours of sleep over a drive to the airport? TL;DR - mom said I was going to the airport, I said no bc I don't wanna lose half a night's sleep, she wished I and my future S/O burn in hell

A quick story about what happened: it started on the drive home from her office, I was swapping out a water dispenser that barely worked for a new one. It was myself (19M), my nmom (56F), and my grandmother (81F) in the car, I was driving. On the way home, she says her and I are going to the airport at 4:30 AM to drop my brother off. 

All I said was I'm not going and her response is she isn't going alone because she's going to get kidnapped if she goes alone. At 4:30 AM, in a car that's going to be locked for all but two minutes, at a major airport,, and there's going to be plenty of other people around to witness anything should anything happen at all

Me not wanting to lose out on 4-5 hours of sleep, when I already sleep like crap and I KNEW I wouldn't be able to fall asleep again, is somehow me being selfish. Despite her being perfectly willing to make sure I lose out on all that sleep so she isn't alone on the drive there

Then she wished that I, as well as my future significant other, burn in hell and that that she birthed two demons. In front of my grandmother. Knowing very well that they are both Christian. My grandmother doesn't say a thing. My response is just ""isn't that worse?"" (Her wishing I burn in hell and calling me a demon is worse than me not wanting to lose out on half my night's sleep)

Am I the asshole?

EDIT: This all happened yesterday (October 9th), I'm not sure what she ended up doing but I do know I didn't end up going, which is surprising bc she never listens to me",0.04

"AITA for wanting another dog while my boyfriend doesn‚Äôt? Edit: I will not be getting a dog anytime soon. Our apartment was approved for dogs of a certain size, so nobody has to get concerned. It‚Äôs more just to see if I‚Äôm really in the wrong here. 

A week before I (23f) met my boyfriend (26m) I adopted a puppy who has since been a member of our family. We love dogs, I come from a background where love our dogs and have owned many, and he appears to have the same mindset without even ever owning any. 
Dog training and dog care has been a passion of mine ever since I met him. My plan is to own a ton of dogs someday, just like my parents do. 
I live in a one bedroom apartment that I pay for. My boyfriend lives with me, and I‚Äôve only asked him to cover a bill or two and help with chores seeing as he doesn‚Äôt work a lot. 
We split taking care of our dog, one of us walks her in the morning, one of us at night. She‚Äôs very easy going and I think could really benefit from having another dog in the home. 
My boyfriend doesn‚Äôt want a dog until spring, because he wants to be graduated from college before we get another dog. While that is fair, I work really hard for the things I have, animal work is a passion of mine, and considering I would have to pay for it anyway, I did the math and have enough that if the right dog came along I could easily and comfortably afford it. 
In preparation for wanting to add another dog to the home, I signed up to meet with an adoption agency, as it usually takes 6 months to get approved. However, we were able to get approved just yesterday. He was a part of the process. My boyfriend sat down with me and picked the dogs we were interested in potentially meeting. 
Well, as we just started to get messages tonight about meeting up with the fosters of the dogs we pick, he told me that ‚Äúit‚Äôs not a good time right now and that we need to wait‚Äù. He also said ‚Äúwe agreed on spring‚Äù so he wants to honor that.
I was pretty mad. I put in the work, I pay for everything, and he tells me that he doesn‚Äôt want it anymore. I feel like he strung me along, helping me pick out which dogs we wanted to see. 
He told me I was acting like a spoiled child who wasn‚Äôt getting her way. This was something I had my heart set on, something I worked hard for, but I feel like he‚Äôs toying with me. 
I could be the AH for not honoring his feelings about when he‚Äôs ready but considering I would be the one paying for it and he went through the entire process with me I feel like it‚Äôs unfair to me to just pull out. AITA?",0.89
"AITA for letting my toddler keep a balloon at a funeral? One of my distant cousins died a few days ago, he was 99. I'd only met him a few times but he was always a really sweet old guy with really cool stories so when I was invited to attend his funeral/celebration of life I did so. I have a 2 year old little boy who is a regular little boy: he gets excited, he makes noise, he cries, so I brought plenty to keep him quietly occupied. I was invited to bring my son as well since Maury loved kids and my son wasn't the only child there.

""Maury"" is the man who died and something I never knew about him was that he had a little cart and he would sell balloons every Sunday at our local park. It was how he spent some of his retirement, he also would make balloon animals for people who wanted them. I learned at the funeral that his favorite color was red and he loved red balloons and when he'd set up his cart he'd make a bunch of other balloons but only a few red ones and if someone asked for a red balloon he gave it away for free. He only did that for the red balloons, apparently he said they were special and he couldn't sell his favorite balloons. I had no idea and when his grandson informed the congregation about his Sunday activity there wasn't a dry eye.

Because ""Maury"" loved red balloons his family arranged to have red balloons given to each guest to be released at the graveside. (Please no one lecture me about how bad this is for the environment, I didn't even remotely have a hand in this idea or the planning of the funeral.) Like most little kids my son loves bright colors and he loves balloons. I let him hold the balloon during the service and when it came time to release the balloons he threatened a tantrum when I tried to take it so I just let him hold onto it, figuring it was better to keep him quiet than to do the release and have him scream. I hadn't brought any of his toys from the car because the graveside was supposed to be brief.

We went up afterward to offer our condolences to the family and a young man I believe to be his great nephew told me in a very annoyed tone that the point of the balloons was to release them in honor of Maury and it was rude of me to have not done so. I tried to explain that I did try to release it but the baby threatened to cry and I didn't want him to ruin the service with a fit so I just let him keep it but I'd release it as soon as I could, which probably wouldn't be too long since we'd be getting in the car and my son would fall asleep. I figured I could just release it when I got home and honor would be satisfied. My explanation fell on deaf ears and I got a bunch of dirty looks from the family and a lot of the guests.

My son was a good boy through the whole service, didn't make a peep, I was even complimented on his behavior by the daughter of the deceased, I just figured it was better to continue this good behavior than do the activity.  Was I an asshole?",0.08
"AITA for telling a family member they couldn‚Äôt apply for a nursing license without having a nursing degree A couple of weeks ago a family member let me know that they had sent in a registered nurse application and that they were super nervous. 

This person is currently an LPN and only has an associates in science, and has never been to nursing school.  

Knowing as much, I asked what they meant by having sent an application. As far as I know (having considered nursing in the past) you need to have graduated from an accredited nursing program before applying for the NCLEX  not to mention licensure itself. 

I assumed that they meant they had tried enrolling for the NCLEX, which as an LPN you can take the NCLEX-PN. This still does not make you an RN.

My family member sends me a screenshot of a receipt of payment for the NY nurse license. At which point my jaw drops and I hurriedly attempt to tell them that this is a non-refundable payment to something they likely do not qualify for. 

At which point I receive a slew of angry messages insisting that to become a nurse you only need an associates of science and that they know how to read requirements. That I ‚Äúam always questioning them‚Äù acting as though all they do is ‚Äúfloat on a rock and smoke weed‚Äù 

I just thought I was looking out for someone I care about. AITA?

Additional info:
Yes I was correct, you need to have graduated from an approved nursing program here in NY.

I also did not continue the argument, I said ‚ÄúOk‚Äùprior to their angry response and did not respond to them afterwards and left it at that. 

Their birthday just passed and I wished them a happy birthday but was ignored which I assume signifies they‚Äôre still upset.

My friend who lives near me said I'm in the wrong for snitching on those people. She said I'm being melodramatic, and that I should've waited till tomorrow to have a chat with them when their party is over. She also told me that my neighbour will now probably get a fine for hosting parties during this lockdown because I snitched on them.

"AITA for throwing a womans divorce in her face after she insulted my marriage? Throwaway: I (28F) have been married to my husband ""Harold"" (29M) for the past 5 years. A bit of background: Harold and I have what most people would refer to as a ""traditional marriage."" He's the Breadwinner and I'm the Homemaker, so all the responsibilities in the home are my job, and all the responsibilities outside the home are his job. Harold and I agreed to pursue this type of lifestyle, and it benefits us both equally.

Unfortunately, we've had our share of judgement and harsh opinions from people that simply don't understand our marriage. We've had a few friends and family members tell us that Harold is forcing this life on me, I'm wasting my ""best years,"" etc. I try my best to explain to people that our marriage dynamic is consensual and it's what makes us happy. It also doesn't make it any easier that I'm the only woman in my friend group that doesn't work outside the home.

Yesterday, I had a girls get together with all my friends (8 of us in total). A friend of mine asked if she could invite one of her coworkers, ""Nina"" (32F). My friend told me that Nina recently went through a messy divorce and that she could use some girl time. I've never met Nina, but I didn't see any problem with inviting her. Nina comes over, she introduces herself, and everything was going smoothly. A couple hours into the visit, Nina asked me what I do for work. I told her that I didn't have a conventional job and that I'm a Homemaker. 

Nina gave me a confused look, which I'm very used to at this point. She then asked, ""Why would you wanna be cooped up in here all day?"" I told her that my Husband and I are happy just having a more traditional marriage. She rolled her eyes and said, ""Oh...right. It's what you and your Husband wanted."" I asked her what she meant by that, and she said, ""No woman who was born after the 40's actually wants a traditional marriage. Their Husband's just convince them to want it.""

I then said that her comments were a bit rude, generalizing, and belittling. She kept giving me judgey side glances and clearly wasn't taking me seriously. The last straw was when I overheard her tell one of my friends, ""Well, at least OP doesn't have kids, especially daughters. I just cant imagine them living a life like this."" I was pissed off and said, ""You're right Nina, this isn't a happy life to live. When I need tips on how to become a depressed divorcee at 32, I'll give you a call.""

Everyone heard it, the room went dead silent, Nina then started crying and left. A couple of my friends left and called me a bitch for stooping so low.

"AITA for telling my girlfriend that her TV show gossip doesn‚Äôt interest me at all? I‚Äôm 22, my girlfriend of 1 year is 20 and she‚Äôs currently at university and living 2 hours away from me. My girlfriend loves gossip stories, in real life and from TV. She watches a Colombian equivalent to ‚ÄòJeremy Kyle‚Äô or ‚ÄòJudge Judy‚Äô, and things like desperate house wives and always tells me about the stories. I like listening to whatever she says because she speaks about it with passion and it‚Äôs something she likes despite me not really having as much enthusiasm for it than she has. I understand, if you don‚Äôt like something you still have to make an effort for your partner.

So we were on a phone call today, but today I‚Äôm really sick, and have had little sleep and I feel extremely grumpy and tired.

"AITA for blowing up after my (16M) mom told me not to date my girlfriend(15F) because her grandparents are racist? Hello! This isn't what you think.

Yesterday me and my girlfriend (B) hung out for the first time. I had my first kiss and it was honestly amazing.

During this hangout B told me that she was lying to her grandparents (who she lives with) about our relationship and had just told them that we were friends. I asked why and she said that they're pretty racist and don't want a black person (like me) dating their granddaughter. I was surprised because they'd seemed nice and she definitely wasn't racist but moved on.

B told me that she hates them and wants to move out ASAP.

Today, I told my mom, who is white, about this and then asked if me and B could hang out again. She said she was feeling uncomfortable about condoning B lying to her grandparents about our relationship, and that maybe she should listen to them since they're adults. I told her that's a racist thing to say. She just kept saying that ""they're the adults"" and ""they're trying to do what's best for her, even thought they're wrong.""

I just stood up, yelled at her saying she sounded crazy, and stormed out of the room. She looked hurt.

To be clear, even though you probably think otherwise after reading this, my mom is not racist. She married a black man (hence, me) and raised a black baby. He died years ago but she's still pretty fiercely anti racist and is very interested in black culture.

That's why this is so out of the blew for me and is making me question my decision. I think that she thinks that following your parents instructions is immensely important, which I can't really relate to in this situation.

TL;DR: My girlfriend's grandparents (who she lives with) are racist and wouldn't want us to date if she told them. My mom thinks we shouldn't lie about it and that we should break up.",0.01
"AITA for going to dinner with other boys on my wedding anniversary. Okay, misleading title but I couldn‚Äôt help myself! Anyways, my wedding anniversary is tomorrow and my husband is out of town for work. He asked me when he found out there was an opportunity to go out of town if I was okay with it and I said it was fine. Honestly, we‚Äôve been married for 19 years and it just didn‚Äôt seem like that big of a deal. 

Since he is going to be out of town, I thought it would be fun to go out with my two preteen boys to celebrate. We probably would have gone out to eat while my husband was gone anyways because I hate cooking. So today while my husband was getting ready for his flight, I mentioned that I thought the boys and I would go out to celebrate and he got all offended suddenly. He said that I was being extremely rude and that anyone would agree with him. I said that if anything was rude, it was going out of town for our anniversary, which was unfair since I did say it was ok. I just didn‚Äôt like how he was turning the tables on me and suddenly I was the rude one because he was choosing to be gone.

"AITA for what I said when my employee asked about being promoted? I run a small business. To keep it simple let‚Äôs basically say there are three tiers of employment here: basic entry level (grunt work, phones, etc.) mid-level (beginning to get into more specialized projects but not customer facing and no one answers to you) and top-level (you have your own projects, are customer facing, and manage a team of entry and mid level workers.)

I have a particular employee who is excellent at mid-level work but whenever given the chance to be customer facing or manage others, really drops the ball. 

I‚Äôve spoken to him before about the importance of cultivating these skills if he hopes to advance but he‚Äôs always said it‚Äôs not his forte. Fine by me, he‚Äôs great at his current job, I was in no rush to make a change. 

As a result though, I‚Äôve never floated the idea of promoting him to top level. He‚Äôs never asked about it. 

Until today, when a coworker of his was promoted, someone who‚Äôd started here later than he did. 

He asked me why I wasn‚Äôt promoting him and I explained he hadn‚Äôt really honed the skills we‚Äôd talked about being required, and even expressed a specific disinterest in them. 

He then said that he has social anxiety so cannot take on the responsibility of interacting with customers or managing employees, but that since it‚Äôs something he can‚Äôt control, he should still be promoted. 

I wasn‚Äôt sure he was being serious at first but when I realized he was I said I understood his frustration but if he physically can‚Äôt interact with customers then him not getting this job is like me never having a shot at the NBA, just not in the cards (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5).

Specifically what happened is me and my sister were talking about Squid Game. I'm a fairly Conservative person, and she strongly leans Liberal. Now, when I said that I like this show, I said,  
""Oh yeah, I actually like Squid Game. It has this goofy camp and such, but it's the good kind of camp. And it has these overly exaggerated expressions like you'd find in anime.""

I mean it as a good thing, first of all. But then I hear her go ""Uh..."" and I realize that I said something that doesn't jive with her political views.

Cue her calling me a racist because I compared all Asian actors to anime. I tried to tell her that that is \*not\* what I was doing. Then she says this gem:  
""Taylor, that's just how they act! You can't say that they all take from anime!"" (again, not what I was saying)

Eventually, I had had enough and said, ""\*That\* is the racist statement! You literally just told me that every one of them act like that, but I compared one aspect of this one show to something you'd find in anime, and you didn't even let me finish my sentence in the first place!""

I'm not sure if I am missing something or if what I said was genuinely racist. I don't think it was, considering I was just referencing the live action expressions to a medium that I love. So, am I the asshole? I know I could have handled that situation better instead of having a screaming match and getting pissed off because I'm being called a racist for a benign statement.

"AITA for hating my sister and attempting to turn my youngest sibling on her?  I know this isn't as bad as the other posts on this sub, but I need to tell somone about this. For context,  I am 14, the middle child is 9 and the youngest is 4. We are all girls. 

Me and the middle child never got along. We squabble near constantly, and overall dont like eachother. The most recent things she's doing though, its a whole new low for her. She's deliberately ruining things. For fun. She pours our mothers expensive beauty stuff down the drain, scratches holes in the bathroom walls, and drawn or written on countless different things.  Its not that that annoys me though, its the lies. She will protest her innocence for hours (she's a terrible liar btw, you can see it in her face easily.) And its only a week or so after that she admits, whilst being giver a row about the next thing she did. 


Today, She decided to paint a cardboard ""laptop"" the youngest one made out of a delivery box. She had painted it with a paint sample we had lying around. This paint got everywhere. Its wall paint, too, so it doesn't come out as easy as other types of paint. The working theory is she painted it, realised she made a mess, and in a weak attempt to frame me, I guess, this girl walks into my room, paint still on her hands, and SMEARS IT ON MY WALL. She was talking about a new season of a show I watched as a decoy, and when I didnt look up (idioticaly, in hindsight) she took her paint-ey finger and smudged a big dark mark on my nice yellow walls... she then washed her hands in the bathroom, causing a big wet mess on the floor. Of course, as my mother and step dad noticed these messes, they were rightfully angry. Only thing is they didn't know who to get angry at. It wasn't them, wasn't the youngest (was sitting content with mums phone next to her.) So that leaver my or the middle child. Middle child outright denied it. And I obviously said no too, you know, having not done it.  She keeps saying it wasn't her even as the evidence came out against her and my step dad believed me. My mother remaind unconvinced. Eventualy she sent me and middle child to our rooms and tells us we won't be going to the local fair tomorrow. She told us to f*ck off aswell so that was nice. I'm not mad at my mum. She's a great person and mum but under a huge amount of stress due to irrelevant circumstances. I'm mad at middle child. Her sorry attempt to save herself cost us all a nice day out. 

Heres where my part comes in. Since we can't go to the fair tomorrow I've already said to youngest that I'll play with her so she still has *some* fun. I also said it was middle child fault we can't go out tomorrow, which is technically the truth. I kind of want youngest to give middle as hard of a time as middle gave me when we were that age. I'm  like training youngest to be annoying to middle, and blame them for everything, Basically 
God that sounds terrible.

Please tell my reddit, am I the asshole?


Edit:
Yeah. I am the asshole. The little ones are asleep so I have to wait till morning to talk to them. I have no idea what I'll say. This sounds weird, but thank you. I have problems that I need to solve and I guess having some people point out the obvious helped me realise how stupid my actions were. I'll probably still play with younger tomorrow, I'll see if middle will join in, but I doubt it. Thanks reddit.",0.99
"AITA for wanting to rehome a puppy?  I(35F) and my husband(36M) are large animal lovers. We currently own 4 cats that we call our babies. We unfortunately lost our 9 year old golden retriever to cancer a week ago. She was the best dog, easily trainable and loved to play with the cats. I still very much miss her and am not ready to get another dog. My husband has been the opposite lately, he's been constantly sending me photos of puppies and we have been receiving calls from breeders asking us to call back if still interested in adopting. It's been taking a huge toll on me and asked my husband to please stop looking at other puppies.

A few girlfriends and I went on a relaxing camping trip and it was great. It took my mind off a lot of things and I went home feeling refreshed. My husband was outside, holding a puppy in his arms. I got out of the car and asked my husband why he was holding a puppy? He smiled and says BIL and I went for a road trip this weekend and we adopted two puppies from the same litter. I was livid, I could feel tears in my eyes and start yelling at him. I tell him that we were going to find a new home for the puppy and suggested we go to counseling. Husband looks at me and says I don't need any counseling and the puppy isn't going anywhere. I am staying with my parents currently and trying to wrap my head around everything. I have asked a few friends if they were interested in the puppy and all are interested in giving the puppy a good home. Husband is giving me the silent treatment and will not answer my texts or calls.

"AITA for telling my in-laws how much my husband makes? This has been nothing me for awhile, and I need some opinions.

Last Saturday, we had been invited to dinner for a small going away party for my husband's sister. of course we went, but my husband wasnt feeling too hot, he was tired as his job schedule just changed to overnights to accomdate him taking some manadatory classes.

so, he had asked me to answer mostly everything for him, as all his energy went to staying awake and eating. I didn't mind, I've  taken the exact same courses for my own job. (in the same field)

At pne point, his grandmother asks, if taking these courses will get him more money after he completed them. I explained that, no, unfortunately not as it is manadtory to take them and he already makes x amount of mone per hour, so getting more would be unlikely.
My MIL then leaned over and hissed in my ear that I say entirely too much, and that's private information.
ive been told in the past that i talk to much, and say to much, so i just sort of shut down and ate. in the car, as we are driving home, my husband then asks whats wrong.

i explain to him what his mom said, and asked if he thought i said too much. He became confused and shook his head, telling me his mom dosent understand how my mind works and that he used to dicuss pay wages with them all the time, so he didn't see what her problem was either.

when we got home, he texted him mom, asking why she said that, and she told him that ""she just enjoys talking over you, and says way to private of information""

He told his mom to chill and apologize for making me feel bad and uncomfortable. she replied i was being a jerk for ""taking over the conversation"".

so now im sitting here, wondering if i really was an AH or if my mil is being...well, a mil.",0.03
"AITA for not attending 'my' birthday party? L.S.S. due to several horrible/abusive incidents that happened on the date of my birth, I DO NOT celebrate my birthday. That Date, is only a Reminder for the Expiration my Driver's License & a code number for important data.

For a Short period of time a VERY GOOD Friend, I'll call her 'Lisa', not her real name, allowed me to stay at her house while I was waiting for a certain apt to open up. Lisa saw My date of birth on some paperwork and was surprised to find out that my date of birth is VERY close to her BIRTHDAY. I told Lisa, that I DO NOT make a Big Deal of that day, and I basically ignore it.

This Year, Lisa is making big fuss over how she & I will be having a 'joint B-day party'. Lisa is the  planner of this event. She is making Announcements about the Duo Birthday Party all over Social Media. Making the 'Birthday Party' a really Big Deal. Especially since Lisa is announcing it is a 'milestone birthday' for me. When mutual friend(s) have spoken to me about the party I make it a point to say it is Lisa's Birthday Party NOT MINE.

Lisa & I have several mutual friends. One of these friends is being gracious to host the 'party' at her Condo, since it is a central geographic location for everybody. Lisa, besides making a big deal about the 'duo party' on social media, She announced that I am making the birthday cake (not to brag but I'm a great baker).

Now the sticky part. I plan to drop off the Birthday Cake & Lisa's Gift early on the day of the party, I will just drop it off in care of the Building Doorman, and will leave before The Friend makes it downstairs to pick up the Cake. I then plan on shutting off my phone and head home for a quiet day/evening away from an event where expectations of behavior will be placed upon me.

AITA for doing the 'Right Thing' by avoiding placing myself in a situation that most likely would end up into a trip to the ER. I admit since My Friend Lisa started to make a BIG Fuss over this Birthday nonsense I've become more irritated & reclusive from that group of people. I'm feeling pressured to live up to their expectations on how a 'birthday person' should behave.  That the idea of a 'birthday' triggers horrible memories, Decades ago when I hit the big 30, I was tricked into entering a 'Surprise Party', within 45 minutes I was in an ambulance because of a Massive Panic/Anxiety Attack. Even My Siblings & Cousins Know not to acknowledge my birthday because of the Trauma.

My husband's friend from high school (whom I've never met) lives nearby, so we planned to attend his birthday party. 
I asked my husband (bc i was raised this way) what we should bring? I am a chef, so i figured at least some bacon wrapped dates.  My husband said, ""I don't really care. ""
I asked again, and he says,  ""do whatever you want.""

At this point, I'm like, ""Just answer yes or no, bro. ""

He says, ""I don't think you should bother. ""

I made them anyway....

Now like a month later we are fighting and he is bringing this up as ammo ""that i don't really respect his opinion anyway,"" so he is justified with his sour attitude.

"AITA for essentially choosing my education over my family? My dad was killed 4 weeks ago and he will be buried in Guatemala as it is his home country. 

The problem is that while I (16f) wanna go, I'd have to miss an entire month of school. I'm a junior in high school and shortly after my dad was killed, my younger sister (8f) and I didn't go to school for about 2 weeks. In our school district, you can only miss 3 weeks of school before truancy. My mom wants to go for an entire month so that she can spend time with our family (she hasn't seen them in over 6 years) but I've repeatedly told her that if we miss a month of school we could lose our spots at our school (my high school has over 1,000 kids and my sisters has at least 300 hundred). She hasn't really listened to my concerns and it's built some tension between us both. 

It all came to fruition when today, we went to go but the tickets. She told the travel agent that we were going for one month but I interrupted her told her again that I couldn't risk missing a month of school but she wouldn't really listen. Because she wouldn't listen to what I had to say as well as anger that's been building up inside of me for the past 4 weeks, I stormed out of the office and went outside and cried. My mom followed my outside and told me that if I didn't go back inside she would cancel the tickets and no one, not even her, would go. So I sucked it up. However, because the travel agent obviously heard what I had said, told us that it was better to talk to our schools before making that decision. I could tell that the travel agents words pissed of my mom and that's when I started thinking that maybe I should just suck it up and go for a month. 

Once we left (w/o the tickets) my mom told me that i was being selfish and that my dad should be on my mind instead of school. She also said how I hadn't told her about my concerns despite the fact that I brought it up multiple times. What really hit me was when she said ""it seems as tho you don't really care about your dad"". I honestly cried when I heard that. I'm honestly at my wits end and at this point I don't know if I even wanna go. AITA? Should I just go for the entire month?",0.08
"AITA for throwing a glass and calling my family selfish at my brother‚Äôs funeral? A few weeks ago, my older brother (M30) died. It was unexpected, and it‚Äôs been so incredibly hard on my family and me.

My family has always been kind of dysfunctional. My dad (M58) was never really around, (he only just re-entered our lives about a year and a half ago) my younger sibling (NB23) strongly dislikes my brother‚Äôs fianc√©, (M30) and I‚Äôm (M27) often left playing mediator. After the service, after the guests left for the burial, my sibling started yelling at the previously mentioned fianc√© because he was the one behind the wheel in the accident that took my brother‚Äôs life.

Frankly, my sibling was cruel. They called the fianc√© a bastard, saying that he was a good-for-nothing drunk that never deserved our brother, etc. The fianc√©‚Äôs response was to say that he wished he‚Äôd been the one to die instead and to snap at my sibling that they had no place to judge him for being a failure. (Sibling has dropped out of college twice.) This set dad off, and he told fianc√© to back off. Then, everyone started yelling at each other. My wife (F28) tried to calm everyone down, but she ended up getting roped into the argument herself.

Now, I pride myself on always being calm and collected, but I snapped. It‚Äôs been a hard few weeks. I‚Äôve always had a big brother, and I never realized how much I relied on him until he was gone. I guess all my grief and years of frustration bubbled up to the surface. I threw a glass and started screaming. I told everyone to shut up, I called them all selfish assholes, and I asked if they couldn‚Äôt put their disagreements aside for one day so that we could bury a man we‚Äôd all loved in peace. (Less eloquently, in more words, and with more cursing, as you can likely imagine.) Then, I stormed out.

It‚Äôs been roughly a week since the funeral. Besides my wife, I haven‚Äôt seen anyone and haven‚Äôt even really checked my phone to see if anyone reached out. I don‚Äôt know how to feel. So, am I the asshole?",0.33
"AITA for denying my step daughter food? My step daughter Ellie is 10, an only child and very entitled. Independent of entitlement issues we generally enjoy our relationship and do many things together at her request.

The incident in question happened Sunday. I had a lot of work to do and needed to go in to work. Ellie BEGGED to come with me (she's legit welcome there). I agreed with the stipulation we eat dinner before heading in because I'd need to power through. We grab McDonald's. She picks at the meal she requested saying she prefers to snack. I say fine, whatever, pack it up if you prefer but we're not eating until I'm done. She throws it away. 

I'm annoyed but offer to grab a snack food option to go. She shrugs and says no she's fine, we head in to my work, she's having fun doing her thing. Three hours in she whines at me how she's starving. I say well you should have eaten, sorry, I need 1 more hour. Her dad texts me 10 minutes later and says why didn't you feed Ellie? I rolled my eyes and ignore him because there's a history here with her doing texting dad a version and I know I can provide him context in 15 minutes or so when I'm done with what I was working on.

Not 3 minutes later her mom is blowing up my phone with texts and then calling literally 30 seconds after sending. I always answer her because its her kid and I'm not her mom but she demands I take Ellie to get food RIGHT NOW or ELSE. I'm about to accommodate because, again, not my kid but Ellie strolls in with this smug look of satisfaction. I'm pissed, I tell her mom ""hey, being hungry seems like a natural consequence of not eating the dinner I already tried to feed her, need to let you go because work."" And hung up the phone.

Ellie asked where we were going for dinner. I told her we had dinner, took the entire last hour I need while ignoring her tantrum and drove home in silence. 

My husband says I'm the AH for getting his ex up his ass, his ex says I'm the AH because how dare I not feed a hungry child... but I'm kind of feeling like they're the AHs for raising such an entitled spoiled brat.

"AITA for visiting my dad's grave on his birthday even though he might have been a Neo-Nazi and being kind of rude to my mom? My (17f) dad died when I was 90.  Today was his birthday, and I went to his grave.  Since I was that young when he died, I don't remember everything.  When I got back from the cemetery today, my mom asked where I'd been and I told her.  She said that I shouldn't be visiting my dad's grave because he wasn't a good person.  I asked her what she meant and she said he was a Neo-Nazi.  She has never said anything about it before.  She has never really talked about him at all.  I reacted pretty badly when she said that and I called her a liar and asked her for proof.  I regret being rude to her and I think I was wrong for that.  She said she doesn't really have any solid proof but I just need to trust her.  She said that even though I was just 9, I must remember that he had a abnormal interest in Nordic history.  I do remember something of that sort.  I feel like she's not telling me everything.  I'm still not entirely convinced he was a white supremacist, but even if he was, it's not like visiting his grave a few times a year will make me one too.  Even if he was what she says, he was still my dad and I loved him.  Am I the asshole?

Edit:  I'm pretty sure there is definitely something my mom's not telling me.  I feel like she knows something else that she doesn't want to tell me.",0.47
"AITAH for getting mad that homeless person returned the stuff I just bought them to buy beer? So I was walking into a convenience store and there was a homeless man sitting outside who asked for money. I told him I didn't have cash but that I could buy him some food or necessities if they'd like. Before I could ask what they would want, they walk into the store with me and start getting food and toiletries, which was fine but would have expected them to ask if it the items were okay with me before grabbing them. 

They ended up getting \~$25 worth of things which I was fine with and they stood by my while I payed for the items. As soon as I paid, they grab the items and while I was leaving they go back into the back of the store. When I was back in my car getting ready to leave, I see them walking out with a case of beer and none of the things I just bought them. As I was driving away, I basically told him it was fucked up to take advantage of me like that. 

I got home and was talking to a friend about how it pissed me off that he took advantage of someone trying to help him. It would be one thing if I had given him cash or bought him beer, but I thought it was entirely misleading to ask for food and then immediately return it for booze. I typically don't give cash to those in need since I don't want them spending the money on drugs/booze. 

My friend argued that I was an AH since I had already spent the money and that they were in a bad situation and that's what they wanted. I think I was right in getting upset since they basically lied to and took advantage of someone trying to help. If I donate to a non profit and they use the money for something other than what was discussed, I would consider it wrong/fraudulent.

"AITA for going to the office or lying for my friend? So here's the story. My friend A has been adorning the bathroom walls with ""art work"" so to speak. I knew she was the one doing the majority of it (others were doing some too.) But I didn't say anything.
 Well time skip to this morning, I make a comment that who ever cleans the bathrooms has taken down her drawings again, so she decided to go back and do more. I go to the bathroom with her because I did need to go to the bathroom before class. My other friends are in their vaping (not really important but kinda) so when a teacher comes in we all hide in a stall and she calls us out on it. My friend and I walk out of the bathroom and head to first hour, half way through as we're talking the discipline guy comes into our class and points at me, then asks 
""Where's G?"" (G being my other friend)
We don't know so we say as much. Then during second hour two other girls are brought out of class and questioned, then I am. I walk down to the office and the discipline guy proceeded to grill me questioning what I was doing in the bathrooms, asking if I was vaping or doing the vandalism. I said I wasn't. He then asks me if I knew who did so he could report them to the police. I lied and said I didn't. He let me go. Time skip again to lunch and we walk back to the school (we have open campus.) And there's a cop car sitting outside the school. We walk in and to the stairs to get to my locker when a kid points at us and says 
""Oh yeah everyone's looking for you two someone stitched on you two."" So we both freak. I tell her,
""Listen you need to tell them it was you. I don't want to get in trouble."" She begged me to go to the office with her when she turned herself in but I refused because I was so scared. I later got called into the office to tell the discipline guy that I did know who did it and that I was sorry for lying and now my best friend is in a lot of trouble, and possibly facing legal charges.

They both live a different life from me and after an incident with my dad I've never wanted to continue the relationship. 

We were both raised on the farm life and very much farm kids but I only came on weekends or weeks at a time due to my parents separation. I've never felt included by my dads side of the family and even by by step-moms side. I realized that when I turned 12-13 so and I stopped initiating everything since if i didnt, he wouldn't care or make the effort for me.

"AITA [16M] for saying that someone can tell me that what I said is inappropriate, instead of redirecting me? I am autistic. The other day, I was at a bowling party for autistic people. I was in a conversation with a teen volunteer. When we were talking about in what grades and high schools we are, it got brought up in conversation that I had skipped grade 1, which is in part due to my late birthday along with other circumstances. She said ""Wow, you must be very smart."". Now sometimes in conversations I get awkward and nervous and do not know what to say and ignore my own judgment when the other person is not reciprocating, and feel like I must keep responding instead of their being silence. I sometimes test good on intelligence assessments despite not always having the best grades, so in response to what she said ""Thanks, I have a very high IQ and..."" was about to talk about other stuff but then an adult interrupted ""Left, what do you do for fun?"". Now previously, my mom had told me that I have a very high IQ and then when I asked what number it is, she told me that she will tell me what number it is only after I promised to not tell anyone. I thus assumed that it is appropriate to repeat the volunteer saying ""smart"" by saying ""high IQ"" without saying the number. My bad, a faux pas. I paused and said ""I am sorry? Are you trying to redirect me? Did I say something inappropriate?"".

The adult said yes. I thus said ""Okay. Can you please tell me if I said something inappropriate next time, instead of trying to redirect me? Trying to use a tactic on me is condescending and I am not low-functioning"". However, she then told me that I should act certain ways if I do not want to be treated as such. I then told her that there is a middle ground, and that my speech therapist at school had previously told me when I did something unexpected instead of redirecting me, which is evidence that it should continue as such.

"AITA - Child's Birthday Party, Cousins not invited Okay reddit, I have never done this before but I need some unbiased perspectives here.

One of my children is turning 4 soon, I am throwing her a birthday party that is aimed at 4 year old children. There will be a face painter and a bouncy castle. In the past, birthday parties I've been to with bouncy castles tend to be a mess for the smaller children, the bigger kids get in and go crazy, making it too bouncy for the little ones. And I want this birthday party to be about my daughter.

With that in mind I invited all of her friends that are within her age group, two of which have older siblings. I told the parents it was okay for the older siblings to attend (I figured one or two bigger is managable, versus 7 or 8). I did not invite my fiance's nieces and nephews because they are all older than 6 and historically rambunctuous and there are 4 of them. My thought was inviting them would be too many bigger kids, again, ruining things for the littles. Additionally, the face painter can only accomodate doing a certain number of faces within a time frame and I did not want to pay for more time.

Sorry this is a book.

I should add that while I love and care for my extended family, I am not the kind of person who feels they need to be included in everything we do and we just are not that kind of family. Not getting invited to a birthday party is no skin off any of our teeth. My fiances family however is more in the mindset of family needing to be included and spend a lot of time together.

Last minute I invited my fiances mom because my mom wanted to come and I wanted to be fair. His mother said she couldn't make it and I thought that was the end of it. Jump to today (party is tomorrow) and his family is very upset with him, his mother crying and his brother not speaking to him because his kids were not invited to the party. They feel that even though the kids are older they should have been invited because it's family. My feelings are that the party is for younger children and they don't need to be there.

I eventuall,y siad fine they can come as ann attempt to mitigate the drama. But they are still upset.

"AITA for going clubbing when my boss gave me the weekend off to take care of sick family? I (23) work in a takeout place that is always busy on the weekend, so I was scheduled Friday to Sunday. On Thursday my mom was rushed to the hospital after she had a random seizure, and my work was generous enough to give me the weekend off so that I can be with her in the hospital, as well as look after my younger (18) brother.

After seeing her on Friday, the doctors told her they needed to keep her in the hospital until they figured out the cause of her seizure, but she is not in immediate danger right now. My mom knew I had plans to go out for my friend's birthday, and she insisted I still go.

Both work in the medical field and rarely get holidays off. My husband and I have more ‚Äútraditional‚Äù work schedules and usually get normal holidays off and then use vacation time for other days we want off. 

This year, my SIL informed my husband of the dates she and her partner would be making the 3.5 hour drive to my in-laws to celebrate Christmas. It is the Thursday and Friday the week before Christmas. She told us she doesn‚Äôt expect us to take off but if we plan to come, they will be leaving early Saturday morning to visit the partner‚Äôs family. We asked about finding another time that could work for everyone and were told that for various reasons, there are no other options. So our options are to:

1. Drive down the 2 hours to my in-laws after we both finish work Friday and see everyone for a few hours. 

2. Try to request off that Friday and spend the day with everyone. The issues here is my husband starts a new job in December and starts with no vacation since it‚Äôs accrued. He will have probably 1 day banked by this Friday. 

3. Visit my MIL & FIL actually on Christmas when we will be in the area to see my family as well but this means not seeing SIL. 

My husband is very much a people pleaser and is thinking about #1 or #2 to avoid any ‚Äúkerfuffles‚Äù. I am frustrated that there was no communication about when we all could get together and that these dates were picked knowing we would have to work. I understand this is what works best for SIL however it‚Äôs not what works best for us. We could save on 4 hours of driving if we go with #3 and set a precedent for future years that if we all want to be together, we should all decide together.

"AITA for calling my friend out on her bs? For context: my friend complains bi-weekly about how much she hates her brother, parents, and her life. I try to give her advice on how to fix it, and how to make her life better. And then she makes it a circular argument. 

And today, I told her how much it infuriates me when she complains and complains. And never fixes the things that are in her power. And I told her ""if you don't bother fixing it, then don't bother bitching about it.""

Am I the asshole for being honest about how much she infuriates me?",0.28
"AITA for calling my sister a rude name My fianc√© was spiked a few  years ago and to this day she only trusts certain people with her drink like we where with eachother 4 years living together 2 when she trusted me 


Well  we decided to visit my family after a year of not seeing them (due to world issues) while here the younger generation of us decided to go to a new club the opened 


My girlfriend needed to used the the bathroom and unfortunately I was up ordering drinks so she asked my sister to To watch here

While she was coming back I asked her to help me hand down drinks so what would have been 5 minutes turned into 15 

When my fianc√© returned she asked my sister for her drink when she had about two to three swallows in my sister giggles and says ‚Äúhey I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs really your drink I put them down and was on my phone so god knows who owns them‚Äù 

My fianc√© went pale and said she felt like getting sick. So I rang a taxi while waiting my sister came out saying she was only joking she held them the whole time  in her hand the whole time my fianc√© needed to stop being a drama queen 

I said ‚Äúthat wasn‚Äôt a joke you‚Äôre just a cunt‚Äù 
Than ignored her till she went back into the club 

Our taxi arrived we ended up going to hotel and my phone has been blowing up since about my sexist name calling",0.17
"AITA for snapping at my stepmother I‚Äôm 23F. I lost my dad (50M) six months ago. He had ongoing mental health issues his whole life, but was always a very giving and wonderful person. From the time I was little, we had a great relationship, though he had struggles with addiction and depression. He always prioritized me. My mom and I lived in a different state, but he was always very active. 

When I was early into my teenage years, he married my stepmom (35F). I liked her; when they were dating, I actually told him I wanted him to marry her because she would watch my favorite anime with me and she knew how to do my hair. She was a really calming influence on him and had a young son from a previous relationship. She‚Äôs been dealing with his death pretty well, but I was staying at her house over the weekend to see my brothers and I learned she was dating someone new already. She had him over that same weekend to meet my brothers (16M and 11M).

I kind of snapped at her, telling her my father‚Äôs body was hardly cold. (Yes, I realize I was on some Hamlet shit). I still think it was extremely inappropriate for her to have her new boyfriend around her grieving kids. She started crying and told me privately that she felt like my father had taken over her life, that she was reduced to being a figure in his story when they married. She was younger and loved him but felt like he had ‚Äúrobbed‚Äù her, in a sense. I felt so uncomfortable with that and have been struggling all weekend. On the other hand, I feel like ‚Äîwhatever her issues with my dad were‚Äîshe shouldn‚Äôt have had a new man around her kids so fast.

"AITA for Driving Away? - Instacart Driver I deliver groceries through Instacart sometimes recently. I had two orders to deliver to two different customers on this day. I dropped the wrong groceries off to the first customer.

I hadn‚Äôt quite left their neighborhood before realizing what I did. I drove back quickly. One of the guys that lived there was outside and he guessed right on what was going on. He said they were inside trying to figure out what was theirs. I told him none of it, apologized profusely, but said  I had their groceries in my car. He was pretty understanding 

They had a good fewer items than the other customer. He took the items that were his from me. 

He then started to bring the groceries out that weren‚Äôt theirs. I asked that if they could just leave them at their front door, I would take them to my car. He was being very polite about it, at first.

A woman was in the back of the house. She didn‚Äôt come out but the door was open, so I could hear and see her. She was saying that I charged her card for all the groceries the other person got.

The man relayed that information to me (I could hear her since the door was open). I told him Instacart deals with the payment part of it, and I did not do that. I just delivered the wrong items to them. 


He stopped bringing the other groceries out, and told me basically he wasn‚Äôt going to bring the other items back until I called support.

I tried to think what to do, because the other person had a lot of dairy items, and it was hot that day, so I wanted to get the other person their items.

Instacart does not have phone support, at least not for drivers, so I‚Äôd have to open up a chat, wait to be connected, and that‚Äôs what the man wanted me to do - call Instacart 

I told him I would call (message)after I completed the other customers order, but that he had his items that he ordered, and I wanted to get the other customer their items.

I did kind of get into a mini argument. I told him I didn‚Äôt want to argue with him and that I didn‚Äôt know him , and that I felt uncomfortable because they were upset and I‚Äôm at their house. 

He was holding the other groceries hostage, and I decided then to drive off. My reasoning was I didn‚Äôt want the situation to escalate for me and they were upset, yelling. 

AITA for driving off instead of contacting Instacart support in front of them and asking them about the customers payment? 

I did contact Instacart after I was away from their house and told them what happened and what I did.",0.18

"AITA for staying at the club So I have been begging my friends to go clubbing with me for several months now. We‚Äôre all 21-22 year old college students and have been friends for the last 3 years and met in college. Two of my friends are dating each other (m21&f21) and my other friend (m22) has a girlfriend of his own. I enjoy smoking but love a good party and drinking socially, my roommates don‚Äôt like going out and prefer staying home which is fine sometimes but we‚Äôre young! i want to enjoy this last year of college together with them and have crazy memories together. The other night we finally all went out for my cousin‚Äôs birthday and we pregamed and ended up going to the club around 1am. My roommate (f21) wanted to drink and stay drunk without buying drinks at the club so she overdid it a little and ended up puking at the club at around 1:30 and i stood with her and held her hair and prevented people from recording her. One friend (her boyfriend m21) wasn‚Äôt allowed upstairs and was waiting outside of the club or just downstairs (I wasnt in the right mind to know). Again, I was pretty drunk and high myself and was desperate to spend time with my friends and cousins to celebrate. Security showed up and started taking my friend downstairs and out of the club. I asked my second friend (m22) if he wanted to stay and he said yes so I ask my friend (f21) if she‚Äôs okay to go find the other friend (her boyfriend) and go home. She said yes and walked downstairs so I assumed everything was okay. I call the friend that was outside the club and explained she was going outside to meet him. He was frantically asking where she was bc he is extra protective of her and hung up on me bc she was calling him. So in my head I think great she found him and they‚Äôll head home. The next day I go to check on our roommate (f21) and she says she doesn‚Äôt want to talk she wants to be alone so I decide to leave her alone. Later the same day our roommate (boyfriend m21) comes and starts ‚Äúscolding‚Äù the two of us (m22 and i) about how we shouldn‚Äôt have left her and that the other friend (f21) has been crying all day about the night before.

"AITA for complaining all day and ruining the group outing for everyone else? This weekend I went to a theme park with my best friend, her sister, and her sister‚Äôs friends. The theme park is nearly 3 hours from home. 

We were all instructed to be ready at 9 and meet up before leaving in separate cars. Two of the sister‚Äôs friends were 1.5 hours late. This irritated me and I expressed my irritation, though I let it drop to not spoil the mood.

I suggested, due to the time we were already stalled that we purchase fast passes to get to the front of the line on rides to avoid lines. I was told that since many people in the group couldn‚Äôt afford it, the considerate thing to do was to all wait in line together. I offered to pay for their fast passes and they said no. Of course, I was not happy about the lines and I said this when we waited in line. 

Here‚Äôs where it got worse: three of the friends waited in line for a ride while myself and my friend went to get food. The plan was to meet up with them when they got off the ride. While we were getting food, the 3 of them went and got out of line to get fast passes, made one failed attempt to contact us to tell us, and when we got back we had no idea where they were and waited in the rain for over 1 hour for them to get off a ride they weren‚Äôt on! And they had money for fast passes then despite telling me not to buy one! I confronted them on this as it really annoyed me.

My eyes were starting to hurt as it got late because I wear contacts and didn‚Äôt want to drive for 3 hours home with hurting eyes. It was 1 hour before the park closed. I asked if we could leave. They insisted on staying the last hour and I couldn‚Äôt help but complain I was in pain.

The next day I was accused of ruining their day with my incessant complaining. I think my complaints were justified and their behavior was inconsiderate at every turn.

"AITA for saying a friend was not singled out in a drinks line? A few weeks ago, a friend and I went to a fair. We're both in our 30s and everyone in line got carded before reaching the bar. My friend is 5'2, wearing a wig and a face mask, and got a little extra questioning. Since then every time being a 90s kid comes up, she brings up that she was carded.
This weekend we were at a party together and she brought up the story again and I said ""yeah I got carded too. They were carding everyone when I was getting my drink."" I didn't mention that she was in line behind me, because I didn't want to call her out completely. She could have easily said ""oh they didn't do that when I went up"" even though we were together.
Today she said I embarrassed her and that she had been questioned more than others in line. I told her that if I was being an A I would have told everyone that her costume covered more than half of her face. It was also height bias, but mostly face covering.
So AITA?

"WIBTA if I wore a similar style outfit to a bridesmaid at a wedding I'm a little mentally stuck on this one but I would like other peoples thoughts and opinions on this.

My friend (m) and his fiance (m) are getting married in about a months time. I've been invited to the wedding as a guest. I know they have been planning it for ages. For the last year anytime we've met up he's told me about the planning of this wedding. Where it is, what will happen, when it is, when I can expect an invite. During this time I had asked what the dress code would be like and he said he didn't really care so long as people felt comfortable and dressed relatively formal. However he did say that him and the groom would be wearing different shades of green and also that his bridesmaids would be wearing green also. So to not wear this color to the wedding. 

So I've went looking for formal nice clothes to wear to a wedding and found this burgundy maxi skirt with a split down the side as I don't really have formal clothes that fit at home. Didn't need to with covid. I also have a lovely formal black top that I've had years that goes well with any skirt. So I bought this maxi skirt. I bought it early as I knew I would need to make alterations to it as I'm a short person. I have also been practicing with makeup style and bought eye shadows that will match the outfit, particularly the skirt. I've not bought makeup in a while, again covid as I don't really wear much makeup. I'm also not the best with makeup so have been practicing with YouTube videos and wanted it all to come together nicely for the wedding.

Come today I was texting my friend and I mentioned I had gotten my outfit. He said he would like to see a picture and I sent it. He said it was nice but then sent another message saying that the skirt is the exact same style and colour as his fiances bridesmaids dresses. Both the skirt and bridesmaid dresses come from the same store so even though its a skirt and his are dresses it's the same colour and style from the waist down and then said he didn't know how this will work.

I feel blindsided. I wasn't able to respond back to his text message. I'm just so upset. I was respectful in not choosing anything green for the wedding. I honestly thought they were green as well. This skirt cost quite a bit of money and is half altered so I can't take it back to the store and ask for my money back. It is past the date I could exchange it for money either way. I found it so hard to find something I like that, that is formal and would suit me.

I know I should talk to my friend more about this, but because I'm still upset I don't think I would come across well. A part of me also thinks a skirt no matter the design is significantly different from a dress. Ironically I was very close to choosing the dress version of this skirt when looking online.

"AITA for insisting our 15 yo buy a car my husband and I already own instead of just letting him have/use it? My husband and I have two boys, 18 and 16. His biologically and my stepkids, if that makes a difference.

Our oldest, ‚ÄúHunter,‚Äù has been driving for 2 1/2 years now. He completed Driver‚Äôs Ed, he practiced his driving, got his required hours in, and saved money to put toward a vehicle. He scheduled and took his driving test as soon as he was able. That‚Äôs pretty much his personality - if he wants something he gets it done.

Hunter‚Äôs grandfather was ready to sell his car a little before the time H got his license, so Grandpa cut the kid a pretty amazing deal on it. Basically, H scored a sedan worth about 3k for a third of the price. He paid Grandpa in cash, then we surprised him by buying new tires and six months of insurance, gas, and expenses.

Now, here comes the 16 yo‚Ä¶ 

‚ÄúAiden‚Äù completed Driver‚Äôs Ed, but is super lax about practicing and getting the required driving hours to be able to take his final test for his license. He‚Äôs saved no money for a car or the expenses that go along with one. This isn‚Äôt a big deal if he‚Äôs just not interested in a car and driving (his father or I are still happy to drive him places if we‚Äôre available), buuuuuuuut a few weeks ago he announced his actual ‚Äúplan‚Äù is to just use our older Suburban as his own. He was somehow operating under the impression that because we don‚Äôt use it on a regular basis (my husband and I each have newer cars) it would be his whenever. 

I reiterated to Aiden that Hunter had to pay for his car, so if he wants the same freedoms and access he would have to do the same for a vehicle of his own. If he really wants the Suburban, I offered Aiden a really good deal on it, but told him we weren‚Äôt going to ‚Äúfinance‚Äù the whole thing for him, he‚Äôd have to pay for at least half upfront. For a hot minute Aiden decided he‚Äôd just pay Hunter for gas in H‚Äôs car and use that whenever, but of course Big Brother shot that right down. Hunter also educated Aiden that he was expecting him to chip in for gas after the holiday break if he still wants rides to school/games/friends‚Äô houses etc. now that he‚Äôs old enough to drive and get a car of his own.

Aiden is now beside himself that a perfectly useable vehicle is going to be sitting in our driveway and he won‚Äôt have the access to it that Hunter has to his own car. 

I‚Äôm wondering if if I‚Äôm the asshole because on the surface I don‚Äôt care if either kid drives the Suburban - it‚Äôs paid for and safe and no big deal if they accidentally dent or ding it. However, it seems unfair to me that one kid put so much effort into thinking through what he wanted to do for a car and accomplishing his driving and freedom goals, and the other wouldn‚Äôt have to do anything close.

So, AITA for sticking to my guns on this one?

ETA: since H got a big ‚Äúfamily discount‚Äù on his purchase, we‚Äôd extend the same help to Aiden if he chooses to buy something of his own. If he finds a car worth 3k, we‚Äôd have him pay 1k and recreate the savings H benefitted from, for example.",0.11
"Aita for pawning cards? My fiance of 3yrs is widowed. She plays this game called Magic the Gathering. She's really into it and won't let anyone forget that the card game is how she met her late husband. 
I wouldn't mind this so much, but the amount of time, space, money, and attention she puts into this game is ridiculous. Seems like new cards come out all the time and she always takes the kids to the store and racks up hundreds in cards. Her eldest seems to also be into it now and she won't stop talking about how his father was ""the best"" which makes me roll my eyes. It's literally a child's game with fantasy fairytale characters. It is embarrassing. 
Once I picked her up from a night at the store and saw she was the only female there. It makes me upset that she's having fun with other men. 
The basement she has is filled with totes with these cards she never touches, but won't get rid of. She finally agreed to thin some of them out was able to sort through the ones she wanted and put some aside to sell. I came across this huge box and she freaked out. Told me she'd never sell it as it was her former husband's cards and she was saving those for the kids. I told her to just get rid of her husband's tote if she's not going to touch it and she got pissed. She got more mad when I told her she needs to grow up and move on. 
This isn't normal the amount of stuff she has for a game nobody has heard of. It is obvious she has some weird obsession, she wants attention from the men at the store, and she needs therapy. 
It's also sad her son is into it. He should he a normal kid playing sports or video games. 
She left for work next day and I was upset. I talked to some friends and they said to just donate them since she'd never notice, it'd give me space, and maybe it'd give her some clarity how her quality of life won't change. So I took some totes and her husband's to a pawn shop. They actually gave me over a grand for them! 
Flash forward, she noticed that some totes were missing. She asked me where they went and I was honest with her, but that I got a decent amount back. It'll help pay for our honeymoon. She blew her top, cursing at me and told me that it was none of my BUSINESS, those were her children's, and those cards were irreplaceable. I offered to just buy them again when we have more space, but she told me some of the cards were thousands of dollars now and were extremely old, which I still have a hard time believing that they were worth that much. Apprently some cards are put together her ex husband did and she can never replicate. 
She now won't talk to me and says she doesn't want to get married. My parents think she's being ridiculous and that I've dodged a bullet. Her sister called me and told I was an asshole and she should sue me for the cards worth. I've offered to pay for it and go to therapy with her, but she has blocked me as of this morning. I feel I was well within my right to stand up for myself and for her mental health.",0.86
"AITA for honestly telling my sister university just wouldn't be for her? Background:My younger sister (16) has never really cared about school. Not that she's dumb or anything, just academics are not her priority. She has always just coasted through school, and spent more time hanging out with her friends or focusing on her Instagram account (self-proclaimed beauty and fashion influencer). As a result, she barely does homework, has gotten detentions for overdue or incomplete assignments, that sort of thing, because her time and effort was elsewhere. For me (19F), I have just finished my first year of uni studying nutrition and dietary health sciences.

Story: My sister is coming into Year 11 next year, so now is the time for her to be looking at her senior subjects for the next two years. These subjects help you to guide your way to uni if that's what you want to do, so it's important that you choose carefully if you have a specific degree you want to study. My sister has never had an idea what she wants to do after school, she just doesn't care about it, and was going to pick the subjects that will get her an easy A. But because a lot of her friends are planning on going to uni, she has now decided to take it a bit more seriously and asked me for advice on what subjects to pick to get her in. Not on any degree or specific uni, just ""I wanna go"".

I was truthful: I don't think she will hack it. I told her based on her past history with school, I think she should go back to picking whatever subjects will get her graduate and look at other options, like TAFE. She immediately came back with ""what, do you think I'm too stupid?"", which of course I don't. She's very creative, and I think she should do something with that. But I told her that uni is very academic focused, and the repercussions for late or missing assignments and failed exams are a lot more severe than high school. The movies are wrong: it's not all partying, you actually have to study, and my sister has always been more interested in social activities than school. 

I told her rather than go to uni because all her friends are, pick the subjects that lie with her strengths and look at TAFE courses. She can always go to uni later on if she chooses. She just got mad at me, accused me of saying she was stupid and not able to handle uni, and stormed off. My parents said I was too harsh and just should have just helped her since she expressed desire to go to uni. AITA?

EDIT: I'm accepting the judgements thus far, but I want to clear up something that I had to delete for the character limit. I never told my sister she will never make it to uni, nor that she is a write off and to give up. In fact, I told her the opposite. This was the exact advice I gave:

My sister is very creative and has a strong interest in fashion and beauty, so I told her to focus on doing some courses at TAFE like a Certificate in Textiles or do an apprenticeship in make up or something like that, because she really enjoys it and is good at it for her age. TAFE is a lot more practical and hands on, giving actual practical work experience and courses are usually completed faster than a 3-4 year academic bachelor's degree. I told her that if she decides after that she still wants to go to university, and she has done some TAFE certificates under her built, then she can enrol as a mature age student (which most universities class 20-21 years of age as ""mature age"") and those certificates can count towards course credits in her degree making the degree easier and/or faster to obtain. 

My cautioning against just diving heads first into uni was two things: 1. My sister has never shown interest in academics or motivation to get anything more than a passing grade, choosing to focus instead on more fun, practical activites. I used this example in another comment but f my sister was given the choice of doing an assignment for school that would grant her top grades and graduate tomorrow, or to do her friend's make up for a party, my sister would choose do to the make up because that's what she finds fun and interesting. Grades and school just don't matter to her. and 2. She doesn't know what to do at uni. Her reasoning is ""all my friends are"". That's it. She has no idea, not even just a smidgen of passion or interest, in what she wants to study or achieve. University is hard, tough gig that is much more academic, sit-in-a-boring-lecture, expensive slog. I feel for my sister uni would be waste of time considering she has no other motivation beyond ""my friends are going!"". She's practical, hands-on, and I think TAFE or an apprenticeship would suit her a lot better for now while she figures out what to she wants to do.",0.19
"WIBTA if I bail out on my promise to stay at a job my aunt got for me? Okay so here‚Äôs the back story, I recently moved to Toronto from Texas and I‚Äôm staying with my aunt and grandma for the time being until they move out. (I‚Äôm taking over their lease) I knew I was gonna have to find a job but I wasn‚Äôt too worried about it since I have a good amount of experience, and I was gonna have time once I got here to look for work. It wouldn‚Äôt have been an issue. 

A couple weeks before my move, my aunt contacts me about working at the cafe downstairs from our apartment, since she works there and can put in the good word for me. I accept because, well a job is a job. My first shift there was okay but I come to realize I‚Äôm not super interested in working there at all. I know nothing about French bakery‚Äôs, everything in store is old and even the register is ancient. I have to make each order by memory and it‚Äôs just not that enjoyable. The customers are all older people and not that I don‚Äôt enjoy it, but it‚Äôs just not my cup of tea. I worked in the ramen business for 3-4 years before I moved here and I‚Äôd much rather work in a ramen/japanese restaurant where I can make better tips and work with a more modernized environment. 

My aunt told me that she would prefer I work at least 6 months there before I look for another place but I kinda don‚Äôt wanna do that and would much rather look for another job ASAP.

"AITA for leaving daughter's wedding reception early to prep food for the reception? My daughter got married last week, and after telling me just prior to the wedding that she only wanted pictures of her and her bride, I left pretty soon after the wedding was over to head to the reception site and finish prepping the food, all of which I cooked and prepared.  

There was about an hour and a half between wedding and reception, and I was working alone, as the few people I had asked to help didn't make it.  My daughter also promised me that she had plenty of people to help with food, even sent a text to her ""squad"" that as I was doing all the cooking, I'd need a lot of support. I was feeding about 80 people a full buffet meal, as well as some snack type platters (cheese, crackers, fruit, veggies, etc).  

In prepping the food, I had two large dishes of two main dishes prepared, and was working in a kitchen about half a mile from the reception site.  In order to serve everything hot, I prepped food in cycles and was busy for the first hour and half of the reception and missed out on it.  

My daughter and her new bride are upset with me and claim I ruined their special day.  I am upset and sad that I didn't get a picture with my daughter as a bride.  I did get hair and nails done, had a mother of the bride dress, and fully expected to be included in the wedding pictures.  When I mentioned it to my daughter at the reception (toward the end), she huffed and said we can just take a picture then.  She'd been dancing and drinking for hours by this point, and I'd been in the kitchen for hours.  I declined, because I wanted a portrait, not a snapshot.  She took that to mean I called her ugly, and so her new bride and guests because to heckle me, screaming obscenities at me (and my entire generation!) until I walked away and left. I was blamed for ruining the wedding, their lives, the economy, the country and the environment.  Maybe more, but I didn't stick around to hear anything else.

Both daughter and new daughter-in-law live in my home, along with daughter-in-law's mother.  This was arranged prior to wedding, because of them wanting to save for a home, and her mom not being physically able to live alone.   All my friends now suggest I kick them out for being so disrespectful, what with all the obscenities.  I've basically avoided my home for the past few days, because I don't know what to do or what to think.   

Am I the a**hole for leaving early and missing part of the reception, because I wanted to ensure the food was ready and presented at the correct temp? Honestly, I was nursing hurt feelings over the wedding too, but kept that to myself, until the end of the reception when I brought it up to my daughter.",0.6

"AITA for not letting my dog on the couch? I am very aware that going into reddit with this question will cause me to be crucified as we are all dog lovers here, but here goes. We have a 1 year old border collie called, let's say Karen. Karen was a lockdown pup, a rescue and my pride and joy. Over lockdown, myself and my SO bought a house and did thef usual spending money on nice things for the house, including a couch. Karen likes the couch. Karen hates her bed. Karen sheds a metric f*ckton.

The downstairs to our home is completely open plan and that's where the dogs sleep. (We did try to let them sleep upstairs in our room on their beds for a while but they're very noisy and move around a lot at night so it didn't really work.) There is no real way to prevent Karen from sleeping on the couch. We have tried barricading with chairs as a last resort as no amount of discipline works. She will contort herself in such a way to get past the barricades to the couch.

We know she's not allowed up there. Karen knows this too, to the point where if she hears us get up out of bed she will stealthily pour herself off the sofa and lie on the floor as if she'd been there the whole time. Then if I go back upstairs, back up she goes.

She's generally very well behaved, gentle and affectionate but when it comes to this she's just like... Yeah f*ck you.
Her younger brother Mike is way more chill, he's happy on his bed / the floor all night with no complaints.

My SO doesn't enforce this as much as me, the dog hair on the couch doesn't annoy him I guess, but my whole life, clothes, car, food etc is covered in dog hair, can't I have just this one thing be for us? AITA?",0.42
"AITA for not letting an ex-friend back into a friend group  

I (f 19) am part of a discord server with all  my friends where we either hang out or do study groups to help overcome the stress of college life. My friend‚Äôs younger brother (15) was invited to the server roughly a year ago, while he is occasionally nice, he does have a short fuse.

.A few weeks ago, I noticed that his status was saying how he lost his self-confidence which worried me. I messaged him and asked him what that was about, keeping in mind that I was working on an essay due that night, so my notifications were off. I typed in the cant speak channel telling them (my boyfriend and my friend) that I was getting some water. when I came back, I saw the messages and decided to open it up. This was all within 10 minutes and he got mad and said that clearly did not care about him if I was typing in other channels. He ended up leaving the server that night because he was mad at my friend (who he called a whore and a slut because she called him a child a few months ago) and me for not answering quick enough.

The next day he began texting me again asking to come back, but I said no because he was rude, and we all need a day to take a breather. when I told him that I would let him back in if we talked and came to a mutual agreement for how he treated me (he said a lot more about me and said that I had no work ethic, failing to see that I am taking a bunch of classes this semester), he said no. At that point, I was mentally not there, I was burnt out from the essay the day before and tired of him treating me like trash. I asked him if we could reschedule to talk, and he got mad and blamed me for his mental crisis. I lost it and had a bad anxiety attack, I know that he is young, and he is going through the motions, but I really care for him like a younger brother and the way he acted towards not only me, but my friends were horrible.

I wrote to him about how I felt really hurt, and he ignored it and said that he got a girl now, but it looks like I wouldn‚Äôt care, basically deflected everything I said. In addition, he has been going around and telling my other friends, who were not aware of this situation, that he wasn‚Äôt associated with us, and that we were weird anyway.

One of my friends feels like he could be brought back in if he does apologize, but I don‚Äôt want him because I feel like he won‚Äôt. Does that make me the asshole? I know that he is going through a lot home wise, but he shouldn‚Äôt be lashing out at those who want to help him out.",0.53
"WIBTA for refusing to visit my family? I (30M) currently live in Texas with my husband and 3 yo daughter. All of my family lives in New England. I have lived here for over 7 years now, with plans to eventually move back to the northeast, but right now, our careers are thriving and we are in the process of expanding our family. We visit my family regularly throughout the year, at least 3-4 times per year. We even drove up for a month long stay during Christmas one year and were up there for 2 months at the start of the year to help out. 

The last time my family visited was in June of 2019. They were supposed to visit the following year but canceled due to covid fears, which we were okay with. We still kept our trips to go visit them. I have been trying to get them to come visit even just once, but everytime I try to suggest it, even to the point where I am paying for the flights, I get every excuse under the sun. 

Needless to say it has not done well for my mental health and my daughter is starting to get upset about them not wanting to come see us. Our final trip up there this year is for Christmas but after that, we have no other trips planned and have talked about not going to visit until they make the effort to visit us.

"AITA for screaming at my brother? We have a new puppy (have had for about a month). He is objectively *my* dog. I paid for over half his fee. I will be bringing him with me when I move out for college, I pay for his vet bills, his toys, his beds, his food, his collar. He's like 3 months old. I'll refer to him as AS (initials).

We have couches that go up and down with the push of a button. AS was sniffing around as a puppy does and went under my brother's footrest. We'll call brother J. J went to put down his footrest and my sister and I said not to because AS was under there. He either didn't hear us or ignored us. The footrest goes down and catches AS on the neck between the metal. 

My sister and I are panicking because AS is whimpering and crying [Don't worry, he was a bit shaken but overall not hurt]. We tell J to put it back up and he just sits there for a good 7-8 seconds as AS cries. I scream, ""OH MY GOD! WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?"" and he finally starts putting it back up.

I retrieve AS and cradle him, check for injuries and all that. As I do so, my dad says, ""You owe J an apology. That was not okay.""

Keep in mind, J has uttered no apology for AS yet. I glare at my dad as I don't think apologies should be issured with insincerity. I force out an apology, just a simple ""Sorry."" My dad says I owe a ""real, genuine apology."" So I say, ""I'm sorry for yelling at you for hurting my dog.""

J goes, ""Maybe you should keep your dog in line."" Both my sister and I agree that AS was shrieking for a much longer time than it would have taken for my brother to immediately put up the footrest.

My mom later said, ""You owe J an apology. You were way out of line.""

J has still said no apology and I don't think I owe him one until he issues one first. I know this is a petty issue, but AITA for not apologizing?",0.02
"AITA for giving my friend $25 instead of $50? I tried to upload this, but too many characters. Pease ask for any clarifications! Throwaway, names changed, etc.

Backstory: I (early 30s F) was friends with this girl JANE for a few years in my 20s. An incident several years ago ended our friendship, and it came up recently in conversation. I feel guilty and am wondering if I am in fact guilty (although at the time I definitely didn't think so). Will do my best to be unbiased here.  JANE and I connected due to both having anxiety but wanting to do normal things like hiking and clubbing. I thought she was a lot like me, but she did have an unfortunate habit of... making herself the victim, ENDLESSLY. I mean it was constant problems with people. Including her twin sister, who she loved. Bringing this up for a reason you'll see later.

The incident: I did not drive, due to anxiety. She did. I worked a normal job and had a side gig as an occasional photographer. Booked my first wedding, and it was in our hometown (we both lived in a city 1.5ish hours north). Asked her if I could give her $50 to drive me. She agreed happily as we had our mutual friend there, and she could see her. I was happy too. The day arrives, we get there, several hours in she starts texting me about stomach problems (she has IBS). Bride and groom end up letting me off early (I think it was around 8pm). I felt so bad, thanked her. She said she wanted to drop me off at the train station by her house. Have to explain the map here: I lived far west, she lived far east, downtown was in the middle-ish. The trains from one side to another are several hours, plus waiting in the freezing cold (January) for up to half an hour for each.

I checked GPS, found an alt route that would take her an extra 5 minutes and she could drop me at downtown and cut my time to just over an hour vs at 2.5 hours (plus walking home after). She said no, that I was ungrateful and selfish and didnt care about her digestive system. I DID care!! I also thought that it was reasonable to go this alt route that would only be 5 more minutes for her to get to the bathroom! Didn't happen, got dropped off in her neighborhood and had to walk down a bunch of stairs to a secluded, dark waiting zone for the first train.

Friendship ended because it took me close to 3 hours to get home from there, arrived past midnight, had $3000 camera equipment plus the couple's photos the entire time in plain view.. it was a cold, snowy night... and I gave her only $25. She said i reneged; I said she reneged and it was 5 MINUTES MORE FOR HER. AITA for not giving the full $50?

&#x200B;

Edit: The reason I wrote about how she was always the victim... she upset me further by telling me that she would tell our mutual friend about how selfish I was, and that she would believe her over me. I got anxious and didn't fight for the mutual friend. I didn't want to bring drama to her. And so I lost her too in the fallout. I feel so stupid. It was just $25... but it was a terrible night.

"AITA for putting away my boyfriend's keys? Sorry for my english. It's not my main language. 

I live with my boyfriend. Both of us have keys. Additionally, he has a copy of keys of his father's apartment. He's at home at 16:30 and I'm at 17:30 from job.

One night, he had friends at home, so I cleaned the house and put away all his stuff into his drawer including his keys. I thought it was the other keys. 

The next day at 16:30, he texted me saying that he couldn't open the door because he can't find his keys. I told him that I saw keys on his nightstand yesterday so i put it into his drawer. He was mad at me because he said that I shouldn't touch his stuff without telling him and now he had to wait for me to return home so he can get in.

When I got home, he barely talked to me. He took a nap and when he woke up, he asked me for an apology. I refused because I think I didn't do nothing wrong because he should had checked if he had his keys or not before going out. He told me that he did looked out for it but he couldn't find it on the nightstand so he assumed that it was in his bag. I told him he should had checked just to made sure that his keys were really in there rather than just ""assume""

"AITA for pushing back on my roommate asking for rent from my boyfriend? I live in a house with 2 other people. My boyfriend of 4 years visits \~3-4 nights a week, and pays an equal split of utilities. One roommate is demanding a share of rent from him too, or is saying he should only stay 2 nights a week as a visitor and continue paying a full utilities split. The lease says guests can't stay ""more than a consecutive week"" which he is taking to mean only seven days cumulatively over a month, but which literally means ""no more than seven days in a row."" When my roommate interviewed for the place I mentioned my boyfriend is over frequently and he said it was not a problem.  My other roommate agrees with me on this re: rent expectations but does not want to get involved.

The landlord is friendly with me but not very involved in the property. I am the master tenant and the other two roommates are sub-lessors who she has no contact with. The roommate who is raising the issue has been here around 6 months and his sublease is almost up-  I checked and I could legally choose not to renew his lease but I know he wants to stay and I think it would get ugly and terrible if it came to that, so I just want to find a situation that feels fair to everyone. My roommate has been unwilling to have house meetings or talk in person about anything since he moved in, and will only text short responses. My other roommate does not have an issue with the arrangement- we've checked in about it every so often and do actively chat and communicate about other house things.

My boyfriend has his own place, but it's a bit of a shithole that has been exacerbating his health issues, and he is locked into his lease until it runs out. He was furloughed during covid and can't afford to pay two rents. When not at my house, he stays with his parents 2 hrs away. BF doesn't keep any stuff here, and we cook together but otherwise stay in my room. He is very neat/clean/considerate. I also do the bulk of the cleaning in the house despite having assigned duties among the roommates, which I've tried to start conversations about but the same roommate has declined having any house meetings.

I've lived here for 5 years, and my boyfriend staying over has never been an issue before, probably due to better communication in general (checking in regularly and defining boundaries together) and my roommates also having partners, so there being some reciprocity.  I asked if there are specific behaviors or anything that are an issue, and my roommate said no he just thinks he should be entitled to pay less rent. That is not realistically an option, and my boyfriend only being here on weekends is not really sustainable either. BF has no personal space here (storage or otherwise), is low-impact in the house and is already paying a full share of utilities despite being here half time (usually less). I'm not used to having tense roommate relationships, and I gotta say I'm not a fan!

AITA? What is fair in this situation?

"AITA for telling my brother my niece got drunk by her friends father? (I'm 22) a few days ago my niece (15) told me she got drunk at her friend's house. I didn't tell my brother solely because she got drunk BUT because of /how/ she got the alcohol. she told me her friends FATHER (30's) let them drink & I found that creepy.

my niece told me he gave them rum & soda, let them go outside tipsy alone, left the rum out (which they snuck around & drank more of later that night) & he found out they got drunk, but he didn't report it to my brother.

I thought it was SUPER creepy how he did all that. my sister-in-law however, got on my ass saying I was in the wrong bc my niece confided in me & I broke her trust... shouldn't she be worried about the man who secretly supplied her minor daughter with alc? 

she even went so far & said if my brother called the cops on that guy, she'll call the cops on my mom bc she let me drink wine at 13. (in the states I've lived in, it's 100% legal for parents to give their children light wine or beer with supervision.) I don't think it's a comparable situation at all, my own mother gave me wine & watched me, this grown man who isn't related to my niece gave her rum & let her go outside alone while tipsy...

"AITAH for saying that my aunt's adopted daughter being out of control is because of her parenting? I (26M) was at an extended family gathering and the conversation of my cousin came up, she's 20F now, and she's been out of control since she was around 16 from what I can gather, she started by cutting classes, underage drinking and sex, possibly prostituting herself due to unexplained items she owns without a job, she eventually dropped out of high school after she got pregnant at 16, gave birth at 17, and 5 days later she left home and her baby. Because she was originally adopted, her mother, and all of her relatives didn't want to take the baby in, and they didn't know who the father was, so they put the baby for adoption. She came back 2 years later with a husband (different guy) and pregnant, gave birth, and then left home again, this time leaving her 2nd baby with her ""husband"", and even he has no idea where she is.  


So at the gathering, the general idea is that everybody thinks poorly of her, because even though she was adopted, she was given a normal life only to end up that way. Her mother, my aunt, said it must be the ""genes"" again because she was adopted, I got angry and told her that it must've been her fault.  My grandma, my aunt, and my cousin all lived together, because my grandma needed a caretaker, my aunt just never moved out as an adult and became the primary breadwinner, she was infertile so she adopted a daughter as a baby, however, she was essentially raised to be a borderline servant, with massive amounts of chores used as disciplinary tools because her mother was a single working mom, in my opinion beyond what's necessary, and routinely berated for not being good enough or messing up, and this is only what I've seen when I was over as a guest, I imagine it must've been way worse if that was how she was treated when guests were over. This even happened at other relatives, where if they were preparing for a gathering she'd essentially be ""borrowed"" to help out.   


I pointed out how they treated her growing up and it caused a massive argument, with the mother being defensive, and one other aunt coming to her defense, however everyone else (about 6 or 7 other people) were silent. The general idea was that my cousin should've been considered lucky to have gotten the life she had, and that children contributing to the household is expected, with me saying that doesn't entitle them to treating her like a slave. I eventually got pissed off to the point I simply left by myself. A few hours later my parents told me that I was an asshole (they didn't actually say asshole) for saying what I said, and that even if my aunt was an inattentive bad parent, that's not enough for my cousin to become who she is today.",0.05

"AITA for narcing on my roommate for graffiti? I live with three other roommates, one of which is just terrible (we‚Äôll call her V). She‚Äôs vegan, and she constantly harasses the rest of us for eating ‚Äúunhealthy.‚Äù She leaves coffee beans on the floor that could poison my other roommate‚Äôs dog. She has an issue with not asking us before using our stuff. She‚Äôs used my hairdryer without permission and my other roommate‚Äôs (we‚Äôll call her D) tweezers. She also trauma dumps regularly on our third roommate (we‚Äôll call him L) and he‚Äôs walked out of the room they share multiple times because he couldn‚Äôt stand her talking anymore. V also threw a fit when we tried to lay down boundaries with her, claiming we wouldn‚Äôt have them when we got older, which is actually not true at all. 

Overall, V is a total bitch who won‚Äôt settle for anything unless it‚Äôs her way. I feel like I‚Äôm walking on eggshells every time I talk to her. 

Me and my roommates all go to the same school, and we‚Äôre all in the same major, just in different years. While V is older than all of us, she‚Äôs a sophomore.

When graffiti showed up in our major building‚Äôs bathroom, I suspected it might be her, but I had never seen it until some of my classmates showed it to me. My jaw dropped. It was her work. I‚Äôd seen her sketchbook multiple times and one of the drawings on the wall was the exact same as her tattoo. 

Let me be clear here. I do not hate graffiti. When it‚Äôs in a public space, I strongly believe it‚Äôs doing it‚Äôs job, making a statement, and letting artists create. But this was in a brand new building, in a bathroom stall that very few people visit, and the teachers would have to shell out money to clean it up themselves. The professors AND department head gave out warnings, saying that they didn‚Äôt want to get anyone suspended or expelled, they just wanted whoever did it to clean it up. They didn‚Äôt want to include security or administration. When no one came forward, I anonymously reported V. Her student ID was temporarily disabled and she was lectured for her behavior. 

Now she‚Äôs going off about how all the professors in our department are narcs, and I can only sit there and say nothing, because I know she would make my life a living hell if I told her I reported her. I can‚Äôt help but feel amused that she finally faced the consequences of her actions. But I also feel bad for reporting her. We both believe in using art as a form of protest.

"AITA for not giving m my daughter a choice in whether or not we got rid of ""her"" cat? I have a 18 year old daughter. She had had some struggles with her mental health recently, however as far as I know the worst of it is behind her, and she still has a therapist she sees on a regular basis. 

My daughter loves animals, and has always begged for a dog or a cat. I originally said no, but eventually we caved and she picked out a dog from the shelter that's a great family dog for the past several years. She's been wanting a cat, but I said no, because we have the dog and we don't know how she'll behave around cats, and neither me nor my husband like cats or want one. 

A couple weeks ago, we found a kitten that had been dumped on the side of the road near our house. Where we live, it couldn't have gotten out of anyone's house, especially because it was only 6/7 weeks old. We took the kitten to the vet, and kept it for a couple weeks. 

My daughter grew very attached to this kitten, and honestly I noticed a lot of changes and she seemed a lot happier. She wanted to keep the kitten, although our intent had always been to find it another home. 

She's begging to keep the cat, and saying that it helps her mental health and she'll take care of it. She apparently told her therapist about it, who agrees that a cat could be beneficial and that we should keep it.

I told the therapist she was way out of line. 

My daughter keeps saying it's unfair because I let her get attached to the kitten and now am not giving her a say in what's done with it, and saying she's an adult and it's ""her"" cat.

She‚Äôs used fake numbers to text, called the cops on false claims, tried to fight my mom. The worst of all, though, is her fake pregnancies. 

She has her tubes tied. When my stepdad tried to leave her, she said she was pregnant. When she found out my mom was pregnant, somehow she was also ‚Äúpregnant‚Äù. Most recently, her boyfriend left her in May and she‚Äôs been saying she‚Äôs pregnant since then. Over the weekend, she posted saying she delivered prematurely and the baby passed. We found the photos online that she stole. She is sick. She is psycho. 

Last week, my stepbrother (18) also started staying with us again. Me and my mom posted today and outed stepdads ex for her lying about such a sensitive matter. We even posted her photo collage of her alleged ‚Äúdead‚Äù baby and the  proof that she stole the photos. Now, we feel bad for outing her, mostly cause my stepbrother is here. We were just so fed up with her constant lying and starting shit, and ALWAYS getting away with it. So, AITA?

Editing to add real quick: she has been a liar/psychopath even before the meth use. I‚Äôve seen her sober/not sober, her personality is the same. She doesn‚Äôt have these problems because of meth. Meth only enhances them.",0.98
"AITA for being upset with my wife for not consulting with me on a big expenditure? In the last week or two we have decided to buy my wife a new car and trade in her old one. She is due for an oil change on her car, which I knew she had arranged for today. Great, no problem. The car ran well, no warning lights or issues we were aware of. 

Tonight, I learned from her the mechanics she went to recommended various other repairs ($3,000 worth) which she agreed to without mentioning them to me. For context, the car is only worth about 7k, I am very much a car guy who is somewhat knowledgeable on repairs, and in our relationship, we have very much discussed expenditures anywhere near this size, especially when the subject is in one of our areas of expertise. 

I got pretty upset with her for wasting money on potentially unnecessary repairs, and certainly repairs that we wont get back in value when we trade in the car next week. Now she wont talk to me. AITA?",0.07
"AITA for Calling my Best Friend's Engagement Ring Expectations Batsh*t Crazy? My best friend (we will call them Jay) and I were watching a video online discussing some family drama surrounding heirloom engagement rings and we got into a heated discussion about what their theoretical expectations would be if they had an heirloom ring in their family.  

So the crux of their expectation is this: if Jay's mother had an heirloom engagement ring, Jay would expect their potential fianc√©(e) to ask their mother for the heirloom ring to propose to JAY.  They said, when asked why, that it is because ""it's MINE"" and that they would never want to give an heirloom that has history in THEIR family to go to someone who is NOT in their family.  

I told Jay that I think this is a batshit crazy reason to shirk tradition and social norms, and they were expressly confused by my lack of understanding.

"AITA for reporting employers for not giving me a job due to a disability I (39 M) have a back injury. Let me do a little bit of explaining. In 2018 I herniated three discs in my lower back ( not on the job) and had to quit my Automotive mechanic job do to it. I received back surgery December 2018 I returned back to work in a non mechanic related role in a auto shop. At my time at that auto shop my a****** of a manager had me putting some stuff away and while lifting correctly I reinjured my back. Workman's comp got involved I sued and I won. I applied for unemployment after my previous employer illegally fired me because of my back injury. Then covid happened and we all know the story on that one. Now I have been applying for jobs in the automotive industry (Auto Parts, Service advisors etc.) Non-automotive work and when I go through the interview process I am very upfront with my back injury. I have about seven years I've Auto Parts experience and three years of automotive mechanic experience. So I am well qualified for the positions I am applying for. I do have some limitations but I do have a doctor's note stating my limitations and the jobs that I'm applying for are within my limitations. I have gone through a few interviews and in the end of use when I bring up my back injury they get really weird and invasive with questions. So I have decided with those employers that I had interviews with and not hiring me to make a ADA complaints against them for not hiring me because of my back injury. So am I the AITA for doing this?

Edit: The reason why I'm informing potential employers of my back injury is because my previous employer that I had to sue because they tried to play it off that I did not inform them of my previous back injury.",0.2
"AITA for blaming my mom for my birds death? This happened in June but I (13F) feel as my mental health is getting way worse because of it.

Let me explain what happened on that day, my moms boyfriend was coming over for dinner. My mom was in a rush to get ready and went in my room (I wasn‚Äôt ever in my room) and she tried to get my birds to go inside their cage (which makes no sense to me since my birds only stay in my room and they only poop inside and on their cage) she could only manage to get 2 in the cage.  She didn‚Äôt close the door properly on the way out.

Fast forward to when her boyfriend leaves. Mom and I were having a conversation when we heard bird sqeeling, If you don‚Äôt know much about birds when they are happy they are INSANELY LOUD. I automatically assume the bird is happy till comes down my cat with my bird.

I automatically start screaming my head off,  this is the most terrifying thing I‚Äôve seen in person. The bird was dead.

This was the hardest I‚Äôve cried in my entire life, I cried so hard I almost threw up.

The worst part is after I calmed down my mom said to me ‚Äúthat‚Äôs why you don‚Äôt let the birds out of the cage‚Äù. The cage I have for them is small, and it would be animal cruelty if I left them in there.

The first person I blamed was her boyfriend, I admit I shouldn‚Äôt have blamed him. But my mom cared more about me blaming him then my feelings.

This birds death really effected me, for the first month every time I heard a bird chirp I broke down. And I still don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve gotten over it

My mom keeps switching sides between saying it‚Äôs my fault and then it‚Äôs her fault.",0.15
"AITA for fighting with my husband over a cat? We took our cats(3) to the vet for check ups and vaccinations. One of our cats had bloodyish pee but we weren't sure it was him bc we found it on the floor but had our suspicion it was. Vet said it may be a bladder infection from stress(he's definitely a beta in our house plus we adopted him bc his previous family left him when they moved a few months ago). 

Turns out we were right bc later that evening i caught him peeing reddish-brown pee on our bed and pillows,  soaking it right to the mattress topper. It was 1am so of course i had to tell my husband we have to wash the bedding and find a dry cleaner tomorrow. 

He got mad and threw the cat outside while i was stripping the bed. When i realized i got livid and yelled at him that the cat is sick and our responsibility now and that he was the one who wanted to keep him in the first place(i was setting up  adoption to another family at the time but my husband said he felt bad and didn't want to send him somewhere else). I also mentioned i might have to reconsider having kids if this is how he treats things that upset him repeatedly. He said that it's a cat/animal and I'm being too soft and it doesn't matter if he's sick it doesn't give him the right to pee on our bed. I argued he should have cleaned the litter and he argued that i should have.

This is not the first time we've argued about the cat since we've had some behavior issues before. This particular cat is very high maintenance unlike our other two cats. We've already agreed he is going to my MIL

Edit: i'm not divorcing my husband, you don't need to suggest that. He's otherwise a very kind just not to this particular cat. I just need to know if it's worth fighting with him about it

Update: kitty came back an hour later and my husband apologized to both the cat and me. He admitted he spoke out of anger and frustration and that he doesn't want any of our animals to get hurt. The kitty in question is an outdoor/indoor cat, he loves being outside, we've kept him inside to keep out unvaccinated kitten safe until she got her shots",0.25
"WIBTA For calling out my coworker for lying about her level of experience? So, I'm a teacher. I am in my mid 30s, and the most senior employee at my high school. This is my 11th year teaching. 

3 years ago, my principal left, and so did another teacher in my discipline. 

I was called in in the summer to run the interviews and choose a replacement teacher.  We had one very promising candidate who I recommended for the job. He turned it down, so the remaining admin chose the next person on their list ""Midge."" 

Midge was a 60ish yo woman who was a housewife for 30 odd years, and became a teacher when her youngest left home 5 years ago. I know this because I interviewed her. Her letter of rec (1) basically just said ""She worked here."" I did not reccomend hiring her. 

Today, we had a district-wide department meeting through Zoom. My boss made everyone introduce themselves with position, school, and experience. I kid you not, she said she had 20 years experience
I nearly spit out my drink. 

Then I realized noone questioned it, even my (new) boss. She's old enough to have that much experience. No one else was here to see her (unimpressive) resume. I may be the only one on staff to know she's on year 7. 

So, WIBTA to tell my boss?",0.25
"AITA for not getting rid of my ex girlfriends paintings? I (29M) have been dating ""Willow"" (29F) for just under 2 years. 

In my early twenties I previously dated a woman called ""Fiona"" who was a fantastic painter. She was especially good at painting dogs and cats and other animals.

When we were together, Fiona painted a wonderful portrait of my dog and also a portrait of my 2 cats. My dog has since passed away (he died of cancer 3 years ago) and my 2 cats are now elderly (both 16) and probably won't live much longer. As you can imagine I deeply cherish these paintings.

Even though Fiona and I broke up ages ago, I kept the lovely paintings she made of my pets and I have them framed and displayed in my apartment. I absolutely love them and when I look at them I think of my beloved pets (not my ex). 

However, the paintings make Willow kind of uncomfortable, simply due to the fact that they were painted by my ex.

 Willow is also a beginner digital artist, and in the past she's made digital artwork of my pets for me which I do love as well, but it doesn't mean I want to get rid of the paintings my ex did and replace them with the digital ones. Willow takes this as a sign I prefer my exes art style and that I must subconsciously still prefer my ex (not true at all).

Well we had another argument about it last night and Willow wants to try to do a painting of my deceased dog and two cats to replace my exes portraits. She even said she would try to copy Fiona's paintings exactly, so I wouldn't need the original anymore and I could throw them out.

 I told her I would never replace the paintings because they hold sentimental value (for my pets, not my ex). She got really upset and again accused me of preferring my ex Fiona. She also accused me of thinking Fiona is a better artist than her, which I don't believe I do (they have different styles and both styles are cool in their own way).

So am i the asshole for not getting rid of these paintings? It's been an ongoing issue and I'm wondering whether there's something I'm missing or not understanding?",0.06
"AITA For reacting badly to my grandfather's NEW relationship with his girlfriend from 50+ years ago? I'm a 19F and my grandpa has lived with us for the past year. 2 years ago, my grandmother passed away. They always instilled very heavy values to both myself and my mother about being honest, upfront, and living by a strict moral sense of rules. My grandfather even called out my father that ""lying by omission is still lying"". After my grandma died, he told the entire family that he would never date again and there would ""never be anyone like my grandma"".

Fast forward to 6 months ago. My grandpa started acting super off. He got snippy with the minor things and if you even came in the same room with him and his phone, he'd throw the phone down or hide it in his pocket. My grandpa is such a sweet, sensitive person, and this behavior was so off. He'd keep taking secret phone calls and both my mom and I got incredibly suspicious of why he was acting out and hurt so often. He'd go primarily after my dad, condemning him for house rules, how he acted towards my mom, or the minor things that would pick apart his character, and was very specific in saying that again, ""lying by omission is still a liar"". My mom saw the phone number that kept calling him, and decided to do research (against my knowledge), and found out that it was an old high school lover: Terry. He never told us who it was and kept lying saying that he was talking to an old business partner. My mom finally confronted him today, and he admitted, that yes, it was Terry and he had lied about all of it.

The reason why I'm upset about this ***isn't*** **the fact he has a girlfriend at all** or someone to keep him company at 77 years old. I don't want him to be alone. The fact was, that he stated that ""Terry was his first love, and MY grandmother came after her"". He went after a girlfriend he had in high school 60+ years ago (who by the way is still married smh) looking for 'companionship' (which in his lingo is courtship). He phrased it like my grandma was sloppy seconds. The fact that he lied multiple times to my face and my mother's face about taking trips to different places to meet old friends he used to work with, asked for MY help to delete his text messages from his phone that he sent to this person, and the fact that he unfortunately has a history of cheating on my grandma (he came home long ago with lipstick on his collar from another woman and had a history of going to strip clubs). It made me feel disgusted, so when he said that ""Well I'm still going to see her and I don't know what it'll turn into or not. I may be grumpy or I might not, I'll see if I feel like it"". He also turned his line about ""lying by omission"" into ""well I said the partial truth that I was visiting a friend"". I called bullshit and ran out the door. AITA for reacting this way? Should I have been more receptive to his ""admission"" of guilt, or more frustrated that he got caught rather than just telling me and my family?

Edit: Also just to mention, the way my mom found out the phone number, is SHE pays for his phone and saw the number reoccurring on the bill.

Edit 2: He also started talking to this woman not a YEAR and a half after my grandma passed away. He's been hiding this for 6 months from us.",0.79
"AITA for not telling my friends about a rare disorder I have and disappearing for a month because of symptoms? Quick context: I got incredibly sick with an infection a couple years ago. I‚Äôve ‚Äúrecovered‚Äù in a general sense but occasionally I‚Äôll have weeks of never being able to get up to go to school.

In these episodes, I‚Äôll sleep for about 19 hours a day, and when I‚Äôm awake, I feel like I‚Äôm still dreaming. I don‚Äôt care about anything and I‚Äôm dismissive towards anyone who tries to make me be active. Honestly, I don‚Äôt remember much of any of these episodes, so this is what people have told me.

I don‚Äôt have episodes real often, so I‚Äôm able to lead a fairly normal life. I have a pretty large friend group and before a while ago, none of them knew about my disorder. And I really wanted to keep it that way. 

About a month ago, I got a cold, and that triggered another episode. I ended up sleeping for about two weeks, and I woke up after that but wasn‚Äôt really -aware- until a couple days ago.

I missed three weeks of school and none of my friends knew what was going on. I have accommodations with my school so I was fine academically. But I‚Äôm guessing my phone was constantly pinging with my friends‚Äô notifications and that ‚Äúwoke‚Äù me up while I was still sleeping. 

So in the view of my friends, I mysteriously disappeared and when texted, all they would get back is various slurred voice messages telling them to fuck off and let me sleep longer. Which definitely is disturbing in their eyes.

I finally went back to school on Wednesday, and I thought I could play it off, but all of my friends are incredibly upset with me. 

They‚Äôve told me that I should have told them about my disorder so they knew I was safe, but I honestly never planned on telling them. I only have these episodes maybe once a year, and I almost never get sick enough to trigger them, so I didn‚Äôt think I needed to tell them. 

I also didn‚Äôt want everyone to treat me like a glass statue, which is already happening. My friends treat me like I‚Äôm gonna pass out while standing and if I even try to take a nap one of them will poke me to make sure I wake up. I‚Äôm honestly fine!!! The only reason I‚Äôm sleepy now is because I have to catch up on the weeks of school work I missed. There‚Äôs no need for them to worry, and I‚Äôve tried to tell them that.

They‚Äôre mad at me for not telling them about my disorder, because friends are supposed to tell each other everything, but I never even wanted them to know I was sick and treat me differently. I just want everyone to forget about it.

I know I was a bitch and worried them while I was sleeping, but I have no control over what happens in the time I‚Äôm asleep. It just doesn‚Äôt work like that. I understand that I really scared them (they were planning to call the cops to do a wellness check) but even after I explained everything, I feel like I‚Äôm still being punished for something I have no conscious control over.

So yeah, that‚Äôs the saga as of today,

"AITA for leaving family gatherings early? i (22M) normally leave early during family gatherings, if its like a birthday i feel like its customary to leave after the cake has been cut but i feel like staying there for 3-4 hours just to wait for a cake is exhausting and not entertaining, but sometimes i have no choice.

It's not like i dont get along with my family but i can barely talk to aunts, uncles, or cousins, my family is very different from me. I'm very bad at starting conversations and i don't share common interests with anybody there, even my cousins, they are older and are already full fledged adults, so i dont relate to them that much. even with cousins near my age i can barely relate. so i normally just show up eat and sometimes an uncle or aunt or my grandma will ask me how i'm doing regarding school or other stuff and i answer in the best way i can. then conversation dies and i just sit there looking at my phone and not doing anything. i just feel like me being there at that point is kinda pointless. so i just say goodbye to my grandma and the person who's birthday it is and i leave. but today my grandma was surprised that i left early (she always is) and it kinda made me sad. i live very near to my grandma i can visit her at any time.

"AITA for calling my ex girlfriend a manipulative bitch over a vent? Already, i know the title sounds terrible but please hear me out...

I (14M) and my ex girlfriend (13F) broke up a few weeks ago. We weren't fighting, there was no ill will towards each other, but I had noticed I wasn't treating her as well as I should recently. So I told her that we should break up so I could deal with school and fix up my own issues rather than taking it out on her. I told her that  I just needed to fix up myself on the inside. She seemed to take it well for the most part, she told me she understood and we went our separate ways. We didn't talk much at all, her being busy and me handling my own issues but when we did talk we got along fine like how we did before we got together. Which was why I was really surprised and hurt a few days ago when she posted a vent about me on her PUBLIC tik tok page. I didn't jump to conclusions, I just went to her and asked her if this was directed at me. When she told me it was I literally FELT the lump forming in my throat. I just said ""Whatever floats ya boat"" and went to bed. I woke up the next morning and told her how I felt. I told her that I did nothing to her to deserve that, and that she was being a manipulative bitch.

"AITA for making my boyfriend go to a wedding with me My (27F) friend is getting married a few hours away this weekend and my boyfriend (27M) and I were invited. When we received the invitation a few months ago, my boyfriend said he didn‚Äôt want to go, but would because I wanted to.  We RSVPd for both of us. 

His reasons for not wanting to go are that we are not very close with this couple anymore because they moved away before Covid and he is not excited about having to dress up. I want to go because I love weddings and I want to see my friend.

He views this as a drain on his weekend and has been very grumpy about having to go for the last few days which is making me feel guilty.  I feel that he should come without complaining because it‚Äôs important to me.

"AITA for telling my daughter she has to deal with consequences? I am a mom of two girls, Sierra (12) and Emily (10). Both of my girls had absolutely beautiful curls that went down to about waist length. I've never personally been able to grow mine out that long so I just could never bear to get theirs cut. Emily has never complained but it started bugging Sierra when she was about nine and decided to join the local girls' soccer team. She needed to have it tied back but because it's also rather thick, her snaps would continuously break and it was a hassle. She wanted to have it all cut back then until we managed to work out a solid way to braid her hair so that it wouldn't keep coming loose, and she stopped complaining about it. 

Two weeks ago, there was an incident at school where a kid stuck a bunch of loose pieces of paper in Sierra's hair. It was a major deal as Sierra got very upset and I had to go in and talk to the school about it. Unfortunately, Sierra's a *very* shy kid and that's been giving her a lot of issues since she's started middle school. The school promised to deal with it, but when we were leaving, Sierra asked if I'd take her to the hairdresser's and get her hair cut. I told her no and she just about had a meltdown, telling me that she was sick of having the other kids mess with her hair and didn't even want it anyways and I didn't listen to her. She was pouty for the rest of the weekend until she and Emily went to their father's for the week, and Sierra came back with most of her hair gone. It was cut to a little above chin length.

Of course, I wasn't happy. I called my ex and he acted as though I was in the wrong, saying that I obviously didn't care about Sierra if I let this go on this long. I did take Sierra's tablet for going behind my back over this, but I otherwise have talked this out with my ex and avoided getting too far into it with her because I don't want another meltdown.

Sierra was at tears during pickup today, telling me that the other kids have been telling her she looks like a boy. I obviously comforted her, but I told her that the haircut was her decision, I'd advised her against it, and now she has to deal with the consequences of her own actions. She got very upset with me and stormed off to lock herself in her room when we got home. She won't come out for a meal or speak to me, and I think I might have been a little harsh. I only wanted her to consider her actions, not to make her upset. AITA?",0.87
"AITA for banning gifts outside or Christmas and Birthdays? My (30F) mother (56F) is a first time grandmother to my 18 month old. We live very close to each other and my child often spends days and sometimes nights with her grandma. 

My mom has always enjoyed showering loved ones with gifts, it's how she shows love. Growing up I was given everything and so was my brother (16M).  But I have seen the negative ramifications of this type of affection in my brother who has never shown true appreciation when he is given a gift. Why would he? He gets everything he wants, so he barely musters a ""thanks"" when he receives a gift from someone.  This has always been the case, even when he was little so it's not because he is a teen.

He's a good kid really but I have always wanted to instil different values in my own children. 

So while I was pregnant and my mother went on her usual shopping sprees for my child, both my husband (30M) and I sat her down and explained we believe gifts should be reserved for Christmas and Birthdays. We asked her to respect our wishes and she agreed. 

However, now that my child is here, my mother has on several occasions pushed the envelope on the no gifts rule. We have gotten into a few small arguments over it and she always acts extremely upset when she buys a gift and I don't respond with excitement (because each time the gift is not purchased for Christmas or birthdays).

We finally had to have a very firm conversation where I asked her to stop buying toys for my kid and stick to the rule we had set even before they were born. My mother was irate and ranted about how she always respects every other aspect of my parenting but she wants to be able to buy gifts whenever she wants like ""other grandparents"" in reference to my child's grandparents on my husband's side who live far away and bring a toy or clothes as a gift when they visit every 4 or 5 months. I argued that it is not the same thing and often those toys get put away when they leave anyway instead of given straight away (we rotate toys to avoid clutter and boredom).

My mother was very upset but hasn't mentioned or purchased any toys since that conversation. 

It's been a couple of weeks since then and I wonder if I'm being too strict and whether my mother has a point.

My husband agrees with me on principle but is more open to my mother's side of things, as he sees it as something that's very common with grandparents and he thinks it's sweet that she wants to spoil our kid so much.

I was pretty much at my breaking point, and told them it wasn‚Äôt a big deal and it‚Äôs a normal thing to tidy up a room (they said their room wasn‚Äôt even that messy) and my friend and the rest of the group said that the parents were disregarding their feelings for wanting her to clean her room, and I told her that the two ideas barely correlated.

"AITA for making my little brother cry? Okay so the title sounds bad, but i didnt really technically mean to make him cry. 

Context: me and my little brother are 6 years apart so we dont always get along. Dont get me wrong, i love him to death, but he gets on my nerves yknow? He has severe anger issues and a severe god complex. Something doesnt go his way and its all over, he screams and cries and gets an attitude and everything. Its bad.

So story, I wanted to spend time with my father and play a game my entire family enjoys just with him. We were playing mario party. My little brother then comes in and starts damanding (stomping his foot and all) saying we let him play. I said no, but then got yelled at by my parents and he ended up playing. He was losing and getting angry (making sarcastic comments, being passive aggressive, on the verge of a tantrum) and then he starts to flip. I then said ‚ÄúThis is why I didnt want him to play, he always ruins the game‚Äù and he screamed at me and started crying. My dad then said his tantrum was my fault and went to calm him down. We continued the game (with way less fun as my dad went out of his way to try and make my brother win) but my brothers tantrum didnt stop. He continued with all the comments. After the game, both my parents said that my comment was rude and hurtful and said they are thinking of taking away my right to see my girlfriend for a few days.

"AITA for not giving a shit about my friend's positive customer review? Sometimes it feels like my friend is in deeply insecure or had narc tendencies, because while I love and enjoy our friendship, she has a history of seeking constant validation from me and others. and maybe this also contribute to me being a possible asshole  - she really lets compliments get to her head. she goes beyond that quick moment of proudness and excitement and will continue to talk about these compliments for weeks. I've been a little harsh lately, I'll admit that. my sister died 2 months ago very unexpectedly and my boyfriend cheated a week later due to lack of investment. I just started hanging out with people again and with said friend. she started a new job. as we were talking she said she had some great news but didn't want to tell me as she wanted to make the day about me. I told her it was okay to tell me. a customer left a positive review about her at her job. I said congrats, I'm proud of her. the next day she sent me a picture of the review. I didn't reply. she asked me later if I read it and what did I think.

I ignored the question because idk, grief or pettiness. 

a week goes by and she yet again brings up the review and expressed how shocked she was. I don't know exactly why but I snapped a little. I don't tell her I don't give a shit about the review, I tell her I'm happy for her but I'm in a bad place right now and a little comfort instead of bragging about something so small would really help. she backed down, said I was right it was small and obviously I don't care about how happy it made her.

My wife is a major mental health advocate and I like to think I am too. I believe in taking mental health days once in awhile if the stress and emotions with work/school are reaching a breaking point. BUT I do think there‚Äôs a line somewhere. 

Here‚Äôs the sitch, since quarantine ended and my daughter started going back to in person classes last year, she has been taking a number of mental health days since my wife told her that‚Äôs okay. At first I was completely fine with it and I was understanding. I know highschool can be rough especially having to deal with what the kids are dealing with in school these days. 

Well it‚Äôs gotten to the point where it seems every other week or once every 3 weeks my daughter is taking a day off school, citing mental health. I think my daughter is starting to abuse this. Wife and I tried talking to her about going to therapy if she‚Äôs really struggling this much, but she won‚Äôt go. So honestly I think she‚Äôs just taking advantage of her mom being so lax about this. Also, we haven‚Äôt seen huge changes in her behavior. She still seems to be a happy 15 year old for the most part. 

It‚Äôs important to care for your mental health, but my daughter needs to learn she can‚Äôt skip school/work anytime she feels a little sad.  I think my wife is enabling this so I had a talk with her. I told her that I think we have to put some sort of rule in place with these mental health days because she can‚Äôt be missing as much as she is. 

My wife scoffed at me and said ‚Äúhow dare you question your own daughters mental health‚Äù 
I love my daughter and I want the best for her. But I know she‚Äôs always been a little trickster so I think she could just be taking advantage of this. I want to reiterate that I‚Äôve had a talk with her about her mental health, asking if she needs anything from us, every time she takes one of these days. She says she‚Äôs fine every time.",0.18
"AITA for not telling my wife about my brother? I(28M) and my brother(30M) were inseparable. He was my best-friend, we had each others back. When my brother turned 20, he got into drugs and alcohol. He put them in my room to avoid getting in trouble. Our parents started to do room checks. They did a deep search of my room and found everything. I did decline everything and told them who it belong to. 

My brother swore they were not his and they believed him. They suggested I go to a rehab facility and get help. I told them I did not have a problem. I told a few friends what happened and one offered to let me stay with him. I moved out and stayed with him until I had money to find my own place. 
I got a good job and have not spoken to my family since I was 18. I got married recently and my wife found out through other family that I had a brother. She got upset that I never told her about my brother and wanted to know what else I was keeping from her.

"AITA for not insisting on euthanizing our cat My husband and I adopted our cat 14 years ago. She was a rescue and estimated to be 2.5 years old at the time of adoption. For about the past 3 years she has suffered from inflammatory bowel disease. We have been giving her topical steroids daily to keep her vomiting under control. Over the past year, we needed to add weekly antiemetic shots at the vet. Over the past month, she needs this shot twice weekly now. As soon as the shots wear off she starts vomiting. I used to take her to the vet for those shots and we had many conversations over the last year where he recommended to euthanize her. Her illness is chronic, with remission and exacerbation, and the shots are not meant to be given longterm. I'd say, she is in pain probably once/twice weekly when she vomits. The other days she does well, eats, sleeps, and snuggles. I brought up the subject of euthanizing her to my husband a few times. He disagrees with me and says she is still well and enjoying life. The last time I brought it up, he said that she is his cat now, and he will not agree. I replied that he now has to take her to the vet for her shots, and that I refuse to do so anymore. We both love this pet, and it would break my heart to let her go, but I feel it is time. However, I cannot convince my husband, and I am not discussing it anymore with him. So, AITA for not standing my ground?",0.16

I am of the same race that he was racist towards but I didn‚Äôt really know what was happening at the moment of the occurrence.

"AITA for snapping at my girlfriend after she wouldn't stop calling me a motherf*cker? I'm an Indian and I've been studying in the US for the past 2 years. My girlfriend, who is American, has a habit of calling me a motherf\*cker. She'll be like, ""Wassup, motherf\*cker?"" She does this jokingly, of course. Now, I am somewhat familiar with Western culture, and I understand that this is acceptable here as playful banter; so I didn't take offense to that. But, where I come from, this is a very offensive word. And you would never use that word unless you really hated that person and harbored a strong animus towards them. So, I'm still not okay with her calling me that.

I told her all of this and politely asked her to not call me that. She said okay, but every now and then, she would keep calling me that. A few times I ignored it, and a few other times I again politely asked her to not call me that. Every time she would say, ""Okay"" or ""Sure,"" but then she'd forget all about it.

This morning, I was already in a bad mood due to an argument I'd had with my father regarding my monthly expenses. It was a long talk and I was exhausted by the end of it. She came in to my room a short while after that and greeted me with, ""Hey, motherf\*cker?"" This time, I lost my cool and snapped at her, saying ""Shut up, you f\*cking c\*nt!""

She looked absolutely shocked when I said it. I immediately apologized. She said she couldn't believe that I'd just said that and that I should never ever speak to a girl like that. I apologized again and said that it was only because she kept calling me that despite repeated warnings and also because I was in a bad mood this morning that I reacted that way. She was upset and just left without saying anything else. I do think that my reaction was far too harsh and I will not hesitate to admit it and apologize for it; but I still think I'm not entirely at fault here. AITA?",0.5
"AITA For Thinking My Sister Could Take Care of My Mom If I Cannot? So AITA only allows 3000 words so imma sum this up in short sentences. Obviously more is to this.

   My sister and I are 11 years apart. She is 34 and I am 23. We have some pretty borderline abusive parents, to where she ranaway to college as soon as she turned 18, and left 7* year old me to suffer. She was well aware of my dad beating my mother in front of me, as well as overfeeding/neglecting/never buying anything for me, as for he controlled my mother's hard earned money while he kept quitting his jobs, and sent such money to Nigerian Scammers. My mom is considered an abuser for keeping me in that situation my WHOLE childhood, as well as being temperamental. My sister never intervened once; left me to handle it all while she could be her own adult. Even when my dad lost his legs and both of our parents became disabled while I was still a minor, it was all on me to take care of them as a teenager and she didn't do anything to help. 

Recently we had to kick my dad out of the house once and for all because he threatened me with a knife over a joke, and my parents (finally) broke up. My fiancee and I now live with just my mother, while my dad lives with my aunt. My fiancee and I have been discussing his plans on rejoining the army, because they weakened their test standards from when he was in training before, and he was ranting to me that he would of gotten in no problem if they were in place just five years ago. Just a couple days ago, he decided that HE WILL rejoin, which means money will be tighter than it is now for at least a month, while im on disability from a ton of mental illnesses just trying to make it through college. We'll get through it somehow. My sister and I actually act as bestfriends, and I was telling her about it this morning. She asked if I would have to move, and that our mom better know that she may have to take care of herself. I responded that I do not plan to for I have college here, but if I really do have to move around with my fiancee, then I do expect her to help take care of our mother when I cannot. My sister raged against me, telling me she does NOT have to do ANYTHING, and that she ABSOLUTELY REFUSES to live and take care of our mother like I've done all these years. That it is NOT HER FAULT that I am making all of these plans (to build a better future for myself), which may make our intermediate life a little less comfortable. I started having to ignore her texts after asking my sister ""Are you saying you won't take care of our mother if I cant?"" As for my sister adding on that she just doesn't want to live with my mom for the fact that she is lazy (she is 60 years old and does clean for the most part), and how my mom only ever calls her when she needs something (which isn't true at all; she even gave my sister 3,000 dollars after winning 80 grand from a lawsuit). 

Am I in the wrong for expecting my sister to take care of our mother if I have to leave?",0.89
"AITA For going to a wedding without my S/O My coworker had a small wedding and invited me. He talked about it a little at work and I always got the feeling that my SO (dating 4 years, living together for 2) would be invited. When I got the invitation it was addressed to just me and didn‚Äôt say anything about a plus one. My SO saw this and was upset she wasn‚Äôt invited, I insisted I would ask to verify she wasn‚Äôt invited but she insisted that I don‚Äôt ask because she ‚Äúdefinitely wasn‚Äôt invited‚Äù because they were being ‚Äúcheap.‚Äù  I took her word for it and RSVP‚Äôd for myself. I felt I had no reason not to go and I work with this person every day. As the wedding approached my SO started saying she can‚Äôt believe I was going and that she would ‚Äúnever go to a wedding if I wasn‚Äôt invited.‚Äù She kept telling me she talked to her co-workers and they said the same thing. I eventually talked to my co-worker about his wedding and he said he had assumed we would be going together. At that point it was too late for my SO to get the night off, and I felt uncomfortable bringing her because she had so many bad things to say about them being ‚Äútoo cheap‚Äù anyway. The day before, day of, and day after the wedding she made me feel really bad about going without her, constantly saying she would ‚Äúnever go to a wedding if I wasn‚Äôt invited.‚Äù Am I the asshole?",0.43
"AITA for complaining about my best friend to our mutual friends? Recently, I (21F) came home to the apartment my BFF and I share with two other friends and started talking about my day to her (we'll call her Jade) and the other roommate who was on the couch (Olivia). Olivia then asked me if I wanted to help her practice for a test she had coming up, and I agreed to help her. We went and did what she needed to practice, and then came back to the couch where Jade was. We kept talking and I quickly noticed that Jade was upset.

&#x200B;

I asked what was wrong. After a little encouragement, Jade told me that sometimes I absorb all of the oxygen in a room and don't leave any for anyone else. I tried to ask her if she said that because I was being too loud, or if it was because I had briefly taken over the conversation by talking about my day when I had gotten home. All she said is that she didn't want for that to be my take away from what she said which is why she didn't want to say it in the first place. I basically just let it go after that, but Olivia pulled me aside afterwards to let me know that she didn't think that about me and it was rude of Jade to say something hurtful like that to me.

&#x200B;

The next day I asked her what she had meant by what she said. She told me she didn't think it was hurtful, and that she thought it was a pretty normal and direct statement. She then said that she thought it was inconsiderate and rude of me to come home and assume that I could just make it all about me without considering what they might have been doing before I got there. I said ""oh, okay"", and then went back to my room. I came back out a few minutes later for something unrelated and we ended up continuing the conversation.

&#x200B;

She clarified that what was really bothering her was that before I had arrived, Olivia had asked her to help with the test practice. Then when I got home Olivia asked me to do it even though Jade had already agreed. She said that made her feel stepped on.

&#x200B;

I understand where she's coming from and I don't blame her for being a little upset by that . However, I feel like what she said to me was completely unwarranted considering that there was no way for me to know that Olivia had already asked her and it's quite the thing to say to someone in the first place.

&#x200B;

Here's where I might be the asshole. The next night after that I was out with a group of our mutual friends including the 4th roommate. I told the the 4th roommate and one of the others about what had happened and they said it was really rude and it was evident that it soured their opinions of her a little.

&#x200B;

This is also not the first time I've talked about her with them before. She and I are less compatible than she likes to believe, and it's led to multiple minor arguments between us.

"AITA for overreacting about food that I can‚Äôt eat? Am I the Asshole for overreacting about food that I can‚Äôt eat?

I(F16) got my wisdom teeth removed today. I‚Äôm home now and what drove me to make this post is what had happened a few minutes ago. (I will get to that.)

So, It was around 7AM, My mom (37) and brother (7) were at the dental office with me. We had arrived at 7:00, and the appointment was scheduled for 7:30. 

7:30 hits and she asks them why they aren‚Äôt starting my appointment. They reassure her and tell her that the dental surgeon and other staff are preparing. She doesn‚Äôt like this, she quoted, ‚ÄúYou guys should‚Äôve been preparing, I have to take my son to school at 8:15 and if I knew you were going to take all day I would‚Äôve stayed home and came later!‚Äù

I felt embarrassed.. ‚ÄúWe require all patients to be here a half hour before their appointment starts.‚Äù One of the receptionist attempted to reassure her. After a few more attempts to get me back there and going, my mom leaves, (It‚Äôs 8:00AM, and she leaves to get my brother to school). (We don‚Äôt live far away from the office at all.)

Well I‚Äôm there sitting still and they tell me that I can come to the back. They can‚Äôt start the procedure though.

Fast forward like 30 minutes later, my mom is finally back. 

(The surgeon explains for the whole time of the 30 minutes what I need to be prepared for, what to expect, what to eat, etc.) 

They let my mom know that they‚Äôre starting and she agrees with it. Finally, the Sedative is in my arm and what happened next.. I don‚Äôt know. 

I wake up in the car and am influenced by the drugs obviously. I get a smoothie and we go home. I take a nap, then I wake up, do some things.. fast forward to now, 9:00PM. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm about to go hang out with R. (F20 something??)  do some adult things. Call me if you need anything. By the way, I made turkey meat for nachos tomorrow.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt eat that.‚Äù I reply. There‚Äôs no gauge in my mouth but I still can‚Äôt open it all that wide.

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt eat it now but tomorrow you can.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Äôve explained to me that I can‚Äôt eat chewy things mom.‚Äù I‚Äôm clearly agitated. 

‚ÄúChewy things? That‚Äôs not chewy and if it is eat it with your front teeth.‚Äù 

She continues to talk but I ignore her. She leaves my room and I start crying. I feel like i‚Äôm developing an ED anyway because I stress eat.) 

She comes back a few minutes later asking me if I took my pain medicine and I told her not yet.. 

She‚Äôs sitting here arguing with me about my pain medicine and chewy food and what the definition means to her. At this point we are both passive-aggressive and I completely stop talking and ignore her. I do have better communication skills, just not with her. She‚Äôs so hard to talk to, so I give up. Anyway she 
says she‚Äôs leaving and I‚Äôm just really mad at this point. 

I do have Jello, and other things. But this is the only time she cooked this week, (when I can‚Äôt eat the food) and it‚Äôs the fact that she‚Äôs being inconsiderate about my teeth..

"AITA For saying I don't care about your feelings. I know the title sounds bad but hear me out. I don't have perfectly stable mental health but I'm getting there with therapy and support groups but recently many of my friends have been pulling me down. They have constantly come to me to talk about their problems and worries which I don't mind and I will listen to them and give advice if that's what they want or need but it has started to be very draining on me. I was talking to my friend about a date I had went on and she made a comment on how I'm always so lucky and people want to be friends with me and started saying very self deprecating things like: I'm ugly, I hate myself, I can't even look at myself and so on. And heres where I might have been the asshole, after a while of her saying all this stuff I said ""I'm tired of listening to you whine when you don't even try to get help. I'm not your therapist and I'm in no way a professional so stop coming to me for some stupid pity cause frankly I don't care about your feelings anymore."" She called me a dickhead and has been ignoring me when I've tried to contact her to talk things out. So, am I the asshole?

UPDATE: Practically in the first hour of getting feedback I realised that yes it's not fair of them for piling on me but it wasn't okay of me to snap at her. She responded and we started talking it through. In short I told her that I'm sorry for saying that I don't care about your feelings and explained that it was draining me emotionally and I shouldn't have snapped however in the end we didn't resolve this issue because after I said that I can't handle the constant negativity she said ""what do you have to be worried about you literally have no problems in your life."" Which made me upset because even when I try to talk to her or any of my friends they instantly switch it off to themselves. So, although I was an asshole for saying that to her I realised that I don't want her as my friend or the rest of the group.

"AITA for body shaming my mom after she body shamed me? I (13F) just got into a argument with my mom, for the past years she always had made strange comments about my body and appearance. Recently it got worse, it happens everyday.

She keeps saying I need more curves, I‚Äôm too skinny and saying that my chest got smaller. I literally have the normal amount of curves you have when you are a 13 year old. I don‚Äôt know if she expects her child to look like Kim kardashian. 
It‚Äôs always been a thing for her to compare my body to my cousins.

Before all this I use to love my body, my body was my favourite thing about myself. But now I‚Äôm literally body checking my self every time I see a mirror, like today I had to shut myself in my room cause I body checked myself 5 times in the pass hour cause there was a mirror downstairs. Now I‚Äôm ashamed of my body.
I keep finding myself comparing my body to literally everyone else‚Äôs, even people that are way older then me.

She also makes it a point to keep pointing out something about myself after she knows I don‚Äôt like that part about myself, for example: 
Me: I wish I was shorter.
Her for the next month: your so tall! Did you get taller! Are you sure your not 5‚Äô4 now? Your probably gonna be 5‚Äô8 by the time you‚Äôre done growing.

She keeps trying to tell me to eat more, which is fine but she‚Äôs acting like I have a eating disorder. Which I find offensive since she knows I eat a lot when I like something. 
I‚Äôm not even concernedly skinny I‚Äôm only like 4 pounds underweight. And when I do gain weight it all goes to below my waist.
And her comments about my weight are literally doing the opposite effect that she wants, I lose my appetite when I‚Äôm upset so that just made me lose even more weight.

Now to the arguement.
I called her out on her consistent body shaming over the years. And she kept just saying that she didn‚Äôt want me to get an eating disorder. (Which I find strange cause the way people usually get a eating disorder is through constant comparing). And she kept going on about how I was too skinny.
So here where I think ITA, I told her ‚Äúit‚Äôs not my fault not everyone is 50 pounds overweight.‚Äù My moms pretty overweight, and I know she‚Äôs insecure about it since she edits herself to the max in photos.
I know it upset her cause instead of yelling at me she just stayed quiet.

"AITA for not allowing my roommate to bring her boyfriend over? I (20F), my roommate (19F) and her boyfriend (21M) have kind of a feud going on. Let me explain because that sounds really bad.

I and my roommate share a very small apartment, which is basically a single room, where we live like sardines. We are very good friends and our co-living is a dream except for two arguments that, sadly, happened, but we figured things out. Otherwise, as I said living together is like a dream!

The point of conflict is that my roommate is head over heels for her boyfriend and is very emotional, so she is constantly wanting to bring her boyfriend over the weekend while I am not here. Seems petty of me right? I have never met the boyfriend, he is a complete stranger to me and from what I heard he is a living walking GIGANTIC red flag to me, but that's a story for another time, otherwise, I do not butt into their relationship. We do understand the point of view from both sides. As I said before, I don't know him at all and I am extremely uncomfortable about him being here because I feel like it's an invasion of MY privacy, because we live in such a small apartment. He kinda hates me because I don't want to allow him to be here and he thinks I butt into the relationship too much. I do occasionally listen to my roommate vent about their relationship but I am not butting into it, I have no say in it, it's not my relationship and I couldn't care less. 

I do understand their point of view because they are very much in love and want to see each other more. I think I should mention that he lives in another city so they cannot visit each other as much. They are both very insecure in their relationship and they both overthink beyond beliefs, so they have a hard time communicating through text and calls only so the one-on-one conversation would be a huge help to them. 

That said I do not prohibit them from meeting each other at all. In fact, they have been on multiple dates and they will be actually going on a date this week. I am just very uncomfortable with him going over to our apartment.

But we still have a feud about this. Since I am keeping my ground that I don't want to allow him to set foot into our flat for another two months or until I get to talk to him. But still, I feel like I am being guilt-tripped by them a little bit into being the villain here. I just have my standards as everyone does. My roommate does understand my point of view very well, as I do understand hers, but they are very frustrated over this. I wrote this with my roommate because we are at our wit's ends here. 

So, Reddit, AITA?


EDIT 1: Most of you are asking for the red flegs, so I am making an update to tell you. They argue a lot over the smallest stuff, lot of time he seems to get angry over the smallest things resulting not talking to each other for a few days, example, she was hugged by ger classmate and he blew up over it, because he is toxic jealous and insecure. He gets very pissy when she doesn't response or text to him. He is also very angry she doesn't share her feeling with him, but most of the time he is alike a bomb most of the time, she have no idea how will he response, so when she actually does share her feelings, he blows up, gets angry, totally unreasonable and doesn't talk to her, keeps arguing with her, which is making her depressed, which is making ke very sad because I dont want to see my best friend sad over a prick. There have been cases where he was inconsiderate to her and tried to guilt-trip her.

EDIT 2: I feel like I left out a lot of stuff, as I replied to comments. So, for those who wants to argue ""Then meet him"", it's not that simple, both I and my roommate are on board so I can meet him and give them the approval for the visit, but we are scared how he will react to that.
For those who question if they can't meet anywhere else or if she can't visit him - she is unable to go and visit him at his place, but they I very free to meet up anywhere else, I do not restric them from meeting at all otherwise.
Those who might be asking why am I so uncomfortable to have him over is because our flat is LITERALLY one room, with no separation walls. If we had a regular two rooms flat where we would sleep separately and kept our stuff devided I wouldn't give a flying shit if he's over, quite literally. It's seriously just question of the space.
Another thing is, I and my roommate have talked about it many times and WE DO UNDERSTAND OUR POINT OF VIEW VERY WELL! She knows where I am coming from as do I.



UPDATE: Hello everyone, for those of you that are still invested in this I bare updates. So... Buckle up, it's A LOT.
First of all, I previously said I'd like to meet him if I was to let him into our studio apartment, but that's out of question now and for ever, he fucked up, big time.
He was being mentally absusive towards my roommate and she finally snapped, bringing up a break-up into question, she was giving him a cold shoulder for a few days, until she called him and basically let him drown in all the shit he has done, it seems that she was very much satisfied with that, well neither me, her male best friend and her mother were.
We all repeatedly told her to be careful around him and be cautious of him, she promised us, she would be cold towards him and she wants to see effort from his side, she also said that if he messes up, she's leaving him. All of us are still baffled that she is even considering a second chance, while he doesn't deserve even a bare minimum, because he was being seriously aweful to her, she has been crying because of him for days and I WAS THERE to comfort her, not him.
I though maybe some kind of sense is coming back to her but I was dead wrong, just two days passed by from her confronting him and she took him back.
And guess what? He fucked up, royaly, again. He forced her to actually severe all ties with her male best friend and guess who was next in line? Those of you who guess me, yes, you are correct, I was the next.
He actually tried to get me out of the picture as well. I can tell you that when I say I was furious, it's an understatement, I saw red and I was seriously considering a murder. I am usually a very mild person and it's hard to get any emotional reaction out of me. And I don't even want to mention how pissed her friend was. She on the other hand, still doesn't see it as a problem that pretentious shitbag tried to ruin another of her friendships. 
Yesterday, I tried to talk about it with her, but she refused, she decided to ignore the whole problem. I'd like to mention that when she cut off her friend, she was a crying mess, but to be completely honest, I couldn't comfort her and straight up told her that's it's her own doing and that she is responsible for that.
I'd love to post a conversation of what that guy wrote to me but since it's in different language and I get angry everytime I see it, I'm not entirely sure, I could translate it well enough for you guys.
So now, understandingly, I do not want to even meet him and I refuse to let him into our apartment. She also agreed that he won't be visiting, but I don't trust her word for that anymore, she was soft on him and she will back down again, so I have to be the voice of reason now. I told her, that if she wants to get her life ruined because of him, I won't care and I certainly won't be there for her to have a shoulder to cry on. Was it cruel of me? Yes, absolutely and I am asshole for that, but she doesn't listen and it seems she cannot be helped, so as long as this topic doesn't concerns our flat I shall not longer care.",0.33
WIBTA for standing my grandmother up when she asked me to help watch my younger brother? [deleted],0.48
"AITAH for not wanting to spend time at my friends due to her child? Me and my best friend have always been close but she‚Äôs upset as I refused her invitation to spend the night at her house due to her son.

I work in a nursery and last week we had a few staff off poorly with COVID. This meant that the staff left had to pick up extra hours so that we could continue to open safely with the correct staff:child ratio. I work in the 3 year old room with some children who have challenging behaviour. Due to picking up extra hours I did a 52 hr week Monday-Friday. 

Well on Friday my friend asked me to spend the evening at hers, her son is 4 and also has challenging behaviour due to additional needs. I politely declined and said that I was exhausted and very stressed after the week at work and just wanted some alone time before returning on Monday. My friend then said that I could relax and hers and we could have a girly night. I again said that I just wanted to have a quiet night in, to which again my friend insisted that I‚Äôd feel better chilling out at her house. That is when I said this. 

‚ÄúYou know I love spending time with you as we are sisters at heart but I have just done a 52hr shift at the nursery and I really don‚Äôt want to be around children at the moment as I really need a break.‚Äù

My friend then said I was being disrespectful at not wanting to go around just because she has a child.


I never mentioned her son‚Äôs behaviour or disability as I thought this would have been upsetting and was irrelevant but I‚Äôve had to deal with a lot of challenging behaviour this week in a classroom of 15 3 year old children and I honestly thought if I‚Äôd gone round that the stress would have gotten to me.

I love my friend and her little boy so much but I didn‚Äôt feel like I could have been able to continue to control my emotions and would have become upset, if her son had an outburst while I was there. This would only upset my friend and not help the behaviour situation.

Am I the asshole?",0.04
"AITA for laughing at an obese dog? For context, I‚Äôm 38+5 weeks pregnant. My husband and I have been together for almost 5 years and married for a little under  a year. We‚Äôre really good at communicating our emotions and de escalating situations, so this one just seems really odd.

My husband and I were driving home from getting dessert and somewhere along the road we saw a pretty chunky German shepherd/husky mix taking a walk with their companion. We both saw them at the same time and I let out a laugh. For some reason it kept getting funnier and I could NOT stop laughing. I tried to contain myself, but my mind kept picturing the dog and I couldn‚Äôt. My husband kept making comments like ‚Äúthat‚Äôs messed up,‚Äù and ‚Äúhe can‚Äôt help it.‚Äù I felt bad for laughing because after all, it‚Äôs really not the dog‚Äôs fault they‚Äôre extra chunky. I commended the fact that they were going on walks, but to me it was still funny/cute. My husband seemed to get annoyed and kept saying I was bullying the dog. I thought he was joking with me the whole time, but eventually he just snapped. He said he didn‚Äôt like people that made fun of other people‚Äôs weight and asked if I would make fun of an overweight person. I told him of course I wouldn‚Äôt (I‚Äôve struggled with weight and would never do that), but it was just a dog we happened to see. I told him seeing the dog just caught me off guard and it had truly made my day (I had an OB appointment earlier that day that didn‚Äôt go that well- I had vented to him already).

The whole hysterically laughing thing has happened to me twice already throughout this pregnancy, where for some reason the tiniest joke sets me off and I have tears spewing from my eyes. The way he reacted just really made me feel like a huge asshole and that I shouldn‚Äôt have laughed that hard or even in the first place. Which made me feel terrible and I started crying. My husband has been struggling with his weight/body image. He‚Äôs not near being overweight and is actually very strong/fit in my eyes, regardless I still really try to be there to support and motivate him. I genuinely don‚Äôt think I did anything harmful, but no matter what I say he still thinks how I acted was unjustifiable and I shouldn‚Äôt be hurt by the way he responded.

TLDR: I uncontrollably laughed at a fat dog on the street and my husband got pissed. AITA?",0.07
"WIBTA if I captured and gave away the ""stray"" cats my neighbor either owns, or is caring for? I moved into my current home in April, and right away I noticed a skinny little orange tabby cat. I didn't know if he had an owner or was a stray, so I tried sweet talking him a little. He was alarmed by me & always avoided people. 

Later, I saw the neighbor across the street calling with a bowl of kitty food in her hand. The little orange tabby came running up below her (the neighbor was on a 2nd floor balcony). I thought that she must own him and let him out. TBH I disapproved of this because A) Outdoor kitties in general, and B) I often saw him hiding in the sewer openings, under bushes, and I was worried about him. He still seemed to be a kitten, maybe 6mo to 1yr. 

Later I saw her feeding him by placing a bowl on her balcony railing, going inside, and watching him through the screen on the front door (FD & balcony are right next to each other). He wouldn't approach the food until she went inside. So I decided he was a stray after all, & started thinking about giving him food and trying to catch him.

Today I found out there are TWO orange kitties, which was a shock. I thought he was just really good at getting around the neighborhood. They were camped outside the neighbor's front door, and she had set up a bowl and a cardboard box (no lid, but under an awning) with a heating pad (I assume, since there was a cord running to it). Her screen door was closed, but the front door was open.

My mom thinks this means she owns the kitties. I'm still unsure. I've a bowl & some food, and I was planning on feeding them and setting up a covered shelter for the winter. I've always had a way with cats, compared to other animals, and one has already accepted treats from me (tossed from a distance), so I think I could earn their trust with some work. But I've always intended to capture them & give them to a shelter. I've too many pets already to keep them. But this lady either owns them or has been working on gaining their trust. I'm sure she's attached to them & loves them. I'm also worried that I'll disrupt whatever plans she has for them. On the other hand, they clearly trust her, but she hasn't brought them inside. I would be interested in joining forces to catch them, but I'm scared that if I approach her, she isn't interested, and then they later disappear, she would be upset/aggressive with me. WIBTA if I gave them away if I managed to catch them?

Note: She has a black & white cat that she doesn't let wander. He has a lil covered box on her balcony he gets to wander in, and that's all. Also, I do have pics of them & her set up, but I'm worried they could be used to dox her, so I'm hesitant to share them.",0.36
"AITA for not inviting my cousin to a cousin gathering? (Sorry this is longer then I thought.)

Last year for my 28th birthday I invited my ‚Äúbest friend‚Äù (F) (let‚Äôs call her Ashley) and cousins to my house for my birthday. My cousin (M) (let‚Äôs call him Josh) is married with kids and Ashley knew that. Josh didn‚Äôt bring his wife or kids. By the end of the night, I saw that Josh and Ashley were leaving together and flirting with each other. I told her that if she leaves with Josh, not to talk to me again because she knows he‚Äôs a married man and I am associating myself with people like that. And I told Josh the same thing. They both clearly didn‚Äôt care how I felt because they left together. 

3 weeks later Josh decides to text me and apologize for what happened on my birthday. I told him how I felt about the whole situation but I forgive him. He told me that he no longer talks to her because he knows that it made me really upset and put me in a awkward situation. I told him that I really appreciate that and I didn‚Äôt want any problems with his wife, since Ashley was my ‚Äúfriend‚Äù. Btw I never talked to her since. 

Long story short, I found out that Josh had been lying to me, they were still dating and seeing each other. His wife ended up finding out because Ashley started telling other people that she was messing with a married man. Ashley‚Äôs friend found one of his wife‚Äôs social media page and told her everything. And also told her that she longer talks to her either because of that. 

His wife called me and asked me. Of course I wasn‚Äôt going to lie to her and told her everything was true. She comforted Josh and he told her that I and that girl were making everything up. He told her that we are liars, cheaters, druggies (not true btw) and that she should trust us. I told her, that I had already said everything to her and that it‚Äôs up to her if she wants to believe me or not. They ended up separating. 

Now I am having a cousin baseball like every year and having a cookout at my house. But I don‚Äôt want to invite Josh. I haven‚Äôt talked to him since and some of my cousins think that I should get over it because it happened a year ago. But I still feel so betrayed by him. AITA?",0.04
"AITA for expecting my family to help with our cat? This is my first post on Reddit and I'm fairly new so bear with me. I (21F) have a cat, who is 9 years old. I've had this cat since she was a kitten, meaning I was 12 when we got her, and she is one of my biggest ""rocks"". Everyone who knows me knows how fond of her I am, and how much she means to me. Even though I was a child when we got her and she's essentially the family cat, everyone refers to her as my cat because of how close we are.

Recently the cat has been diagnosed with a disease that affects her bowels, and she shits like crazy. I do my best to keep up after her, I buy all of her medication, special diet food and clean up after her constantly. Her litterbox has to be cleaned everyday, but often more than once. However, I can't always watch her, as I am in school taking 22 credits, doing clinical observations and working part-time. There are days where I leave the house early in the morning and stay out working/studying for the entirety of the day. This means that often, I ask my family to watch her and every now and then, ask them to clean the litter box. This is something that my family HATES doing.

Today, as I'm driving, I can feel my phone going off like crazy. I pull over to see what the big emergency is and I have over 30 unread messages from my mother (42 F) that the cat has shit on her bed. She was absolutely livid and said that she 1) might give her up for good and 2) has put her out of the house, in the POURING RAIN (it's been storming really bad the last few days) and she's staying out there. Keep in mind I just had the longest day, I'm running errands, but I immediately cancel all my plans to race home. She did indeed put the cat out and she was soaking wet, running over to my car as soon as I parked. I was pissed, but not as pissed as she was when she saw that I had brought the cat back in.

She starts ranting and yelling about how she has to deal with the cat's shit and illness all the time and how I can't properly take care of her. I let her know I have asked one of my siblings to do it today because I knew I wouldn't be home, and why she isn't mad at them considering if it were clean she wouldn't shit on beds. Basically, my mom reiterated that the whole family considers it my responsibility and won't help if I'm not home because it's none of their business, they all consider her MY cat even though it technically is the family cat. I had to apologize to her for not keeping up, despite the fact they all know how busy I am this semester. I know I've already set the standard that I look after the cat, but am I really the AH for expecting them to help with the FAMILY cat?

EDIT: I want to add that this isn't a forever-situation, only TEMPORARY until my semester ends (only another month and a half), next semester I'll be in my before-graduation internship and not dealing w studies/parttime job. I'm not asking them to clean her litterbox everyday, this is maybe twice a week, I still have full responsibility most of the time. Just to clear that up.

ANOTHER EDIT: Although I'm the only one taking care of her, my siblings do love the cat. It's just that all of them rlly dislike taking care of her.",0.16
"AITA for making my babydaddy text/video message only? For context, my child's father and I had a casual relationship before I got pregnant. We were both pretty excited about the baby though, so we decided to take things more seriously in hopes of starting a family [super dumb, I realize this now]

During my pregnancy he did not contribute at all- didn't help get anything ready, didnt contribute financially, couldn't even be bothered to come up with baby names. Overall pretty useless- however, during the last month of my pregnancy he had started really whining about how my roommate [also female] had been helping me a lot with the pregnancy, and went so far as to be angry with her and accuse her of ""upstaging him""

While I was in labor I could not get in contact with him, found out the next morning he was at a bar with his friends and an ex girlfriend [which was surprising, because he'd not been to a bar once during my pregnancy] but after that he had really ramped up complaining about my roommate helping me with baby stuff, even tho he had ignored all my texts and calls when I went into labor.

A month later, our child is a month old, and I find out from the ex girlfriend that he had proposed to her the same night I was in labor [while they were at the bar together] and married 3 weeks and a few days after my child was born- so he was still with me, but married her in secret at her family's property. All his friends and the ex knew about this, and he told all of them that we had broken up [or so they claim]

Now my child is almost a year old and he wants to talk about our child, but I have no interest in speaking to him unless I can document it- he planned an entire marriage behind my back, there were several instances where I was suspicious of him and he would gaslight me unless I had texts or video messages to disprove whatever he was saying.

So, am I the Asshole for distrusting him and setting the boundary that I will only talk to him about our child via text or video message?

NOTE: 

He has contributed nothing to this kid, NOTHING-

NOWHERE in this post have I said I won't let him see my child, only that I plan to document any communication.

His wife/ex girlfriend divorced him, but she also has two kids of her own that he claimed to really care about, but neither are his kids.

I plan to set up visitation and such, not for the Father, but because my kid DESERVES AND IS ENTITLED to have a father.",0.06
"AITA for assuming I'd inherit my mothers house? My (f20s) mother raised me and my sister (20s) as a single parent in a single income household. We've rented our whole lives and grew up low middle class. We never went without food or other essentials, but didn't have the luxuries of many wants. I started investing when I was 17 through my mother, and have been somewhat successful through it. I have accumulated enough money to afford a downpayment on a house in our neighbourhood/city. I have decided to pursue a second degree at college to further my career/job opportunities, and currently have a part-time job, which is not enough to support a mortgage. I currently rent with a roommate. Me and my mother have an extremely good relationship and I used to joke growing up that when I'm older and have money, I'd buy a house and let her live with me so she doesn't have to worry about her living situation/a mortgage/paying rent when she's older.

&#x200B;

I told my mother about my plan to buy a house and pitched the idea that I'd give her the money as a downpayment, and she'd pay the mortgage.  (She has a very stable job now and can afford to keep up on a mortgage, the down deposit was the issue as she didn't have enough saved to afford our city). She didn't want to feel burdened to me but I really want to do this for her. I would move in and contribute some money in 'rent' for utilities/mortgage. It's a beneficial situation for both of us. Eventually, In 20+ years when my mum retires or whenever she wants to retire, I should have a stable career and be able to take over the remainder of her mortgage IF she still had one.

&#x200B;

We were all agreed on this and both extremely excited about starting the process. I was fine with the house being in my mothers name but this is where the conflict came up. When I agreed for it to be in my mothers name, it was because I'd still be able to live there, would inherit it in the future, and it would eventually be in my name anyway. My mother disagreed, and said she would leave it to both me and my sister 50/50. I didn't understand as my sister was not contributing financially to this house, while I was. I told my mother that I would not give her the money for a down deposit if I didn't solely inherit it in the future. She called me selfish for making her 'leave my sister with nothing' but I disagree. My sister has never had much focus or priority on her future or career, and is quite materialistic. She hardly saves and has a boyfriend who she'll 98% marry eventually and have children with. I personally want to be childfree and knowing my sister, she'll believe she is more 'deserving' as she'll have a family. Also, if she knew about my mother and I were buying a house but still inheriting it in the future, there is 0 chance she'd save for her own place. She'd wait till our mother passed and assume she'd be able to move it.

&#x200B;

AITA for demanding/assuming I'd inherit my mothers house?

Edit: Sorry for not clarifying, I'd be paying the deposit + at least 40% of the mortgage over time. My bank denied my application for a loan.",0.18
"AITA for not answering my Gf‚Äôs phone calls? First ever post so I‚Äôm sorry if it‚Äôs not good. 
I (21m) have been at work all day and my gf (20f) got home around 5. She called me when she got home and we planned to meet at our new house to finish painting so we could try to move in this weekend. The plan was for me to let her know when I was leaving work and she would meet me. I also asked her to bring me a few things when she left including a bowl of weed. 
Fast forward to now (around 7:30) she has called and texted me multiple times. I just got off work and was able to check my phone. She was beyond mad that I didn‚Äôt see that she had already gotten to the new house and has been waiting for around an hour. 
I did see her calls, and even declined them from my laptop. The only reason I did that is because I was going through training to take on even more responsibility at my job. The person training me was my boss, who is the owner/executive of his own company. 
Now, I‚Äôm not sure about y‚Äôall, but when someone who‚Äôs time is worth literally 1000x mine is teaching me something‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm definitely all ears. Not to mention it‚Äôs my job‚Ä¶ She knows this. She knows I can‚Äôt always access my phone. She assumed that since we talked around 5 that I‚Äôd be there when she got there but obviously that wasn‚Äôt the case. 
Now she blew up on me bc of how long she sat there and the fact she had weed on her (not legal here) in the car. She is no stranger to carrying weed and was just using that as an argument. She said I should‚Äôve picked up so she could‚Äôve known to keep waiting or leave. I reminded her that I never gave her the go ahead to meet me and told her to just go home because I haven‚Äôt eaten today and just wanna get rest so we can tackle it first thing in the morning.

"AITA for not being allowed to drink water at my boyfriends house? Just for some background info, I come to my boyfriends house over the weekend. We are both still in college so we live with our parents. 
His mom buys six packs of bottled water, and they don‚Äôt have any other drinking water except the bottled ones.
When I go to his house, we consume more of the bottled water than he would drink on his own, obviously. His mom sometimes gets mad at him for drinking so much water, because 3 of the bottles of the six pack are hers and the other 3 are respectively his.
My issue here is that I am not sure if I should bring my own water from home, that seems wrong and weird overall. What gets me really frustrated is that he tells me to ‚Äúnot drink so much water‚Äù and things along those lines very often.

"AITA for living in an apartment building with my baby??? I honestly want opinions.  So about a year ago me, fiance, and baby moved into a new apartment building and never had problems with the tenants that were here when I had arrived.  My neighbors had ended up leaving a few months down the road and six months of me being here I get new neighbors. These new neighbors have been nothing but problems. Constantly having people in and out of their place at all hours of the night, them being loud at all hours of the night cause they have the grandkids over. Not to mention tho that these same neighbors also smeared dog shit on my front door and constantly fucked with my lightbulb on my front porch. They have had guest over that have threated  to attack us while I had my child in my arms.  Recently out of absolutely out of nowhere  they came over pounded on our door and started yelling and screaming about our music being to loud at all hours of the night. My fiance and I just kind of looked at him dumbfounded cause we haven't played music super loud to begin with and we had not been listening to music for over a week now.  He says if the music doesn't stop hes kicking our door in and beating our asses. We later come to figure out that the sound that is upsetting our neighbors is actually my baby rocking in her pack n play.  As my baby rocks the pack n play comes off the floor a bit and slams back down. The dumb neighbors think its freaking bass.  I'll admit it is loud but I have tried everything  to find a solution for it. When I tell my neighbors its my daughter rocking they tell me that i need to fix it and storm off. Since all this they have also started calling me a horrible mother and that I don't take care of my kid, that I'm an alcoholic, that my fiance beats me outside on the porch.

"AITA - for requesting that my roommate put her cat in her bedroom‚Ä¶ Post move update - to anyone who‚Äôs following this or keeps in touch with it. We‚Äôve since moved. Since moving my puppy has ‚Äî shocker ‚Äî free reign of my new apartment. No accidents & no chewing so maybe I just got lucky with my pup ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è she‚Äôs doing great & loves having more space to roam and play. Living confined in the old place was horrid. She and the cat initially were not friends like we had anticipated but by the time I left they were good buds. Thanks for all the advice but I still feel strongly that I was not the AH in this situation. It‚Äôs one thing to not be flexible it‚Äôs another to *not even compromise* which is what was happening with me & my old roommate.

*Update - thanks everyone for your input but this was resolved. Puppy still can‚Äôt walk freely but there are baby gates everywhere. Her cat doesn‚Äôt try to climb over them but has squeezed through on occasion. Cat still dominates the rest of the apt but ‚Äúthat‚Äôs how cats are‚Äù so as far as I‚Äôm understanding there is no real way to control the cat. I just take the dog out frequently so she isn‚Äôt trapped in the office with me.*

Thanks everyone for suggestions - we‚Äôre gonna get a very tall gate & roommate has compromised to put the cat in her room when she isn‚Äôt working from home.

My roommate got a cat - some of you may have seen that post already.

Well I‚Äôm getting a puppy soon. Not in retaliation but because this was planned a while ago and it‚Äôs just now all coming to fruition.

My roommate has (thus far) allowed her cat to roam. Which is fine because I‚Äôve kept to myself in my office. However with my puppy I would like for her to be able to walk around. I was considering putting up a baby gate at the end of the hallway where I work so she can roam in an out of my office, bedroom, and the hallway. My roommate *rudely* told me that ‚Äúnothing will keep a cat out so that‚Äôs pointless‚Äù. Not to mention she‚Äôs shown no motivation to even try to keep the cat out of my space; despite the fact that I am *allergic* to her cat and have put up with her being here. 

I‚Äôve kept to myself in my little corner but don‚Äôt really want to subject my puppy to that. It‚Äôs enough that she (my roommate) took over the communal spaces and made me feel like I couldn‚Äôt go out in them. It‚Äôs another to completely isolate me &amp; a puppy to a bedroom when her cat roams free.

AITA for requesting that if the puppy is roaming; for the cat to be put in the bedroom for fear of her cat (that I‚Äôm allergic to) darting into my personal spaces? To add - we will not be living together in a few weeks as our lease is ending and we decided not to renew it for aforementioned cat allergies. So really - she only has to put up with this for 3 weeks. When I‚Äôve put up with the cat since this summer.

Edited to add: 

My roommate and I have known each other since we were kids. She‚Äôs known about my allergies but has told me since I don‚Äôt need an epipen - that it‚Äôs not serious enough not to warrant her not getting a cat.

Thank you internet warriors who don‚Äôt seem to understand that the cat has the run of an almost 2000 sq fr apartment and I‚Äôm stuck in my office because my roommate hasn‚Äôt kept her cat out of my space the way she *said* she would.

Yes I know I got a puppy from a breeder but that‚Äôs not the point here. The point is that I a human am already locked up in my office for most of the day and do not want to subject my dog to do the same because that‚Äôs not fair. 

I want to be able to walk her around the apartment but can‚Äôt because the cat is ALL over our space and she can‚Äôt go into my office. My roommate told me that a *gate will not keep out a cat* however, this was not what I was told prior to her getting a cat.I‚Äôve never owned a cat so I thought she could teach her to stay out of places the way you can teach a dog. Our apartment is like a W and I wanted to block off my long end of the ‚ÄúW‚Äù with a baby gate. It seems that the gate *will not* keep the cat from my space. Only keep the dog near me which is fine - but I wanted to be able to leave my office door open &amp; have the dog walk in her own 50 sq ft culdesac between the bathroom &amp; my office.

My AH question comes from now that this is the norm between my friend and I - is it rude to ask for this time each day &amp; will she hate me for getting a dog because of it?",0.5
"AITA for telling my coworker to dress up as the wicked witch for halloween 
I (22F) have worked in an office for about a year now. ‚ÄúAngela‚Äù (mid-30s F) is part of a friend group I quickly became close with. I began to notice early on that Angela was a very negative person and always had something to complain about. During lunch when anyone would bring up something fun they were doing or honestly just anything, she always has something negative to say. This usually tends to be unasked for opinions such as ‚ÄúI would never do that‚Äù ‚Äúthat does not sound fun.‚Äù It seems small, but when she does it for every thing that is brought up, it gets old and frustrating quick. 

Yesterday at lunch, we got into a conversation about Halloween and trick-or-treating. She had already expressed her disdain for older kids (high schoolers) going out on Halloween to get candy. She was talking about how her mom passes out candy at her house so she and her husband can take her two kids out. Angela said she would never be able to pass out candy because she would get annoyed if a kid said a ‚Äúsmart ass comment‚Äù about what she was handing out or talked poorly about her football team decorations and she would not give them candy. I told her they would just be having fun and to lighten up. 

Angela then said that it bothers her when kids don‚Äôt say ‚Äútrick or treat‚Äù or ‚Äúthank you‚Äù when they go up to the houses and it‚Äôs rude. I mentioned that some kids can‚Äôt due to being anxious, shy, or non verbal and she said ‚Äúthey need to learn somehow.‚Äù She went on to say it was shitty for one parent to stay home to pass out candy and not go with their kids. I said that one parent homes can‚Äôt do that and either way they‚Äôll usually leave the bowl out with the take one sign. She said that those are dumb because after two kids come, they take all the candy and there‚Äôs none left for everyone else. 

This is where I may be the asshole. After this went on for a while, I ‚Äújokingly‚Äù said that she should dress up as the wicked witch for Halloween since she doesn‚Äôt like to let kids have fun. She didn‚Äôt really say anything afterwards and her lunch ended shortly after. Later on when I had mentioned what happened to others in the friend group who weren‚Äôt there, they were extremely surprised I had said that. I was thinking that I should apologize for saying this, but honestly she does this all the time and I don‚Äôt think anyone has ever said anything to her. People tend to ignore or change the subject. 

So AITA for calling her a witch and should I apologize?

"AITA for not wanting to write a birthday card? Both my parents grew up in Spanish speaking countries and still know how to write Spanish neatly. Since they weren't confident in their English writing I was in charge in writing out anything in English for them. Wether it be paperwork or text messages I always had to write everything without complaining.

So when it came my Spanish speaking cousin's birthday and my parents told me to write a message in English I was confused. I told them that they should write it and write it in Spanish since she is more comfortable speaking/ writing/ and reading Spanish (She's been in America for a couple years but whenever she visits she and her family always talk Spanish never English.) My parents didn't want that and just want me to write something in English but I repeated myself and said ""That doesn't make sense. If English was the language she was comfortable with I would write it but she reads better in Spanish since she grew up with that language.

"AITA for not wanting to be around my husband‚Äôs friends anymore? I (21F) am always asked to join my husband (24M) at these monthly bbq‚Äôs with his friends. For context my husband is in the Army so naturally that comes with military spouses‚Ä¶ I get along great with my husband‚Äôs friends but not so much with the wives. All his friends have kids except for us and all the wives are SAHMs. I work a full time 9-5 job M-F so it‚Äôs rare that I go to every bbq due to the fact that they‚Äôre usually on Friday‚Äôs. But I will make an effort to go just bc I know my husband wants me there. I don‚Äôt really connect with the wives as I feel we are just in a different point in our lives. Kids just haven‚Äôt been in the cards for us rn. Aside from that, the wives like to gossip and eat up any drama they can get their hands on and I‚Äôm not interested in that. Because of this the wives tend to not like talking to me very much but I don‚Äôt mind. Every event is always ‚Äúhey buddy‚Äù from the wives to my husband and usually a smile or head nod in my direction. However, recently we went to a BBQ and the wives were all outside sitting by the entrance. We approach the door and the wife of the host goes ‚ÄúHEY BUDDY‚Äù and doesn‚Äôt begin to look in my direction. I figured maybe she didn‚Äôt see me. In an attempt to acknowledge their presence i say ‚Äúhi guys‚Äù. No reaction. Not one look in my direction. Dead silent. I figured maybe they didn‚Äôt hear me so I speak again and again nothing. Obviously I‚Äôm bothered and upset bc I feel it‚Äôs super rude. But I keep my composure and go inside. Throughout the day the wives go out their way to speak to my husband and not to me.After the event I expressed to my husband how it made me feel that he would converse with the females who don‚Äôt have the decency to speak to me. I asked him if he was going to stick up for me and defend me but he made it clear it‚Äôs not his issue.

AITA for hating my BIL‚Äôs wife because she told me that I‚Äôm too immature? [deleted],0.56
"AITA because I accused my friend of emotionally blackmailing me? I‚Äôve (M23) been friends with this guy K (M27) for two years now. We are roommates and are generally quite close and know a lot about each other. I was told by a mutual friend that K‚Äôs sister had died tragically several years before we had met. I never brought it up to K and although he talked about his sister several times, he never said that she had passed on.

Last weekend we were both invited to a party. I was not keen on going but K wanted me to go. He had recently got out of a relationship, and I knew he had been messaging a girl at the house where the party was being held. I knew that the situation would most likely end in him staying the night with her, which would mean I would have to as well. The party was quite a distance away from our flat, and my phone had broken several days beforehand, so K knew I was relying on him to call a taxi for us to go home. We arrived at the party and as I suspected would happen, K and the girl went off to her room and he didn‚Äôt come back the entire night. I even made sure before he left with her that he knew I was relying on him. He left telling me he would only be an hour. He didn‚Äôt come back. I ended up having to sleep in a bed with someone I wasn‚Äôt entirely comfortable with (although this person is my friend). K left the following morning for work. 

I eventually got a lift home the following morning by another partygoer. That night K came to my room to talk about the party, and I basically called him out for his selfish behaviour. I think he was a bit shocked by my reaction as this was the first time I‚Äôd ever been truly angry with him and he left. The following night K came to my room, and laid down on my bed, telling me he‚Äôd been crying over his sister as it was near the anniversary. I pretended I knew nothing about it and he then proceeded to tell me the story about her death. While I listened and was sympathetic, I couldn‚Äôt help but feel I was only being told the story now as he knew I was angry with him, and he was trying to emotionally blackmail me into forgiving him.  I accused him of this. He got angry and left and I haven‚Äôt seen him since. 

Am I the asshole for accusing him?",0.21
"AITA for being upset that lunch plans changed last minute and making others, who invited themselves, feel embarrassed about their inability to pay?

I am autistic and as such everything is planned down to the detail for me‚Ä¶ budgeting, timing and so on. I also am a very picky eater and therefore am particular about what I eat and where. And while I recognize that I live in a world not built for me and therefore I must adapt the best I can, I do not adapt WELL to extremely last minute changes in plans. It throws me off. 

I invited one other person last night and slowly, one by one, other people began inviting themselves to these plans, which they heard about in passing and ended up being 8 people total. This left two people who were sleeping over the same house with me after a Halloween party feeling excluded because they couldn‚Äôt afford the restaurant. 

I was asked if I minded changing the plan to be inclusive and even though I didn‚Äôt want to change the plan, I said yes out of feeling sympathetic and said ‚ÄúI am feeling sympathetic today‚Ä¶ sure why not. Just not TGI Fridays or Applebee‚Äôs.‚Äù

I was told this reply was rude and embarrassed people who couldn‚Äôt pay. In my view I sacrificed my plans at my inconvenience and others were rude to invite themselves.

"AITA for roughhousing with kids who were ok with it? Am I the asshole for roughhousing with kids who were ok with it? Today I was at a Halloween party that my aunt and uncle were hosting. They‚Äôre the family who always goes all out and are a ton of fun, so of course they rented a bouncy house. At first, we were jumping around and just enjoying the time. More and more kids began showing up and we began a little game. I would sit at the top of the slide and push people down chanting ‚ÄúSacrifice! Sacrifice!‚Äù Everyone was laughed and had smiles on their faces. Eventually it evolved into policing the slide area and not letting the kids climb back up. (As in up the slide, not the rest of the bouncy house.) One kid was really good at it and kept climbing past me. He asked to be a police guy as well and I made everyone there a compromise. ‚ÄúIf you can pull me down the slide, you can be a part of the police.‚Äù (I do Jiu Jitsu, and although I‚Äôm 14 I still go to the adult class. So naturally I was a lot stronger than everyone, and I knew how to avoid sliding) The majority were going at it, and the kids who weren‚Äôt were left out. Enter, Entitled mom and Entitled kid. It was a family of them who were all dressed as skeletons. Entitled kid had a friend who was already there and also having fun, but he got him on his side to get mad at me as well. They came up and told me to stop throwing people down the slide, and I explained that I was simply sending people down the slide who were climbing on me. They got mad anyway, and left. About 5 minutes later I hear someone yell my name. I get down from the slide, and walk over to the lady who called for me. I reach her and before I can say anything, she goes off. ‚ÄúYou should not be throwing kids off the slide! You could hurt them, and I‚Äôve heard from multiple kids that you have been intentionally hurting them!‚Äù I‚Äôm baffled and I say ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been pulling kids off of me who have been climbing and trying to knock me-‚Äú before I can finish my sentance, she cuts me off. ‚ÄúYou just need to stop! You shouldn‚Äôt be trying to hurt kids! You‚Äôre old enough to know that‚Äôs wrong!‚Äù My mom is telling me it‚Äôs time to go, so I tell the lady, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm leaving now anyway, so don‚Äôt worry about it.‚Äù She nods and with a smirk walks away. I go the the car baffled at the situation that just occurred. My mom gets in the car and is livid. She tells me, ‚ÄúSo the lady that got made at you for pushing people down the the slide.‚Äù (She heard the whole thing) ‚ÄúWas bragging to her friends about how she got mad at a 14 year old for attacking little kids.‚Äù I expect a call from my aunt, but for now I‚Äôm safe. So, am I the asshole?

Edit: The youngest kids (who were toddlers I think) stayed out of it completely. They just went to the other side (of the slide) and had fun like that. The biggest kids were 9-10 and the majority were playing but the ones that weren‚Äôt did the same as the toddlers. Stayed on the other side and out of the way.",0.8
"AITA for telling my roommate to move out or buy her own stuff after she was TA to me? So my (22F) friend (21F) of 8+ years needed a place to live after a bad breakup & I had an extra room in an apt I was moving to. I said she could come & I paid for everything (moving expenses, security depo, common use furniture, appliances, cookware) I‚Äôm also the only one with a car which I let her use whenever she asks & she pays much less in rent for a smaller room but still below market value. The other day she was using my car to run errands and she asked me where to get quarters for laundry. Told her that any bank can give her a roll in exchange for a $10. She comes back hours later saying that she went to her job for quarters & they gave them but said they couldn‚Äôt do it again & they told her the bank won‚Äôt do it unless she has an account. Then the conversation went like this: 
Me: ‚Äúmost banks will just do it as a courtesy because it‚Äôs an easy exchange, you can‚Äôt go to a bank and ask to take $10 in change out if you don‚Äôt have an account‚Äù
Her: no. They [her job, not the bank] said you can‚Äôt get it unless you have an account. 
Me: I‚Äôve literally done it at banks I don‚Äôt have an account

Me: ok‚Ä¶. Well then don‚Äôt argue for no reason

"AITA for not driving 4.5 hours (one-way)to pick my girlfriend from the airport and ask her to take a bus My(30M) girlfriend(30) went for a girls trip this weekend. But she found out Saturday that her return flight on sunday is cancelled. All flight options given were for next day which she did not prefer.
She called me and asked me to search flights from another airlines and I sent her options which were not too bad. 
Then she asked me if I could drive 4.5 hours one way to another airport to pick her up and drive back as she did not want to take the next leg of the flight. I booked her on flight to the airport 4.5 hours away and asked her if she could take the bus back for 5 hours instead of me driving 9 hours in a day. 
She did not want to drive as she knew she would be too tired with all activities over the weekend. I refused and she is upset now. I normally would have done this but seeing she could have rented a taxi as well or take a bus I didn't think this was a big deal as there were options.
Please help me understand if I am in the wrong.
Sidenote- I stay in United States and I do understand there are people who would drive this much without thinking.

Edit-
I see I made an error in setting the timeline correctly. She agreed to fly to the airport which was 4.5 hours away before she asked me to come pick her up. I declined at that point and asked if she wanted me to rebook her flight to another location. But she said she would manage and then I booked her a bus ticket. 
I also told her I don't see any logic in me driving so much.",0.06
"WIBTA if I confronted my brother about his spending habits using my card? Hey everyone,

Tough situation here. I gave my brother a card for him to use that is loaded with money from sales I make working car sales. It‚Äôs a significant amount, too. $250 to begin with, and I told him he could keep whatever else gets loaded on. (Average per car is $100) - if I sell 10 new cars that‚Äôs potentially $1000/mo I‚Äôm effectively giving him. This is 1099‚Äôd as well, meaning I‚Äôm liable for all of the tax at the end of the year. 

Now the reason why I did this? Because he‚Äôs hurting. His wife is going to school to be a nurse, so her income is gone. They have twins. They need daycare one time a week ($800/mo), 2 new car payments, and a mortgage. Diapers etc adds up. I‚Äôm younger than him, so I wouldn‚Äôt know exactly how much all of this costs but I‚Äôm assuming a lot. 

I thought I‚Äôd be nice and step in to try to help him get thru this, and provide some financial assistance, for now at least. He was not proud to accept the help, but also wasn‚Äôt in the position to deny it. 

Anyways, I gave him the card a week ago, and out of curiosity (since it is my money after all) I figured I check the statement to see how he‚Äôs spending it, etc. 

McDonald‚Äôs, Cumberland farms (candy and soda) charges, YouTube premium‚Ä¶etc. all things that aren‚Äôt a necessity to his life. In fact, I haven‚Äôt seen one charge that made sense for him to actually charge. 

I was hoping to see pharmacy, gas, grocery, etc. but it appears he‚Äôs using the card as a way to pay for things he doesn‚Äôt need. 

And I‚Äôm not in a great financial position to where this money isn‚Äôt significant to myself. It‚Äôs a lot of money. In fact, it‚Äôs money I could use towards my taxes, future, education etc. I gave him the money as a ‚Äúhere man, I know what the struggle is like.‚Äù 

It pisses me off! I could be spending the money like that and live more comfortably‚Ä¶ I could be the one enjoying YouTube premium, etc. I intended the money to be used toward my nephew and godson, or any other NECESSARY purchases. Not convenience items. 

Tl;dr brother spending money I gave him foolishly, making me question if he ever even needed the money or if he has a spending problem. 

The reason I could be the asshole is if I confronted him it could be me basically spying on him, dictating how the ‚Äúgift‚Äù should be spent. And it would seem almost overbearing as I‚Äôd be judging him on his finances.",0.26
"AITA for trapping my neighbour‚Äôs cat for repeated trespassing? I had a new neighbour move in not too long ago with a pet cat. The cat is not confined to the boundaries of their house (there are low walls/fences around everyone‚Äôs houses) and frequently goes ‚Äòvisiting‚Äô other houses on a neighbourhood tour.

At the start, I found it somewhat amusing to see the cat in my backyard and driveway but that changed once the cat started heading up to the bedrooms in my house. This was alarming as I have a baby and I know that the cat has also frequently entered the drains outside our houses. I spoke to my neighbour about it but she dismissed it saying that there was nothing she could do and I‚Äôm fussing too much just because I had a child. 

I‚Äôve tried keeping the doors and windows shut as well as spraying cat repellant but somehow the cat has managed to find a way in, including eating food left out on the kitchen tables. In addition, the cat‚Äôs presence also attracts the neighbourhood stray cats, turning my front yard into a battleground late at night.

On a suggestion of a friend, I loaned some traps from a government animal welfare agency. So this program basically loans out traps to homeowners with stray cat complaints. The agency picks up tracked cats and scans for identification tags. Stray cats will then be rehomed and pet cats returned to owners. The grey area here is using them for overly intrusive pet cats as it is an almost 1 hour drive to their facility to pick up your pet cat if it has been trapped. 

I thought that doing that will perhaps prompt my neighbour into keeping her cat indoors since she‚Äôs unwilling to barricade her house. In addition, other neigbours have also raised this as an issue to her.

After 3 of such trap and release incidents, I‚Äôm surprised that nothing has been done on her end. However she seems to have found out that the traps were placed in my house and is accusing me of being cruel to animals. AITA?

Edit: Checked on window screens and the contractors said that major modifications would be needed for my existing windows. Not paying that cost out of pocket so I‚Äôll go back to trapping lol. For those who feel it‚Äôs the neighbour‚Äôs right to freeroam her cat, the hypocrisy is real is if you think the same doesn‚Äôt apply for one‚Äôs dog.",0.62

"AITA for being upset that my not-boyfriend deleted my Tinder? ""John"" and I have been chatting for a month online through Tinder. He came into town, we spent the weekend together, had a great time, and seem to be pretty into each other. I'm still not quite over my ex's (yes, plural), though, so I wanted to take things a little slow. 

He mentioned on Saturday that he had deleted his Tinder. I replied with a ""oh yeah, I should probably do that too."" I forgot. 

On Sunday, I got a Tinder notification and he saw. It brought the conversation back to me deleting it. So, because I was driving, I handed my phone to him, asked him to ""pause"" my profile (a function that makes your Tinder profile inactive, but you can still participate in existing conversations and see old convos). He gave it back, I uninstalled it, and that was that.

Monday, I started to miss that dopamine hit of getting a ton of matches (honestly, you can be a goblin on Tinder, but if you're female, you'll get swamped w/ matches). Even though we've chatted about dating, we haven't set it in stone yet. I've kind of been dancing around the idea- and especially since I checked my ex's Facebook and saw he was in a relationship and it just tore my heart out today. 

So I opened up Tinder and it's deleted.

John says it was a mistake. And maybe I'm overreacting because I'm already pretty sensitive about my ex starting a new relationship (when he broke it off with me specifically because he didn't want a relationship). But I got super, super upset. I put talking to John on hold until I can decide whether I'm an asshole for opening up Tinder, and whether I'm justified being upset with him for ""accidentally"" deleting it in the first place.",0.38
"AITA for not warning my housemate when I shower at night? My Housemate and I share a bathroom. I shower at night - spending a total of maximum 15 minutes in the bathroom before I go to bed.

I know the feeling of disappointment when someone else goes into the bathroom when you had thought about it too, but given he could brush his teeth at any other time in the night aside from one 15 minute period, this seems unnecessary to me.

"AITA for not using tax returns to pay for pet surgery? Our cat has Chylothorax which is likely terminal. My fiance was devastated by the news. Emotions ran high again weeks later when our dog was diagnosed with an inoperable tumor. We can buy more time with our cat with surgery but we don't know for sure what the cost would be. 

I found out at work that if my fiance and I get married before year's end we'll get ~$13k back in taxes I paid this year.  My immediate thought was to use the money for the wedding so I asked my fiance if she wanted to get married early at the courthouse and use the tax return for a ceremony. 

Initially she seemed hesitant because she didn't want to ""cheapen"" the experience. I was ready to let it go at that but my coworkers pushed the numbers again the next day saying it was a ""no-brainer"". When I got home the topic of conversation turned back to the tax benefit of marrying early. 

My fiance threw out ""it makes no sense not to go for it"" since we're getting married anyway.  I was a little shocked at the change of opinion. She then asked me point blank ""if the cat's surgery is $8k, would you be willing to use the money for that?""

Enter the moral dilemma. 

I said it was irrational and unwise to spend that much on our cat. The surgery can't provide a permanent fix and we'd have continuing medical bills for a few years until our cat finally passed. I suggested it'd be wiser to spend the money on the wedding or replacing her 2005 prius, or starting a 529 to pay for college for any potential children. 

My fiance abruptly ended the conversation saying she needed to go do homework. I dropped it and said good night. On my way to bed, I stopped in her office to get a kiss and she was playing games instead.

"AITA for telling my son to stop projecting on me?  

23 years ago, I was in a really bad place in my life. Addict, escaping some pretty heavy stuff. In the midst of it all, I found out I was pregnant. At the time, I was basically forced to carry to term by someone in my life and I ultimately decided the best thing to do for that child was give them to a family who could provide stability. The adoption was supposed to be open, but the parents closed it after 2 years. I somewhat understood. I was still not in a fabulous place at the time and I likely would've done what they did. I kept my medical records up to date with the agency, should the child want to reach out.

Fast forward to now, I am 10 years clean and have created a new life for myself. My biological son reached out to me and I was happy to reconnect. He unfortunately shared that he had been through a lot as an adoptee and felt as though he would've done better with me or my family. I have explained several times that his trauma is valid and I am very sorry that his adoptive parents turned out that way. However, I have also explained either way, he would've had trauma had myself or family raised him.

I have always validated his trauma and listened, but I started drawing the line when he'd project it onto me. Here's the thing...I don't regret giving him up. I wish I had found better parents but given what things were like with adoption at the time, I didn't have much of a choice. But overall, it was best for both of us that I didn't raise him. I have never felt any trauma or grief from placing him. And while he can feel how he does, I will not be spoken for. We've gotten into arguments about this because he's done research and says I must feel this way, I have to. He told me he's seen videos from other adoptees and they all have bio parents who were coerced or have regret. I don't. He seemed almost mad at me that I didn't have any. I finally asked if he wanted me to lie to him and he told me I was being obtuse. We haven't spoken much since.

His wife has since reached out and says that I am being very dismissive and I should show at least some guilt or regret to help him through this. AITA for saying no?",0.08

Later she justifies for putting the bill on her card saying she‚Äôs not one to let money control her and stuff basically she‚Äôs not that kind of person that will hold money over you. 

I was too nervous about the money thing to send her money yesterday I ended up overthinking everything and forgot to zelle her. This was the first time I hung out with this group but I didn‚Äôt want to ruin it by not sending the extra 50 dollars. 
So today M texted me to remind me to zelle her so I told her the truth about how I felt about the bill. I asked her if it was okay if I sent over the money for just the food I ordered since I wasn‚Äôt planning to pay for everyone else‚Äôs drinks and food. And she hasn‚Äôt replied yet. I feel horrible that I can‚Äôt pay for that kind of bill at the moment. I honestly wish I had money to just spend on dinner like that but that‚Äôs not how I am. Obviously if I had ordered a bunch of stuff I would be down to pay but I didn‚Äôt everyone had 3+ drinks and a bunch of appetizers that I hardly ate because I arrive 20 minutes late (they changed the restaurant last minute). I just feel like an asshole because everyone was totally fine with paying that much money. Though there was one girl who commented that she wasn‚Äôt planning to spend that much money either.


Edit: BTW the guy asked for the check quietly. No one knew he asked for one check. Nobody even checked with everyone to see if that was okay this was my first time going out with them so I wasn‚Äôt sure if this was a usual thing or not. And I shouldn‚Äôt have to bring up my budget in a social setting to the whole table. I‚Äôm uncomfortable with that. 

Update: she was totally cool with me only sending my portion of the food I got. she‚Äôs not out of 50$ because I know for a fact that people handed her extra cash and then some because some people knew they ordered more than 80$ of food

I‚Äôve never been in this kind of situation so I didn‚Äôt know what to do literally never had a situation like this. Which is why I stayed quiet and was anxious to bring it up at the table. But now I know to definitely bring it up next time

It was very clear the guy next to me was trying to not have to pay for what he ordered and put it on the rest of the table.


TLDR:

Went out with some friends, one guy ahead of time asks for one bill and told the waiter  we were gonna split. I was only planning to pay for the two things I ordered that would have came out 23 dollars but now it‚Äôs 80 because they are splitting evenly and I didn‚Äôt plan to budget that in. M decided to just put it on her check and everyone send her money, some people give her money in cash well over their 80 dollars because they knew they spend more than the split. I ask her if I can send the money from just my food and tip because I was not expecting it was going to be split like that and she said of course you can. Calculating the extra money that some people have makes her out of 20iah bucks and there‚Äôs also a friend moving away who‚Äôs tab was ‚Äúcovered‚Äù by the guy who asked for the check early. Which was basically split between all of us.",0.57
"AITA [30m] for getting mad at gf [26f] for finding zoloft prescription pills by the nightstand for the 2nd time? We have cats and zoloft is toxic to cats. One of our cats had to go to the emergency room last year (he was in kidney failure) and the vet couldn't figure out why. The vet flushed his system and we miraculously got him back alive. He was very close to death.

The next day, I found zoloft pills by her nightstand and found out that they are extremely toxic to cats and could cause kidney failure.... my gf thought that it could have been these flowers that I got her around the same time...(i honestly cant remember what type they were or if I had even gotten flowers in the first place).

We talk about the pills and she says that she will make sure not to drop them on the ground again and thats that.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to now... I find another damm zoloft prescription pill on the ground by the nightstand. I'm pretty upset at this point because even though we dont know if it caused our cat's kidney failure, after almost losing him, I can't help but think about it happening again. 

Am I the asshole for how I handled this? text messages below:

&#x200B;

me: \*sends image of pill on ground\* ""dude. seriously?""

her: ""Sorry! You know I dont do it on purpose""

me: ""why would I think you purposefully put prescription pills on the floor. This has been happening too often.""

her: ""By your reaction it certainly seems like it""

me: ""Why does it seem like im the only one upset about a prescription pill being left on the ground when its extremely toxic to our cats?""

her: ""why dont you think im upset by it? You dont think I feel bad enough as it is without you getting mad about it""

me: ""so how are we going to make sure it doesnt happen again?""

her: ""I'll send you a powerpoint slide like you always ask for""

The texts keep going but this is the jest of the conversation....and I should also note that I dont ever ask her for powerpoint slides of things....I dont really know why she said that.",0.12

i found out 2 months before my wedding that my fianc√© was being unfaithful to me for a while so i broke everything with him off including the wedding & everything. i wrote in my bridesmaids group chat explaining that everything was off & what happened. literally 5 days later my best friend wrote in her bridesmaids chat to inform us that she & her husband were gonna change their wedding date to an earlier date. & when they said they were moving it to THE SAME EXACT DAY i was suppose to get married, i legit couldn‚Äôt believe it. i wrote my ‚Äúfriend‚Äù on the side & told her i didn‚Äôt feel comfortable walking in her wedding anymore considering that was suppose to be my day & that i would be too emotional that specific date.. for a good reason i think? she told me i was being a bad friend cus it was just a date & her location canceled her date & they had an opening on my date. she also went on to say that she had already spent the money on my bridesmaids gift & everything & how could i do this to her. i was really shocked & hurt that she would steal my date not even a week after i canceled everything & literally had my heartbroken.

AITA FOR TELLING MY HUSBAND TO NOT GET HIS BROTHER FOOD? [deleted],0.25
"AITA for locking my (ex)bf in my flat? This is my first time postig, and english is not my first language. So, I'm sorry for my grammar.
I (19f) used to date John (21m) back in April. He was a friend of mine for almost 2 years, but the relationship was difficult from the start. We used to fight quite a lot, but nothing really important, just two or three big dramatic fights. 
This all started geting bad when we moved for University. We both study in a city that an hour away from our home town. This was my first year at it (I took a gap year because of my mental health), but he already had an aparment here since 2019 (we started dating in 2020, he was in town because of the pandemic). 

We started fighting every single day. He didn't want to see me, and spended the whole day with his neighbours (29f and 24f) who didn't liked me because ""I look easy"" and ""I'm jealous"". So, I could not visit John without awfull looks, and most of the time ended up being told to go home in the middle of the night (which to be honest I didn't do, saying I care for my safety enough not to walk 3km at 3am alone). 
Because of this, we only met at my flat once a week. The problem is no one can enter or leave the building unless the have a key, so in order for him to leave the building I have to go to the hall and open the front door for him. 

Not big deal, right? Well, if you take into acount I have BPD and panick, and John has anger issues, it kinda was. When ever we fight, he would scream at me calling me names, saying I make every body miserable and stuff like that. Off corse, as the dramatic b my brain is, I would have a mental breack down every single time. I locked him in the flat until I was able to calm (so my neighbours didn't see me like that). This happended many times. Now I feel awful about it. He said it traumatized him, and he broke up. He even said I deserved beeing abused by my first boyfriend when I was 16. Kinda feeling that is true.

I was able to moved on, I'm dating someone I really love and  we don't fight at all. But I feel I don't deserve this, I don't deserved to be able to move on so fast after what I did. I know I should broke up with John before it got really bad, but I was scared of hurting him. He texted me a week ago and I asked him to not do that never again, but I been feeling like I own him an apology. So, Am I the Asshole?",0.75
AITA: for believing the man who got me pregnant should help me during difficult times I‚Äôm having such as financial.  I met the guy on tinder we were kind of on and off and then I found out I was pregnant. When we met I had my own place and a job and I was pretty well set up then that all changed. My roommate let me know literally a few months before we were supposed to re-sign our lease that she no longer wanted to do that because I was pregnant yet again I already have a son who does not live with me. I was scrambling to try to find somewhere to go and I ended up finding a one bedroom apartment but unfortunately it turned out to be a scam so I was left homeless and with not enough money to sustain myself because hotels are expensive. I asked the father of my child to allow me to stay with him as his sister-in-law who he stays with was OK with that considering the circumstances he told me he does not have any responsibility for me or for the child until the child is born therefore he does not care if I‚Äôm homeless. I ended up staying there and long story short he keeps kicking me out and in doing so embarrassing me in front of everybody like today when he had his family locked me outside of the house after I came back from a prenatal appointment. So me and tears goes to my car and parks in a Walmart parking lot and he‚Äôs telling me that he has no responsibility for me and that I‚Äôm a cheater and that I‚Äôm not loyal and that he doesn‚Äôt want to deal with me anymore so if he did asshole or am I the asshole does he really have no responsibility to ensure that I am safe so the baby is safe?,0.85

"AITA for not wanting my bf to speak to my ex-friend jealousy is an emotion i rarely feel. if i feel threatened by competition i sort of give up and passively let things happen. in june my crush at the time met my best friend at the time and got close. i didn‚Äôt feel ‚Äòjealous‚Äô, just left out and a little pushed away, which hurt. 

for my birthday my crush and i were gna go to a scenic rooftop. after realising that my crush and best friend liked each other i backed off and told them to date. i regretted stepping aside for them but was uncomfy with how they were willing to change the name on my ticket to her name. it was supposed to be for my birthday. 

we got over that situation and my crush became my boyfriend and my friend and i got much closer. 

but all of a sudden she cut me off. she said she didn‚Äôt want to be my friend anymore and i didn‚Äôt fight

earlier this week my boyfriend revealed that he and my ex-friend still speak to each other but it made me so sad. knowing how she feels about me now i fear that her dislike for me could somehow spread to my boyfriend.

my boyfriend and i took a break and i cannot stop picturing the two of them together. they liked each other in the past and it feels like they could like each other again. i want to fight for my boyfriend this time i keep imagining the two of them talking about me behind my back, secretly reinforcing their hatred for me.

i want to tell him to stop speaking to her because as long as he does, i don‚Äôt know if i can trust them. when we went on a break, he told her and she replied ‚Äúi knew this would happen‚Äù and it seems so taunting

but i don‚Äôt wanna tell him what to do. i don‚Äôt wanna limit his freedom be controlling all of a sudden after. i just want them to stop talking because i don‚Äôt see how they could talk while he claims to love me and she seemingly hates me.

"AITA for reverse trick or treating with my wife? Good evening.

This happened a few nights ago, but I just heard it was causing drama today.

My wife and I moved into our neighborhood a few weeks ago, and we live somewhat rural. We're in a small town, under 5,000 people, but have about 4 dozen homes within a 20 minute walk.

We know there aren't any kids in the neighborhood, and were told to expect no trick or treaters.

So, my wife and I dressed up in costumes we had easy access to, nothing controversial or inappropriate, and stocked up on candy. We made little baggies for each house in our neighborhood with about a dozen fun sized pieces of candy in each.

On Halloween night we went from house ot house, and about half the people opened for us. We'd give them candy, introduce ourselves, and move on. We started around 6:30 PM and finished around 8:30 PM. (We started far out, and moved back in towards home, towards a few people we had casually met.)

Today while getting the mail, my wife overheard a group of people talking about the new, weird, neighbors, who decided to take up a chunk of everyone's evening on a Saturday night.

That mixed with two of the houses on our route telling us that people don't do that kind of thing in our neighborhood, and one telling us we're going to burn in hell for celebrating a satanic holiday, has me thinking that A. We have at least one loony neighbor, but B. maybe we may have crossed a line in going out in the evening?

I'm dismissing the satanic panic right away, but with multiple people telling us we weren't welcome, and the stuff my wife overheard, I'm wondering, were we out of line?

Are we the assholes?

Thank you.",0.17
"AITA for saying I don't respect my future father in law? Quick background first.

My fianc√©'s parents had an affair while both being married with 2 kids, as a result my fianc√© came to be. Her mother divorced her husband and her father stayed with his wife.  Said wife told him ""you need to be in that child's life but I don't want the child in my house"". He did not make any attempt to see my fianc√©, and my mother in law while didn't ask for child support has had the same businessin the same location for the last 30 years so he knew where to find her.  My fianc√© found him on Facebook when she turned 18 and said he wanted a relationship with her but did not want to speak about the past and wanted a ""normal"" father - daughter relationship. Since then he had another child with his now ex wife, is remarried with a 7 year old. 

Onto the issue at hand, this weekend we went out with her sister [on her dad's side] with her new boyfriend, while we talked he asked me what I felt about their father. Now I have always been open with my feelings about the man so I said ""Honestly I have no respect for a man that KNOWS he has a child but makes no attempt to be in the child's life."" When the boyfriend asked of that ment I wouldn't interact with him I said no, if my fianc√© wants a relationship with him I will be polite,  but my experience with him is that he will not try to have a conversation with me, but I also did say I felt it was since we are a same sex couple. I gave him a few examples, but then our food arrived and the conversation naturally shifted. 

When we left my fianc√© told me I shouldn't have said anything since her sister is a daddy's girl and she will run to tell him what I said. Now like I said, I'm open about my feelings, all of our friends and her other siblings [mother's side] know this, and she has never told me anything before. I did tell her that if her sister does tell and he changes towards her then that speaks more about them then anything else. Now I'm thinking about it and I do feel bad for risking their relationship.

"AITA if I removed myself off the lease? Hello, 
I (26F) live with 2 other roommates, Roomie A (19F) AND Roomie B (21F). I've been living with them since June and in that time B has been late on rent 3 times. I was the one that always had to cover the late rent and its been to the point that she and A expect it. The past month, I had to pay over 300 dollars since B came up short. The first time we were late, we got a 3 day notice by our apartment when we were late by one day. It was stressful for myself and I never wanted to go through that. I feel like at the point where it's expected that I cover her when she is late. I finally have expressed that I am not covering the amount anymore and she apologized that she made me feel that way. She gave the old run around stating that she is trying and they she will pay me back. So far she has paid me 100 out of the 300 which is annoying cause I do have trip coming up. So far she had only worked a pt time job but I had just found out today she did get a full time job. 

I do want ro note that she does call out often or leaves work early when her boss dosent need people. She's always going out and spending money when she shouldn't. For example bought an 80 dollar bag the week before rent was due and ended up being short by 100. 

Now I'm really debating to talk to the landlord to see how I can get removed on the lease since there is two people on the lease and refusing to pay anything extra if one of them is late.  I am thinking about moving out but it's been hard to find a place that will accept my dog. 

I am wondering if I'd be the asshole if I did do that cause I do make more then her and can budget my money to the point I can afford yearly trips to Europe. I worked really hard to get to the point I am in my life and I'm just tired of bailing us out.

UPDATE 1: 
hey guys, thanks for the reply. Somethings are taking place. I was a bit surprised by turn around of A. In fact, A and B are not as buddy buddy as I thought. I just came back from my birthday trip in Paris and before I got on the plane, B sent her portion of the rent being a 150 dollars short. I became furious and chewed her out in the chat then 10 mins later she sends the rest. I was able to pay the rent right before I left. It was stressful. 

Turns out A wasn't as happy with B as well. B has been eatting As and I food,I haven't noticed cause I forgot things super easily. It seems like B clinged onto A also which has annoyed A like for instance A was suppose to go to Magic Kingdom with her friend but when B asked to come A said no. B said she would end herself since no one likes her. I didn't find out about this after I got back because A said we need to do something. So tonight we are going to have a sit down and tell B we don't want her hear anymore since she dosent help out, dosent pay her rent, and is not taking care of herself. If anyone cares to know the outcome of this talk. I will be updating after the discussion",0.14
"AITA in trying to help my girlfriend? My girlfriend and I are in a long-distance relationship (she had to move for med-school). Today, after a rocky few days, I called her on Zoom and we were about to watch a show on Prime. I asked her if she has formatted an abstract that was she was supposed to do (it was listed on her calendar). She said she hasn't and I offered to do it for her. She agreed, sent me links for the formatting and the abstract.

I spent a few minutes formatting the abstract for her while talking to her. I did my best to format the document for her but made a few mistakes. It is a totally different field to mine and each field has its guidelines so I was not 100% confident in my work. I show it to her and she yells and gets mad at me and says ""if you were gonna ask me everything, then why did you offer to help? I was supposed to do other things while you did this"".

I didn't really have a retort. I hate confrontation and I usually freeze. She kept saying stuff along the above lines. I asked if she wants this document and she said no, she'll work on it later once she gets information about an author. So I said OK and tried to move past this by asking if she wanted to watch the show with me and she said OK. As soon as the show starts, she says she's gonna go and immediately leaves before I could say anything. No bye or anything.

I felt terrible that I didn't really help but realized that I was doing this while talking to her and talking to a friend over messenger. Additionally, I was also keeping an eye on something else. I offered help thinking it would be longer work than it turned out to be and something that could take the ease her workload.

My brother and his gf, had a baby boy and at 8 months he was diagnosed with cancer and passed away at 16 months. The hospital was wonderful with us and there is an organization that worked with the hospital that help families who lost their children like giving tickets for a spa day, organized an activity with other family who's grieving so they can gather together, go for a hike and supported each other etc. It's amazing and every year, they organized a marathon and each family wanted to participate needs to raise a fundraiser so all the money goes to the organization and that's how they can help family. Every year in September, we participate and we run for the lost ones. This year, I had to move in September with a 5 days notice and I slept every night for about 1-3h. I'm not exaggerating. I was dizzy, shaking and exhausted almost every day and if I run, I have the feeling I will collapse so I told my brother's gf (SIL?) that is better if I don't participate and my brother was ok and she asked me if I don't run, at least walk.

"AITA for not picking up the food? 
My (20f) sister (25f) texted me at 4 today while I was working to ask if I‚Äôd pick dinner up from a steak house for us and the rest of our family on my way home. I said yes because I thought this meant somebody would place the order before I left and it would be ready by the time I got there to get it. I would have said no if I‚Äôd known it was gonna be any different because I hate having to leave the house after I‚Äôve just gotten home from work. She‚Äôs knows this. She‚Äôs also been off from work all day and could‚Äôve gotten it herself before I even arrived. 

When I got off at 6pm, I texted her asking if it was ready for me to pick up. She texts back and asks if I‚Äôll call and place the order (she has severe anxiety and won‚Äôt do it herself, I thought she would be having somebody else place the order for us). I said no. I also have anxiety and I was driving, plus there was 5 different meals I had to read from text messages. I didn‚Äôt say any of this, I just said no because I‚Äôm driving and don‚Äôt want to type all of that out. So she bitches me out over text message because nobody will place the order for her. Tells me I‚Äôm not getting anything and I‚Äôm ‚Äúannoying as fuck‚Äù.  I tell her that‚Äôs fine because I‚Äôm tired of being bitched out by her everyday over the littlest things. I just want to come home. We text back and forth, her asking if I‚Äôll place the order still, me upset because I‚Äôm still just driving aimlessly while trying to figure out the plan. I text one last time asking if no one else can place the order. She doesn‚Äôt answer so I decide to come home. She texts back about 10 minutes later saying it‚Äôs been ordered and asking if I‚Äôll still go pick it up and now help pay for it. Im already almost home, so this pisses me off further. I call and ask how long it‚Äôll be before it‚Äôs ready. 45 minutes to an hour. I obviously sounded upset about this on the phone because she texts me less than a minute later calling me a bitch  and telling me to just come home and she‚Äôll go get it. She sends a couple other mean text messages and also called me a couple other choice words but whatever. I come home. And she‚Äôs PISSED that I came home without the food. And PISSED that she has to go do it. We bicker a little bit before she leaves with my grandmother to go get the food. She even texted me after they left saying she should just cancel my meal since I don‚Äôt wanna help out. I feel bad because I said I would go get the food, but I hate doing favors for her when she treats me like that. This type of thing happens all the time so it leaves me wondering if I‚Äôm TA or if she is.

Edit: I guess I should add that I have already set the boundary in the past that I will not go pick up dinner if it‚Äôs not ready when I am or if I‚Äôm already home. Which is why I assumed it would be ready when I got off work. I actually enjoy cooking and would much rather make them dinner then leave the house after just getting home.",0.27
"AITA for keeping a tip a customer directly gave to me even though we tip share. First of all, sorry if this is disjointed, today has been a day for me. Also I'm on mobile so who knows how the formattings going to look.

For some backstory, I work at a local restaurant that would probably be classified as fast casual, everything is BYO and made to order, nothing is pre-prepared, currently we are very short-staffed, and Fridays are typically pretty busy for us. The way our tips work is we have a physical tip jar, and we also do electronic tips, and all tips get split up each pay period by how many hours each person worked.

For five and a half hours of my shift, I was the only person taking orders at the counter and on the phone, and preparing orders.There was only an hour and a half of time I had someone helping me on that side, and I ended up needing to stay 3 hours after closing to finish closing and cleaning tasks and also complete all the tasks I was expected to get done in preparation for the weekend. The only other employee in the store during that time isn't trained to do any of those things, and basically only does cleaning tasks and prep for the next day. I was unable to find the time to text my boss that I needed her to turn off online ordering, because I was unable to keep up with the volume of orders that were coming in in-store, on the phone, online, and on our delivery sites by myself. 

A man came in who had placed an online order, and it wasn't ready yet, because I literally hadn't had a chance to get to it between everything else I was doing, and he was very upset over that fact and took it out on me. That encounter, combined with the fact I was already pretty stressed by having to work a rush by myself and some issues with my personal life, caused me to start crying.

Another customer, after seeing how that man treated me, went out to his car after I gave him his food, and came back inside with a 20$ bill, which he gave directly to me, while telling me the guy was a jerk and I was doing a great job. Typically, when people hand me tips I just put them in our tip jar so they'll get split between everyone, but this time I just pocketed it, which I have never done before, because I figure if the guy wanted it to go in the tip jar he would've just put it in the tip jar instead of specifically calling me over and handing it to me.

The conflict is, the people I've mentioned this to are kind of split, some people think I was perfectly justified to do that, considering the specific circumstances and the fact I was literally the only person there at the time, while some people think it was a jerk move and how would I feel if I found out a coworker did that and blah blah blah. 

I wouldn't say I think I did the right thing, but I don't think I did the wrong thing, necessarily.

My fianc√©e totaled his car about a month ago. His grandmother had bought it for him as an early wedding gift. (He had an older, unreliable car.) Thankfully, he had full coverage so he‚Äôs getting a $12,000 check for it. 

Which is great, but he can‚Äôt find a decent truck for that much and he really needs one for his job. (Construction) So he‚Äôs now considering taking on a loan for a $50,000 brand new truck. 

The issue is: we‚Äôve just managed to dig ourselves out of debt from school and hospital bills. This month would be first time we haven‚Äôt lived check to check for a long time. I just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a good idea to sign up for a loan that big and payments that are half our rent ($700). And honestly, I‚Äôm scared. 

We‚Äôve been debating it for hours and he‚Äôs brought my parents into the argument. (They‚Äôre on his side). 

My family is calling me a selfish asshole. Am  I? 

I know that he wants a new truck for his job and he deserves it. He‚Äôs worked really hard this year. I‚Äôm just worried about the financial aspect of it. I don‚Äôt want to start drowning in debt again. Event though it‚Äôs not my loan, it will be my debt when I marry him.

"AITA for telling my stepsons mom that we need to switch weekends? Sorry in advance, I‚Äôm on mobile and not  good at typing things like this out. 

My stepson (12) lives with his mom full time. He comes to our house every other weekend. He lives in a different town 50 miles away. 

We haven‚Äôt had my stepson at our home in 3 months, because he coincidentally has band practice every time that it‚Äôs our weekend, but not the opposite weekend. We make weekly trips on Sunday to see him, but that‚Äôs not the point. We cannot afford to drive to pick him up on Friday, take him to band practice and come back on Saturday, and then take him home again Sunday. 

We have a group chat between his mom, my husband and myself. She told us yesterday that he‚Äôd be coming to our house this weekend. Today, I message that I‚Äôm on my way, and she said no because he has band practice tomorrow. I told her that it wasn‚Äôt fair to his dad (my husband) or his brother (my son) or even my stepson that he isn‚Äôt able to come to our house, and that we needed to switch weekends, so that we will get our weekends with him. (I had previously had this conversation with my husband who agreed). She left the chat and texted my husband that I was disrespectful and she‚Äôd no longer be speaking to me.

"AITA for eating meat? For context I‚Äôm a pescatarian (17f). Not because I‚Äôm against anything but just simply for the reason that I‚Äôm more on top of my diet. I‚Äôve always struggled with my eating habits like eating junk food constantly, eating too much and a never ending feeling of hunger. I needed to change and for some reason since I‚Äôve dropped meat, I‚Äôm always on track of my diet, I eat healthier and mentally I feel great. I do not force anyone to accommodate for me as this is something I personally chose to do and never bring anyone down for eating meat. Sometimes when invited to a party and is asked if I had any recommendations for food or etc, I mention I don‚Äôt really eat meat which is usually fine as people provide veggie dishes and such. 

On to the problem, today was my uncles bday party which I had no clue of at all (it was never mentioned to me but I did know it was his birthday soon). Since we haven‚Äôt really gone to family bday parties (due to covid) in the past 2/3 years no one really knows I‚Äôm pescatarian. Anyways, my parents pick me up from work and tell me we are going to a party for my uncle. Dinner is ready and there were no non-meat dishes but only rice (I‚Äôm Filipino so a lot of food was very meat based). I didn‚Äôt care and usually if this happens I grab around the meat in dishes. But I was so hungry, just got off work and felt like I was going to starve to death. Not to mention there were like a 100 people behind me in line who probably didn‚Äôt want to watch me spend 10 minutes at each dish trying to scoop parts that didn‚Äôt have meat. So I got a dish that didn‚Äôt have a lot of meat and had a small portion with a ton of rice. Mind you, I actually love meat but for the above reasons I‚Äôd rather not have it in my daily meals. I sit down and start eating but out of the corner of my eye I see my mom staring daggers at me. I look up and she says that has meat in it, I say I know but that I was just so hungry and didn‚Äôt want to stall the line so I went with it. She then goes off on me and starts saying that I was a bitch and a liar. That all the money she has spent on me (getting vegan dishes) is just because I‚Äôm spoiled. That the only reason I didn‚Äôt eat meat was just so I can make my whole family feel bad about their food choices and weight. Then asked about all the other parties that had to bust their ass so my selfish self can be picky. I told her that‚Äôs not true and never meant to imply that ever. First, I have never commented on anything about their weight or diet. Second, I buy my own groceries and make my own dinners (on some occasions my parents buy me things that they think I‚Äôll like and I take it). We are now home and she refuses to look me in the eye but I feel bad for all the things she called me too. I do understand that vegan options can be expensive though.",0.02
"WIBTA asshole if I was to tell my BFF that she needs to either my friend or my boyfriend‚Äôs friend Just so that you know we have been childhood friends and I am not saying that they cannot talk.

I always listen to her vent about her husband and her problems with him and be there for her. It‚Äôs not the same for me because she seems to always defend him every time I vent to her. For example, I was telling her how he accidentally threw away my bag of school supplies and she snapped at me like i should not have left it out. I told her that it was in the closet. I told her my bag was full that he would see it. She just got so defensive.

&#x200B;

when he was going to leave and break up with me behind I was so heart broken. I was hurt and he decided not to and expected me to let it go and move on acting like it didn‚Äôt happen. She took his side and told me i was in the wrong for being upset. It was my first heartbreak and I couldn‚Äôt event vent to my best friend because she was defending him. The heartache was so bad my time of the month was was so heavy I had to go to the hospital.

we were the caregivers for my grandma and wasn‚Äôt treated badly.

I was treated like a slave. He didn‚Äôt know about it because it was hard for me to open up to him. I tried to open up but she already heard my bo side and would shut me off. When he finally saw what was going on and getting the treatment she would tell me she was already hearing about it because she heard it from him. I did not have anyone to talk to about it because I lost a lot of my friends because I was too busy being a caregiver.

now that we have my own place I am in school with good grades. He told me not to work because we make enough money for him to work and for me to concentrate on school and take care of our pet. We don‚Äôt have trouble with bills. she wasn‚Äôt working for five years before she got her recent job. She is mad that they are low staff because people are working. She was trying to pressure me to work with her but I don‚Äôt believe working with friends and refuse to work with kids and elderly after I went through as a caregiver. she was putting things through my boyfriends head about me not working and he was having a bad attitude about it until I talked to him. he apologized for it and agrees he was allowing her to manipulate him. I even asked him if that is how he feels and he doesn‚Äôt understand why he was acting that way and change his opinions when he makes more to help us out. I even make more money than him on scholarships due to my great grades so we are not in financial trouble. she still makes comments about me not working.

"AITA for calling out my mom for my terrible childhood? 
My parents weren‚Äôt good at all. They were lazy, paid no attention to me growing up, racist, bitter and mean. Verbally and emotionally abusive. VERY neglectful. I would go into detail, but it would be pages long. My mom hasn‚Äôt changed much either. She‚Äôs still a mean, bitter woman.

I‚Äôm (21F) only recently processing a lot of my trauma. I confronted my mom about it and she replied with hostility.

The conversation went like this (in voice messages on her end) 

‚ÄúDo you remember when I would tell you or dad that I made a new friend and you guys would say ‚Äúwhite or black‚Äù?‚Äù 

‚ÄúYa so‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy‚Äù 

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. What the fuck does that have to do with now, today in our lives? Who gives a shit?‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause it was my formative years as a child? Lol‚Äù

‚ÄúGreat, so why don‚Äôt you blame your upbringing on whatever‚Äôs going on in your life today. Fantastic.‚Äù

‚ÄúWasn‚Äôt the best upbringing.‚Äù
 
‚ÄúI did the best I could. How about trying to be a little more grateful for what you did have.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou are pretty much fucking ungrateful. I fucking busted my ass for you to give you everything you fucking had. Unfucking grateful.‚Äù 

After this argument she stopped speaking to me.  A month later I wound up in the mental hospital. Once I got out I contacted my oldest brother and asked if he‚Äôd like to spend New Years with me. He said he would under one condition- I say Merry Christmas to my mother. I told him I owe her nothing especially since she didn‚Äôt even reach out to me after my hospitalization.

He told me it was on me to reach out and told me I‚Äôm terrible for what I said to her. He told me my mom called him crying and venting to him about what I said to her. Went on about how I shouldn‚Äôt blame my mother for raising me badly and that it‚Äôs an absolutely shitty thing to say to her. Threatened to never speak to me again if I didn‚Äôt contact my mom.

"AITA for throwing my phone at my mom? Yesterday night, my dad & I (F14) were in the home office built into the garage of our house playing a video game together. He told me he‚Äôs gonna start making dinner, which will be shredded chicken and green onion sauce.

He called me half an hour later on our landline system while I was filming something (landline is our way of communicating if we‚Äôre not in the same room) & told me to come up in 5 minutes for dinner. I finished the video I was filming and headed upstairs. 

When I got to the main floor, I saw my mom shredding the chicken at the table & my dad was making the onion sauce. They looked mad so I asked them what was wrong. 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre 15 minutes later, I called you at 5:58PM and now it‚Äôs 6:14PM.‚Äù - my dad

I said, ‚ÄúNo...you called me at 6:09PM and I came up on time.‚Äù

My mom said she asked my dad whether he called me or not after the 5 minutes passed and that she started watching TV after my dad said he had called me and she knows that she was watching for more than 5 minutes. 

I told them that I had been filming a video when my dad had called me & that I knew he called me at 6:09PM, NOT 5:58PM. My mom said that she wouldn‚Äôt let me have the green onion sauce since I came up late.

I went back downstairs to the garage & checked the timestamp of the video I recorded. It said 6:08PM. I had started filming about 30 seconds before he called me and ended the recording about a minute after he hanged up on me. 

I went back upstairs & told my parents that the timestamp said 6:09PM & that‚Äôs the time they called me. My parents wouldn‚Äôt listen & kept telling me that I needed to learn to track my time. My mom said that I could ‚Äústill have the onion sauce‚Äù if I went outside to our patio & picked a few green onions. That sounded fine to me so I brought my shoes to the patio & picked a few onions. My mom was laughing while I was outside in the patio & she was saying ‚Äúwhere‚Äôs the ginger? we don‚Äôt have any ginger here, oh yeah we can give you the ginger for free‚Äù. I came back inside & started laughing along because I didn‚Äôt know what else to do.

I went to my dad & asked him what to do with the onions I had picked from the patio. I‚Äôve never made the sauce or watched him make it.

"AITA for not telling a friend I was going away for the weekend? With being home more and work stressing me out, I hung out with my friends online a lot to game or just chill, whatever floated our boats more at the time. In the group, I'm closer to one of them and we spent for time hanging or talking, basically 24/7 and that's more than I talk to my partner-which in retrospect may not have been the healthiest thing for the friendship.

My family's been planning this weekend getaway for awhile and I'm stoked about it but I never mentioned it to my friends that I was going on it. Friday comes and we leave early in the morning. I'm pretty much off the grid between driving, being present with my family, and little reception. When I get back home Sunday, I come back to walls of text asking my whereabouts from the friend I'm closer to. They essentially called our friendship done and are saying their goodbyes to me.

I was shocked to say the least, but I guess I shouldn't have been since something similar happened months before but I reassured them I wasn't going anywhere. I brushed it off since I want to be understanding and know they haven't had it easy in life or friendships. I get that I probably should've said 'hey I can't be contacted this weekend, going out of town' or something since we've been hanging out so much. I just didn't think they'd think I was ghosting them. Our friendship's been rocky since and I felt like a big a-hole. I don't think they've really trusted me after that and get mad at things I do or when I game with our mutual friends and not them, but that's a whole nother issue.

"AITA for calling my sibling a screw up/a good for nothing after they went out and got themself arrested? I (F23) am the oldest of three siblings. Our mom died when I was eleven and our father left three months after my youngest sibling (NB16) was born. We were raised by our aunt, but she works as a nurse, meaning long shifts and a lot of time away from home. I stepped up to the plate and tried my best to raise my little siblings. 

The middle sibling (M19) and I have always gotten along very well. My youngest sibling and I‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm afraid I can‚Äôt say the same. My youngest sibling and I are very different. I‚Äôll admit, I‚Äôm a bit tense and my youngest sibling is the stereotypical ‚Äòwild child.‚Äô They haven‚Äôt gotten anything higher than a C since middle school and have been sneaking out constantly since. It all started when I left for college, and I‚Äôve never been able to understand why.

Anyway, a few nights ago, I got a call at three in the morning from my younger brother, telling me to get over to my aunt‚Äôs house because the cops were there. I rushed over and was briefed on the situation. My sibling had gotten drunk and had tried (along with a few friends) to steal something from a store. I was furious, but I kept my head and spoke to the cops. (I suppose law school hasn‚Äôt all been a waste.) Once they left, I suppose I lost my cool.

I asked my sibling what the hell they were thinking and if they were trying to ruin their future. They said that I didn‚Äôt have to ‚Äòplay nice‚Äô because we all knew I didn‚Äôt think they had one of those. My brother tried to interject, but we both brushed him off. I asked my sibling why they thought I thought that, and I pointed out that this is the third time I‚Äôve caught them doing something like this in just the past three months, and I mentioned how it‚Äôs a miracle they only got arrested now. They yelled at me that not everyone could be as perfect as me. 
I‚Äôm not proud of what I said next, but I can‚Äôt say I didn‚Äôt mean it at least bit. I told them they were a screw up and that I didn‚Äôt know why I tried with them at all, because we both knew they wouldn‚Äôt amount to anything. (Bad attitude and bad grades, for one.) My sibling cursed me out and stormed to their room. 

My brother told me that my anger was justified, but that I was being cruel. He said that our sibling looked up to me (which I highly doubt) and was only doing this for my attention. He also said that maybe our sibling didn‚Äôt need a mom anymore, they needed a sister. 

I‚Äôm conflicted. My sibling has never listened to any of my advice before, so I can‚Äôt imagine they actually want my attention. I also know what I said was harsh, but I wasn‚Äôt wrong. My sibling has been nothing but trouble for years. So, AITA?

Update: Hello, everyone. Thank you for the feedback, and I‚Äôve concluded that you‚Äôre all right. About half an hour after posting, I went over to my aunt‚Äôs and took my sibling to dinner. We had a long talk, and they admitted that I‚Äôve been so busy the past few years and that maddening me was the only way, they felt, to get my full, undivided attention. I‚Äôve agreed to go to family therapy, (they don‚Äôt want to go alone) and I think I‚Äôm going to move back into my aunt‚Äôs so I can keep a better eye on them. We said we loved each other and tried to see from each other‚Äôs perspective. My sibling said that it wasn‚Äôt fair I‚Äôd been forced to sacrifice my childhood for my siblings and they‚Äôd try to understand I couldn‚Äôt just turn the ‚Äòmothering‚Äô impulse off; I told them I would try and listen to them more and stop trying to logic out their feelings. I know I can‚Äôt take back what I said, but I tried to make them know I loved them. I don‚Äôt know how I missed this, but all I can do is endeavor to do better in the future.

"AITA for thinking I deserve at least an apology directly to me? So I‚Äôm going to heavily censor parts of this to respect the identity and intimacy of others. 

Basically I‚Äôm in a heavy disagreement with a partner right now. 

A long time ago there was an incident with my partner. 

We had invited someone we both thought would respect knowledge of something deeply personal and intimate about us to be a confidant to it. 

Basically - she (the one we trusted) abused it and used it as an opportunity to hurt my partner. Individually with me she used it as an opportunity to kind of demean what trust I had shown on her, and frequently attempted to invalidate my commitment to my partner. Even went so far as to say she enjoyed hurting my partner and would do so again because she was easily manipulated. She never once apologized or showed remorse for this despite me attempting to fix things between them. 

Needless to say this hurt. Both of us. And we both went out separate ways from this former friend for her behavior. 

Recently this person has reached out again to my partner and explained she was simply in a bad mood. I don‚Äôt even know if a genuine apology was made - but my partner feels everything should be fine now. 

My partner feels since this person explained herself to her that that should be enough for me and everything should be all good now. 

I feel that I think it‚Äôs great she reached out to her and received an explanation that she‚Äôs happy with. But that as someone who was also individually hurt by this persons words and actions, that I deserve an apology as well. 

The way I‚Äôm trying to explain it is if I hurt two different people I would have owed them both an apology and explanation individually for my actions. 

To only apologize for one is essentially the equivalent of saying ‚Äúyou can pass on my apology but they aren‚Äôt worth one themselves to me.‚Äù

Genuinely I‚Äôm hurt by my partners inability to understand that I feel because I was also hurt I cannot accept a vicarious explanation. That I deserve the respect it entails to reach out to me and apologize to me directly before I forgive someone. 

My partner is now calling me mean and saying I never listen because if I did I‚Äôd see that it was all good now. 

Am I the asshole here for thinking I deserve an apology as well? I‚Äôm genuinely happy for her if they can patch things up but I feel it‚Äôs extremely disrespectful to me now from BOTH of them to essentially say I don‚Äôt deserve an explanation or apology as well. That a vicarious one should be good enough. 

If I am I will gladly recognize it and say I‚Äôm sorry to both of them but as someone who had mental health struggles in the part and mistreated people I knew, throughout therapy I would reach out to people I hadn‚Äôt spoken to in years just to apologize for my behavior back then. Never expecting responses or for forgiveness but it was about me respecting the memory at the very least and the roles in my life they once held and feeling if nothing else I needed to have a personal sense of accountability for my own actions. 

So yeah. Help me out. Thanks.",0.36
"AITA For Not Letting My Brother Say The N-Word A bit of context, my brother and I both have a black mom. However, we both look very white and so no one believes us when we say that we are black.  People have actually bullied both of us in the past for calling ourselves black.

A while ago, my brother and I were talking. We were throwing casual insults around, as we normally do when all of a sudden my brother calls me a n\*\*\*\*\*. Now, curse words are normal for us, but as a general rule, we have stayed away from the n-word.

Now, I was very shocked when he said that, and then I started yelling at him. Like, full-on rage mode. I told him all the reasons why he shouldn't say that word. He screamed back, ""Why can't I say it? You're just being oppressive!"" I told him I just didn't want to see him get bullied more.

"AITA for telling my son‚Äôs wife she needed to stop blaming me for all of my sons flaws, and start blaming him if she feels the need to place 100% of the blame on someone? 
My Son and his wife live out of town and they‚Äôre apparently having some issues at home. And while legitimately everyone seems to share this sentiment. I‚Äôm not sure how you can attribute all of his shortcomings to, ‚Äúhow I raised him‚Äù.  


She whines on Facebook over me, ‚Äúnot teaching my son how to cook‚Äù‚Ä¶.but‚Ä¶.cooking is just reading recipes‚Ä¶.anyone can do it. It‚Äôs not my responsibility to send him out into the world as a gourmet chef. 


She tells my son that he was, ‚Äúbabied all his life‚Äù. But me doing his laundry is not the reason he can‚Äôt operate a washer. If she can‚Äôt handle doing something that takes like 2 minutes outside of washing/drying time then that‚Äôs on her. She‚Äôs welcome to show him how. But I‚Äôm not going to accept blame for doing the laundry in my own home. 


She recently started complaining about her, ‚ÄúMIL who decided not to show her precious little angel how to wrap presents‚Äù‚Ä¶..I mean, seriously? She frequents JNMIL. And her posts are just basically blaming me for the 2 of them not being able to handle simple chores without complaining.


It‚Äôs ironic, because she doesn‚Äôt really know how to cook either and they usually have takeout according to my son. Their lack of ‚Äúlife skills‚Äù and her inability to handle 100% of the mental/emotional/domestic labor in a relationship is not on me. Yes, my son watched me do it. But I didn‚Äôt force him to expect the same from his wife. And I‚Äôm certainly not going to apologize for standing by my husband and I guess forcing my children to see what that looks like. 


I responded to tell her that none of it is my fault. And if she feels the need to place 100% of the blame on someone. She should look at my son, or even herself honestly. If she wasn‚Äôt busy whining she might be able to show him. Since she can‚Äôt handle it herself. Now I‚Äôm a, ‚Äúparent who won‚Äôt accept responsibility for their parenting failures‚Äù.

We both have mental health issues and when summer came around she kinda stopped talking to me bc her depression was getting bad. I kind gave up on initiating conversations with her which I think was probably my first mistake. I couldnt really deal with dry tired replies constantly as i was dealing with my own stuff but I feel I shouldve tried harder. She started venting to my other friends about how she thought I hated her or was angry with her. I decided to give her some room because she started crying when I tried to talk to her and I felt weird not being able to comfort her anymore. 

I get a text some time early fall asking what she was doing wrong, if she was pushing others away. I told her it wasnt her fault it was just a bad place for both of us and that our relationship just kinda flopped. She asked me if i still wanted to dress up with her for Halloween and if we were still going to this concert together. I told her that I was feeling less out of sorts about the situation and that she could choose. She chose for us to do both still. 

Fast forward to homecoming a few weeks later and she says she thinks its best if we dont do either of the things. Im a little hurt but I tell her ‚Äúokay thats fine.‚ÄùBecause it really was and I recently learned another friend (15 M) was going to the concert as well. 

The next day she texted me again and said that she wanted to go with me and she as sorry for acting badly that she was just not dealing with losing our friendship well she said it seemed kinda dumb to be separate at a concert but she would understand if i didnt want to go with her. i told her the following:

‚Äúi know it probably isnt the best thing to hear but i dont think we would end up having a fun time if we went together. i hope you still have a good time! i‚Äôm still going and i would be okay if we ended up around eachother yk but i don‚Äôt know if actively seeking to go together is a good idea since its probably going to end up kinda awkward lmao. you don‚Äôt have to feel bad, i‚Äôm alright. i hope you‚Äôre doing okay too. ‚Äú

she got really upset with me and told me she was just trying to make things less awkward. she kinda ranted to me about how my ability to move on astonished her and then we didn‚Äôt talk again other than when she made a comment about how i made her go to the concert alone. (we both were there alone, the other friend couldnt get in) She sounded really hurt. 

tl;dr: relationship with a friend declined, she changed her mind about going to a concert with me and then changed her mind again and was upset when i told her i didnt want to go with her and she ende up having to go alone.

"AITA For complaining about the gifts I get from my MIL? On Mobile, you know the drill.

No TLDR, and it‚Äôs a long post. Apologies for the inconvenience.

So, for some background. I(24F) have been with my boyfriend(27M, let‚Äôs call him Connor) for five years. I love him completely, and I moved countries to live with him three years ago. I get along with his family as well as I can, but it is made difficult by a language barrier that I am still working to overcome.

Connor‚Äôs parents are usually very generous towards him, and also to his siblings. His dad will often just palm off ‚Ç¨50 when he‚Äôs around. (He has never done this to me, only to Connor and his other siblings, plus the partners of the other siblings.) I find it overly generous and have told Connor to refuse it in the past, as we don‚Äôt need the extra money and I don‚Äôt like to feel like I owe people anything. 

Last year, a week before my birthday, Connor said that his mother wanted to know what I would like for my gift that year. I already had a small list set up just in case people asked, with items all under ‚Ç¨30 in value. Things like a particular soap, or a few pairs of socks. I made sure that they were easy to find, because I hate being a bother to people. 

Come the day of my birthday, Connor‚Äôs parents show up and give me my gift- a cheap bottle of perfume, not one I had asked for as I‚Äôm particular about which perfumes I use so I buy them for myself. I wasn‚Äôt really upset, I just thanked them and let it go, and I had a great birthday. 

The problem is that this year, my birthday is coming up in about two weeks, and Connor has told me what his parents plan on giving me. 

We are in the process of installing new wiring in our house so that we can fit solar panels. This has included us purchasing an induction stove for the kitchen, to replace the gas stove. And his parents told Connor that if he needs new pots and pans, then I will get that for my birthday. 

My problem is that if they can get me something useful that I would appreciate but is also VERY expensive (in my opinion), when Connor also needs it, why couldn‚Äôt they have gotten me something that I asked for that was cheap last year?",0.69

"AITA For Expecting Money Back? So I was to be a groomsman for my close friends wedding, scheduled for Halloween of 2020. In anticipation I went out to the agreed upon suit rental store, got fitted, paid $164 for the rental, and waited for the day of the wedding. Then a little something called Covid-19 ruined that plan entirely, and the wedding was postponed. 

Halloween 2021 comes around, and this time it's officially been cancelled and the groom tells us we should probably just get a refund for the suit. I return to the suit rental place for the refund and am informed that the groom hadn't cancelled the suit rentals before they were delivered to the store. So instead of receiving the entire $164 back they offered a refund of $104.

"AITA for telling my girlfriend she might want to think about a less stressful job? I know the title sounds kinda bad but I really want to know if I‚Äôm the asshole here. My (22m) girlfriend (26f) has been a Registered Nurse for about a year and a half. She did 4-5 months in a hospital where she said she couldn‚Äôt stand the stress. She left that job and started at the prison I work at, where we met. Note: Prison nursing is extremely easy. Even she used to tell me how easy and boring the job was. Eventually she left that job after 6-8 months and began at another hospital in an ICU. 

Since then it‚Äôs been hell. She constantly complains about the stress. She‚Äôs always in a bad mood, never wants to leave the house besides work, is constantly lashing out, and has been showing a lot of signs of anxiety and depression that are completely out of character for her usual behavior. Her relationship with her daughter isn‚Äôt the same, and neither is ours. Today she called me early in the morning, in a very bad mood telling me how she couldn‚Äôt handle the stress of the job and she wants to quit and hates it overall. I tried to calm her down and be optimistic but it didn‚Äôt really work. After she got off work, I talked to her again. I explained that she seems to be very negatively effected by this job and she might want to consider nursing in a less stressful field, like a rehab center or something that isn‚Äôt as demanding as a hospital. 

I explained that she has been lashing out at others and that she constantly says she can‚Äôt stand the job.  I also explained to her that in my 3.5+ years in corrections I‚Äôve learned that these kind of jobs aren‚Äôt for everyone and some people don‚Äôt handle the stress.  Nursing and first responder jobs are extremely mentally draining and they definitely do a number on your mental health. No job is worth being miserable in your personal life over, and it‚Äôs effecting her relationships and mental health. I offered to help her find a new job if she wants to do that, and explained that I support her no matter what she decides to do. She immediately got defensive and lashed out at me, told me she doesn‚Äôt want to talk to me, and that I‚Äôm ‚Äúinsulting her.‚Äù I told her I‚Äôd give her some time and we‚Äôd talk later in the day. 

So Reddit am I the asshole for suggesting that she find a less stressful job?

"AITA for being angry at my SO for not taking our kid to a party with my in-laws because his other children are coming? My SO and I have been together for over a decade, I‚Äôve always known he has two children from a previous marriage and I‚Äôm totally ok with it. This year we had a kid of our own, and his parents are really stoked about it, so when he mentioned that there would be a party at his parents‚Äô I told him to go with our kid so they could see him. He told me he couldn‚Äôt because his other children are coming to the party and they haven‚Äôt met ours yet (although they do know about him). I got totally mad because since our kid was born he‚Äôs been avoiding to present him to his siblings despite the fact that his younger kid was really excited about having a brother. I know he has been avoiding it because he‚Äôs older kid is super jealous, and he doesn‚Äôt want to hurt his feelings. However, I told him that all three kids are the same and should be allowed to go to their grandparents‚Äô and that he is being unfair by not taking our kid to the party just because his other children will be there. He says I‚Äôm being pushy and that he won‚Äôt push his older kid to meet ours if he doesn‚Äôt want to. I think he is wrong since even if it‚Äôs hard on his son, it is something that has to happen as he cannot ban my kid from every event where his other children are. So that‚Äôs the story!

UPDATE: I‚Äôm not going because he has never introduced me to his kids because he thinks it will upset them, I didn‚Äôt mention it because I stopped caring a long time ago because I know it‚Äôs a lost cause. However, I won‚Äôt allow that kind of shit for my kid.",0.59
"AITA for cautioning my friend about her ""situationship"" My (22F) friend (22F) recently told me about the new dynamic she and her ex (M23) have. And it concerned me A LOT. I'm aware it's none of my buisness and I only told her my opinion once, beyond that, I don't even want to interfere because it's all so extremely immature. 

So, basically, the two of them started dating in college for almost an year and broke up over summer when covid happened (he broke up because he thought she was toxic). I don't think she's toxic, just really immature. But basically ever since they went back (November 2020) they've been ""hanging out"" again. They don't have sex or anything but just spend wayyyy too much time together.

The guy has made it very clear that he has no intentions of continuing the relationship once college is over and she is ... well, just living in the moment. She says she will deal with it when it comes, but it's almost 2.5 years away! 
They're also both really weird about dating other people (neither are actually doing that) but if someone else flirts w one of them, suddenly the other will flip out. There's lots of other juvenile behaviour, basically things she has been doing since she was 16 (we all did tbh, just that everyone else grew up).
Both of them claim to be ""in love"" or atleast she does. And somehow she says whatever they have is extremely healthy.

Hearing it all out gave me flashbacks of our younger selves. I've emotionally distanced myself from her over this last year (too immature to handle especially with the pandemic and how careless she was) and I don't provide any advice unless asked but this time I felt I absolutely had to say something. So I told her she's only prolonging the pain that she will feel when they eventually break up, what she's doing is unhealthy asf almost toxic and this whole thing is really immature. 

The other friend who was with us interrupted me multiple times when I told her this because he thought I was being too harsh. I didn't feel so but now I'm a little guilty.

"AITA for talking badly about a subpar former coworker? For the past year, I had to deal with a really bad coworker. He didn‚Äôt do the job well, treated everyone with disrespect and was very self-centered. He finally got let go about 2 months ago and everything has been great since then. 

He worked in sales so you would think that people would return and ask for him but that was rarely the case. We were discussing it today and I said that I had heard of about 5 return guests of his in the past year. It didn‚Äôt seem very often to me, and that‚Äôs not necessarily a bad thing or indicative of his entire time there but it definitely makes you consider their work ethic. We moved on from the topic at hand. 

My manager called me into the office an hour later and said that he heard I was badmouthing the former employee. I apologized and said that I was just stating an observation. He said that it was nobody‚Äôs place to discuss. I find it odd that my manager felt so strong about it when he hated this employee. I apologized and my manager said it was okay as he agreed, but others are now saying that me and the other three in the room are bullies. I think bullies is a strong term to describe the topic but I feel bad about vocalizing my observations. It doesn‚Äôt really have any relevance now so maybe we should‚Äôve moved on.

"AITA for not wanting to cook meat for my girlfriend after becoming a vegetarian? Hi everyone. I (27F) have been vegetarian for a few weeks now- trying it out for health and environmental reasons, and it's been going well. Until today, my partner, ""T"" (29F) was supportive about my new diet. We talked about it in the beginning and I assured her I wasn't trying to make her vegetarian, but I would try cooking vegetarian meals for us. I've made several meals for us so far and she thought they were delicious. She hasn't cooked anything for us yet though.

For context, T is a great cook, but every dinner she has made had some form of meat in it. That's how I used to cook too, so I am having to look up recipes/learn new ways of cooking now. We alternated making dinner a few times a week in the past, until I started being vegetarian.

This afternoon we went to Trader Joe's together, and things went downhill. I asked if we could get veggie broth instead of chicken, and she kind of shut down, saying nothing when I put it in the cart. She also seemed annoyed at me for picking veggie meal options (tofu, etc). I didn't bat an eye when she put sausages, lunch meat etc in the cart for herself.

When we got in the car, I asked T what was wrong and she basically ranted at me. She said that it wasn't fair that she has to eat vegetarian meals that I make now, and that I would expect her to cook vegetarian from now on. Even though I told her she didn't have to cook for me. She said that cooking was her love language, but now she doesn't know what to make for me, and it feels one-sided because she has to cater to me. 

She also kept asking me ""well what if I wanted you to make me a meat dinner for a special occasion?"" I said I didn't know, because I hadn't thought of that scenario. Basically she is upset that I ""didn't think about her at all"" with my new diet, and is sad that now  I won't eat the old meals she made for us. 

I'm kind of at a loss of what to say. I feel bad that I'm hurting her, but I also don't want to stop being a vegetarian. The only thing I could say was that I didn't expect her to cook special for me, and it was fine if we eat separate if I'm not cooking. But I am disappointed that T isn't open to trying to make at least one vegetarian meal for us.

"AITA for ‚Äúouting‚Äù my sister to her kids? Her kids were having a sleepover. We‚Äôve always had this picture of my family up from when we were really young, and this was the FIRST time her kids ever asked about it. She has also seen the picture and never commented on it. They asked who she was in the picture.

My sister started transitioning in high school so I don‚Äôt really think of her as ‚Äútrans.‚Äù Like I know she wasn‚Äôt always a woman but old pictures of her are just pictures of her to me. And I sort of assume people know and it‚Äôs not a big dark secret.

Naturally, I responded honestly. I told them that was their mom, her daughter said she looked like a boy, and I said she was. I tried to explain that she was a boy but now she‚Äôs not and her son thought it was funny, but it made her daughter really upset. I was surprised she kept it from them.

It didn‚Äôt come up again after that, her and her husband picked the kids up eventually and neither kid seemed upset about it. Overall it was a pretty good sleepover.

A few hours later, I have her husband on the phone asking what I said and calling me ‚Äúinsane.‚Äù He said my sister is ‚Äúdistraught.‚Äù He was saying I outed her and how cruel that was, but kids are pure. Outing means nothing to them because you can teach them empathy and understanding. There‚Äôs nothing to be afraid of, being outed to a kid.

Still I did out her, which I apologized for. I eventually got her on the phone and she said she‚Äôs really upset with me but she understands I didn‚Äôt mean to cause any harm. I asked her if she was ever planning to tell her kids and she said she wasn‚Äôt sure. I was SHOCKED at that. My sister isn‚Äôt typically a dishonest person. AT ALL. Both kids even know they‚Äôre adopted. I told her I did her kids a favour, which I believe, and then she said I‚Äôm never sorry about anything.

I think outing is horrible, but in this situation, was it justified? My husband also agrees it‚Äôs the kind of lie that would have left her children distrustful of her in the future.

UPDATE: Okay, I'm in the wrong. The few people agreeing with me have been majority extremely rude and transphobic to my sister. I'll be apologizing to her. Please understand I did not want to make this a place where transphobes could spout rhetoric.",0.31

We eventually got him to try out wrestling and ballet to help him feel better about himself and get him more fit ( which I wish we never did) . He seemed happier for a time and he really slimmed down. By the time he was 16 he'd dropped wrestling to focus on on ballet, but thinks only got bad from there..

We thought he'd been doing better, but he started getting worse and he was putting alot of pressure on himself.  We started noticing irregular eating habits , our youngest  caught him hiding food a. few times and his then  boyfriend told us how he never saw Jakob eating. He was officially diagnosed with anorexia a few weeks before his 17th birthday and then it got really bad because he wouldn't accept help.

WIBTA if I get everyone a Christmas gift instead of just my secret Santa? So for the last 4 years or so we have done secret Santa between my sister/her husband and my parents. One gift per secret Santa and thats it. Every single year everyone says they will only get whoever they got for secret Santa. Yet every year my parents always get us something on top of their secret Santa and my sister does the same. Basically everyone breaks the rule except me and secret Santa only ever means get one person something extra. I feel like I always look like a jackass. This year I told myself I wouldn't play it anymore. When I told my family they insisted we had to play it this year because my sister is in a tough spot financially so she will for sure not be able to do it again. I know my parents will probably still break the rule and honestly I kinda wanna get everyone something anyways because I'm doing well and because I'm salty they all do it to me. I know my sister will probably feel bad but she's done it to me for years I also think I might be kicking while she's down.

"WIBTA if I bought life insurance without my husband knowing? Not as bad as it sounds, I hope. 

My husband (26M) and I (25F) just got married this past September. We also own a house and have 3 dogs together. Earlier this year he got Covid and almost died. He was put into a medically induced coma and was on a ventilator. It was terrifying, but he doesn‚Äôt remember it because he was in the coma. It made us both think about a lot but one thing that has not left my mind since is life insurance.

When my husband (boyfriend at the time so we had all separate bills) was in the hospital, I paid his bills (car, health/dental, pay by plate, etc.) and realized that if he had died I would be really fucked. I would probably end up in financial ruin. I don‚Äôt want that to happen to me of course, but I really do not want that to happen to him. 

I‚Äôve brought it up to him and explained how I want to get life insurance policies on both of us now that we are married in case something happens. I told him about how it‚Äôs cheaper when you start young and would be really important to have if we decide to have a child. He thinks it‚Äôs too early and we‚Äôre too young. He thinks it will jinx us. I reminded him about earlier this year and even with everything that happened, he doesn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs necessary. I told him I could just buy it on myself and pay for it so he would have something if I died but he really doesn‚Äôt like that either.

"WIBTA if I keep my boss's secrets Throwaway account

My boss and I became close after working together for years. My boss is a bad person, but they're kind to me and simple time together has caused us to be close. I've learned many horrible things they've done, and have even witnessed a few. Some examples include: misuse of organizational funds, consensual sex at the office multiple times, intimidation/blackmail, tormenting employees until they quit because its faster than dealing with unions, and lying under oath to avoid harassment charges (non sexual) which led to innocent people getting fired - to name a few. For the sake of self preservation I have kept these things to myself. I'm not proud of it, but I'm not throwing my career away out of principle especially after seeing the shit they've gotten away with in the past. I've also seen what has befallen those who try to go against them and failed - it's ugly. No joke, it sometimes feels like a mafia movie but with an office setting.

So fast forward, I'm getting a new job soon, and have been contemplating turning my soon-to-be-former-boss in to both company and/or legal authorities once they no longer have direct power over my career. But after thinking about it, I'm leaning towards not turning them in. Partly because I fear reprisal, partly because my evidence is not strong since they're extremely careful, partly because I am skeptical that the legal system or corporate system can be relied on to do anything useful after the shit I've seen them get away with, and partly because I will lose a valuable ally. I'd never need this, but to illustrate my point, having earned their trust, I honestly believe my boss would help me bury a body no questions asked.

"AITA for not wanting to celebrate SIL birthday the day after our wedding First time poster. Sorry for formatting/spelling/grammar I‚Äôm on my phone. You do not have my consent to post this anywhere else.

I (30F) am getting married next weekend to my Fianc√© H (35M). In my background our weddings span a couple days so we will have events from Thursday to Saturday night. It is in my hometown and we are both flying in early to help with preparations. This has been a crazy stressful time but I am so excited.

My FSIL (30‚ÄôsF) and FMIL and FFIL all live in another city and are coming in for the wedding. Well FSIL‚Äôs birthday is the Sunday after the wedding. She has contacted H and asked what are plans are. He is not from the same background as me so his answer was ‚Äúoh I don‚Äôt know‚Äù. She then requested we both be with her and his family to celebrate her birthday. 

I do not want to for a couple reasons. 1. I want time to stay in bed and be a couple. 2. It will have been a hectic week and I‚Äôm looking forward to relaxing just the two of us. 3. I don‚Äôt really want to go the day after our wedding and celebrate her birthday because in my head it‚Äôs still OUR weekend to focus on us. 

He doesn‚Äôt want to upset her, and is feeling guilted into it. So AITA for saying no and it causing an argument between us and possibly upsetting his sister when he (or I) tell her no?

P.S. I am posting this for a friend to back her up because I think NTA. I will try to answer any questions that come up.",0.2
"AITA for asking my BF not to order seafood when we go out because I‚Äôm allergic? I (28 F) became allergic to seafood a few years ago, just the smell triggers my allergy. My BF (28 M) loves seafood and he avoids eating it since I told him that I would like to avoid a trip to the hospital. We‚Äôve been together for a year and a half, and living together for a good 9 months. He constantly states how much he misses eating seafood, and even though I feel bad, is something out of my hands.

Today I sent him a spanish restaurant that I wanted to go to, so it has paella and a few other seafood things in their menu, his response was, are you seriously asking me yo go a restaurant that has all the things I love and can‚Äôt eat? And honestly I didn‚Äôt see it like that, I just wanted to have some sangria and watch the Flamenco show. I told him I was sorry, and that is fine we don‚Äôt have to go.

I felt bad after the interaction and against my better judgement, I went and got him stuff to make some salmon (just standing in the fish counter caused me to break out in hives) the guy wrapped it a few times and walked me yo the register so I wouldn‚Äôt have to touch it. They double bagged it and I grabbed some potatoes, garlic butter and a disposable pan. I get home really excited and told him I would stay at work during lunch so he can make some salmon, he just needs to open the windows and clean the kitchen with bleach once he is done. 

His response was not what I was hoping for and he said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not doing all that‚Äù, I told him I was just trying to do something nice, since I know its not easy to not eat some of his favorite food because of me. He said just to throw it away, since he was not cooking it.

AITA for putting him in a weird position?

EDIT: the restaurant is outdoors, so as long as the hot food is not in my face, I should be fine. Even McDonalds serves fish. If I never went to a place because they serve seafood, I would not go out. You just make sure not more than 25% of the menu is seafood. I‚Äôve successfully done this for 5+ years, and only had a reaction on group tables when people I‚Äôm not close to ordered seafood, and I was too embarrassed to stop them. I just pop an antihistamine and hope for the best. 

He enjoys cooking, and mentioned on our first date and showed me pictures of his best dish, which is salmon. People clean after cooking anyways. 

Thanks for the different point of views, I didn‚Äôt think it would be a chore, since he has to make lunch anyways, I just thought that it would be a nice treat.",0.56
"AITA: My Dad the asshole for not wanting to pay for bro's fiancee's dinner everytime? My (29M) parents are super conservative and have allowed for my brother (31M) and his fiancee (28F) to live in the house. I will admit that her life was more challenging and rough than me and my brother growing up. But anyways, they want to get married, but my  parents will not let them until they buy their own place and move in there. Until then, they have to sleep in separate bedrooms. 

In order to help them out, both of my retired parents do not charge rent or utilities so they can buy a place in full. My mom was smart with planning her retirement and has more of an income than my dad's  gov retirement stipend. That being said, they are not rich by any means. They have their expenses that keep them humble.

Since my brother's fiancee moved in, my parents have been spending more money on feeding her then they have truly wanted. Whenever my bro goes to pickup food for my parents, he'll use the cash given to him to get his fiancee food too. Originally, my parents were just wanting to pay for him only and themselves like before she moved in. My mother doesn't mind most of the time. However, my dad gets annoyed with it. (his retirement is less than my moms) He has expressed to me that he's okay with paying for her if we all go out to eat at a sitdown restaurant(family dinner nights, birthdays, etc.), but he didn't sign-up to have to pay for her everytime one of us is given cash to pay for our dinner in return for picking up his/theirs. So, I explained this to my brother and he said, ""Well dads an asshole with his greed and should pay for her too!"" I almost lost it on my brother. He clearly doesn't see all the things my father already does by allowing her to live in the house cost free. So reddit, am I an asshole for agreeing with my dad? Or is my bro?",0.15

"WIBTA if I turned in a classmate for plagiarism? I (16F) am a high school sophomore who is taking all honors classes. There is this one kid, we'll call him John, who is in my honors English class. John has a disability of some sort and a pretty severe speech impediment. He is also failing English class and barely turns in any assignments and when he does, they are full of grammatical errors and borderline incomprehensible. I know this because our English teacher isn't exactly one for discreet reminders to submit work.  Recently, we were asked to submit 10-15 sentence paragraphs on a class discussion board. I submitted mine without much thought, and went back to check and noticed that John had submitted his (a day late). I wasn't interested in reading his paragraph so I was scrolling past it when a sentence caught my eye. He had used the exact same (very distinct) phrase that I had used in mine. I reread over it and realized that he was an exact reiteration of my paragraph, with some sentences being almost exactly the same.   

Now here comes the problem, I'm not sure if I should report him or not. His plagiarized version of my paragraph was full-on uncapitalized letters, comma splice errors, and basic spelling mistakes. Because of this, he'll probably get a bad grade on the assignment anyway. Additionally, to my knowledge, this may be the first assignment he's submitted all semester. John clearly shouldn't be in honors English, and I pity him for this. My school also takes plagiarism EXTREMELY seriously. I guess I also emphasize with him for his speech impediment because my younger sister has a severe speech impediment so I have more of an understanding of how difficult it is. On the other hand, I think it's important for there to be a consequence so that he doesn't do this in the future and get into more trouble. I honestly have no idea what to do.

"AITA for constantly mentioning my crush to my best friend? Today at school our class went on a field trip to a local lake and outdoor center. It was mostly just a boring walk around a lake and then we just went indoors and learned some boring lessons about animals and stuff like that. I was mostly just looking forward to the trip because I wanted to use it as an opportunity to finally ask out this girl that I've been crushing on since last year in the sixth grade. Her name is Ally and I wanted to get a moment alone with her to ask her out.

I couldn't really get my moment with her and I spend most of the field trip by the side of one of my best friends, Zeke. I was mentioning Ally a lot to Zeke on the trip and I was just trying to get him to give me advice on how to ask her out. He was telling me that I needed to just ask her. We reached a point when we were in the gift shop and I mentioned Ally again. That's when Zeke just blew up and shouted at me ""JUST FUCKING ASK HER ALREADY! GOD!"" Then he stormed off and ignored me for the rest of the trip.

He wouldn't sit by me on the bus and then when we got back to school, we were let loose on the playground for the rest of the day. I was chasing Zeke around trying to talk to him, but he kept avoiding me and was running away from me. Another friend, Mark, intervened and tried to figure out what was going on. This forced me to reveal my crush on Ally to Mark, but he couldn't really do much for me. All I know is Zeke is pissed off at me and I don't know what I did wrong.",0.91
"AITA for ignoring my friends because they forgot about my birthday? I'm the type of person who remembers my friends' birthday. And if they're really special to me, I even prepare surprises for them. I don't expect people to do the same thing to me, but I won't lie that I wish they would at least remember my birthday and say their wishes.

So, it's my birthday a few days ago. None of my friends - not even my best friend - greeted me. At first, I thought they were just playing a prank, and they would greet me at the last minute. But two days later, none of them greeted me. I was upset. This reminded me of what happened last year, but last year, I didn't mind it because we're in the middle of pandemic and I decided to stay away from soc media. But this time, it was different because I literally told them about it two weeks ago when we met up on another friend's birthday.

Because I was so upset, I ignored them for now. I kept their message on reading. Two of them live in the neighborhood. I refused to hang out with them when they invited me last night. I believe this is when they realized I'm upset, so they went to my home and asked what's going on. I finally told them about them forgetting about my birthday. But rather than being apologetic, they became defensive, saying I'm ""throwing a fit"" about something trivial. They even claimed that one of our friends literally died from covid four months ago, and all I'm thinking is about my birthday when we should still be mourning over his loss.

"AITA for Laughing at my Coworker‚Äôs KPOP Fantasies? A bit of a pretext: the girl in question is like 29yrs old, lives in US and is a coworker of mine.

We always hang out at lunch, talk about boring stuff like what we did over the weekend, how we‚Äôre doing, etc. One thing I learned over the past few weeks is that she‚Äôs really into KPOP. LIKE SUPER INTO IT. Her phone background picture is her favorite kpop boyband, she has a folder containing images and videos of the band, she goes to all their concerts, you know‚Ä¶ the typical obsessive die hard KPOP fan.

Anyway, we were discussing what makes them so appealing and she nonchalantly said their looks and their music which I guess is an acceptable answer. Her favorite band by the way is a group called GOT7. There are many members in that group and I don‚Äôt know any of their names, but let‚Äôs say her favorite member is ‚ÄúBob‚Äù from GOT7. 

During one of our lunches, she says, ‚ÄúI will marry Bob someday‚Äù. I thought it was a joke and just bursted out laughing. I looked at her and she didn‚Äôt seem too happy about me laughing. So then I calmed down quickly and asked her if she was serious. She nodded and quietly muttered, ‚Äúyes‚Äù. At this point, I felt bad for laughing but thought to my head, ‚Äúwtf she‚Äôs a lunatic‚Äù. That boy band is in Korea, probably has 100M female fans globally and she‚Äôs too old to have this sort of hopium.

Anyway, she looked visibly uncomfortable throughout the rest of lunch and she never asked me out to lunch anymore let alone come to talk to me during work.

"AITA for meeting up with a guy behind my crushes back, then lying? Okay the title sounds bad, but hear me out. First time poster. 

So I've (24f) had a thing for let's call him Levi(29m) for over a year, i will go as far to say i am head over heels in love with him. Levi knows, he know. I will do anything for him . But we never have gotten together, no real reason, he says he love me & We did everything couples do. 

 I had gone out with my friend, he was with his dad. My friend ditched me after her bf finished work, a mutual friend invited me to join them so i wasn't on my own, when they were leaving we stayed behind aa we had something to talk about privately isn't relevant). Me and levi began walking up to the pub that we perfer and i snapped at him for a comment he always makes ""your just a typical woman"" basically said one doesn't stay loyal to a man for a year when he keeps refusing to make me his gf. He made a joke about me finally getting a back bone and then told me to come to pub. 
He was all over me, putting his jacket around me because I was cold, kissing me, hand on my thighs & keeping me super close. A friend Annie (18f) messaged me about coming out, seeing if I was, Levi said let her come out, even though i don't trust her. Annie loves attention from older men, but she was into Levi friend. she had said she didnt like levi at all. We end up talking and walking back to his . He said ""as much as I love you, i won't ever be with you how you want, i can't trust you not to hurt me"" which stung as it is him comparing me to his ex.  ""but we can stay like this "" and i spent the night with him.

A week later i got covid from work, i was in isolation but constant contact with Levi, but twi day after isolating i Messaged him and silence for 3 weeks almost, but Annie screen shot all my snapchat stuff, i called her out and got ""new phone"" 
She was pushing me to meet a guy who i knew through a friend, he wanted to take me to a good curry house as i adore spicy food.  I thought what's the harm, wasn't a date, I posted a photo on snapchat and Annie asked ""is that your boyfriend?""
Well she knows i love levi, but i had a idea , say yes ahd see if she tells anyone, so i lied and said yes. No reply 20 minutes later levi messaged me asking ""if I was alive"" I replied yes I was, every seemed ok.
Next morning i get a message ""so is that boy your boyfriend?""
""not really, he took me out for curry""


Hell broke loose. Levi lost it, everything between us went sour and he is claiming i betrayed him then lied to him and broke his heart, because of what i told Annie, who told him. Mind you i showed him the message i sent to my best friend saying ""i don't trust Annie think im gonna lie to her about this friend im out with and see what happens"" proving i was lying to her. But there both acting like im the asshole and im getting shit about it and he saying i hurt him badly which makes me feel so guilty so I'm here for impartial thoughts reddit am i the asshole?


Tiny edit - feel this is relevant - when I was out having curry and levi messaged, he also asked if we could talk, i said i was busy can it wait.

He said sure, can you meet me at the usual place tomorrow, i said sure, it was weird as he never ask to talk in person.
 I hadn't left to meet him when he messaged me the next day as i was feeding friends cats then going. Well that evening ny friend took me over to get my stuff back and give him back his necklace I was wearing and had been for over a year. When i gave it back i asked him what he was going to tell me ""well i was going to ask you to be with me properly as my girlfriend... It why i was quiet, looking after nan and thinking if i was ready to be with you, because i love you, but i guess you don't love me like you claimed"" then slammed the door in my face which is adding to me think is he right,  did i betray him and was I just impatient....

"AITA for referring to an ex-friend of mine as a backstabbing bastard? A little context here.

When I (M24) was 17, I was kicked out of my home 2 months before the end of my senior year, and 3 months before my 18th birthday. This resulted with me being homeless for those three months, and for a few months after I turned 18 too. Thankfully, an (at the time) friend, ""Cole"" let me stay with him, crashing on his couch until I finished high school, then once I graduated I was able to find another place to stay.

After graduation I was able to move into a temporary housing solution. For my birthday I was gifted a phone, and I informed the friends who had helped me of this, providing them with my number in case they wanted to keep contact.

About a month after this, I received a call from Cole, asking how I was doing. I informed him I was doing well, and asked him how he was. Instead of replying, he accused me of stealing his mother's wedding ring (WHAT?) and demanded it back.

Obviously, I didn't have it. While staying with him and his family, I'd done my best to stay out of their way and pay back their kindness. I cooked, I cleaned, I even worked odd jobs to try and pay what rent I could, even though it wasn't asked of me. To even consider stealing from them was unthinkable, as it would not only ruin my living situation, but my relationship with them and my friend.

Fast forward a few years, and I've since moved out of state and moved back home again. I was hanging out with another friend, ""John"", and his girlfriend, catching up and generally having a good time. John mentioned that he'd gotten a call from Cole recently, who made a very poorly disguised attempt to ask after me (it's been six years by this point) and again accuse me of stealing his mother's wedding ring. John told Cole that under no circumstances would he even consider that I'd stolen the ring, as I had visited John and his family multiple times and never once stolen from them, even when money was left out in the open.

Upon hearing that Cole was still spinning his web of lies about me, I became angry. I said that he'd probably stolen it himself and pawned it for weed, and being the backstabbing, pathologically lying bastard that he is, tried to pin the blame on me. John's girlfriend became upset at this, saying that I had no proof of this, and that if that's how I talk about people who helped me when I was homeless, then she didn't want anything to do with me.

John was understanding, but his girlfriend is giving him the cold shoulder because he still associates with me. I feel like an asshole because this vendetta that Cole has with me is entirely ridiculous, but apparently some people believe him anyways.

So Reddit. AITA?

**EDIT**: A lot of you have asked some good questions, and I feel that the answers should be gathered in one place instead of scattered in the comments. So here they are:

\- I don't know if John's GF has any connection to Cole. 

\- I called Cole a pathological liar based on previous interactions with him. Along with many, smaller things, some notable things he'd lied about are :

>Enlisting in the Marines at freshman year  
>  
>Being a Captain in the Marines (Junior year)  
>  
>Hacking Microsoft's servers  
>  
>Having designed and coded an autonomous AI  
>  
>Receiving a Cease and Desist from Microsoft  
>  
>Being SUED by Microsoft (he typed up a fake summons for this)  
>  
>Having a girlfriend in Louisiana (he was using pictures of a model from Instagram)  
>  
>Being a member of Anonymous (XD)

\- Cole smoked weed. Like, a LOT. He tried to grow weed using a desk lamp with a UV bulb in his bedroom, so he, and I quote, ""wouldn't have to buy from \[his\] dealer anymore"", and would often show up high to school or smoke throughout the day.

\- Cole's mother believed him 100% that I stole her ring. My first job back home was about a year after this happened, which is also when I tried to confront him directly and was threatened at gunpoint.

\- According to John, this is not the first time Cole has tried to interact with him and talk about the missing ring. He even visited John's house himself, asking if maybe I hid it over there to avoid it being found.",0.25

"AITA for getting mad at my wife for... I (41M) am together now for 6 years with my wife (41F not married). Her daughter recently turned 11.
She often asks for social media acces since she was 8-9. My gf let her have Tik-Tok which led to numerous deletions of her account by Tik-Tok cause she's too young. The drama that came from that was not nice, to say the least. 

She got Snapchat, Instagram got postponed for a later age but when I discussed this with my wife Facebook was also talked about and we agreed upon legal age, which is 13 here.

Yesterday I left for the weekend to visit my dad (71). Whilst there, my father receives a FB friend request of our girl (I'm plusparent, not real dad, real dad is a narcist, pervert asshole)

I call my wife & I get this vague explanation. Wanted to wait to tell me when I got home today. Told her girl not to send me request cause she knew I would be irritated.
Things haven't been going all that well with my gf so will also play a part.

I got home, and slept a while. When the daughter was sleeping I ask how this FB account got created. Daughter had made an account with her grand mother  months ago behind our backs, but was not actively used, yesterday afternoon my wife set this account up together with the daughter. Despite being nothing near tech savvy my wife claims she'll have full insight due to some setting.

I got irritated but didn't raise my voice. She gets upset with me that it's just Facebook & all the kids in school use FB. Not a big deal. I tell her that it's not just about the account but her deciding this while I was away and I had no say in this whatsoever. I felt sidestepped and for me tbh, I don't want my 11y plus daughter inside this shitty FB world. The Social Dilemma comes to mind, the recent FB whistleblower as well...

So when my got upset & lost my patience, we had an argument, another one, putting even more pressure on us both. I left and went into another room to listen to music & calm down. My wife was clearly superstressed and continued her serie.

Am I making too big a deal of this?

"AITA for being indifferent about my brother's baby? *Edit: I house and dog-sat for my brother while they were in the hospital, and I have congratulated them and everything. I didn't mean for it to seem like I just haven't acknowledged the baby at all, so that's my bad. 

First time poster so I'm sorry if it's long.

TLDR: brother had baby, I'm pretty indifferent, family is guilting me for not being supportive enough 

Context: I'm the youngest of three, with my brother being the oldest and favorite of my mom. I have a lot of personal issues with my family, (specifically my mother) and everyone's lack of boundaries- I have really bad anxiety but I've been living on my own for a little over a year and have been getting better about recognizing my limits mentally/socially, and my family is very draining. 

My brother and his wife had their first kid on Halloween, with this being my mom's first grandkid. It was a hard pregnancy and she had to be induced a month early but both baby and her are doing well now. I'm glad everyone's healthy and such, but I feel no desire/urgency to meet the baby. I'm not a big fan of kids and pregnancy in general, but I think people assume that it being my brother's kid will override that. (I'm not mean or bad with kids, I just don't care for them) I had assumed that since there were potential health risks with the pregnancy, it would be a while before they would be introducing anyone. 

Well, this past Sunday they brought the baby to meet my sister and our grandma for the first time, with my mom present as well. I had just gotten my flu shot earlier that week (you're supposed to wait two weeks before seeing newborns) and have had some changes at work and home that I've been really stressed about so I didn't go. I will say that IATA for not messaging beforehand to say I wouldn't be there, so I do take responsibility for that. 

I got a text from my mom Sunday evening saying she was disappointed I couldn't be there for such an ""important event in all of our lives,"" which sounds typical for the kind of dramatic guilt-trip she normally does. (I lost track of how many times one of us kids ""ruined Christmas"" growing up) But then I also got an email from my grandma today where she expressed how ""ashamed"" she is at my lack of excitement for my brother's new baby, and how I'm hurting his feelings by not being interested in their kid, especially since they're so""accepting of my life choices."" 

I love my brother and his little budding family and I wish them the best, I just don't feel like the need to be there the whole way.

"WIBTA if i confronted my partner‚Äôs father regarding his comments about me? Context: I, Male 22, and my GF, Female 21 are both students. We live in the same city, and both my parents and her parents know of our soon to be 6 month long relationship.

My parents absolutely love my girlfriend. They invite her over, always send food and gifts for the both of us on special occasions, and my mother especially likes to keep in touch with her from time to time. 

Her parents however have a problem with me, and, spoiler alert, it‚Äôs not my behaviour or my social status, as they told my GF that I‚Äôm a good person. Her father, particularly, has been making very offensive jokes about my physical apperance, which is not actually a bad one. I‚Äôm not handsome, but I‚Äôm not ugly either. 

He usually makes fun of me through the phone when talking with my GF, telling her things like ‚Äúand how does it feel to kiss the frog?‚Äù, ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs the hunchback doing?‚Äù, ‚ÄúOh, so your boyfriend reads. Maybe that‚Äôs why his eyes are so big and he wears glasses.‚Äù, ‚ÄúYou could have found a much better one.‚Äù etc.

I have quite some trauma from my childhood, as I was bullied for wearing glasses, I was skinny shamed, and I also had people bully me for my excessive chest hair. And these little ‚Äújokes‚Äù irritate me more by the day. I understand that he does not like me, but at least he could have the human decency of not being fake nice to me when we do interact. 

Two months ago, he even had the audacity to tell my girlfriend that ‚Äúshe should consider breaking up with me, since no matter how smart I am or how nicely I treat her, my physical appearance will never truly satisfy her.‚Äù

So, considering all these things, and the fact that my GF tried telling him to stop yet he never did, WITA if I confronted him as well next time I have the chance?",0.31
"WIBTA if I didn't get my daughter the color car she wanted? My daughter is currently a learner driver, and for her 1st car, she initially stated that she wanted a Miata or a Toyota 86. However, I nixed these choices, as they are too expensive (we live in Australia). She backed down and said she wanted a black Japanese Sedan. While the Japanese sedan part is OK, I don't want to get her a black car. This is because I associate black cars with drug dealers. However, my daughter wants a black car because she LOVES Knight Rider, and KITT is a black car. When I stated my reasons, she got annoyed with me, stating that she had been trying to compromise and that if she has to settle for a more modest model of car, she wants to at least choose the color. 

I feel as though I'm the arsehole, as my daughter was trying to suggest a more reasonable model of car, and she wants to at least choose the color. However, I'll be paying most of the price for it with her contributing towards the purchase as well, and so I believe I should be able to choose exactly what she gets.

So, Reddit. WIBTA if I didn't let my daughter choose what color car she gets?",0.95
"AITA for refusing to pay dues for an organisation i volunteer for? So i'm a mechanical engineering student and i volunteered to work on a project that aims to develop the energy grid of a sustainable model city. The project is worked on purely by students and gets the advice of a counseling professor, but no funding has been collected at this point.
So far i worked for 3 months, putting in an average of 3-4 hours a week, all while doing my studies and working a part time job.
I intend to work on the project for time to come, so i filled out the application to become a full member.
Now a Mail arrives rejecting my membership because i decided not to donate to the cause.
I told them this was outrageous since my time is enough of a donation and a whole city will surely not get funded by students donating a few bucks.

"WIBTA if I don't go to my best friend's graduation party?   Soo my bff (f25) is graduating college. There were various instances in which she ""celebrated"" it (her last class, her last exam) but because of covid restrictions, all of those were just gatherings of two to four friends at a time. In some of them I've been present, although I didn't initiate any of them.

  Now for the end of the year, the class has organized a collective big party to celebrate all their graduations. They've rented a huge place and will have an open bar. For that they charge the invitation. I do not have a problem with that; I've already payed mine.

  The thing is that I want to support my friend, and celebrate with her, but the goal of this party is to have everyone involved absolutely smashed drunk as soon as possible. And I can't drink alcohol (I have a medical condition) nor I can get equally smashed using other... media. I hate partys where everyone is out of themselves because of this, I just can't be in the same mental state and end up taking care of other people. For the last few years, I've double checked there would be at least one sober friend to chat to, or skipped this ""wild nights"" entirely. I can share my time with friends in other ways.

  Full disclosure: I've showed my concerns with my bff and she agrees that I'm not gonna be in the same mood, nor will she be very conscious of where I'm at during the party. And she said she'd understand if I don't go. But it was very clear that she'd rather have me there. So, am I an AH if I don't get myself a night of displeasure for the sake of her contempt?",0.11
"AITA for being upset at my mom for taking money from my car she wrecked for her to buy a car? For background info; my mom and I inherited a 2004 Buick Lesabre from my grandma when she passed away in 2018. My mom gifted it to me as my first car when I got my license. I‚Äôm now 21, and have taken great care of it. It‚Äôs my baby. My mom hasn‚Äôt had very great luck in the past with cars, she‚Äôs very easily distracted and a super reckless driver. She‚Äôs held the car over my head since I got it and treats it like it‚Äôs still her car. This is where it gets complicated. The insurance and car are in her name so we could avoid the high cost of a new driver getting insurance. She has junked 2 cars in the last month and a half and has been sharing mine with me. Last night she used it to go to church and crashed into a truck by swerving into his lane while they were both turning. At first I was extremely angry and didn‚Äôt know how bad the damage was. After she got home and I saw how upset she was that she crashed my car we had gotten from her mom and couldn‚Äôt be mad. The car is totaled. Probably will be about $3000 back to us. She‚Äôs been talking on the phone all day about how she wants to use that money to get herself a nice jeep her friend is selling. I can‚Äôt help but be extremely angry that she is taking the money from crashing MY CAR to get her a car and then expects me to just save up until I can get a car. When I told her that I heard her say she‚Äôs getting a car with the money and I feel like I‚Äôm being screwed she started throwing stuff around my room saying she couldn‚Äôt even sit down on my bed because of how messy it was, and that I‚Äôm ridiculous for thinking I was going to be the one to get a car with the money because neither of us have one and she needs to go back and forth to work. (I also work part time and without both incomes we won‚Äôt be able to afford bills and rent.) 
I just don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm being selfish or if I‚Äôm seeing this correctly?
Edit: she now has a couple friends who are willing to borrow her a thousand each to get her own car, with me getting the money from my car and using that to get me a car first. 
TLDR; my mom crashed my car and because the insurance is in her name she‚Äôs taking the money to buy herself a new car",0.02
"WIBTA if I asked my sister to make someone else the godfather? My older sister (30f) had her first child roughly 2 months ago and given our fantastic, close relationship it wasn‚Äôt really a surprise to anyone when she ended up asking me (23m) to be the godfather and guardian of her child in case of her and her husband‚Äôs death. I, of course, was honored and accepted. As of right now we both live in our parents‚Äô house in our own respective mini apartments, but she and her husband have been making it clear that they have been trying to find a house to move to. Everyone in my family has been under the impression that they were planning on moving somewhere close by, specifically one state over but within a 2 hour drive. Well, over the past 2ish months that sentiment has sort of changed as the husband has been making it clear that he wants to move closer to his family across the country (vertically, so like Montana to New Mexico). Well, yesterday they informed our family that they had a bid accepted and they are going to be closing on a house in that state across the country and will be moving in the end of December.

Yes, I am very sad that my sister who I am very close with is going to be moving across the country and yes this has caused a bunch of drama and fighting between them and the other members of my family (I can elaborate in comments if requested), but that isn‚Äôt really the point. What I‚Äôm worried about is the logistics. How am I supposed to fulfill my duties as the godfather of a child who is roughly 1000 miles away? Further, if the unthinkable happens in 8-10 years, how am I supposed to take on a kid who is going to be almost a complete stranger to me? When I accepted these roles I envisioned a child who I could form an active relationship with, not someone who I won‚Äôt even see grow up. 

My nephew gets baptized on December 5th and the godmother is going to be the husband‚Äôs 15 year old sister. Would I be the asshole if I asked my sister and her husband to make someone else the godfather and potential guardian of their child? Specifically, maybe the husband‚Äôs brother (17m) who lives an hour away from their new home or our aunt‚Äôs husband who lives a few hours from their new home?",0.18

"WIBTA if I took some time to myself on a couple's retreat? I'm in a long term marriage that has had some rocky times because of multiple work related separations. We lead a very busy life with kids and work, and have not been doing much with each other. I'm in over my head at work. It's very unbalanced. I feel a lot of stress. I have some time off, and as a couple we decided to take a vacation together. Kids will go to family, and for the first time in forever... we will be traveling alone. It seems like a good opportunity to work on our marriage.

Except... I'd like to spend some time to myself on the vacation. 

We're so scheduled and regulated all the time, and I'm constantly having to meet people's needs. It's unending. It's like that at work and at home. I'm happy about trying to work on the marriage, but I'm also in deep need of escape from the demands of other people. When we return, it's all going to restart. Thanksgiving, school work, kids, it'll all fall on me again, and I'm not going to have gotten any recovery time. And I need it. I'm an introvert and even though I want time with people, they exhaust me.

I don't see what's so wrong about asking for even a whole day to myself. I brought it up and he said that it made no sense, since I'm always saying we don't get time together (we don't.) He feels it's unfair for him to be at a loose end during that time and I get that, but he's also grown... He could find something to do.  I'm afraid we will go down the whole time doing touristy stuff when all I really want is a few basic things. Really basic, like a whole morning to enjoy a cup of good coffee, a new book from an old bookstore, maybe sit in said store and dig through the used section for treasures. I can't see him wanting to do that with me. I'm sorry if my imagination is too limited to see it. 

I can understand why it's a confusing or offensive idea. It's just been a really long time since I've even had the option of company on an outing like that so I don't know if it would be peaceful. And I really need peace. Like, deep down, comfortable peace. And just in case I couldn't get that together, I wanted to just plan some time to get it on my own.

"AITA For Stating My Dad Has Mental Illness?  Context: My mom (45F) and dad (55M) are separated and have been for 4 to 5 years. I (20F) have made a huge effort to spend equal time with both parents. I usually spend 2 weeks at each parents house before swapping to the other parent. My dad moved away a few months ago and his new house would take 18 hours to drive from my current location. He is also a known alcoholic and has a MAJOR spending problem, in case that's relevant.

My dad got a dog 2 years ago. She was an 8 week old puppy when he got her, and she was of a larger breed. Let's call her Sun in this story. Sun was an amazing dog. She was smart, athletic and very loving. However, she started having diarrhea shortly after my dad got her. I assumed it was her food, but my dad decided to not listen to my requests to change it to something of a higher quality. Later on, she was quite skinny so my dad took her to a vet. Apparently, she was being fed diet food so my dad changed her food to a very cheap costco food. I again suggested she eat something better, since a dogs diet is really important but he hates listening to other people and always wants to be right, so he refused.

Sadly Sun passed away a few weeks ago at the age of 2 years old. Dad took her to the vet in the morning and the vet stated that Suns colon has stopped working properly, and that she was going septic. He also stated that Sun was allergic to chicken, which was the prime ingredient of the food she was fed. Dad decided that the humane thing to do was put her down so he did that.

He told me about what the vet said, and I thought that maybe the shitty food she had for her whole life could have contributed to the diarrhea, and that it would have been the main cause for her colon to stop working. Since I'm not a vet or a doctor, I asked a Vet group on Facebook to get some answers, as I was quite unhappy. When I was asked why he didn't change her food, I said that he has ""mental illness"" and that he wouldn't listen to anyone. I use the term mental illness because he says he has anxiety, and I do believe he is bipolar.

My dad found the post, and while I was not hiding it from him, I also didn't want to cause more stress by telling him that the food he fed was most likely the cause of his dogs death. He got really upset because I had said he had ""mental illness"". He tossed a few cuss words my way and stated how hurt, pissed and disappointed he was. Then he blocked me on Facebook entirely.

AITA?

"AITA for refusing to learn how to drive? I (F15) agree with my mother (F56) that driving is an essential life skill.

"AITA for not wanting a Christmas tree up at my MILs house on Thanksgiving The holidays are very special and sensitive for me (34F), this year more than ever. My brother and I were recently orphaned, having lost our mother to breast cancer over 20 years ago and now our father to septicemia in 2020. I'm trying to navigate how I'm going to manage the holidays without my parents and I'm a new parent myself so I want to establish some nice family traditions with my son (1.5) that we will be able to continue. I love this time of year so much I really want it to be special for my son.

I agreed to have Thanksgiving dinner this year at my MILs house and my brother, who is traveling 900 miles to visit, is ok with going over there, but as we're confirming the plans my MIL says I'm putting up my Christmas tree tomorrow and maybe my son would like to help put up ornaments. This sent me completely over the edge. This is my reasoning:

1 Thanksgiving is one of my favorite holidays and I would prefer the two holidays be clearly split and defined.

2 I want to get a tree of our own and be able to enjoy the awe and wonder of the event with my son for the first time.

3 I can't get the Christmas tree that I would like before Thanksgiving so I can preempt the situation.

4 Christmas is full of mixed emotions for me. It's also my birthday so I've always had to manage some feelings of neglect and lack of control.

5 My parents passed right before and right after Christmas. I would have hoped to get through Thanksgiving without being bombarded with all these feelings. I don't know if my brother will have a similar emotional response.

6 Putting up a Christmas tree 2 weeks before Thanksgiving is not a long-standing family tradition in MILs household.

I told my husband that I didn't really want to go to MILs house for Thanksgiving if there was going to be a Christmas tree up and instead of putting the time into listening to me and at least trying to understand why, he proceeded to immediately phone her and tell her I refused to come to her house if there was a Christmas tree up she said that's weird and he said it was because I wanted to do it first. She's now not going to put up a Christmas tree. I'm not happy. He didn't take the time to even attempt to understand my feelings or explain my side of things to her. I don't usually dictate what others do in their own homes, but I believe I should be able to have some minor input into the experience this year at MILs, especially where my son is involved. My husband thinks I'm selfish for wanting to have the experience of putting up a tree and seeing my son's reaction first. He thinks that I just want to be in conflict with his Mother and I should have just let it go. While I feel he ruined the Holiday season for me before it's even begun, he believes that if anyone ruined the Holidays it's me.

"AITA for getting all hurt and pissed off when my entire family is nonchalantly abandoning my son and me at Christmas? My sister (50) and her family decided to go on a cruise this year for Christmas.

Anyway apparently my mom and sister had been discussing it for a week and then my mom sent me a ‚Äúoh btw‚Äù text like: ‚Äújust so you know, this is what we‚Äôre doing.

"AITA for not giving a child my balloon hat? I'm aware the title makes me sound like a child myself, but bear with me.

So, at my (23f) place of work, we have a lady who comes every Saturday to make balloon hats, face paint etc. She's super lovely and I get very excited for Saturdays to roll around because I am partial to a silly hat and she makes a MEAN balloon hat. While we do wear the balloon hats at work, we don't usually take them home, but we had our staff party that night and we all planned on taking then home to wear to that.

This happened a couple weeks ago. I had my balloon hat, which was a fish, and I was wearing it as I was serving customers (I wasn't the only one wearing one btw.) when a child (maybe 7-8) and her dad came up to me next. The girl points at it and asks her Dad if she could get one. Now by this time the Balloon Hat Lady had packed up her stuff and left, and he told her that. BUT then he said, 'maybe if you ask the lady for hers she will give it to you.'

I kind of cringed because I knew if I said no to this sweet little girl I would be a massive AH, but I also thought why should I feel obliged to give this random kid something of mine just because she's a kid? So instead I said 'oh I this is actually my hat but I think we have a spare one that nobody is wearing that you can have!' So I went to ask my workmates for the other one and they were also a bit conflicted because as I said above, we were planning on wearing them to our staff party that night.

We couldn't find the spare one so one of my work mates reluctantly gave up his. (more mature than me obvs) I gave it to her and she seemed happy with it but the dad kind of made a sly comment about me not wanting to give his child my one. It was kind of awkward and I did feel like a bad for letting my workmate give up his one instead of mine.

Anyway I told my BF when I got home about it and he said I was a bit of an AH because it's just a stupid hat and I could have gotten another one next week. He said this to me as I was wearing the fish balloon hat which made me feel a bit silly.

So, AITA for not giving a child my balloon hat?

"AITA for being mad at my friends for ‚Äújust sending a picture‚Äù? I have an aversion to eyes. I get queasy at the thought of someone touching their own eyes. And images of people sticking things into their eyes (like you might see in a horror movie) triggers my gag reflex.

I generally try to keep this aversion to myself because, in my experience, when people find out about it they like to tease by touching their eyes in front of me. It‚Äôs been that way with pretty much any friend group or family member who has ever found out about my ‚Äúdeal‚Äù.

Anyways, my current friend group recently discovered my aversion to eyes when we were watching a movie together and I ran out of the room at the sight of some pretty gross eye mutilation.

Ever since then, they've been teasing. I‚Äôve laughed if it off for the most part because people tend to not react well if I sternly ask them to stop. But while I can handle teasing and the occasion friend surprising me by touching their eye, one of my friends took it a step too far by sending a graphic GIF in our group chat.

I saw enough of it that I nearly vomited and am now seeing the image every time I close my eyes. I finally lost it on my friends, all of whom claim I‚Äôm overreacting since I‚Äôve only really laughed off their teasing over the last few weeks.

AITA for telling someone to put their dog on a leash?

I was taking my two dogs on an evening walk in my apartment complex. One of the dogs weighs close to 120 lbs and the other is barely 10 lbs. They are both leash trained and no reactive towards other dogs. The big one is a Canine Good Citizen!

It was a regular walk until suddenly I hear snarling and barking. I look down and there‚Äôs a Jack Russell type dog trying to bite my big dog! I instantly reacted by pulling my dogs back and telling them to sit. The other dog kept coming at my dogs and in frustration and panic I yelled at the owner ‚Äúput your dog on a leash before it bites mine!!‚Äù 

The owner says back ‚Äúmy dog is on a leash but my kid dropped it.‚Äù 

Ha, what? If there‚Äôs nobody at the end of the leash then your dog is not leashed! Also, why is the kid walking an aggressive dog? 

The dog was still trying to get at mine so I kept yelling. ‚ÄúMy dog weighs more than you and someone could get hurt! Come get your dog!‚Äù

The kid eventually grabbed the leash again and tugged the still frothing at the mouth dog away. I turned to leave but not before saying ‚Äútrain that dog!‚Äù 

I cut our walk short and went back home because I was pretty freaked out. But now I‚Äôm thinking I completely overreacted. When I say I yelled, I yelled. And in front of the guys kid, who was only 5. I feel like a total AH! 

But seriously, his dog, my dogs, myself, or his kid could have gotten hurt. I should‚Äôve taken a moment to calm down before yelling at him.

"AITA for telling someone to shut the fuck up? I was in class earlier, it was an acting class and today you had to perform a monologue infront of the entire class. Everyone was settling down and a girl was walking on stage, the teacher explained that you should be quiet whilst they were on stage and not go on your phone or anything (essentially just basic etiquette and stuff). After he did this a girl started talking to her friend who was a few desks away. From what I remember the girls friend didnt really respond to her because she knew that someone was about to perform. People obviously start shushing her, someone was on stage and she was talking loudly and was stopping the girl from performing. Eventually the shushes start turning into shut ups as she continued talking. Even the teacher was telling her to be quiet. Since I was right next to her I decided to quietly say ""shut the fuck up"". She then says ""Well take your own advice and shut the fuck up too"".

We both get sent to the office, we talk to some behavioural person and I told my side of the story (exactly what I said here) and the girl told hers. In her story she claimed she didn't know another student was onstage (that was a lie, the teacher literally said someone was on stage) and that she didnt like that everyone was being rude to her and shushing her.

"WIBTA for missing Thanksgiving? This is a fairly new problem that came up so my brilliant mind thought ‚Äúwhy not ask strangers on reddit for their input?‚Äù Obligatory I‚Äôm on mobile so sorry for the weird formatting.

So I (20m) just got hired at Amazon and it‚Äôs my first real job, but my first shift is on Thanksgiving. Now I can‚Äôt ask for my first day off I feel like that would be extremely unprofessional, but my mom is requiring that I attend Thanksgiving ‚Äúbecause it‚Äôs your family.‚Äù 

If I‚Äôm being honestly, I don‚Äôt really enjoy it that much. I love my family so so much, but there‚Äôs no one really close to my age. It would just be me, my mom (51) and dad (59), my 2 middle-aged cousins with their SOs and their 3 children no older than 6, as well their parents (my aunt and uncle both older than my parents). Because of this, I can‚Äôt really relate to all their conversations and the kids are preoccupied playing with all their toys. In previous years I usually just sit with everyone and watch whatever is on TV, eat a little food, and then just continue watching TV until we leave. 

I really just want to know if IWBTA for skipping it and going to work on Thanksgiving. I‚Äôm really ready to start my own life and save up to move out but I feel like if I ask for a my first day off it‚Äôs not going to look good.

EDIT: I JUST REALIZED I LEFT A PRETTY BIG PART. So my job is night shift. I would be waking up early to drive 2 hours (4 round trip) for lunch at my aunt/uncles house, then leaving to come home, go straight to work, then work all night. Essentially I would be up from about 9am to 4am, with the latter part being my first day at work doing manual labor. This is where my problem is, because my mom is pointing out that I could make thanksgiving and make my shift, however I just feel like I would be exhausted by the time I have to work, and I don‚Äôt want to be bad on my first day especially since I‚Äôll be trained in everything I have to do.",0.09
"AITA for yelling at my mom to stop trying to do everything for my wedding? My (30f) fianc√© (32m) and I are getting married next spring, and needless to say, our families are extremely excited. My future in laws have been good with staying out of things, with the exception of my future MIL planning our rehearsal dinner. My dad has also been great, but my mom has been an absolute nightmare.

I will say that my parents have agreed to pay for majority of the wedding, (though my in laws did provide us a very generous amount of money as a gift towards wedding costs), so I tried to allow my mom some more freedom to help me with planning the wedding. That has now turned into her calling or texting me every single day about the wedding, every single conversation I have with her goes back to the wedding. She‚Äôs even gotten ahead of herself and reached out to vendors who she thought would be good for me (photographers, florists, and even my childhood pastor who I didn‚Äôt even want to officiate my wedding) and I had to be the one to look like the bad guy when I told them that I wasn‚Äôt going to be going with them.

It all came to a head today when she calls me to ask me something regarding the wedding. I blew up on her and said that I‚Äôm sick and tired of talking about the wedding, she‚Äôs made this whole process more anxiety provoking for me, and from now on I‚Äôm not talking to her about anything wedding related and I will take care of everything on my own. I said this isn‚Äôt her wedding and that she can handle the bridal shower, but everything else I will take care of and she will no longer be involved.

"AITA for refusing to donate $1 to my employer? I teach at a private school in an insanely wealthy area. One year of student tuition costs more than my car. More than 90% of our students‚Äô families are multi-millionaires. However the school is technically a non-profit and relies heavily on donations to balance the budget each year.

Part of the school‚Äôs strategy to get more donors is to have every employee donate some money to the school. Then they tell the donors ‚ÄúOur employees care soooo much about the school that 100% of them donate to our general fund.‚Äù

This means that they put a lot of pressure on us to donate any amount of money, but they make it clear the amount does not matter. Even $1 is enough for them to advertise 100% participation. It is heavily implied that if anyone doesn‚Äôt participate it hurts the whole fundraising campaign.

The whole thing rubs me the wrong way. Either I get guilted into donating significant money to my employer‚Ä¶ or I donate $1 and become complicit in the 100% participation deception. I know it‚Äôs not technically a lie if I donate $1 but it still feels deceitful to me. Either way I feel like an asshole.

Last year I stuck to my guns and refused to donate. In a faculty meeting they announced ‚ÄúThanks to everyone that donated we were able to get *nearly* 100% participation.‚Äù Immediately the room erupted into ‚ÄúWho didn‚Äôt donate?!‚Äù. Which I think just highlights the problem of the system. But it could also just be an indicator that I need to stop being the stick in the mud and hand over a damn dollar.

So am I the asshole?

TL;DR - Employer wants all employees to donate at least $1 to be able to market ‚Äúhow much we care about this place.‚Äù I refuse.",0.24
"AITA for not believing my sister having OC without medical proof I have an older sister who is not having her second child with being third pregnancy, her previous pregnancies had no complications only labour part, well my last pregnancy I had been diagnosed with oc at 33 weeks now I still don‚Äôt know everything as my midwifes and doctors only told me I‚Äôll more likely have a still born baby but my baby was born healthy at 40 weeks, I had blood test done every week and went in and out of hospital I was in hospital for 10 days before baby was born and 9 days after but I wasn‚Äôt allowed the leave hospital in the 9 days after baby was born. My sister has told my mother off for waiting outside hospital and trying to see me because when she was in hospital for not even a whole 24 hours she only came to the hospital once. But now she‚Äôs pregnant again she wanted to know all my medical history and I only told her what is important and she made it clear that she was likely going to have it, she spoke like she wanted it and I don‚Äôt know how to react as I was stressed and emotional so much but I feel like she wants it because i had it and she wants attention because she feels like I had all attention in my pregnancy. So when she started moaning and saying she‚Äôs had to do test to find out if she has it I was just speechless and didn‚Äôt have any belief in it and tbh I did seem like I didn‚Äôt care because i just didn‚Äôt believe it, Am I the asshole not believe her until she gets results saying she has it as I feel like she would just itch to make it look like she has it, but your blood will show if you do so I know she can‚Äôt fake it.",0.74
"AITA Am I the asshole for asking a dude to change his picture of me on his account? So a little background on this. Couple of days ago, my brother approached me and asked me, hey is this you on TikTok? And as someone who never goes on TikTok, I said no. I checked the account and it‚Äôs a dude posting videos on TikTok with my senior picture(which I‚Äôve personally never posted anywhere on the internet). And I checked his content but that‚Äôs not really what bothered me. For me, it was the fact that he was using my picture without me knowing and I am certain I don‚Äôt know the individual behind the account. So I filed a report to TikTok claiming they‚Äôre impersonating me, but TikTok found nothing wrong. Which I found annoying but I understood cause I have no images of myself on my TikTok cause I never use it so it made sense. I updated my account to have a picture of me as the profile and a video stating that hey, that account isn‚Äôt me. So some random individual calls him out on a new account telling him to take it down. 

He comments on it and I tell him that hey, I‚Äôm the person, mind taking it down now? His response was that how do I know ur the actual person, and even if you were, I bought the image from a stock image site, so am I gonna pay him back? Which was laughably bullshit cause earlier that same day, he had told my friend that he had just found it through a ‚Äúgoogle search‚Äù. So now he‚Äôs lying to me and top of that he blocks me on his alt account. He has 2 accounts using my face and he just refuses to take it down? I‚Äôve already reported both accounts for impersonating me and I‚Äôve also emailed TikTok about it with proof that I‚Äôm the person with my drivers license. Am I the asshole for taking it this far?

Edit: so I‚Äôve DM‚Äôd him a bit more and he has no interest in changing the image. He says that he bought it and so he has a right to use it. And that I have ‚Äúno claim‚Äù on the image. He keeps claiming that it‚Äôs a public stock image when it‚Äôs clearly not.

Edit 2: I appreciate all the advice I‚Äôve received. For the time being, I‚Äôm going to wait and see if TikTok responds to me and bans him that way. Because of what I‚Äôve been told, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll do much good if I get him banned but he can just reuse the image on another account. So I‚Äôll display the username of both his accounts if TikTok is unable to do anything about it. I plan on pursuing legal action as well if this is the case.",0.11
"AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend for getting me gifts? I know it sounds weird but let me explain. I (M19) have been with my girlfriend (F18) for a few months now. The first thing I noticed is that she's always getting me gifts. Anything I mention or say that I like she gets and at first it was cute but now i feel like I'm being bombarded with gifts. I don't even wanna mention anything I like around her anymore because I'm worried that she'll get me it. I've never really liked accepting gifts and I told her but she never really listens. I just don't want her to waste a bunch of money on me. The gifts aren't that big either. I just grew up with my parents financially struggling so the first thing I think about is the price.

"AITA for upsetting my mother by not attending a short notice birthday party for my sister? I am in a long distance relationship and due to covid, we didnt see each other often, this was the first time my partner was in my country in about 1.5years.

One of the days happened to be my sister's birthday. Mum did speak to me a little bit about it before but I didn't really know any concrete plans. Anyway, my partner wanted to visit a friend who lives 1.5h away by car. We established a day that was my sister's bday, but I just thought that we will be there in the morning anyway and we will do something on the weekend instead.

Unfortunately, we are late get uppers. Its hard for us to get up especially when we are together as we just havent seen each other a lot recently and its hard due to my depression as well. About 12:45 we were ready ish, but the evening before my mum called to let me know I am to get a cake, that she didn't order, im just suppose to find a nice cake (not supermarket sugar stone). 

Well since I'm still a learner driver, I ended up besically taking longer than normal to get to the cake shop, then took longer than I wanted to find the small cake shop in big shopping mall, then had a break down because I knew we didnt have enough time to even spend 2h with that friend in the city if we were going to be back by evening time that my mum said day before. 

This extended things considerably and so at around 2pm after getting the cake I told my sister how we had cancelled, but she told us to go. Since it was her birthday and she felt quite strongly about it, I decided to uncancel with his friend and head there anyway after blowing up some balloons (since I was expected to find a pump in that big shopping mall too, but I knew it would of added  minimum 30min extra at the mall, so I just blew some up instead), so at something like 2.30 or 3pm we drove. We got to the city at 5.30 ish, stuck in traffic, and decided to stay for more like 3h. We got back by 11pm, my mum was angry, didnt even greet us, and I was told I am prioritising boyfriends again angrily. 

Of course I am upset that she said that, because my ex was abusive to me, and I was disconnected from everyone by besically putting him over my family. I understand that I somehow did choose to put him ahead, at the same time I do feel it was because of gas lightning and control I experienced. I am really hurt that she said it knowing that it obviously hurts, and I feel like ultimately my sister wanted us to go and it was her birthday, so although I understand some upset, I did think she would of understood and not treated me and my partner so coldly. 

But am I wrong in feeling this way, is the whole thing actually my fault? Ive been feeling like someone who is just there to constantly do favours for her due to her long hours at work and frankly I just cant stand it so I decided to proritise my plans that day but only after getting green flag from my sister.

"AITA For Not Letting my daughter sleep over at her friends? My daughter is 14, she wants to have a sleepover with two friends. One friend is a boy, one friend is a girl both the same grade.

We have, up to this point only allowed sleepovers with other girls, so we(my wife and I) told her no. 

Her argument is that the guy is bi and has a boyfriend, and that I‚Äôve let her have sleepovers with her gay female friends in the past. My daughter hasn‚Äôt defined her sexuality yet, at least not to me, and I respect that. 

She asked why gender matters for sleepovers. I said that sexual experiences and experimenting with drugs and alcohol that may not be good for her in the long run of life can happen in situations like this. I offered to let her hang at that house as late as she wants and I would just pick her up when she is ready to go to bed, but didn‚Äôt feel comfortable having her sleepover. 

She was very upset, called me gross for my gender stereotypes, said I‚Äôm old fashion in my thinking.

"AITA - Locking the Door I‚Äôve been in two arguments now on whether everyone should lock the door behind them or if it‚Äôs the responsibility of the last person to leave the house.

I‚Äôm of the opinion that even if there is somebody left in the house you should lock the door no matter what, I work 2nd and 3rd shifts which is different than my roommate and his girlfriend who work a 9-5. They leave the door unlocked while At 7-8am while I am sleeping or get ready to sleep, then when I wake up and use the back door to leave, which I lock behind me, I am blamed for not locking the front door that they left out of that morning.

"AITA for not inviting my SIL to a siblings meeting after asking them to pitch in for my mom's rent? I (35F) am the youngest of 3- brother 1 (40M married with 2 kids) and brother 2 (39M married no kids). 

Parents came to Canada 1990 
Mom was SAHM, knew little English 
Divorced in 2005, my dad sent her back to her home country and only $10k after 20 years marriage. 
We all had a strained relationship 
She picked on brother 2 the most 

2012, mom wants to live in Canada with grandkids 
She is now disabled, mentally and physically- and is a shell of a person of who she was. Very submissive, timid, very respectful etc. 
She also has 0 money and honestly can't work even if she wanted to, mentally and physically has issues 


Brother 1 and I made a plan for her to come, I paid for my mom fully.

2 years later she moved in with my now husband, I couldn't afford to pay her rent too, Brothers still never pitched in. 


Brother 2 new girlfriend and I got very close 2020. After a health problem I told brother 1 and 2 i need space from my mom and they all agreed to chip in to mover out, $520/each.

As SOON as brother 2 girlfriend found out, she told me that she doesn't think brother 2 should pay for our mom because he doesn't benefit from the relationship, repeatedly. I didn't say anything. We 

I had a baby April 2021. 

Made brother 2 the God father of my first child. 

June 2021 brother 2 got engaged 

July 2021 I called a meeting in person with my brothers to discuss moms rent $ plan. The cost would have been $520/each (3 siblings) monthly.

Brother 1s wife was a SAHM for 4 years, but got a part time job so they can pitch in for my mom. SIL also says mom stuff is not her business.

My husband financially supported her 5 years, says he's he's good with any decision. 


During meeting brother 2 now says he is not going to chip in, his fiance wants to move to San Fran and he doesn't have money. His fiancess dog died January 2021 and she's been too distraught to work, so they only have 1 income, despite him having a boat, low mortgage, etc. 


B2 fiance was PISSED at me for not ""inviting"" her to the meeting, despite me inviting no spouses, including my own and says that this is a ""household"" income issue and her voice about my mom affairs is just as important. 

I have told B2 I don't want to discuss things about my mom with his fiance, and he went back and told her, because ""they don't keep secrets from each other."" 

They got married in Jamaica Aug 2021- with the only people in attendance was my dad, step mom, her mom and her sister. Mom wasn't invited. Brother 1 and I couldn't go, short notice.

Since that meeting, Shes  still been telling my brother that I am trying to come between them, cause  problems in their relationship etc. All petty and not true.

God only knows what she said but My brother and her both stopped talking to me. Oct 2021 we got a place for my mom, we pay $1000 b1 pays still $500.

AFTER I got a place she now calls me and says we should be close again because we're family.",0.45

"AITA for not wanting to have My grandmas dogs at our house at Christmas cuz of how the dogs act and cuz of past events? Me and My boyfriend live With My parents and im currently 32 weeks pregnant and there is a 90% chance that i give birth a few days before Christmas so that is what we assume Will happen.

And i have 2 Cats who are terrified of dogs due to past events where they have been chased and almost bitten by dogs, One cat is almost 11 years old and i am scared that He Will get super stressed if My grandma brings her dogs to our house.

My grandmas dogs have growled at and chased our Cats in the past and tend to jump on people and break things and bark and growl at any Little Noise they hear, and i do not want dogs to Break any of our things or jump on me and My baby or scare the shit out of My baby or My Cats. 

Me and My boyfriend do not feel comfortable with having the dogs here due to the things stated above and have Asked My grandma if she could get a dogsitter but My parents and My sister think im an ahole for even thinking like that and say the dogs have a right to be here.

But me and My boyfriend think the Cats and our baby have a right to be safe in their own home. So Reddit aita?

Edit: im 17 years old and the dogs can easily Hurt My baby IF im holding him since i am Short (159 cm), they have Hurt me everytime they see me, and i have been attacked and chased by dogs in the past, so no i dont legaly own the house but in My opinion i Still have the right to feel safe at My own home.

"AITA for wanting to give my boyfriend an ultimatum. So I (F17) have been with my boyfriend (17M) for moths now and we‚Äôre pretty serious. For the most part, things between us are great but when it comes to his family, I almost want to run for the hills. 

For some background, he‚Äôs mixed (black and white) but his bio dad isn‚Äôt in the picture‚Äîhe lives with his mom, half brother, and stepdad who are white. I, on the other hand, have two black parents. His parents are always nice to me when I‚Äôm around and invite me places with them but it doesn‚Äôt always seem genuine as I have found out that his stepdad has called him slurs (such as the n-word with the hard r) and said pretty racist things towards him and there have been times where his mom has let it happen. When we had that conversation, I was absolutely disgusted and he seemed kind of upset when talking about it but said ‚Äúthey‚Äôre family so it‚Äôs different. We love each other at the end of the day‚Äù and I left it at that because I didn‚Äôt want to say anything to upset him. 

Fast forward to a week ago and we‚Äôre talking about race again after listening to something micro-aggressions and stuff and he tells me that he didn‚Äôt realize how messed up his family was when it came to racism and that it was hard for him to process but it made him want to slowly distance himself from them but since that conversation, he really hasn‚Äôt because he ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt like conflict‚Äù and his stepdad constantly guilts him into spending more time with his mom.

And fast forward again to now, I find out that his step-cousin has called me a slave and said other remarks about ‚Äún*gg*r‚Äôs‚Äù and that my boyfriend said ‚Äúdon‚Äôt say that‚Äù and left it at that because his cousin‚Äôs girlfriend and stepdad were there and that it would have been ‚Äúworse for him‚Äù if he further said anything and that it wasn‚Äôt the first time that they have made other remarks about my race. This angered me, not only because he didn‚Äôt say anything more but because he allowed them to even get that far into insults about me.

"AITA for not wanting to pass down the ‚Äúfamily name‚Äù? My SO and I are expecting our first. We‚Äôre thinking about baby names. My SO is a Jr., and he and his family would really like for me to pass on the family name and make our (if it‚Äôs a boy) child a III.

The problem is, I don‚Äôt like his name. I love my SO, don‚Äôt get me wrong, but it‚Äòs an old man Boomer name and something I would never name a child, and certainly not something I could look at a baby and call him by that name. 

And I also am not the biggest fan of his father, who has proven EXTREMELY douchey, and don‚Äôt want to name any child after him. (I‚Äôve always kinda had a stereotypical idea that Boomers who name their sons after themselves are egotistical, and he‚Äôs certainly proved that.)

I love his middle name and even suggested that as something different but still a name within the family, but that was shot down. 

My SO really wants to do it too. He really enjoys the idea of having a little G Man. He brings it up a lot, and the only thing I can say is I think it puts a lot of pressure on a kid to live up to his father‚Äôs name (something my SO has said before) and that HE is that name to me, so it‚Äôs not as individual for the child. 

Complicating things is my SO‚Äôs sister, who named her first son the III after his father and grandfather. Their name is something timeless that isn‚Äôt outdated. But the family is giving me vibes of, ‚ÄúIf she can, you can too.‚Äù 

My SO‚Äôs other sister doesn‚Äôt understand why it‚Äôs a big deal to me, and she and his father both are really trying to pressure me into it and making me feel like I‚Äôm going to be a bad person if I don‚Äôt pass it down.

"AITA for not doing my husband's college class? Okay, so I (22 nonbinary she/they) and my husband (25M) just had a baby 2 months ago. She is the youngest of our three girls (3 and 2). 3 weeks into my recovery my husband decides to sign up for college classes. I advised him not to because we just had a baby and we‚Äôre both very busy already. He did anyway convincing me he could handle it and so I told him I'd do my best to give him time away from the girls for his schoolwork. Well, he fell behind on his classes and pleaded with me to help him catch up so of course, I said yes I'll look over the work and do what I can. Mind you I'm breastfeeding/chestfeeding a newborn every 2 hours. After chasing the girls, cleaning messes, and getting them to bed I'm exhausted. 

I did what could before falling asleep if I had the energy. Right now he's backed up about 5 weeks of work I've already done 3 assignments and a quiz. I told him I could just crap out some work so he has something to turn in and he said ‚Äúno get good grades‚Äù so not only is it late I have to get good grades (I'm not dumb but this stuff is hard! I've gotten full points on everything did I think). He works overnight and will wake up and check if I did anything. If I didn't he‚Äôd wake me up at 1-2:30 am and yell at me about not doing it. I tell him to stop cause it's not my fault or responsibility to do his work I'm doing him a favor. He tells me to not make promises I can't keep (because it's so easy to tell him ‚Äúno‚Äù) and that the money for his classes will come out of our taxes next year if he fails. 

Today is the last day and he has like 6 things left they'd take me all night but I don't want $5000 coming out of our taxes or being yelled at.

"AITA - Mosquito Bite Debacle My (30M) partner (25F) got 3-4 mosquito bites on her leg that grew to approximately 2-3 inches in diameter. She‚Äôs had them for two days now. They‚Äôre itching and hurt. She‚Äôs on Benadryl now and cortisone cream. 

Today she said she wants to cake it in cream and cover it with something to help the pain. She wanted me to use medical tape and tape tissues to her legs instead of getting the medical bandages I suggested or just laying on a towel. I agree despite thinking it‚Äôd not work. 

While taping I‚Äôm laughing at the absurdity of taping tissues to her leg and she got mad. Tore the tissue off, and is crying and upset at me for being an asshole.

"AITA For telling my girlfriend to sleep? So backstory is we've been dating for six months, but we've know each other for about a year and a half. Last her her mother would take her electronics (which was very hard on her as she used them for music or videos to fall asleep) as when she would have them she'd stay up to 1-3 am even on a school night a be exhausted the next morning. This year we both have been trying to be healthier in our living. We have been doing well, but she has continued the habit of not sleeping until late hours into the night.

So last night her mom started turning off the wifi on her electronics (i pad, iphone) so she sleeps. Which last night didn't work on her iphone so my girlfriend was up. She dmed me and we talked a bit then I said she should sleep as her staying up late was the whole reason the wifi was being turned off we both giggled and said yeah and she went to sleep very soon after, no problem. Then tonight her ipad didn't turn off. So she texted me and said she was up. I said hun sleep as we want to make the time ur mam forces the wifi off to be sorter. she says she'll sleep later. 1hour passes and she textes again. I ask her to sleep as we didn't want her stuff being taken like the year pervious. she said that she would when she's tired. I have to admit i got a little annoyed at this as I knew she'd be up late. I said, just don't be sad when ur mam takes ur stuff at 10 or 11 or even 9 as a punishment. She got either sad or angery at this as she went ""... Goodnight"" the typical, Im pissed language.

"AITA for being upset about Thanksgiving dinner? Long story short, I (23 enby) recently moved across the country to live with a close friend (25F). We're so close that her whole family has ""adopted"" me and calls me their sister. I've never liked Thanksgiving, but it's important to her family, who we'll be celebrating with. I have Celiac and can't eat anything with wheat, barley, or rye, so I can't eat most classic Thanksgiving food anyway.

Originally, my friend (who does most of the cooking) planned to make everything gluten free, but that ended up not working out because finances made us wait longer than expected to go shopping, and by the time we went shopping, the gluten-free versions of things we needed were sold out.

Now, I have pills I can occasionally take that prevent most symptoms if I eat gluten, but I still get super depressed and sluggish even if I do take the pills, so I try to only do that in an emergency. I consider an emergency any time that we're too busy to cook real food; if things are being cooked, it doesn't seem fair that I should have to risk my health for it. My friend made a comment that it's ridiculous that I don't want to take them for Thanksgiving, which is a super important holiday to her family. 

Besides that, the only dish I requested was green bean casserole (again, it was supposed to be made GF, but that fell through). My friend started saying that we need cheese for it, which I was confused by because I'd never heard of putting cheese in green bean casserole. I made a joke that she was ""ruining the one dish I requested"" and she got mad at me. I'm basically in charge of the casserole now because, clearly, none of their food is good enough for me. It's not that at all. I'm just disappointed that the only things safe for me to eat at all will be turkey and potatoes, and there's not a single thing cooked in a way I'm used to. I never expected them to change the whole meal to be safe for me; my friend initially offered to do that, but now even having one dish changed slightly for me seems like too much. I don't care too much about that, but this whole thing just seems like a reminder that I just don't belong here with the people who call me family like I thought I did.

ETA: I did offer to bring my own dish when we discussed the plan for the day a few weeks ago and actually suggested a few different things. I was specifically told not to, as their dad apparently isn't as into holidays as the rest of the family and doesn't want to deviate from the usual plan. Because of that, my options are limited only to what will be provided.",0.28
"AITA for being honest when my dad asked why I stopped buying him gifts Ok so my dad is hard to shop for, I always tried to do my best to get him something he would enjoy, but that wasn't something to use in his work since I know he prefers ""fun"" gifts. A few years ago I got him a desk toy, it was a magnetic disk that came with a collection of hex nuts that could be stacked and connected on it. 

About a week after this, I was talking to my grandma and I mentioned the gift and that I think he liked it, but that my brother really stole the show by getting him a model of the first car he had as a teen... Well... Grandma laughed in my face and revealed that no, my father in fact told her my gift was ""just stupid trash"" and that he ""can't even use the nuts cause they're metric""

I know it wasn't a good gift I guess, but I was struggling at the time financially and wanted to make sure I got everyone something even if it was small...

I just really got hurt hearing this and so this year when his birthday came, I went home, and I took him nothing. My family also did an early early Xmas for my dad's side of the family since my cousin will be out of state soon until 2022, again I got him nothing, he said nothing to me but had my mom ask me why i hadn't gotten him a gift but did for p much everyone else.

So I told him ""well I knew I would risk getting you trash, and I can't tell the difference between metric and imperial hex nuts so you can just get your own right?"" He was.... Less than thrilled, my family has since joined together to tell me what a brat I am, that I was disrespectful and as my father he deserves better. He personally hasn't spoken to me much since.

AITA for being blunt? I know I couldve been more subtle or gentle but it just really stung

Edit: thanks everyone, I appreciate all the different perspectives, next time I'm home I'm going to try to sit him down alone and have a talk with him (it'll be hard to get him alone but ill try) and ask him to give his 100% honest side of things, I've also thought on some of the questions asked of me and I am honestly starting to wonder if maybe my dad just doesn't like *me*",0.17

"WIBTA if I refuse to cover the shift of my coworker whose son died? Ok, so I work a high demand food service job were I am scheduled 50 hours a week. As one of the only crew members that know how to work an essential part of the restaurant,  I often come in early or stay late to keep the place running.  While we are training more people in this section of the restaurant, none of the trainees are able to run this part solo. 

Anyway, my manager is pretty lousy at scheduling,  but I lucked out in a way that I actually have consistent days off. One of my supervisors was not so lucky and was scheduled on her usual day off. While she normally would have sucked it up and worked the extra hours,  she recently found out her son died, and she has to drive to another state to pick up the body. The only other people who can open up that extra day are me and the lousy manager,  who can't for reasons I'm not sure of,  I think he's out of town.  While I'd usually be willing to help out the supervisor who is in this crisis, the day off she needs me to cover is actually a scheduled family reunion.  My family can not get together this Thanksgiving so we're trying to get together later this week.  I didn't request this day off in advance because it falls on my regular day off. Now I'm torn. WIBTA if I don't skip my family reunion to cover my supervisor whose son died?

Update: My Supervisor went to pick up her son, I went to my reunion, and my lousy manager has been upgraded or maybe downgraded to A-hole manager. A lot happened in that week and a lot has happened since. I'll start with the good news,  I had a wonderful dinner, where I met a cousin I never knew I had. My supervisor got to mourn in peace. Neither of us were at risk of losing our jobs and neither of us were even written up. It actually turns out that my manager was supposed to work that day anyway and had only asked me to cover the shift so he wouldn't have to come in early and work 12 hours like the rest of us. What actually enrages me most is A-hole manager's hypocrisy. He gave my supervisor crap for taking ONE DAY off to pick up her son's body, but is currently taking the entire week off to mourn his dead dog. I love dogs, don't get me wrong, and I be devastated about losing my family dog, but I feel he should be a bit more sympathetic to someone who lost her son. But that's a story for another time. Anyway, the bad news is my Supervisor did face a small repercussion for ""calling off."" She lost out on a $100 gift card the company was awarding to people who never called off or came late to work for the entire month of November. Honestly, the game was rigged to begin with because the A-hole manager didn't accommodate anyone's actual availability. 
There's actually a lot going on with my terrible manager that I could create an entire post towards r/entitledpeople, but long story, short, I put in my two weeks notice and so did my supervisor. We're officially done working with A-hole manager.",0.17
"AITA for not inviting my roommate/friend to things so he can spend time with his dog? Background: My roommate was a coworker I was good friends with but recently got a new job. We live in a four bedroom apartment. His girlfriend stayed with us for a few months and before she left the state they got dogs together. Border Collie/Blue healer mixes. For an apartment. She and her dog left soon enough but his is still here and I don‚Äôt think he spends enough time with it. He works long hours as manager of a bar and when he gets home usually cleans up the dog shit in the living room (he keeps it there during the day, this is also the room my bathroom is in) and takes him on a walk before putting him away again to play Xbox or go out. 

I hate his fucking dog because he‚Äôs understandably a menace. His claws are razor sharp because he ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt want to spend money on a groomer‚Äù and is obviously hyper due to his pedigree. Even the girls he brings over don‚Äôt like it and he has kept it in our other living room where it barks while he has people over.

Recently I‚Äôve been going out a lot with our old coworkers who we are both close with and he asked why he isn‚Äôt invited. I said so he can spend more time with the shit hound. He got offended because it‚Äôs not my business/responsibility what happens to the dog. AITA?",0.19

"WIBTA if I ask my buddy if another one of our friends has asked him for money. This is my first post here, so hopefully I make everything make sense. 

A buddy of mine, let's say bob, asked me tonight through text if I could lend him $50. He said he lost his job recently and is kinda broke and needs it for his phone bill. He said he'd pay me back if I do. I've known him for a several years, so I don't think he's lying about it but I've had bad experiences lending money to people before. (Haven't loaned money to bob before)

So this is where I feel like I might end up being the asshole. I want to trust him, but there is always the chance he is lying about it or something. In our friend group it's pretty much bob, me, and one other friend(let's say Steve). I was thinking about asking Steve about this, to see if he was asked anything similar before and to see if Steve knows if bob actually lost his job or not. 

I just wanna make sure that bob is being honest about it and not trying to get easy money or something. I feel like I'd be breaking his trust by going to Steve with this though, and I also don't wanna start any drama in the group.

"AITA cause I don't want people calling my wife Michael anymore? My wife was suppose to be a boy. Her parents had picked out the name Michael for her but well she wasn't a boy. However for whatever reason, they made Michael her nickname and everyone calls her that. Her name isn't Michael. When I met her, I found it kinda cute that everyone called her that. Now its just  annoying. Hardy anyone calls my wife her name. Her parents, friends, family, coworkers - she'll tell complete strangers to call her Michael.

Like I said, it is no longer cute and just teeth grinding annoying to hear the name Michael throwout our marriage. I asked her if she can stop using the nickname or switch to a feminine nickname like Michelle. She shot me down saying Michael is her name. I told her no its not! We got into a small argument where I pointed out she's not taking my feelings into consideration here! I even had someone ask me once if my wife was trans cause of the name Michael.  She told me to leave the house and to come out when I want to talk. Its my house too! In the end, my wife took a bag and went to her brother's house.

I called once I thought she had cooled down and again asked that for the sake of our marriage for her to stop encouraging the nickname. She hung up on me. I'm not asking much. Just don't want people calling my wife Michael anymore!

"AITA for expressing complaints to my roommates over text to keep them on the record? In a college campus apartment, and my roommates are pigs. The apartment is so dirty (constantly) that it breaks housing agreement. I‚Äôm talking molding food, leftovers being left out for weeks, empty beer cans/bottles left on the floor for weeks, the whole nine yards.

Obviously when dealing with anything like this, I take the well-documented route so that I can prove whatever I need to in a dispute. I read the writing on the wall that this would be a problem from the start, so I decided to text any requests in our group chat. 

Obviously, no matter how many times I tried to get a roommate agreement meeting organized or some form of chore list going, it was ignored and the behavior continued.

I clean up everything I use and take out my own trash, and for the entire first half of the semester I was the only one cleaning anything. I was fed up so I stopped and things got so much worse. 

Today we all left campus for thanksgiving break and one guy slams the group chat saying he just did a ‚Äúdeep clean‚Äù of the apartment (all he did was clean up the mess he made and put his dishes away that were in the sink for weeks) and then said ‚Äúno more bitching in the group chat or playing the blame game‚Äù. He took several shots at me for communicating over text and said I should just say it in person. 

I still plan on communicating over text to keep it on the record. I responded by saying that the reason I have to is that we don‚Äôt have a roommate agreement so the only record we have of what should be getting done is through text. 

AITA? I‚Äôve been patient but I‚Äôm fed up with this shit. My roommates are selfish assholes and have been since day one.

AITA for refusing to pay for my younger sister's surgery? [deleted],0.28
"AITA for damaging my SIL clothes and refusing to dwell on it ? Did the laundry. Unfortunately, two sweaters of my little brother's girlfriend were in the bag at that time, delicate ones that cost 90$ each and gifts from her grandmother. One was ruined because of the fabric, the other one they managed to get back by using a blowdryer.

&#x200B;

Felt horrible. Apologized right on the spot, gave her space to be mad, apologized again at dinner. She took it very graciously at the time and forgave me immediately and explicitely. My brother offered to pay her back, which she refused in front of me. I then discussed it with my mother to gift her similar clothes only to find out they had made a money transfer afterwards without my knowing. I think it's only right even though I would have wanted to help repair my mistakes.

&#x200B;

The only thing is, they're adamant they had both warned me about this and asked me not to touch the laundry. I do remember heeding those warnings, however, I remember them being phrased as a one time thing, something to the extent of ""don't do the laundry cause delicate sweaters are in the bag"" several weeks before the incident. At least, I understood them as such : what they're both saying is, they explicitely warned me of ""never doing the laundry again"". I need very clear instructions as I take things literally and do not remember this part.

&#x200B;

I have a bad memory and the fews I do have, I struggle to trus which makes me feel crazy sometimes. It's entirely possible they're right and I misunderstood, even if I'm not sold. That is the only point where there is still a disagreement. Since none of our opinions will change, since excuses have been issued, since mistakes have been repaired and since forgiveness has been granted, I decided to let the subject go. However, they've been bringing it up a few times, even during outings, and I don't understand their intentions because it upsets me and they know it. If it's play-bickering, they're aware I don't like it. If it's mockery, it's just cruel. If it's because there is still unresolved tension on their part, I don't understand why they're not having a calm discussion with me, and I don't understand why my brother (who was not wronged in the incident) is acting like it's his business when only his girlfriend has the right to be mad.

&#x200B;

They've been shutting me down when I react by contesting their version of the story. They tell me that I ""should not get vexed or mad, it's okay if you misunderstood us"". In my point of view, I'm only defending myself when they bring the subject up for no reason at all, justifying my fault with facts that I think are false. I thought we were through this. Obviously, they don't agree since they keep laughing about it with me in the room and expect me to either laugh with them, confess my mistake or stay silent (I don't really know what they expect from me and what their intentions are).

"AITA for yelling at my dad for never telling me that I had a sister So I (16 M) was yelling at my dad (47 M) last night because of this. Pretty much, my mom passed away a week ago and the funeral is in a week so we're all in a bad way right now.

The day my mom passed, there was this lady that I'd never seen before crying by her side holding her hand in the hospital. What was even weirder was that she was calling her mommy. I was confused but I didn't say anything. Then after my mom passed, she hugged my dad and called him daddy and kept saying sorry to him. She left the room with my dad and I haven't even seen her again or even my dad for a few hours.

My dad wouldn't tell me anything about her when I asked. Finally, I asked my grandpa who she was and he was surprised my dad didn't tell me. Pretty much, my dad and mom were high school sweethearts (this much I knew) and my mom got pregnant when she was young. They had a girl named Jane (who is the lady I saw) that they gave up to my dad's cousin. When I was a baby, Jane and my mom got into a bad argument over my parents having more kids and they then went no contact.

My dad noticed me sulking all week and when he finally asked what was up and if I was going to do a eulogy last night, I kind of lost it. He never told me about her. There's this big part of my family that I never even knew about. Even if she doesn't want anything to do with me, why didn't he tell me that? He didn't say anything to me but my aunt heard and chewed me out.

Since then I've felt terrible and I know I didn't take my dad's feelings into account. I really feel like I shouldn't have yelled at him and I should have handled it differently.",0.08

"AITA for abandoning my partner in our group project? My friend, who I'll call Grace (17f), and i were working together on an essay based school project for a miserable teacher I'll call Ms. PooPoo. Ms. PooPoo is a really awful lady who has 0 sympathy for anyone and doesn't accept any excuses for missing class or work, regardless of how valid they are. To give you an example, last year my uncle died, and I took a week off school and she yelled at me for not doing any of the work while I was off mourning. She's a huge dick. 

The essay Grace and I had to do needed to be 5000 words and we needed a PowerPoint to go with it too. We were only given 3 days to do it and the deadline is tomorrow. I have adhd and only function in bursts of like 20 minutes and procrastinate chronically, so I only have about 1/3 of my half done so far. 

Recently, I changed schools. The change was very sudden and I only found out today that I can start tomorrow so I didn't have any time to do anything really because I have a lot of catchup work to do for my new skl. So I didn't do the rest of the project because I wont be in ms poopoos class ever again. I told Grace that I hadn't done the rest of the work and she freaked out at me and cried because ms poopoo is going to get mad. Me leaving the school is not going to be a valid enough excuse for ms poopoo. 

Grace is mad at me for choosing not to finish the rest of my half so that she can at least present it tomorrow, and says that I should focus on the project rather than my catch up work. 2/3 is a lot extra to have to do by herself.

"AITA for planning to keep 2 stray kittens in my home overnight before I get them to a rescue? To start, here‚Äôs some relevant background information: I (25F) have been involved in animal rescue as long as I can remember. I currently work at a shelter, but before that I spent years fostering neonatal kittens that were found outside ‚Äî for a while it wasn‚Äôt uncommon for me to have 3-5 groups of foster kittens at a time and I became the person people texted when they found extremely young kittens outside. I‚Äôve also spent time volunteering at sanctuaries, running adoption events, educating other people, working with TNR programs, etc. All this to say, what I do is VERY important to me.

Fast forward to tonight ‚Äî I‚Äôm walking home, and stumble upon 2 kittens, very clearly strays, terrified, maybe 2-3 months old. So I do what I have always done in this situation: I sit down, and start planning how I can get these guys to safety (especially because we‚Äôve been getting below freezing temperatures in my city recently). I worked for about an hour tossing them the few dog treats I happened to have in my pocket, gaining their trust. In that hour, I realized I didn‚Äôt currently have the means to do anything with these kittens. (No more food, no traps, no cat carrier, and a dying phone).

So I headed home to regroup, and texted my partner (24M) who I live with (we‚Äôve lived together for 3 months and I haven‚Äôt fostered any animals in that time), letting him know the situation and that I might bring these two kittens home tomorrow to crash in our guest bathroom until I can find a rescue to take them the next day. He immediately loses his mind telling me I‚Äôm not allowed to bring them home, because it would make him ‚Äúunhappy and uncomfortable,‚Äù even though he wouldn‚Äôt have to even see the kittens if he didn‚Äôt want to, and I‚Äôm not asking him to help in any way. He also mentioned that having them in our home for a night would make him unhappy during his planned (online) game night tomorrow.

I told him it was not up for debate because the lives of the kittens are more important than one night of comfort, especially seeing as they would be in a room we haven‚Äôt used since moving here so they wouldn‚Äôt be in the way at all.

I feel I‚Äôm trying to meet him in the middle by not just staying out all night to be able to bring them home today without notice, and also not requesting that we foster them or keep them longer than a night; he feels like he‚Äôs not allowed to have an opinion on what goes on in his home.",0.09

"AITA for not completing a project I wasn't assigned at the last minute because I don't want to? Today I got text from my boss (at a relatively new job, three-ish weeks) asking me to complete an essential section of a project I was not assigned to. We work in social media, and projects move really fast, and the job is very flexible and can be done remotely. It just requires me to do specific things at specific times outside of normal business hours. I have no problem with this. And the company is fine with me traveling to see my family for Thanksgiving as long as I'm still able to get those specific things done at those specific times, which I am and have been able to no problem.

When they asked me to complete the project I was with my grandfather and would be for a little bit. But also honestly, it's the night before I leave my family, I was little stoned earlier in the day (which doesn't make for my sharpest mind the rest of the day), and I don't want to work. I said I was with family celebrating Hannukah, which isn't entirely untrue. It just won't take the rest of the night. But I wasn't going to take time away from being with my grandfather that minute to rush off to finish a project I didn't know was coming my way. And I am spending time with my family tonight. No one would be devastated if I worked, but again, I don't want to and I think this is a fine time to say no.

Even though I gave them what I thought was a reasonable excuse, family and religion(ish), they still wanted me to do it because the deadline for it is today and it still had to go through an approval process before the deadline. They kind of blamed me for this last minute ask too.

And that kind of set an alarm bell off in my head.  I don't care what industry you're in and unless it's in your contract, I don't think it's reasonable to expect me to drop everything to finish something I was never a part of. You can ask and if I can I'll do it, but I shouldn't be in trouble for not being able to at any given moment, right?

I doubled down and said I was somewhere it wasn't possible for me to work and apologized. I offered a solution that still meets the deadlines, essentially flipping the order of projects (which no one but us would know). And I got a non response.

I'm not being an asshole or bad employee by not doing this, right? My dad says I'm fine and I feel like this is a reasonable boundary to stand by. But my mom is insisting I'm being lazy. So, AITA?

&#x200B;

EDIT- I'm getting mostly NTA vibes, but it doesn't look good to my bosses. I get that. But I think because I focus a lot on getting final approval for my projects at least two days in advance I'll be okay this time.",0.01
"AITA? My ex (31M) keeps complaining to me (32F) about his job while he has a pregnant new GF (22F) I (32F) always tried to keep a good relationship with my ex (31M) and I don't want to ruin it. But lately this has become very, very difficult.
One of the reasons for the breakup 2 years ago was that my ex (31M) never had a real job and was doing nothing to find one. He even asked me once to move with me to my place without having any kind of income (he was living at his parents place). And he actually asked to marry me in a complete random  way, which lead to the definitive breakup. 
Since then, I moved to a different city and started a new job, that I had to quit recently for mobbing reasons. Obviously I'm not having the best time of my life. 
Instead of asking me how I'm doing, he keeps complaining about this random job he found. Fun fact is, that he actually started complaining about all the events, trips, etc that he'll be missing because of work even before starting. He also has a new GF (22F) that probably should care more than me at this point, and that is the reason why he finally decided to get a job (she's pregnant). But he keeps telling me that they really don't talk that much about serious stuff, which I find very concerning. I asked him (before they found out about the unexpected pregnancy) if he was sure about that relationship, but he insisted that everything was amazing. 
I don't want to be rude to him, but he's being very immature and insensitive about the whole situation. I want to tell him to shut up and stop whining about having an actual job, because apparently that's the only thing he sees wrong with all this. AITA?",0.37

"AITA roommate trouble So I just took over my sisters lease, my sister rented out a bedroom and shared a bathroom with one other girl.* I feel somewhat obligated to take over the lease because she‚Äôs moving in with a boyfriend and her friends expressed some concern about it and would like for her to have a back up plan*
My sister moved out in mid October and I planned to move-in in early December. Mid November I went to the house to check it out , I was having some friends from out of town come and stay and my sister said we could stay there! I walked in and the bathroom was absolutely disgusting. I gave the girl the benefit of the doubt and just cleaned the bathroom. I left a note that read ‚Äúplease be more considerate of shared spaces, I move in soon‚Äù I went into the bathroom later that day to find a note. The note touched on many topics such as I need to learn to live with someone with ADHD, I need to cut back on my cannabis consumption and I will not be able to park here in the winter and I‚Äôll need to park elsewhere. I‚Äôd like to mention that I have been diagnosed with ADHD, I have a medical marijuana card(I had not smoked inside the house) and I will be paying more in rent than her making me feel uneasy about the parking situation. 

My response to the note was passively aggressively annotate the note and touch on the concerns I just expressed.

"AITA: for getting mad at my (f18) boyfriend (m20) for saying I‚Äôve been a bad host? 
So my boyfriend is from Japan and he couldn‚Äôt go back home for thanksgivings break. I thought it would be nice to have him over for thanksgiving since I wanted him to meet my extended family.

My parents said we weren‚Äôt allowed to sleep in my bedroom together so the first night I let him sleep in my room and I slept in my sisters room. (She wasn‚Äôt home so it wasn‚Äôt so awkward) then the rest of the nights we slept together on the couch said my parents said that was okay.

Last night I wanted to sleep in my room since I didn‚Äôt get to sleep in it at all since I got home so I decided to. My boyfriend slept on the couch and my father accidentally passed out on the couch as well. 

My family and I are heading to the movies and I told my boyfriend to get ready. He got all upset saying that he didn‚Äôt get any sleep last night due to my father snoring. I told him that I was sorry but I can‚Äôt control my dad. He then said that I‚Äôve been a horrible host, saying that I haven‚Äôt offered him any food and it was rude to not make a bed for him.

I told him that he was welcomed to take anything from the fridge and cabinet since the day we got back which was Tuesday. All he has done is sleep in my room during the day and has barely interacted with me.

He hasn‚Äôt talked to me at all and my family is heading to the movies right now with him in the car.

"AITA for getting angry at my mom I feel like I should preface this by saying that I am a sophomore in high school (16 y.o.) and still living with my parents (obviously)

&#x200B;

As this past week was thanksgiving, my grandparents were in town, which made everything a lot more stressful, as drama seems to follow them. Everyone has been super worn out, and it‚Äôs been difficult for all of us. It doesn‚Äôt really help that I have been going through a weird antisocial phase as well (super tired, not wanting to talk to anyone, but not really depressed- different feeling). So, I have been using my phone as a distraction, though all I really want to do is stay home. My mom has grown increasingly upset at this, to the point where she has started to take my phone at random points in time. I don‚Äôt really have any issue with this, as I see her point, but when I still don‚Äôt really want to do anything, she gets even more upset. I have been sleeping until like 2 in the afternoon for the past week. Not sure why, as that is like 12 hours of sleep. Yesterday, when she woke me up to go to thanksgiving lunch/dinner, I kind of snapped at her, saying how tired/done I was with everything. Nonetheless, As soon as I got up I felt terrible about snapping at her and sent her a text apologizing for attacking her, and that I knew that she was just trying to help me and I was being a jerk.

&#x200B;

Today, just now, I have been working on some stuff for a play I‚Äôm trying out for. I was in the kitchen making myself some Mac and cheese when she came in, made a snarky comment about me being on my phone (this is pretty normal for her tho) and asked if she could hear the song I was trying out with. I explained the song, and she says ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt you do a song you know?‚Äù And I explained that I did know the song and she was like ‚Äúwell I‚Äôve never heard you listen to it before‚Äù and I just kinda shrugged it off. I then asked if she wanted to hear it and she said yes. I kinda struggle a bit while singing and get flustered. When I finish, I look up at her and she is standing there, arms and legs crossed, head tilted slightly sideways and the. I‚Äôm already upset, so I‚Äôm like ‚Äúdude what the heck‚Äù and she then denies that she was doing that and immediately claims that I have been attacking her a lot. I bring up the fact that she often does things and then says that she didn‚Äôt afterward. I then realize that I don‚Äôt really want to be in this situation, as it‚Äôs kind of standard in my household that my mom never loses an argument, so I just quickly apologize that I don‚Äôt know why I was upset, sorry. She then starts to walk out, turns, and said something to me that really rocked my core ‚ÄúYknow, I feel like I‚Äôm being abused by you. You keep doing this, then apologizing afterward.‚Äù I don‚Äôt even know what to say to that, so she just leaves.

"AITA for telling my friend I don't care about her boy problems? So I (16F) have a friend (15f) who is a huge boy magnet (i'll call her NA).

Anyways she started talking to this one guy known as the ""Freshman Slayer"" because of how many freshman girls he got with. He's 19 for context (i'll call him FS). I had advised NA to stop talking to him because clearly he only wanted to date her for one purpose but she didn't care. She ignored all red flags about FS (he would blow her off all the time, he invited her out to eat with some of the other freshman girls he had been in relationships with, and some other things). I told her multiple times that dating FS was a bad idea and she shouldn't do it but she didn't listen. They dated for about a month before she found out that he was talking to like 10 other girls and having casual hookups with 5 of the girls. This happened on the 24th and she called me crying today telling me how much she missed him. I told NA that I had advised her not to date him and she still did so I wasn't going to listen to her cry over a guy that never really wanted to date her for her.

"AITA for lying about disliking a necklace because I didn‚Äôt like the sales assistant? It‚Äôs my MIL‚Äôs birthday next week and my husband and I went to look for a gift for her on Friday.

We were supposed to meet once he was finished work but he was running late so I started looking around by myself. I was looking at a necklace and asked a sales assistant if I could take a closer look but she told me they weren‚Äôt allowed to take that particular necklace out, which I thought was weird but I never said anything.

I ended up going to a different department but my husband called me to tell me he was in the jewellery department and wanted to show me something. When I went back, that same sales assistant didn‚Äôt seem to have any issue helping him, she also was suddenly being super nice to me when she realised we were together. My husband was looking at the exact same necklace (she took it out for him) I had been looking at earlier and asked me if I liked it. I told him I didn‚Äôt think my MIL would like it because it wasn‚Äôt her style (this wasn‚Äôt a lie) but he said he hadn‚Äôt been looking at it for her but wanted to know if I liked it for myself. I lied and said no because, while I have no idea if she would make commission on the necklace, I didn‚Äôt want to give her the sale. The sales assistant offered to show us other items but I said no and we went to a different department.

My husband was disappointed I never liked the necklace because he was so sure I would‚Äôve so I admitted the truth to him and explained what happened with the sales assistant. He got upset with me for lying to him and said I shouldn‚Äôt have let her bother me or care if she got the sale or not. We ended up going back and bought the necklace from someone else and the sales assistant was giving me dirty looks the entire time.

"WIBTA if I get angry/tough with a company after they've stalled on fixing my power wheelchair.  

A little background- I've been disabled almost 30 years, and using a wheelchair.

My current power wheelchair was delivered a year ago, but a drive motor broke in July. I've been trying to get it repaired, but the company that sold it to me has been blowing me off since then, despite multiple attempts by my doctor to provide the necessary approval paperwork. The paperwork is needed to authorize the company to submit the repair request to Medicaid to cover it. I've talked with a Medicaid rep, who has confirmed that indeed, the repairs are covered, so it's all about getting the company to do what they are required to do.

The short version is that my doctor faxes them the required forms, I wait several days, or longer, company never calls to tell me they got the forms, I call them to ask about it, and they quickly tell me they never got the faxes. This has been repeated over the past 5 months.

I'm done being patient with them, and I'm planning to send them an email being harsh, terse, but as professional sounding as I still can be, that I \*expect"" them to do the repairs, no more bullshitting about technical problems, or blaming other people- or the pandemic- for the endless delays and stalling.

"AITA For asking the bookkeeper at work to leave a tip? This just happened, and I'll asked her in the morning about the bill, with your help.

So I work as a kitchen manager/chef in a brewery.  We don't have a huge menu, but we do have brewboards, like charcuterie but more matching beer pairings.

My bookkeeper messegen be earlier asking if I'm working, wanting me to make a large board, as I know what she likes so I'll make it best. I said yes, made it so good, lots of extras. She got her friend to pick it up, and they thought it looked amazing.

So I just got off work, the servers wanted to ask me about the bill. I did not know staff food was %50 off, she asked for the discount, and she is on the payroll. But she left no tip. The bill was $32, her friend payed $16. That's barely breaking even for the food, and puts the server out of tips.

Can I ask her to even out her bill, and if so how? Either way I'm giving the server $5, that's that's I have in cash.

EDIT:The book keeper is behind the scenes, does not come in unless she can't get the pay period sent to her. She had a friend come in to pay.

I think it might be best to just let her know we can't give her %50 off, just %20? 

It's the server that wants me to tell them, but I do kinda agree with them.

EDIT 2: I should have worded it WIBTA, IF I brought it up(I have not and will not). I do agree, and I never wanted to let her know, but the servers thought it was rude. If she orders food again, inside or to-go I'll let her know she can have %20 off, not %50. Turns out she never tips, even inside.

"AITA for telling off my 11 year old cousin for agitating my 4 yo daughter? Context: my (37M) wife's 11 year old cousin (11M) is staying with us for two weeks. His parents and older sister are in Spain for a holiday, but he is unvaxxed and he says he doesn't care for Spain. 

To pre-empt - I did not suggest he stay with us, it was kinda foisted upon me. I however did not protest or disagree either.

Also, I live with my mother in law. The 11 year old is the son of her younger brother. 

I have a 4 year old daughter. She doesn't like to sleep, and the more tired she gets the less she wants to sleep. All quite normal, and we've created a routine where we will calm her down and get her mentally ready to sleep - she brushes her teeth, puts on her jammies, I read stories to her, my MIL comes in and puts her to bed. 

With the cousin around though this is a bit more complex. My girl loves her uncle a lot, and loves to play with him. When it comes to winding down time though, it's not ideal cos she remains very jazzed up. 

Last night, after a very exciting day at the water park, she was v tired (of course) but couldn't sleep till the cousin had left to go shower. I raced her to the bathroom, went through the routine, read her her stories and tucked her in. Suddenly, I hear the door open and there the 11 year old is, standing there ""just to say hello"". 

This is where I might be TA: I told him off, ""come on she's just about ready to sleep, you're winding her up! Get out!"" He giggled and walked out. Thankfully my daughter didn't follow him, but I was so annoyed. AITA?

"AITA for not sharing a $140 tip?    I work at a restaurant in a country club. My coworker came in to work the breakfast shift at 7 and I came in at 11. When I get there, she has one table and two bar guests, all of which are people who frequent the club. She asks to transfer the table to me, and she cashes out her bar guests. The bar guests tip her, and she gets an automatic 18% gratuity on everything they ordered from her. I do not know how much they tipped her.
   They want to stay and drink, so she asks if I can take care of them. I make them drinks and chat with them, put their food order in. Each time I walk away, he tells me ‚Äúnice butt.‚Äù I was annoyed, but sadly working in a country club, comments like this are not uncommon. I knew he was drunk, I see him everyday and he isn‚Äôt usually like this so I don‚Äôt say anything. 
   I go over there and one of them gives me $20. I thank him and look at his friend who was previously making comments about me and tell him he should be the one tipping me since he wants to be rude. The man who already tipped said he would take care of it and hands me another $20, but his friends hands me a $100 as well. I was not expecting this, but I was damn sure happy about it. It‚Äôs the holidays, I just paid my rent and I could use the extra money.
   I go back to the bar where my coworker was and tell her what happened because I was happy and honestly found it humorous. My coworker is immediately pissed. She storms over to their table and asks them why they didn‚Äôt give her $100. I thought about giving her $40, but I was honestly shocked by her reaction. I go back over there to check on them and they ask me if I will split the money with her since she‚Äôs angry. I tell them sure and go to try to find her. That‚Äôs when I realize that she left. She didn‚Äôt do any side-work or anything. 
   Now I‚Äôm a bit mad. I‚Äôm debating whether I should give her anything because if I wouldn‚Äôt have said anything I wouldn‚Äôt have had to split it, and when I tried to, I see that she left me without saying anything or doing any of the things she should have before she left. I decide I‚Äôm going to just take it home and think on it. If i decide to give her some money, I‚Äôll bring it to work next time we are on the same shift. If I decide not to, I‚Äôll keep it. Everything is cool. Until things escalate. 
   My boss calls me and asks about what happened. I tell him. He then proceeds to tell me that she is crying and what I did was ‚Äúshady.‚Äù He said that I need to split the money with my coworker. I will admit, I did not tell him that they later asked me if I would split it with her. I was mad that she left without doing anything, that she didn‚Äôt talk to me about how she was feeling so we could work something out, and now I was mad that she called me boss crying because someone tipped me better than they tipped her.

My mom has a lot of siblings, and now has a lot of nieces, nephews, grand nieces, grand nephews, etc. mom and I are master gift givers, and shopping together is a favorite activity of ours when I visit (I live a few hours away).

"AITA for disappearing on Thanksgiving So my wife and I had her family (parents and brother and his wife) over for Thanksgiving, and like most every other Thanksgiving story goes, boy was it a turkey.

To begin with, they have a very close knit, almost tribal family. Try as I might for years, I always felt sidelined, and they make that abundantly clear. For example, if my wife leaves the room and I'm still having dessert? Everyone leaves with her. At the end of the day, as we are all sitting in the middle of a conversation and she says she has to go to bed early, suddenly everyone leaves as well. And the best one? If we go somewhere in two cars, one ends up being a clown car, and in the other? I'm driving by myself.

All those examples were from just this last week. Maybe I'm old fashioned, but I was taught that when you are a guest, you follow the host's lead at dinner within reason. Take this for example. On Thanksgiving night, as we were finishing dinner, I insist we have some dessert. Barely a minute later, my brother in laws wife (in her late 20s), abruptly gets up and announces that she is going to take a twenty minute nap (actually 2 hours). Her husband follows her shortly after, and then, so do the in laws. So no dessert I guess...?

At least this is better than the other nights if their visit, where in the middle of dinner at the dinner table, while I was still finishing up my own dinner (everyone for some reason started eating before I had a chance to sit, while I was still bringing out food), the same person would abruptly leave to go watch TV without saying anything. Everyone would follow in a span of a few minutes, while I was still eating. I'd try to continue my conversation with my in laws, but they'd do so with a foot out the door... At least my wife would stay a moment longer, look apologetic, and quickly follow her family.

That's not even getting to the part where my wife's brother and wife would barely engage me in conversation (almost every attempt was made by me, and would only get short, closed-ended responses.

And to cap it all off, on the last day, my wife's parents thanked me for their stay, which was appreciated, her brother said it was a nice house, and his wife? She just walked into my wife's car without a word.

Anyway, those are just some of the weird things I noticed throughout the week that led me to refuse to spend anymore time with them than I had to. This was after the second dinner, after basically being abandoned mid meal twice. While I was polite and asked them how their day was, I only joined everyone for dinners, otherwise spending the week in my home office. I really tried to avoid dealing with them as much as I could. So am I the asshole here? Sounds loaded, but I wanted to know if I was being too sensitive.",0.01
"AITA for letting my friends kind of bully this guy who was interested in me? A year ago, I was close friends with this one dude in my calc class. He was really nice, but he really just wasn't my type. We had a nice friendship though. Then, it turned out he was interested in me all along and asked me out, but again, he wasn't my type. I told him so, but after that our relationship got really weird. 

We were still friends, and we'd hang out, but when we were together (alone) he'd get handsy and put his arm around me, or 'joke' about us being together. (Ex. watching a couple in a show, he'd say ""that could be us"" or a kissing scene, he'd say ""i'd do it better if you want me to show you""). It was really uncomfortable, but I'm a really not-confrontational person, so I didn't know how to deal with it. I'd just push his arm off, or push his hands away, ignore his comments. I really liked him as a friend and I didn't want to lose that, but I didn't want to deal with his weird antics either. 

I started asking my friends to come along, to make it less weird. They never outright bullied him, but they'd reply to his comments with ""that's cringe"" or ""you're weird for that"", and sit between us because they knew contact with him made me uncomfortable. I was really grateful, but I feel selfish now because I wasn't really thinking about how he was feeling. 

Randomly two weeks ago, he disappeared. He stopped replying to my texts, didn't show up for class, and so on. It turns out that he either dropped out or is taking a gap year (a friend of mine who knows his sister told my friends), and it's because he just felt like he had no friends and was really lonely. I feel like part of that was my fault. I tried reaching out to apologize, but my friends told me not to and that he deserved it.

It has been like this for 3 years now, and I've never once had it cause an unsafe situation, nor has it gotten worse. My car is cleared as road safe by mechanics, and I've never been in an accident.

This past weekend, my friend and his new GF went clubbing and got pretty drunk. Since neither could drive, they didn't want to pay for an Uber and I live fairly close to the club they were at, they asked me for a ride. I said yes. My friend has been in my car several times before, and is well aware of its condition. The GF had never been in my car.

I pick them up and drive them to his house, which was about a 30 min drive, since I avoid the highways. The entire time, she is very loudly complaining about the car, and is clutching the oh shit handles constantly. Every time the car made a thunk (fairly common, like 2x a minute in some places) she whimpered or yelled. It was a very awkward ride, and at the end they silently leave my car and my friend doesn't even say thank you. 

The next day he told me I made his GF extremely uncomfortable, said that I should get my car fixed immediately, and that it was an AH move to drive such an unsafe car. He basically accused me of endangering their lives.

I admit, I got pretty pissed because 1) He ASKED me to drive him knowing the condition of my car and 2) my car is not unsafe. It looks like shit and sounds scary, but I know how it handles, I take care of the essentials and I don't drive in dangerous conditions/places. So I yelled at him a little bit for being ungrateful and being overly deferential to his GF, and now he isn't speaking to me.

Am I TA?

TL;DR: I drive a beater. Last weekend I gave my friend and his new GF a 30 minute ride home, and they are accusing me of driving an unsafe car and being an AH for endangering their lives.",0.13
AITA for getting mad at my husband for not helping more with the baby? [deleted],0.08
"AITA if I don‚Äôt show up to work tomorrow? I (25F ) work in a veterinary clinic as a receptionist, but at the moment we‚Äôre super short staffed so I‚Äôve been trying to help out where I can doing reception, technician and kennels so for the past 3 weeks I‚Äôve only had Sundays off and maybe a afternoon that isn‚Äôt guaranteed. And we‚Äôre also in the process of training someone for my position so I‚Äôll be changing to a technician position. Just a short story on the situation we‚Äôre in at the moment. We have 3 receptionist, myself, coworker A and coworker B. 

Coworker B is a great worker and I have no problem working with her, we split tasks and we get along very well. But recently she‚Äôs been asking me to work her shifts or swap shifts with her because of her boyfriends son. I understand she sees him as her own and cares for him without a doubt. But it‚Äôs either they don‚Äôt have a baby sitter, the son is sick or he‚Äôs hurt himself which obviously no one can control. But she is not the only adult/parent that can look after him. Tuesdays are my scheduled days off, and she asked me to switch, so I work Tuesday and she‚Äôll work on her day off for me on Thursday. And I‚Äôve been trying to get some personal things done that I can only get done during office hours which aren‚Äôt on Sundays, and I tried explaining that to her and she didn‚Äôt get upset but more like tried to guilt trip me into working for her. So I told her I can go in after my personal business is done and I get ‚Äúwell I don‚Äôt have anyone else to watch the kid‚Äù. I‚Äôve talked to my coworker/manager and he said I don‚Äôt have to work but I know how stressful working receptionist is alone so I don‚Äôt want to screw over Coworker A, but at the same time I don‚Äôt want her to think anytime she asks me to work for her I‚Äôm going to. I don‚Äôt mind it every now and then but it‚Äôs been almost weekly to every 2 weeks now.

"AITA for buying a poinsettia? I live with two roommates who live downstairs, and I occupy the upstairs of the house. One of my roommates friends (not my friend) came in the house the other day and saw that I had bought a poinsettia plant for the Holidays. She then said that I was a bad cat owner for buying the poinsettia because it is toxic to cats. 

I consider myself to be a good pet owner. I took this cat in from the street, got her spayed and vaccinated, play with her every day, trim her nails, only pet her when she wants it, and respect her. I have savings to pay emergency vet bills. She eats high quality wet food and plays with any of her many toys to stay amused. Also, my cat is very smart, and she doesn't eat plants.

"AITA for not defending my husband against my parents. TLDR: AITA for not defending my husband against my parents and thinking that issues he has, he should bring it up with them himself?

My (f36) husband (m44) does not get along with my parents at all. It‚Äôs gone that bad that any mention of them is a trigger for him to spout off on how much he dislikes them. 
So basically my parents haven‚Äôt been in touch with him for about 5 months now. They were privy to some things he has said about them.

The first problem began 4 years ago when my parents were over and we were having a discussion about things to do with a sibling of mine, of which I‚Äôm no contact with, my mother made a comment to my partner about something to do with being a Christian and showing love, he took offence to it and walked away. He came back to the discussion to say that he had been tempted to kick them out but obviously he didn‚Äôt and we came at an impasse and that wasn‚Äôt discussed again. My parents took it on the chin. 


So a couple of years ago, my mother made a comment in jest about our daughter. (Being an unfriendly toddler üôÑ it was said in another language that we speak but not to be taken seriously.)
My husband took offense even though I didn‚Äôt, and he wanted an apology from my mother. It never came forth, and he was like if she can‚Äôt apologize then she can‚Äôt look after the kids. I told my mother this and she got so upset. Realizing this, my husband went to their house to apologize for the comment but the damage was done. 

They didn‚Äôt talk to him for months but they were overseas during this time anyway. In any case, my mother didn‚Äôt apologize in any form even as I appealed to them in a letter how much it bothered him and he hadn‚Äôt meant any harm saying what he did. He was just frustrated. 
I still entertained them and spoke to them while they were overseas, even though he was pissed off at them. 
 
There was some reconciliation up until this year. 

My husband feels like my parents don‚Äôt do enough, aren‚Äôt involved enough. He‚Äôs pissed that he feels like they get to be fun grandparents without putting in the hard yards of always being present. (Whatever that means.) like literally not helping out.  
To me, when they‚Äôd come past and entertain the kids, I was happy with that but he never was.  He felt like they could be doing more, especially around the house. My mum would help me and would try and get me to rest while she took care of things. 

In his opinion, they owe it to us considering what he has done for them. When they‚Äôve been away, he‚Äôs helped me tidy up their house. He and I did flat pack furniture together for their hobby farm 2 hours away, setting up the furniture.  So it‚Äôs not as if he wasn‚Äôt trying to be Involved. 

I don‚Äôt know what do. Is he justified? Am I an asshole wife for not defending him enough or for not washing my hands clean of my parents? 
In all honesty, I feel like he‚Äôs put me in the middle and it sucks. But I‚Äôll accept judgment, whatever it is.


ETA: Hey everyone, thank you for commenting on my thread and I apologize for not giving enough info. I thought I had enough considering there‚Äôs a word limit. 
All I can say is, is that I swear on 
my life that my parents have never intended any ill-will. They‚Äôre not around off enough for that anyway as they travel a lot of the time (pre-Covid). Definitely not like my older in-laws who I love dearly but stuck in their ways of family life. (Nothing wrong with that). 
I think he compares them, my parents and his. Like he has said it himself that I should consider his parents more my parents as they are always doing something for us.
I know material stuff isn‚Äôt important and this will be superficial but my parents love language are gifts, so they‚Äôve been very generous. Even now my parents have told me to consider my mortgage (I bought an investment property before I got married) paid off so I didn‚Äôt have to worry about it and could use the rent money to build with my husband later. 
I think they just rub my husband up the wrong way because if they can get along well with my in-laws and my BIL, why don‚Äôt they get along with my husband?

I really don‚Äôt know anymore, everyone. I accept all judgment, even the YTA because you‚Äôre right, spouses should support one another and spouses shouldn‚Äôt vent to family members about their SO.

I‚Äôm just desperate for clarity.

ETA 2: just last week my dad posted a picture of our daughter for her birthday on my side of the family‚Äôs WhatsApp group. That includes aunts, uncles and cousins. It doesn‚Äôt really bother me but my husband has said before that he doesn‚Äôt like it and has told my dad this. I said to my husband that I‚Äôll tell my dad that we didn‚Äôt appreciate the post but then my husband said to me not to. 
I spoke to my dad that day and didn‚Äôt mention it.

"AITA for leaving my husband for two months so I can go home So in advance: this might be a little lengthy, English is my first language 

So me and my husband got into an argument earlier with him saying that I‚Äôm the butthole for wanting to go back home for a little under 2 months.
To the backstory: I haven‚Äôt been home/been able to see my family for over two years because I was traveling for a bit and then a little virus appeared. This year my grandma passed away and I couldn‚Äôt go home to see her one last time and it just completely destroyed me. Of course my family is still devastated and we‚Äôre all trying to cope with it, although I‚Äôm having a really hard time.

So now I finally have the opportunity to go home for the holidays and I decided I want to go for about two months, so I can heal with my family and spend some time with everyone plus I just want to be home for a while since I‚Äôm very homesick and I just haven‚Äôt been myself.
My husband doesn‚Äôt really understand why I want to go home for two months, he said that one month would be more than enough and that I will be bored and annoyed if I stay with my family for so long. Of course he doesn‚Äôt want to be alone either and I feel horrible for wanting to leave him for so long and I‚Äôm going to miss him terribly. He also said that it‚Äôs not fair since he‚Äôs going to pay for everything himself for those two months, however I was planning on sending him grocery money so it‚Äôs not as hard on him (I wasn‚Äôt able to work for a long time because of immigration reasons but I‚Äôve always tried to work some mini jobs to help pay).

He says I‚Äôm a massive a**hole for leaving him that long, he also wants to cancel the plans to go to Disney with his family (we‚Äôre supposed to leave in 2 weeks!) because he doesn‚Äôt want to be constantly reminded that I‚Äôm going to leave him for a long time, he also doesn‚Äôt want to talk to me.

"WIBTA for cancelling me and my Partner's Anniversary Dinner? I (23M) have a partner (22F) and our 1st Anniversary is coming up. I have been saving up to take her to this very expensive spot, and I have been planning for weeks. However, 2 days ago, my Grandma (who I was very close to) passed away. Our Family is not that well off, and my Mum has asked us to put in for the Funeral Expenses. I cannot afford the anniversary dinner if I put in money for the Funeral, so I told my Partner exactly that. She responded by saying ""that I wanted to go all year"" and that for me ""to detach myself from my family"". I told her I could not do that, and she started calling me names, and even said "" Is your Grandma more important to you than our relationship?"". I hung up right after she said that. Her friends are telling me just to go with her and forget the funeral, while I want to really help out my mom with the funeral expenses. Today, I asked my partner if we could go out to a less expensive but still exclusive place, yet she refused. I really do not know what to do.

"AITA for shouting at my dad I (18F) passed my birthday recently and my friends sent me a birthday cake. It was my favourite flavour and I was really happy that they remembered that I was disappointed in the past when the shop didn't sell the cake so they got it this time round. It was the only cake I got because my parents didn't get one.

I live in a college dorm but I head back for the weekend. The cake came just before I left to head back to school so I took a slice and kept the rest. Anyway when I got back the next week the entire cake had been eaten by my brother (17M). I was pretty pissed and told him how annoyed I was but I generally wasn't overly attached to eating the actual cake more so than the thought that my friends put in so I didn't make a big fuss then.

The same day at dinner I told my brother I was still annoyed and my father heard it. He immediately intervened and started scolding me since I should have ""told everyone not to eat the cake"" and it was my fault for not making it clear. Thing is, my family knew my friends sent me this particular cake and I didn't tell them not to take it because I was fine with them eating it, but I didn't think the whole cake would be finished. Anyway I felt very aggrieved and this descended into a big fight and I left for college earlier.

My brother and I are old enough to settle our problems on our own and after I left he apologised and made it up to me. I was mainly upset at my father for intervening in our own conflict and for blaming me.

Turns out, he felt I was being ungenerous and he thought he raised me better than that where I shouldn't be squabbling with my brother over the cake. Again, I'm really not attached to the physical cake but more of how he ate the whole thing knowing that my friends sent it to me.

Here's where I may be TA: during the argument I swore and said ""WTF is your problem?"" and in general it wasn't a pleasant situation",0.22

"AITA for choosing a long song to take a shower to?

We got to choose the songs so I chose two relatively short songs (1:44 and 1:32 minutes, respectively and one very long song - 9:30.) My mother is now pissed off at me for choosing such a long song but I need time and I use cold water anyways...plus I do other things to cut down on water consumption.

"AITA for being aggravated by my partners need for emotional comfort? My partner expressed to me that I need to be more loving, give more time, talk more to him.

Currently I see him like once or a few times a week.. talk intermittently throughout the day but it‚Äôs mostly ‚Äúhow‚Äôs ur day‚Äù yadda yadda. (I‚Äôve spent a lot of time solo and I don‚Äôt make it a point to converse with anyone regularly so I quite frankly don‚Äôt know how to have lively text conversation)

Recently he expressed he needs more from me and that if it was between being with me with how I am currently or be single having his female emotionally supportive friends, he‚Äôd rather be single.

I know it takes two people meeting in the middle for relationships to work but I feel like he NEEDS me and that automatically drains me even thinking about.  I don‚Äôt NEED him, I don‚Äôt ask much from him, I enjoy just having his company.

He‚Äôs been through a lot, and has moments/days where things are just really weighing on him and what helps is that emotional support element.  That‚Äôs understandable but at the same time, I feel like leaning on me for that is a lot‚Ä¶

I was that ‚Äòemotionally supportive‚Äô person in the past in a previous relationship and it wore me down. I made excuses for actions/behaviors/substance abuse because he was ‚Äúgoing through it‚Äù. I just wanted to be there for him and it exhausted me.  And now, I just have such a low tolerance for people needing me and I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because I have actual boundaries now or if I‚Äôve created that as sort of a self preservation tactic because of the trauma I felt in the past.  I, myself, struggle with bad days and low moods but I handle it on my own and don‚Äôt depend on anyone to make it better.

So ya, I found myself being upset he expressed that and even vocalized it[edit: I voiced that I was upset and was wondering why I even had that response to him saying he needed more from me. I wasn‚Äôt upset that he was expressing himself]. I feel like I offer an adequate amount of time and just feel like he needs me more because he has more free time.. and I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs fair.

"AITA for pointing out my Cuban friend‚Äôs internalized racism? Since last September, I was friends with a Cuban girl who has Afro hair, brown skin, and Afro facial features too. It‚Äôs pretty common for Cubans to have African ancestry which is why many of them have Afro features. Hence, why the term ‚ÄúAfroLatino‚Äù exists. She is quite visibly partially black and it was rarely a topic until now. 

While I was hanging out with her and her friends today, she mentioned how some man at the bar called her ‚Äúblack‚Äù and it wasn‚Äôt the first time she makes a big fuss over being called ‚Äúblack‚Äù or even ‚ÄúAfro-Latina‚Äù as if being black (or even ‚Äúpartially black‚Äù) is a bad thing. I called her out today because I realized how much it bothers me that she denies her black heritage. 

I find all of this to be very problematic as someone who is partially black too, so I pretty much told her to stop trying to tell people she isn‚Äôt partially black. She prefers to be called just Cuban and hide her African ancestry as if it never happened. Wtf, that‚Äôs like Meghan Markle trying to tell us ‚Äòshe‚Äôs not partially black but just American.‚Äô Those friends of hers pretty much played  along with her internalized racism and delusion, and yelled at me for suggesting otherwise instead of just educating themselves on this matter.

"AITA for saying my in laws are not my parents So all this really came to a blow up at Thanksgiving. I‚Äôve never really gotten along with my step FIL. But since we moved, I‚Äôve been trying to get along with him. Helped him out around their house, their property, etc. Never actually received a thank you from him but whatever. 

So for Thanksgiving, my parents have moved to be with us in the same state. They are in the process of buying a house, so far now, they are living in their trailer. So we asked if my in laws would be willing to host Thanksgiving. I got the turkey ready. I brined it. Bagged it. Everything ready to go. I left instructions with my FIL as with the brining method, it should be cooked in a specific way. Upside down, 325 degrees and for about 5 hours. Usually less, but FIL likes to stuff the turkey, even though with brining it really shouldn‚Äôt. So I took into consideration the extra time with the stuffing. The night before he kept saying he knows how to cook a turkey and doesn‚Äôt need instructions. My wife and MIL kept saying he was joking but I had a bad feeling. As to why we didn‚Äôt cook it, our oven isn‚Äôt reliable. It probably would‚Äôve taken 12 hours to cook the turkey in our oven. 

Fast forward to Thursday afternoon, we head over and I go to check on the turkey cooking. Temp to high, over stuffed and not upside down. Needless to say I was pissed. I left and went for a walk. I did complain to my wife that I‚Äôm tired of trying to work with him. Helping out and attempting to be friendly and he can‚Äôt  do something as simple as cook a turkey I prepared the way I needed it. The only reason I ended up returning was because my parents saw me walking They said to ignore him and go eat. The only reason they even came was because they considered this a Thanksgiving my wife and I were hosting as we did the majority of the prepping. 

It‚Äôs now the following Tuesday. My MIL is trying to keep the peace but I feel she made it much worse. Her and my wife were talking and she tried explaining that they (both MIL and FIL) see us as their kids and they treat us as such (for the record I‚Äôm 41, my wife is 29 for the 5th or sixth time). I told my wife I find this condescending. For one, I‚Äôm not their kid. I have my own parents. I get what they are attempting to say, but that shouldn‚Äôt give them the right to just ignore things we have to offer, or feel they can do things better, just because they think I‚Äôm their kid. My in laws just feel that since they see us as kids, if they (mostly FIL) feels his way is better or just doesn‚Äôt want to do something, then he can because he‚Äôs the parent. My wife agrees as she feels this is how they show their love and it‚Äôs perfectly fine. I don‚Äôt agree.

"AITA for wanting my bf to come home with me instead of extending his vacation? My boyfriend (27M) and I (25M) have been dating for almost 9 months and it has been the greatest relationship I have ever had. I am from Africa and I moved to Europe over a year ago so I could study my Master's degree. I met my bf after I moved from one country to another (which was part of my course) and we hit it off quickly.

Ever since then, him and I have travelled to many places in the country we live in (but never outside). He is an avid traveller who has been to many countries and I have the same views, but I have been to fewer places than him due to past financial strain. However, when we travelled to local places together, we never separated in that time. We arrived there and left there together.

Now on to the issue... my bf and I have been planning on travelling to Thailand for the Christmas/New Year's period, which is my bf's favourite country and is a place that I have always wanted to visit. Part of what has made my Master's degree so intensive is the necessity for me to finish projects by a certain date. My time hasn't really been my own because of that.

My bf has insisted that a trip to Thailand should last longer than a month, but I don't have the time to spend that long away from home. I have projects due at the end of January. I told him that I couldn't spend longer than 3 weeks there, but he asked if I would be OK with us going to Thailand together and then him staying there after I've left. I told him that I honestly didn't like the idea.

There are a few reasons for this. First, I will not lie: I do feel somewhat jealous about him staying longer than me. But this isn't the main reason for my ambivalence. Second, this is the first major vacation that we are having outside of the country together. I feel it is only right that we start it and end it together.

And last, in the time that we have dated, my bf has been on vacations outside the country twice without me. I don't mind at all. I'm really happy that he has experienced these things that bring him joy, but this is our first time going on vacation like this together. And he has a tendency of making rash decisions without considering my feelings as his partner (like booking a two-week vacation a week before he was supposed to leave)

Therefore, his question about staying in Thailand after I've left sort of felt as though he was sidelining me.

My bf accepted my request and I thought I was justified until I spoke to a friend who mentioned that it was selfish for me to ask my bf to cut his trip shorter than he'd want just because I couldn't stay longer.

I don't ever want my bf to feel that I'm taking his dreams and joys away. I want him to be happy. At the same time, I feel sad when I think of taking a flight back home from Thailand without him, knowing that he will stay longer without me.

When she got better, I suggested that I get guardianship of him, just in case something happened to her and so I can make medical decisions and be privy to his information like a dad. I wouldn't want him to go to foster care. The point of taking him in was to prevent that.

She said she was deeply hurt at the suggestion and refused. My son was furious at me too. They said he's their responsibility. Irony is that he's with me full-time still and wants to keep it that way. My son mostly lives with his mom.

"AITA for blaming my obesity on my mum I (23f) am overweight and need to do something about it, this is the largest I‚Äôve been since stopping smoking, currently 5‚Äô2 and around 12st 8. I live with my parents who I generally have a great relationship with, other than this problem with my mother.

I don‚Äôt really know where to start with this as it always been somewhat of an issue. She‚Äôs always been hyper focused on weight with everyone but mostly me. The first time I dieted I was 16 and starting weight of 8.5-9 stone, and only done it because of my mums extensive ‚Äòencouragement‚Äô. I‚Äôve since been on and off diets, including ones based on ketosis that make me unwell, and have a very bad relationship with food. I believe I may suffer from binge eating disorder as I hide my food, and will binge until Im sick. Almost every diet I have been on is due to caving from the comments she makes to me. It started off with ‚Äúshould you really be eating that?‚Äù but it‚Äôs now the case that she will shout at me whenever I eat, her comments are harsher, with her more recently saying ‚Äúsurely ‚Äòtom‚Äô (my SO) isn‚Äôt happy with this.‚Äù It‚Äôs gotten to the point that every conversation we‚Äôve had for the past two years has consisted of talking about my weight.

I lost it today. I had an invasive procedure in the morning that left me light headed, and had taken extremely strong painkillers. I ate nothing because I knew she would comment. 5 hours later I opened a packet of crisps, the first and probably only thing i would eat today and she started again.

I screamed and cried. I told her (like I have multiple times) that she is making me hate myself, that her constantly bringing this up isn‚Äôt helpful and that any diet I have ever seen proper results from are the ones I chose to start on my own accord. She still wasn‚Äôt listening, continuing to call me unhealthy and that I‚Äôm on my way to a heart attack. I told her that my being overweight in the first place is partly due to her. That her demonising food and making eating such a taboo thing has made me form unhealthy habits (hiding food, binging), starting from when I was in a healthy weight range. I want to make it clear that the sole responsibility is not hers but I think she definitely had a part to play. 

I think I might be TA because my mum is heartbroken. She told me she hates herself if that‚Äôs what she‚Äôs done however she does not agree that this is the case. Im worried because if she doesn‚Äôt recognise her role then nothing will change. I love my mum, she is an excellent parent and given me a very good life outside of this. But I truly believe she‚Äôs deflecting her part in this and I can‚Äôt keep denying it for the sake of her feelings when she doesn‚Äôt seem to have regard for mine in this matter.

Tldr: mum essentially forced me to diet when I was healthy and now I can‚Äôt stop binging. She doesn‚Äôt think this is her fault.",0.85
"AITA for telling my father to stop making me his confidant My dad and I have a great relationship for the most part. He's always been a fairly quiet person and afraid to seek help when he needs it. 

His wife (my mom) died 20+ years ago so I've kinda been his best friend since then. Most times I love it, but as hes gotten older I noticed he's been telling me things that I feel like should be for a therapists ears and not his daughters.

He keeps telling me things hes insecure about (like his parenting decisions), mistakes he's made as a parent (contributing to some of my quirks and personality good and bad), to even things he regrets introducing me to, and how he should have kept me in church because, ""thats what he gets for not keeping his daughter in church."" 

I told him (loveingly and as kind as I could) that I love that he feels comfortable telling me things, I feel like those particular subjects need to be discussed with a mental health professional, because it is not fair as his daughter to begin to question all the things he taught me growing up--- it makes me question the foundations I was raised on and it was very upsetting for him to tell me things like that. 

It insinuates that he regrets the way he raised me (which makes no sense... I'm a 100% fully functioning adult who financially supports herself, is happily about to be married, I even have full time career while doing continuing education, and a 401k!! lol) 

He like, kind of took it well? I can tell he felt bad for making me emotional but the fact that he said it makes me feel like that is the way he actually feels. It's very confusing to be told things like this.

"AITA (Hypothetical) for leaving the ""family business""? I own and operate a business with my brother.  What we do does not matter.  My brother and I built it from the ground up and have become successful in our neighborhood.  It's me, him, and 3 employees.  The business would have to be dissolved if I left (due to what I manage), and the business would have to be dissolved if my brother left (due to what he manages), basically it is a very tight run machine that if even one gear left, it would crumble.  If either of us wanted out, we would have to sell it.

Now, I don't plan on leaving, but, we live in a state I hope to soon get out of, to live a different life.  I would like to when the kids are grown, sell the house, pick something up in utah or wherever with a bit of land, and do what I do now, just out of my house on a ""income to help pay the groceries"" level.  Nothing near the 60+ hours a week I currently work.

Now, the big question.  When the time comes, and I want to move on, WIBTA if I went to my brother and told him I wanted out, which would basically force him to sell the business?

Some side info.  

He could do what he currently does if we sold, just it would be for ""corporate"".

IF we did sell, the amount of money after we split it would be very close to, or a insane head start into ""retirement"".

tl;dr - If I were to leave the family business, it would have to be sold - WIBTA if I left?",0.04
"AITA for trying to secretly sublet my apartment to get away from my close friend? I (22M) have been living with one of my close friends (22M) for a few months. We have not known each other very long, but we instantly became close friends after hanging out at a party last year.  It was super cool to have another close friend in the area, as the pandemic prevented me from meeting a lot of people in the area as I am pretty new here. 

My original plan was to live with my old roommate Nick again, because we got along great, have similar tendencies, but I was supposed to be in a different state right now for a job. Things changed last minute and Nick had already signed a lease with a couple of our other friends. I was not mad, it was my fault for not planning ahead. My now roommate, Grant, was still looking for a place so we decided to sign on an apartment together. To preface everything I am about to say, I am not the type to be super confrontational about cleaning or anything because I tend to leave my clothes around my room and am not the least cluttered person ever, but I do have some standards about stuff like dishes and genuinely ""dirty"" things. 

We moved in together in August and it was alright for the first couple weeks, but it seemed like he changed into an entirely different person. He no longer wanted to go out and party with our friends and started actively avoiding people we know. Abnormal, but he said it all checked out and he was just not vibing with them anymore. Whatever. But as he started spending more time in our apartment, more problems arose. First, he and his partner are slobs. They leave dirty dishes in the sink for weeks attracting flies and mold. I ask him to wash their dishes all the time, but blames the mess on his partner and forces them to come clean it each time, but they do not finish it and the cycle starts all over again.  This pisses me off. 

He also feels the need to criticize everything I do whether it be staying out too late or having people over before going out or refusing to stay in with him. He also criticizes the amount of showering I do because apparently it is ""too much"" even though water is included in our rent. 

Other than just general uncleanliness and childish behaviors, something recently has just sent me over the edge. He clogged our toliet and caused it to overflow, letting literal shit get all over the bathroom and did NOT call the plumber until almost 24 hours later. I was not able to shower or use the bathroom at all. When asked to clean it, he said he did, but last week when I decided to clean the bathroom the towel came out literally brown after wiping the toliet and floors. 

&#x200B;

He is still one of my friends at the end of the day and we get along in most other regards, but I cannot continue to live like this anymore. I talked to my friends here and back home and they all agree that he is intolerable sometimes and that subleasing would be the best but I feel so guilty anytime I even have the conversation with them. 

Am I the asshole for starting this process behind his back?",0.28
"WIBTA for refusing to limit the time my boyfriend spends at my home? I am a landlord-roommate and we live in a 3 bedroom house. When we first decided that they would be my roommates, we didn‚Äôt discuss SO issues because I wasn‚Äôt serious with my boyfriend at the time. Before moving in, however, I mentioned that my boyfriend would likely be ‚Äúpractically living with me‚Äù and if that bothered anyone. The answer was no, they didn‚Äôt care. We then all lived together with my boyfriend spending most of his time at my place with the exception of about 2 nights a week. After about a month, my bf and I were told by the roommate next to me, ‚ÄúB‚Äù, that she could hear our noises and that it was a bit awkward. Fair. I got a new bed frame and we made sure to tone it down. We received no more complaints.
Now, we had initially agreed to do base rent + split utilities, but because I know my SO would be around so much, I offered to split utilities 40/30/30. After the second month, the utility bills were still higher than they were hoping for, so they asked for a meeting to discuss the utilities. During that meeting, they expressly stated ‚Äúsince SO is living here, we think utilities should be split more.‚Äù We instead negotiated a set monthly rent which includes utilities that were lower in general so they wouldn‚Äôt have to worry about seasonal fluctuations, and they seemed happy with that. (My utilities are now around 60% with that change) 

Two months later, I got a text from one of the roommates asking to restrict how often my SO is at the house.
I was informed that we are too loud in general, that my SOs phone calls are too loud, etc. They made valid points, however, they had not brought any of this up prior to automatically resorting to restricting his visits.
I offered to talk to my SO and make sure that we were quieter in general, and see how they feel after a week. Just as a side note, my SO and I both try to make sure to stay out of the common areas so we aren‚Äôt hogging them, and both the roommates use those areas almost exclusively and frequently.
We had this conversation and the roommate next to us ‚ÄúB‚Äù agreed to the compromise. The same night, I told my SO about the issues they raised and we both agreed to be more considerate and quieter in general. However, despite us basically whispering during the whole conversation, ‚ÄúB‚Äù let us know she could still hear it and wanted to write up a roommate agreement to restrict SO visits in general (her bf is long distance, the other roommate is single)

"AITA for getting my mom soap for her birthday? my mom is a hard person to shop for so every year on her birthday i get her the same thing, a nice little gift basket full of fancy soap, lotion, perfume, bath bombs, etc.  i figured because she works so hard she could use it to relax. 

this year i gave her her gift and she looked really disappointed. i asked her what was wrong and she told me i keep getting her the same thing while i give my siblings different stuff on their birthdays. i told her it was because they‚Äôre kids and their interests change making getting stuff for them easy. she never asks for anything so i just go with whatever works. 

she also mentioned that buying someone soap implies that they smell bad and she‚Äôs been holding off saying that for years. i told her i get them for her because it‚Äôs a quick and easy way to relax when you have a busy schedule but she still took offense to it.

i‚Äôve been thinking maybe getting her the same thing every year isn‚Äôt really that thoughtful and i should make more of an effort but at the same time the stuff i get her is expensive and she should probably just be thankful. none of my siblings get her anything at all. 

still, am i a bad son?

"AITA for making my mom angry while driving This is gonna be rather long so bear with me

I'm 15M and I have my driver's permit but not my license. Whenever I drive with my mom (which is like 90% of the time I drive) she lets me know way too many obvious things, like ""you're going 50"" when the speed limit is 45 and I'm actively decelerating, ""slow down"" when there's a red light a pretty long way ahead, ""stay in your lane"" when I'm already in my lane, and other stuff like that. I get really annoyed by this but I never have an outburst or anything, I just say ""I know"", sometimes in an annoyed tone. One time she got *really* mad at me for telling her ""I know"", so she started yelling at me. When I calmly told her to stop yelling so I could concentrate on driving, she kept yelling and the second time I told her to stop yelling she told me to pull over so she could finish. I did, and she reiterated what she'd been saying several times, and when it was clear that I didn't agree (even though I didn't talk back to her) she had me switch with her so she could finish driving instead of me. Then, today, I was driving somewhere and she kept telling me a bunch of stuff that I already knew, as usual, only this time she started getting really annoyed with me and the things she was telling me were more pointless than usual, almost like she was trying to provoke me (idk if this is the case though). Eventually she started yelling at me, so I got fed up and started yelling back. She told me to pull over and switch, telling me that I'll have to finish my 50 hours of driving with my dad because I won't be driving with her anymore (I only have 18 hours so far and my birthday's in July, and since my dad has a job during the day it'll be harder to find time to drive if I can't drive with my mom).

"AITA for telling my 7 year old neice that Santa isn‚Äôt real? To call the neighborhood I(28F) currently live in ‚Äúfestive‚Äù, would be an understatement. My brother(26M) also lives in this neighborhood. Him, his wife, and their 1 year old had to take an emergency trip to visit her sick family but because of updated COVID restrictions, they can‚Äôt get back until January 9th. So I was left to take care of niece during the holidays. A couple days ago, I went to pick her up from school and she was obviously upset  when I asked her why, she said her friends were speaking about their previous years‚Äôs gifts from Santa and started laughing when they heard hers. My brother and sister-in-law are financially stable however definitely not nearly as wealthy as the people in this neighborhood(the house was an inheritance). As a result, my niece doesn‚Äôt have the same type of gifts that her classmates typically have.  She sadly came to the conclusion that Santa liked her less. I obviously couldn‚Äôt let her just believe that, so I told her the truth about Santa not being real and promised to let her pick out whatever she wanted this year as a gift. She honestly looked way more relieved afterwards. I asked her not to tell her classmates but there is only so much trust you can put in a 7 year old. The next day, I go to pick up my niece from school again and are met with an angry mother at the parking lot. It was clear that the Santa thing spread around. She passive-aggressively said that I ‚Äúruined the fun of Santa for a bunch of children‚Äù and also that my brother‚Äôs ‚Äúlack of money is not a reason to ruin everyone else‚Äôs fun.‚Äù  Her kid and several others is no longer allowed to speak to my niece.

"AITA for making a bingo about how much mom talks about her colleague? My mom talks about this colleague a lot.

It is cute in an annoying way. 

My brother and I Made a bingo out of it. We made grids and filled it with stupid shit like 'cute  outfit', 'shutdown sexist' and ' smiled at mom'. We have been playing for weeks and my brother finally won and he ended up telling her what we have been up to. My brother and I are 17 and 15. 

She got really upset and said it was a mean thing to do. She doesn't talk about the colleague anymore and honestly that kinda sucks because  she is really happy when she is talks about her.

"AITA for not letting my seat to another student, leading to my friend and the classroom feeling uncomfortable ? Throwaway bc my friend knows I have Reddit. 

Me (20F) and my friend (21F) went to class but therr was no seat on the front row, were we usually sit. So naturally we had to go sit elsewhere.

Fyi, I am not particularly in love with front rows but in this class, there‚Äôs a group of studying that just talk so much in the back rows and it makes me lose focus easily + I hate background noises like this especially in class and almost no one ever tell them to be quiet. So I usually try to avoid them as much as possible and my friend happily follow me for that too. 

We were getting ready for class etc and this girl, from this one loud group I mentioned, go straight to us. At that point, the class hadn‚Äôt started yet bc the professor wasn‚Äôt there yet but she was still technically late (time wise at least). 

And she goes : ""Hum, that‚Äôs my seat right here, I always seat here and I need to charge my phone on this plug right there."" No hello, no sorry, no please.

So I just tell her to find somewhere else to sit because there was still some seats left and that if she wanted to charge her phone I wouldn‚Äôt mind her leaving it there and taking it back at the end of the class. A student close to us also told her there was another plug that was free on the other side of the classroom. But she keeps going ""no I think there‚Äôs a misunderstanding, that‚Äôs my seat right here"". 
My friend then packed her things, apologized to that girl, and just disappeared, looking for somewhere else to sit.

But since I found that ridiculous I just went : ""Sorry but I got there first, you have plenty of other seats left. We‚Äôre not in kindergarten anymore, you will be fine not having your ""assigned"" seat for an hour or two."", put my earphones and got back to minding my own business. 

The girl said nothing for thirty seconds and then started throwing a tantrum about how she won‚Äôt be able to focus in class now thanks to me and how my friend was so much kinder than me, making the whole class looks at us.

After that, I spent the entire class at that sit, not knowing where my friend was and being pissed about her lack of willing anyway. 

So I wait for her at the end of the class and ask her why she did so and she says I was childish for not leaving my seat to the girl and disturbing the class (even tho the professor wasn‚Äôt even there yet). And she tell me I was an asshole for it and that I embarassed her and made her and the while class uncomfortable.
I think that‚Äôs ridiculous because that student was acting like a child.

"AITA for getting angry at my ex for not going to his parents tonight like he said he was? This is a bit long and I apologize in advance.

I (21f) live with my ex (21m) in an apartment with 2 other guys. We broke up because of trust issues but stayed friends. 

Things were fine the first few months after we broke up (we broke up in July and I'm stuck on this lease till may 2022) but then he quit his job and suddenly he never leaves the apartment and I never have space from him. 

He has a problem with not knocking on my door and will just waltz in here and start talking to me. He also will still act like we're dating sometimes (say he wants to merry me, how he only wants me, calls me his girlfriend, trys to cuddle me, etc) and I always need to remind him we aren't dating anymore. This is particularly annoying recently as I'm trying to date again. He also has no respect for people's time and never has. He doesn't time manage, ever, and I'm surprised he was never fired with how many times he went to work late. 

On to the issue.

Yesterday he said he was going to his parents house today for the night. I was thrilled, I haven't had space away from him and to myself in months while he gets the place to himself every day as I work 40 hours a week + I have my university courses on campus. 

I messaged him several times today from work about his plans to leave and he promised he'd be gone before I got home.

Guess what? He was sitting on the couch when I walked through the door. 

I was of course very annoyed as I had a night of pampering myself planned as I had been wanting a night to myself for ages. He noticed I was upset and bugged and pushed my buttons on why I was upset until I snapped and said ""I just wanted to be alone tonight! Why can't you just do the things you say you're going to do instead of changing all your plans around and ruining any plans I made around YOUR plans!"" He got upset and said ""well I took to long to leave so there's no point now"" 

This really pissed me off because it meant the only reason he didn't go today is because he once again, decided not to watch the time. This has been a constant issue of his and its impacted me negatively in the past (forgotten to pick me up from places, makes me late to events, etc). Then he had the nerve to ask if I wanted a hug (for the third time during that conversation) and i just snapped back ""NO! I want to be ALONE! I was supposed to be ALONE! So leave me ALONE!"" He finally left my room but the night is ruined now as he could just decide to bug me whenever he likes, and he will, because he sucks.

I went and got water from the kitchen a few minutes ago and I could tell he was mad at me. I hate when people are mad at me but I think I'm in the right.

AITA for reaching my limit, wanting time apart from my ex, and yelling at him a tiny bit about wanting to be alone? I mostly just want to know if I should be apologizing as I guess he technically did nothing wrong.

Edit: I'm accepting that we both are assholes here. I'm going to figure out a way to find space for myself without forcing him out of the apartment. Thanks guys ‚ù§",0.24
"AITA for texting my friends mom EDIT: clarified what I did before messaging my moms friend to clear up some confusion about me messaging mutual friends

So way back at the end of April I went out with a friend to build a bear. They seemed slightly upset with something when I picked them up, but they seemed fine by the time we got to build a bear and we ended up having a great night.

The next day, I was leaving for a road trip and then a flight the next day I was back from the road trip. Before I left on my road trip, I noticed my friend had left their wallet in my car. I brought it in to my house and told them where I left it and that they could pick it up while I was gone, because I didn‚Äôt have time to drop it off to them before I left. 

Flash forward two weeks, and I‚Äôve heard nothing from them. I was pretty worried so I kept messaging them, but I wasn‚Äôt getting a response. I asked a mutual friend to contact them and they replied with a brief message to the friend that they had got their wallet, but they never messaged me back. 

I was really worried at this point. This has never happened with us before. We‚Äôd never really had any big fights or anything so I had never experienced this with them. They also had a history of not so great mental health, so radio silence was really concerning to me, especially because we hadn‚Äôt fought or anything. 

I tried reaching out to mutual friends first to see if they were able to get ahold of them and see what was going on, but they also got radio silence. 

So I texted a mom, asking if they were okay. It was nothing personal, a very short conversation just confirming they were okay. I just wanted to know they were alive. The whole exchange was literally 3 texts total and very brief, and I hadn‚Äôt mentioned anything about their mental health. Just that they hadn‚Äôt been talking to me recently and I was just wondering if they were okay. 

After that I finally received a message from my friend saying that texting their mom is weird before they subsequently blocked me. I tried messaging them a few times on different platforms and was blocked each time. I had the mutual friend ask about the situation for me, and communication was cut with them too. I tried (including the friend messaging) about 5 times to get in contact with them, and each time I was blocked. 

Today I emailed them just asking how they were doing and if they could provide some closure, not expecting a response. They replied saying that, ‚Äúwhen someone stops talking to you, the normal thing to do is not call their mom and bother them constantly.‚Äù They then said the only reason was that they didn‚Äôt (and still don‚Äôt) want to talk to me. 

While it‚Äôs hurts and is not the closure I was looking for, I‚Äôm not going to the message them again. I just don‚Äôt know what happened, or if I did anything wrong. 

So am I the asshole for texting their mom to see if they were okay, and messaging them a few times after to figure out what is going on?",0.2
"AITA for smoking around my boyfriend? I (21F) began smoking when I was 13 years old. My ex offered me my first cigarette, and I've been smoking rather casually ever since. I don't consider myself an addict, and I only smoke around a pack a month. I'm also fully aware of all of the health risks and impacts that come along with being a smoker, and I've made the choice to continue the use.

 I started dating my current boyfriend (24M) around 6 months ago, and we began talks of moving in around 4 months into our relationship. About 2 weeks ago he moved in, and I'm really enjoying it. The downside is, he hates smokers. His mindset is that I am an addict, and I chose that fate for myself. His Great Aunt died of lung cancer, and he thinks that even if you smoke just one cigarette, you're damning yourself to eternal pain.

Nevertheless, He hates the smell of my apartment because of the traces of smoke. He's started telling me that I taste like smoke every time he kisses me, and that all my clothes smell ""like addiction"". I understand not wanting to smell my secondhand smoke, but he brings it up every fucking minute.

I sort of want to quit anyways, but I don't think that I like this side of him that I'm seeing. I talked to him about this a few days ago and he blew up at me. He told me that it was just the nicotine talking and that I should ""go to rehab before it kills the both of us"", and that he doesn't even know if he loves me anymore.

I told him to get out, and he left. I haven't seen him in around 2 days, but I know he's sleeping on a friend's couch right now. Part of me wants to just apologize and quit smoking, because I really do love him, but I also hated the way he talked to me and treated me in that argument, and sort of the past week-ish.

"AITA I went on a trip with my best friends instead of a trip with my wife. Me and my friends have an annual trip type of thing. We do different places each year and each time its 3 - 5 days. So my wife wanted to go on a trip somewhere just the 2 of us but I couldn't because she said were going during the time ME AND MY FRIENDS ARE GOING ON OUR TRIP. I didn't just cancel on my friends because we rarely get to hang out anymore because of life and work. iv known these people since middle school so 17ish years so I'm not gonna let them down also we already booked flights and hotels already. I would go on a trip with my wife any other time but she picked that time specifically. Ever since I came back shes been giving me the cold shoulder and just acting pissed.

"WIBTA for going to a vacation trip with my bf even if my dad might not like it? Me (19f) and my bf (20m) have been together for 7 years. My dad doesn't entirely like him but he doesn't hate him either. My dad was pretty strict when I was younger between me and my bf but once i turned 18 my dad told me ""I could do whatever I want "". That's what I did,  or at least tried to.

Then my dad didn't like that (I just hanged out with my bf, I didn't do anything disrespectful or crazy,  just gave myself more freedom) I still had to ask my dad for permission on things like just hanging out with my bf, despite him telling me once I turn 18, I could do whatever.

He then changed it to paying bills once I had a job. I did that, got a job and paid my portion of bills (my phone bill and wifi). Eventually he gave me a bit more freedom but still demanded I ask permission until I pay rent. Now my bf is telling me that he planned an anniversary trip for us next year. I really wanna go but I gotta ask my dad permission. However, I now pay my portion of rent in my household so I feel like it's fair that I can be allowed to go to that trip and if my dad says no, I might not listen to him and still go because 1 I'm an adult 2 he told me I could do whatever once I'm 18 3 he's already let me sleep over with my bf or gone on a trip with his family 4 I pay my part of rent 5 I'm not a bad kid, I go to college, pay for my things/ school etc

"AITA after getting mad at my boyfriend over his kitchen? My (21F) boyfriend (21M) and I have been dating for 6 months. Recently, he got an apartment with his childhood best friend an hour away from our hometown. I still live at home with my mom due to my dad‚Äôs (and my mom‚Äôs husbands) recent passing. I drive to visit my boyfriend every weekend.

My boyfriend has been extremely stressed out lately. He has been working so hard on his senior thesis research project in order to graduate. He has forgotten about everything in his life these past couples of weeks, which has led to the neglect of quite a few things. The biggest? His kitchen. His kitchen looks like it hasn‚Äôt been cleaned in MONTHS! Built up dishes in the sink, nasty crusty bread still in the over, crumbs all over the stove, and a small infestation of ants in the corner. Last week, while he was at school, I took it upon myself to clean his whole kitchen. I cleaned every square inch of that fucking kitchen, and it looked spotless. I did this because I thought it would help him. I thought having a clean kitchen would make him feel happy and a little more normal, which it did. He was so grateful and happy, and so was the roommate. 

I came over today to visit my boyfriend and guess what? His kitchen is disgusting, once again. It looks like it did before, minus the ants because I was able to fully get rid of them. I took one look at this kitchen and lost my cool. My boyfriend asked why I was swearing and was upset, and I said that I worked so hard on this kitchen to clean it up, and it looks so gross now! He said, ‚Äúand? you don‚Äôt live here.‚Äù That made me furious. We banter back and forth a bit about the kitchen. Then, he was the right to say, ‚Äúand respectfully, we didn‚Äôt ask you to clean it. So it‚Äôs really not that fair to complain about doing something we didn‚Äôt ask you to do‚Äù My jaw dropped. I got more and more upset. He goes on to say that it‚Äôs not his fault, and it‚Äôs his roommates fault. He‚Äôs upset with me and I‚Äôm just upset about how much hard work I put into this kitchen, just to get disgusting again in one week.

I asked him to compromise by helping her move until dinner time then come to my aunts to celebrate. He said he doesn‚Äôt know when they‚Äôll be done and can‚Äôt.

"AITA for giving my dog the same name as my niece? I am not really one to care about dog names. I have a dog names centrifuge for example like usually I just give random names that I come up with on the spot. But this dog I had planned for a year in advance. At the beginning of 2020 I got in touch with a breeder to get my dream dog a beautiful clumber spaniel. The litter was born 10 weeks ago so this has been a plan for a looooong time. I have told everyone and I decided on the name ""Maybeline"". I told my brother and his wife about the name and they loved it. 

Fast forward and my SIL is pregnant and finds out it is a girl. We are all so excited and happy and wondering about the name and she said Maybeline. I didn't really think much of it at the spot but I did make a comment about how that is what my puppy will be called. My SIL took me aside and asked me if I can change the name to something else and I said I would think about it. 

Ultimately I didnt change the name and my dog is now called Maybeline. When I told my family everyone was so angry with me saying I was being rude and insulting my brother and my niece. I had planned this name before my niece was even conceived. I am not going to change it but am I being an asshole about it?

update: so we came up with a solution! I will call my dog may for short as a nickname while keeping Maybeline as her registered name. Also I am not allowed to tell everyone their daughter is named after my dog. Its a bit of a dumb agreement because British people will shorten the shortest of names. Your name is James? Not anymore Jay. Your name is Amy? Not anymore Ames. So their kid and my dog will just both be called May for short. I find this hilarious and I will not tell them this changes nothing.",0.1

Thing is I clean the litter box about every four days and empty it out and replace the litter every month. I went to my sister tonight about it and she just scoffed at me and told me I need more evidence to bring the cats to the vets. She digs her heels in the ground about it and wants me to tell her specificity what might be wrong with the cats.

"AITA for being upset with my long-distance best friend who I've visited for taking a trip somewhere near me, but not visiting me? My best friend K (F/22) lives in PA, I (M/24) live in FL. We've been best friends for about 6+ years, and we've been there for each other through a lot of things, including her transition and my depression. I booked a flight and visited her about 6(?, I'm bad with timeframes) months ago for vacation and we had an amazing time, and we agreed that next time she'd return the favor and visit me and we could possibly alternate. Yes, we have a mutual crush and we fooled around a bit while I was there, but neither of us believe in long distance so it never went anywhere. She also started dating a little while after.

&#x200B;

Lately she had been asking me a lot about Florida and it's theme parks, and eventually told me that she had booked a trip to Disneyworld/Universal in June, but didn't elaborate much more. There was an obvious elephant in the room as to where I would fit into the equation, but I think we were both scared to bring up the subject.

&#x200B;

Eventually she started telling me more about the plans for the trip, and she said that she's driving down, it would be over 5 days and her schedule is REALLY packed and I probably wouldn't be able to fit anywhere into it. She also told me that even if she had time, she wouldn't be able to drive to see me, because she's driving her boyfriends car and it's ""not her choice"". She said its possible that I could meet for a short dinner at some point if I drove up to Orlando, which is about 2 hours from me. I wasn't really satisfied with this because I feel like as her best friend, I deserve more than a one hour dinner if I'm lucky and she can find a place for me.

&#x200B;

I told her I was really hurt as a result of all this, and she explained that she does want to see me, but its not up to her (even though she's told me numerous times that she's paying for it and its her choice of destination). She also explained that its meant to be an anniversary/birthday trip for her boyfriend (my birthday is also in june :/ ). It turned into an argument and I'm currently not on on speaking terms with her (I was the one who cut contact).

&#x200B;

She thinks I'm acting unreasonable because she's taking a trip to Disneyworld, and there's no reason she should have to see me. 

&#x200B;

I understand its a trip with her boyfriend, and our relationship is a bit more complicated because we both still have feelings. But I just can't help but be really hurt because she's acting like she has no choice in this despite it being her choice of destination, which is really close to me. and I'm really hurt that my best friend who I took time to visit and meet is gonna be in my state without even trying to see me. I don't want to lose her, but I feel like this is a really hard snub to me, intentional or not, and I don't think I should be the one to come back and apologize. I don't expect her to change plans to include me, but I wish she'd be more understanding of my feelings and try to imagine how it feels almost extremely personal.

AITA for repeating what the store employee said to my wife? [deleted],0.19
"AITA for being upset over a jar of apple butter? I (22 F) may be the asshole because I complained to my mom (55 F) about my visiting uncle (68 M) because he ate a lot of my apple butter.

My family has always had a policy that if someone eats something in the house, we replace it and everything in communal spaces is free game. Even if it is something that someone else bought or a gift, you are supposed to accept the replacement and move on.

I have always hated this rule because I feel like it encourages taking without asking and negates the emotional connection people have with certain gifts. It can also seriously inconvenience someone if they want to use that specific food at that moment and now have to wait until the replacement can arrive. Not only that, but if someone put their hard-earned money into buying something, it really hurts to see that someone else got to it first.

My parents and sister (20 F) have always gotten irritated when I didn't agree with this rule or challenged it. I'm the only one in the family who has an issue with the rule and no one listens to me when I ask them not to take my food. It's gotten to the point that I have a secret snacks stash in my room where I keep my good stuff.

Now, the conflict:

Six months ago, my best friend (24 M) and I went on a big cross-US road trip and got to meet a lot of our Internet friends for the first time.

One of these friends (23 F) gave both of us jars of local preserves from where they live in Florida. I got a jar of apple butter, my best friend got a jar of strawberry jam. I brought the jar back to my home in California and put it in the fridge.

Over the last couple months, I finally broke into the jar and started to have some of it. No one else was eating it because I told my parents how much the jar meant to me, but I did use it in some recipes.

My uncle came to visit two weeks ago. When I went to check the jar today, over a third of it was gone from the last time I used it, which was before he arrived. I talked to my uncle and he said that he had been having apple butter sandwiches since he'd been here. 

I was annoyed and angry and went to go talk to my mom about it. I did not ask for them to replace the jar; I was only trying to vent about a frustrating situation. I did not want to confront him about it directly and I didn't want to come off like a food hoarder.

However, that's exactly how my mom took it. She proceeded to get mad and made some comments about how 'we opened our home to him' and 'we have a policy of sharing food' and 'we shouldn't have to ask every time we're hungry.' She mentioned that she 'needs time to process' this.

I don't want to talk to my uncle about it since he's only going to be here for three more days, but I also am upset. I can't just go and replace this apple butter and it has sentimental value. However, he is also a guest, the rest of the family's policy is that food is free game when in the kitchen areas, and I never told him explicitly to not touch it.

Am I the asshole?",0.88
"AITA: for telling my boss the truth and breaking up a marriage So bit of context. I (21f) work in an restaurant which has mainly male staff, this isn‚Äôt a problem they‚Äôre amazing and very protective.

I thought nothing if it, maybe he just felt more comfortable since I‚Äôd been there a while at that point. Anyway we start speaking more and more each shift but his English is limited as it‚Äôs his third language. One day I go into the kitchen and I say to one of the other guys that he was my favourite. Jack then went I‚Äôm not your favourite I‚Äôm your husband. I again thought nothing if it bc these jokes were not uncommon in the place I work. Fast forward a few weeks and he‚Äôs starting to tell me he loves me and misses me and we joke about it all the time, the other guys join in to but he starts to get annoyed if I joke too much with the others or hug them and wouldn‚Äôt speak to me for a few days. Anyway we continue this way for a few months but I began to notice he wouldn‚Äôt do it in front of our bosses or the other guys wives. Turns out this guy was married with kids and hadn‚Äôt told anyone and I come into work and he‚Äôs ignoring me so I ask why and he says I‚Äôve caused trouble with him and his wife!!! 
I say that‚Äôs not my problem and ignore him for the rest of the day bc what am I supposed to do? Anyway we sort it and he continues doing what he‚Äôs always done and tells me he prefers being around me and blah blah blah. I don‚Äôt hug or tell him I love him anymore but don‚Äôt stop him from doing it bc I realised he was gonna do I anyway
I later found out he‚Äôs told his wife it was all me so I decided enough was enough and I handed in my notice. My boss, who is more like a friend obvi wanted to know why so I told him everything and showed him text messages. Well he‚Äôs pissed that he‚Äôs lost a staff meme her and goes to this guys wife and tells her everything, incl things on the cameras that he‚Äôs seen.

Here‚Äôs why I think I might be the AH: I didn‚Äôt need to tell my boss the truth, I could have easily lied but my pride won out and I couldn‚Äôt help myself.

"AITA for selling some of my sisters dolls after she broke my laptop? My (25F) younger sister (19F) is currently away studying at college. Every since we were little she has been into collecting dolls and she still collects them now, having quite a big collection. She has a room at our parents house (I live there too) and keeps all her dolls there so nobody at college will know she has them and tease her for collecting them.

A couple weeks ago she came home for the weekend (this was late September and she was already in college as she got permission to move into dorms early) and the whole family got together at our house. During the party my sister asked me if I had any tampons and I told her they were in my room and she could go help herself to them. A couple minutes later she came back down and looked nervous and I asked her what happened.

She told me that as she grabbed the tampons she accidentally knocked my laptop on the floor and the screen broke. I don't have insurance on my laptop and can't afford to get it fixed (I have to pay parents rent and pay off debt so I have no money at the end of the month) so I was really angry with her, asking her to pay for it to be fixed. Our parents give her $1000 dollars to go to college every month (not including finances for her classes so this is just fun money) and my laptop costs $400 to fix so I knew it wasn't an unreasonable request. She told me she already spent this months money and that she would pay me next month.

But it's been over 2 months and she still hasn't paid me back and has started to ghost me so I decided to sell some of her dolls. A few of them are worth a lot due to not being produced anymore so I sold 5 of them on ebay to make up the money to fix my laptop. I told my friend and he said I was messed up for doing this as she broke my laptop by accident and I could've given her more time to pay me.

I feel like a total AH for selling them now, I haven't told her about it because I know she will be angry but I feel like I jumped the gun. My laptop isn't important for my work as I'm a nurse and I only use it for entertainment reasons so I feel bad for stealing her dolls and selling them for this. AITA for selling her dolls after she broke my laptop and wouldn't pay the fees to fix it?

&#x200B;

Edit - A lot of people are calling me an AH for this and I wanted to explain why I didn't go to our parents. They have always favored my younger sister and have the attitude that she can do no wrong. I've asked my them to pay for it but they refuse to, saying my younger sister didn't do anything wrong and it was an accident.

I also forgot to mention that my laptop was on my desk and the tampons were in the desk drawers so although it was an accident she had to have been mucking about in some way to break it. For the comment saying she's only been paid once since the incident, it happened around the 25th September so they've given her $2000 dollars since.

She started ghosting me late October so it's been over a month since I've heard from her and this is why I resorted to drastic measures. I stole the dolls because I knew she wouldn't pay me back and I had to fix my laptop somehow. For the people who are upset about me selling valuable collector items, there are many other listings on ebay with the exact dolls I sold so she is able to replace them if she wants to.

Our parents always let her get away with things since she was little and I knew she wouldn't pay me back for this because she's always done things like this and that's why I stole her dolls. I've messaged my sister telling her what I did so she is able to repurchase the dolls I sold on ebay.

Edit 2 - Lots of comments are saying I should've warned her and I want to clarify that I did message her saying ''If you don't pay me back I will consider selling some of your dolls'' a month ago when she started to ghost me and she never read it.

Edit 3 - I just want to say thanks to everyone who voted on this. My sister was angry with me for doing it but after finding my post and reading some of the comments she realized that we were both in the wrong. We agreed on me repurchasing the dolls for her to call it even and she sent me the money to do it with. Our relationship has always been strained but this has brought us closer as she opened up to me about how hard college has been for her. ",0.46

Not a lot of people understand what he does for a living but it‚Äôs kinda complicated. For the sake of this post, I won‚Äôt comment too much about it.

Anyways, so I do have a bit of an accent, and my gf‚Äôs friends often comment on me saying that she‚Äôs dating the son of a mob boss.

"WIBTA if I excluded a friend from future dinners? For context, my group of friends are all college students and we frequently go out for dinner or get takeout on weekend nights. This weekend we had decided to get takeout and three of us intended on sharing the food family-style. The place we picked was relatively pricey so we only planned on ordering two entrees because we could have enough to split between three people, but no more than that. Two other friends ordered their own entrees. My one friend, A, offered to pay for all of our food under one order and we would just Venmo her what we owed.

Prior to this, we invited our friend, B, to get takeout with us, and she *declined*, but said that she still wanted to spend time with us. We also planned on getting drinks to-go with the takeout, so while A and I went to pick up the food, B and the rest of our group went to pick up drinks. Another friend was going to buy my drink for me and I was going to Venmo them, but B paid for it, saying it was a favor because we were friends. I insisted that I wanted to pay her back, but she refused. She later mentioned thinking of the drink as payment to ""have a few bites"" of my portion specifically. I would not have accepted the drink if I knew she bought it in order to justify eating the takeout.

When we got back, I did expect B to have a forkful or two of food to try, but she asked for a bowl and ended up consuming just as much food from the two entrees that my friends and I (who paid for it) did. She also ate more shrimp from the dish than any of us were able to. Then, after nothing was left of our shared food, she asked our other friends there if they had anything else to give her. She was ignored.

She left soon after dinner was over. One of the other friends there let me know that they wished they had been able to eat more of what they had paid for and wanted B to pay for what she ate. A text was sent to B letting her know that she was expected to pay for the portion she had consumed. A response has not been received. I think our meal should be split four ways instead of three because she consumed more than she was welcome to and we did not buy enough food for four people and shouldn't have to pay for her dinner.

"AITA for punishing one child and not punishing the other? Okay so the title sounds off, I‚Äôll admit. But this was the best way I could put it, so please hear me out. 

I‚Äôm (28F) a mother and a stepmother. My bio daughter is 7, and my stepdaughter is a month younger than my bio daughter so she is also 7. My partner (35M) is a good father and he is very soft on the girls and he thinks I‚Äôm being a bit harsh. 

This weekend I promised my girls that they would be taken to Chuck E. Cheese today if they did all of their work and behaved well in school. The problem is, my bio daughter did not do her work nor did she behave. She yelled at her teacher, kicked her desk, and pushed her chair over and threw a complete tantrum on her teacher today. So when I picked up my daughter from school, I told her that she wasn‚Äôt getting rewarded for bad behavior. I didn‚Äôt want to punish my stepdaughter because she did what was asked of her so she earned the Chuck E. Cheese reward. Okay so I broke the news to my stepdaughter that she was going but her sister was staying with me and doing homework and reading books because she‚Äôs on punishment. My stepdaughter is now crying and told me that I was a meanie because I won‚Äôt budge on my bio daughter not being allowed to play. My partner wants to just let it go and let my bio daughter play with my stepdaughter to stop her tears. I told my partner no, and that that was my final answer.

On Thanksgiving my family took group photos (I was not there, not for lack of trying, it just would‚Äôve been too late when I got there in the end) and in one my step dad, who was in the very middle, made a hand sign. These photos were posted to social media by SD and sister and on SDs profile his friends started to crack jokes referencing the sign. When I saw this I was alarmed and then got worried about my family not being aware and the potential implications of this being online (aware of SD being a pos but helpless). I felt that I should make sure everyone in the photos was aware. I did not expect everyone to have been aware and wasn‚Äôt sure how many would be okay with it. Most of them have very good jobs so even if they turned out to be I thought that they would at least care for that reason. And in any case I assumed an easy fix would have been for the photos to be removed or altered, with no issue. There were issues. My sister and SD admitted knowing and not caring, I said okay and backed off. A cousin then blew up because she had no clue and was appalled. The rest of the family blew up because they didn‚Äôt know or care now that they did and thought we were being dramatic because ‚Äúno one else would and it‚Äôs not that big of a deal‚Äù. SD and sister then tried to deescalate group chat madness by saying that just because I say the sign means x doesn‚Äôt mean it does, etc. Heavily trying to turn situation around on me. I sent a ss to chat of what I originally saw and told him to F off. He then deleted post. Cousin researched symbol, sent ss, and pointed out that they admitted knowing before. Everyone has been mad at my cousin and i for the last week. I'm mad that they flipped a switch on me. I‚Äôve been labeled a shit starter, dramatic, called two faced, invalidated, and ignored. By everyone. My mom started off saying it was all unnecessary because no one could get in trouble but her husband anyway. Then said that I shouldn‚Äôt have cared because I wasn‚Äôt in the picture. My explanation was ignored. And when I told her I was even more upset that SD and sister tried to crap on me she denied that that happened and when I screen recorded the original conversation and circled the messages in red for her she chose to not respond and ignored me for a week only to then message me like nothing ever happened. My SD deleted me on social media, I blocked him and everyone else. Sister told me not to call her ever again. SD recently messaged everyone but cousin and I apologizing (in different gc) because he was ‚Äúgoofing off and didn‚Äôt mean to start a mess‚Äù. Cousin was told about it and got more mad bc he apologized to everyone he didn‚Äôt offend. He caught wind and copied, pasted, and sent her same msg. I‚Äôve gotten nothing. He did edit & repost photos online, sister left originals up. Entire family is now at odds about Christmas as well, as some people refuse to go after this situation. Myself included. 

UPDATE: I decided to go no contact with everyone including my cousin. Happy holidays y‚Äôall",0.2
"AITA roommate problem. So my GF and I moved into a 3 bedroom mobile home with a friend of mine I've known for years.  Everything was fine at first, the roommate gave me and my gf the master bedroom, however, the roommate, who has a kid, has two bedrooms as well as the main bathroom. Plus the roommate uses more of the living room(my gf and I don't use the living room) and due to the roommate leaving the oven filthy and the sink full of dishes, we don't use the kitchen often. 
We use less electricity, as the roommate leaves two TVs  on even when she goes to work. As well as leaving lights on in every room.
The roommate also thinks we use most of the internet, because we have two Xboxes, however, the roommate also streams on 2 to 3 TVs nonstop, like when I get home there's usually stuff streaming on the TVs.
We do not game for more than 6 hours a day, and that's usually just on one Xbox. Which previously living with a couple roommates who used laptops and a ps4 quite often on the same internet plan, never went over our 1.2tb data cap. 
She also thinks we eat all of her groceries, when we don't even eat at home due to the kitchen always being a mess. We eat out constantly because we refuse to clean up her messes. 
The roommate wants to fully split the rent and utilities 3 ways. Just a flat rate 500$/per person. Which is more than the total cost of bills. 
She takes up more square footage, uses more internet data, and uses more electricity, as well as more gas an water. However she expects my Gf and I, who occupy the same space, to pay 1000$ vs her who occupies more space and would pay only 500$.
To everyone I've spoken to it sounds like she's being entitlement and wants people to pay for her daughter's electric usage, her daughters food, etc. 

I plainly told her no and she told me to gtfo. I'm on the lease and refuse to just leave so she can end up with us both in court because she can't afford the place on her own. 

AITA for telling her there's no reason for my Gf and I to pay 2/3rds of the rent, when she occupies more of the house and uses more of the utilities than we do?",0.7
"AITA for asking my boyfriend to start paying for netflix? I (19F) have been going out with my boyfriend (19M) for almost 2 years and I'm very happy to be with him. Our relationship was very rocky at first due to us starting our relationship during high school but we're currently thriving as young adults now.

During our time in high school, My boyfriend would let me use their family Netflix account every now and then whenever I or my family were unable to pay for our Netflix account but we later decided to deactivate the service to save a little bit more money. Recently, I got myself a Netflix subscription ($13.99 for screen of 2) and decided to add my boyfriend into the subscription with me paying for it, I had no problem with him sharing it with his family either.

However, He recently made a concern about how he wasn't able to watch his shows whenever his little sister and someone else is on at the same time. I told him that I had the plan for 2 screens and that maybe the reason why. He later asked if I would decided to change my plan to screen of 4 ($17.99). I don't mind personally paying a bit more but I don't need all those screens so i suggest that I wouldn't mind changing the plan if my boyfriend pay's half for the subscription for it.

Immediately he got upset saying how whenever he would let me use his family account at the time, i would never pay for it so he shouldn't pay for the new plan for a while. I got upset about this and told him that if he was going to make a suggestion about my netflix and rather not pay for it, he doesn't need to be on it at all and later changed the password so he would be unable to get back on.

Currently, we're not talking to one another and both of us are upset with one another. I honestly don't see me doing anything wrong but I know from my eyes, it looks far more different to someone else.

"AITA for refusing to clean up my vomit from my dad's car?  Throwaway because I have a couple friends on reddit and am embarrassed. I'm 18F and attending a university about two hours from my hometown. Last weekend I had plans to go home to attend a family event, and since I left my car at home (parking is super expensive here), my dad always drives me back and forth between school and home. He was picking me up at about 4 that afternoon, but I called him around one to tell him I was feeling a little off. This was mostly to ask if I should still come home because my younger brother is medically fragile and I would hate to spread anything to him. He told me that he was sure I was fine, especially since I just started feeling bad, and that I shouldn't be trying to skip out on family events (birthday celebration for my aunt).

So fast forward to when he picks me up. I'm not feeling great, I had a pulsating headache and was a little queasy. I was a little nauseous, and although I didn't feel like it would turn into anything at the time, I brought along the biggest tupperware with a lid I had, just in case. About an hour (half-way), I asked my dad if he could pull over, luckily it was a rural road, so not to busy, and I got out and was sick by the side of the road. After that, I got back in and tried to just close my eyes and wait out the rest of the drive. However, not twenty minutes later, I felt the nausea start again. This time we were on the interstate nowhere near an exit, unfortunate, but I suppose this was why I brought the bowl. I closed the lid on that tupperware, which was sizable, but not super big. The size of it ended up being a problem though. At this point, we're only about ten minutes from home, so we're driving through town. I ask my dad to pull over again because I'm going to be sick, but he tells me we're almost home. I tried to tell him that it couldn't wait, but he was annoyed and said that I'm an adult and should be able to handle myself. Well, half that statement ended up being true. I am an adult, but could not handle myself. Seeing as my container was pretty much full, I was out of ""respectable"" places to vomit. The second I started gagging my dad started getting upset with me, telling me that I need to grow up. My dad has those floormats that are advertised as being very easy to clean, so that's what I aimed for. While still not ideal, since it was the third time I'd yakked in within the hour, there wasn't a lot of volume. We got home a couple minutes later, and I went straight inside to go lay down. Before I made it to my bedroom though my dad is yelling at me to clean up my mess. I told him I asked for him to pull over so we could avoid this, and right now I feel really sick and need to lie down. He continued to yell, saying that his shouldn't be his problem, and I need to clean up my own messes. I just went to bed. The next day, he asked for an apology for my behavior, and I refused again. While it is my own mess, it's also partially his fault. At this point I may be crossing the line by being so petty about it. Who's TA here?",0.5
"AITA for not giving two people a day off? To start off, some background. I am the scheduler for a nursing facility. It‚Äôs not my main job duty, just something until we hire someone to replace the previous person. I am also a CNA (certified nurses assistant) and work every other weekend night shift and one other day during the week to maintain staffing in the building. Working as a CNA is also not part of my job title‚Äôs duties. 


I have two people who work night shift that are dating. They talked to me a while ago and said that they were going to submit a request for time off for around Christmas. I said okay, that I would review it and try my best to approve it. They submit their paperwork and the time they requested off was not around Christmas, but around the new year, also including the new year (Dec 31st going into January 1st). I approved all the other days except new years and said that if they wanted to have that day off, that they would have to find their own replacement, which goes with our company guidelines. They have since then said that they are not going to show up and that they think it‚Äôs unfair that im not giving them the day off. I reiterated that if they want the day off, they would need to find their own replacement. It‚Äôs been a lot of back and forth of the same thing. Typically if there is no staffing, I come in because I don‚Äôt want to leave our residents and nurses with no aides. 

I feel kind of guilty for denying their request. I am working Christmas Eve going into Christmas day (which for our company is a holiday and the day my family celebrates Christmas) and would like one day with all of my close family together. Last year, the same problem arose with the same people and I ended up working Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Years. I promised my family I would give them one holiday as a family this year and have been planning everything accordingly.

I gave them the option of switching holidays with me so they would have New Years off but they said no. I also tried finding someone to work for them to no avail. In the past, I have worked for them when they asked for time off so they could have it off. They also asked for a week off for some family event without having pto and i worked that for them as well as a personal favor. All in all, they have taken about a month in vacation within the past year.

"AITA for upsetting my friend‚Äôs husband? The other week I was hanging out at my friend‚Äôs house since she had just gotten the photos back from her wedding and wanted help making an album. 

So we‚Äôre sitting there on the computer and she adds ‚ÄúMr. & Mrs. Smith‚Äù on the cover of the album. I joke about how she‚Äôs technically not Mrs. Smith yet (she‚Äôs still in the process of changing her name) and it‚Äôs not too late to keep her maiden name.

All of a sudden her husband comes stomping down the steps yelling about how ignorant I‚Äôm being and that she married him so now she‚Äôs changing her name. I immediately go on the offensive and start arguing right back asking him what his problem is and why he‚Äôs being such an ass.

"WIBTA if I messaged my possible half siblings about our potential shared paternity even though it's almost Christmas? Sorry in advance for format issues. Please do not share this on other platforms.

So my (33f) husband (37m) and I thought it would be neat to do those mail-in DNA testing kits, just for fun, so we could ooh and ahh over our heritages. We got the results in last night, and surprise, the sibling I grew up with is only genetically my half sibling. I spent last night and part of this morning looking up articles on the science behind DNA testing, margins of error, lowest possible shared DNA of full siblings, etc. Anything to find some concrete proof before asking my mother about it, as my dad (the man who raised me) has passed away.

I found in my matches that I had three possible other half siblings whom I've never heard of or met, and none of them matched with my known sibling at all. I took this as the last nail in the coffin of the idea that my dad was my biological father, and called my mom this morning. I live several states away so an in-person visit wasn't an option, unfortunately.

I made sure to broach the subject from a place of curiosity and understanding since I didn't know the details of my conception, and I wanted her to know I wasn't mad or upset, I just had questions. She took it well, and said that my father had major fertility issues so they used sperm donors for myself and my sibling and then basically stopped talking about it, even with each other. She doesn't even remember which hospitals/clinics they used for us, so finding my donor will be more difficult and I'm hoping my matches from the DNA testing will be able to help fill in gaps.

The issue is that it's approaching Christmas, and while my possible half siblings (all of whom I share more DNA overlap with than my known sibling) were all matched before I did my test, there's no guarantee they aren't all under the impression that they're full siblings. What if they're my donor's natural children? I confided in some friends, and they and my mother think it would be best to wait before I contact any of the matches in case they don't already know. I'm on the fence about it myself, as I don't want to ruin the season or impact their current family relationships, but I also feel they deserve to know for medical reasons if nothing else.

TL;DR I found out from a DNA test that I'm the product of sperm donation and don't know if I should risk interrupting my potential half siblings' lives by messaging them right before Christmas.",0.2
"AITAH for not paying my dad back for my car insurance? There is quite a back story to this so bare with me. I, (22f) and my dad, (51m) have had a rocky relationship throughout the years. My parents divorced when I was 13, which was hard enough on my brother (19m), and myself. I stayed with my mum most of the time so my dad had to pay child support. He made my life absolute hell and blames me for him having to pay child support. 

3 months after my parents split up, my dad was in a life changing car accident where he almost died (literally, they had to use the jaws of life on him). Might I add this was not his fault, he was t-boned. He couldn‚Äôt work anymore and got a huge settlement a couple years after the accident worth 1.2M. 

Time after time he would still fight my mum in court about giving her child support which he was not doing. My mum ended up settling for less than half of what he owed her, and she bought herself a new car as she was needing a new one for like ever.

My dad is very materialistic and he would buy me things I needed, and I would occasionally stay with him. If I didn‚Äôt do something he wanted (like DD for him), he would cut off things like my car and not buy me things I needed. So I ended up paying for my toiletries and other things which was fine as I worked. (This happened from when I was 16-18 when this was going on. ) He also emotionally abused me and kicked me out of the house a couple times, so I ended up moving in with my mum full time. 

I moved abroad for a year from 2018-2019 and when I came back he said he would pay for my car insurance as I had no money but he wanted me to pay him back which I agreed. My car ended up shitting the bed and he bought me a new car with the intent of me paying him back, which I did pay him back in 5 months - a total of $6,100.) As I was paying this back, things got sour between us and we ended up not communicating as much and I was just giving my brother the money he wanted back. He then asked me to pay back the $1,200 for the car insurance and I had just been accepted into nursing school. I wanted to go out for lunch with him to have a chat about my future plans and school, as well as to ask for relief from the car insurance because I had no savings for school and since he did have a 1.2M settlement after lawyers (he actually got 1.8M but 600,000 went to lawyers). He rejected the offer and said I should take my mum out for lunch instead as I am her daughter, not his. 

That comment sent me into a dark place. What kind of dad doesn‚Äôt want his daughter? I had to go to therapy, every-time I saw him (live in small town) I cried, it was terrible. I then texted him back, ‚Äòwell since we have to have this conversation over text, I am not paying you back for car insurance‚Äô. I didn‚Äôt mention school either. He said ‚Äòyou owe me this and that‚Äôs what you will pay me‚Äô. He now even thinks less of me and tells his family how awful I am (which is also my only extended family.) 

I haven‚Äôt talked to my dad since March 2021, but I still feel guilty for not giving him the rest of the money. AITAH?",0.42

"AITA for walking my dog at 7:00pm? My husband and I are currently sick (thankfully not covid just flu) and cannot do much for our dog so we have been taking him on walks all day. (Ohio tends to get dark around 6 but it‚Äôs not late it just seems like it.) It was my turn to walk him so we went on a walk at 7:00pm taking my time because I feel like death. Towards the end where I usually turn around I passed by a house with multiple dogs and they all started barking like crazy. They don‚Äôt usually bark mainly cause we usually don‚Äôt walk this late, we take pup out to the park or ravine. I ignored the dogs and kept on walking till the sidewalk ended, apparently we were still visible to the dogs they were still barking.

After picking up the poo we started walking back towards our house dogs still barking (my pup was not barking just kept walking and sniffing the sidewalk) the owner, (I assume) started  at first yelling. She was a middle aged woman. 
Her: DO YOU KNOW WHAT TIME IT IS?!!! 
Me: no?
Her: Your dog is making mine bark
Me: oh ok (I didn‚Äôt feel the need to apologize because we were just walking)

Me: (looks at him sitting and starting to lay down still not barking) hes not barking and were just walking. 
Her: keep your aggressive dog off my property. (We were still on the sidewalk)

Over the last 2 weeks we‚Äôve talked about every big initial ‚Äútalking stage‚Äù topic that you can think of, that we hadnt already discussed as friends.

"WIBTA if I let a fight with my SIL potentially ruin Christmas? **Backstory:** I f(30) have two girls 8 months and 3 years. My brother m(27) and SIL f(27) have two boys 2 and 5. My oldest and their oldest attend the same school. My youngest attends daycare full time. Their youngest my mom looks after Wed-Saturday for free. This started when my mom lost her job but has gotten more out of hand. 

Right before Thanksgiving my 8 month old had a very runny nose so she didn't meet the requirements to go to daycare. She needed to be covid tested to meet protocol. My SIL knew this and was playing with her the night before she was tested. I asked my mom if she could keep my daughter Friday so both my husband and I could work. We'd both taken extended time off in October because both our girls were sick. She agreed.

The next morning when I was getting everyone ready to go where they needed to my mom sent out an angry group text. I wasn't sure what it was about but apologized for being impatient with answers and didn't think anymore of it. I arrived at my brothers house where my mom was going to watch my daughter and their son and asked if he knew why she was upset. He said no. 

I had gotten my daughters covid results back which were negative. I texted my SIL to let her know as she'd shared mild concern about having to quarantine. She proceed to yell at me and tell me how dare I bring a cold into her house and she hoped no one caught it and got sick because they'd all have to take time off work. Neither her or my brother have ever taken a sick day when the boys didn't feel well and just left it to my mom. My mom would even watch the boys when they were sick. I told her I didn't need this from her and that unlike her job mine and my husband required someone to take our place. (We're both teachers and there is a sub shortage; she works as the manager of the go section of a grocery store) She continued telling me how she didn't understand why she can't voice her opinion without getting yelled at and how it's not fair to her to have my daughter at her house. I'd had enough of it and told her she was a selfish bitch and constantly does this when she doesn't get her way.

She told me I was rude to her and she was no longer talking to me. She also said my brother feels the same way and just won't say anything. My mom thinks I should apologize however I don't want to apologize for how I feel. My husband feels like I could have been nicer was in the right as she wanted my mom to chose her son over our daughter.

I haven't spoken to her in over a month. I have talked to my brother nothing there has changed. I ran into her yesterday at the pharmacy and she acted like she didn't know me. She wouldn't even let my nephew come say hi to his cousin and it upset my younger daughter.

"AITA: for telling my bridesmaid that I'm not paying pay for her dress or for her to attend the bachelorette after she asks me to go to her 500$ per guest birthday party? EDIT: should I pay for her dress and her costs at the bachelorette? I live in the United States where it's traditional for bridesmaids to cover their own costs.

&#x200B;

One of my bridesmaids asked me for help paying for her dress and the bachelorette, which was fine. If there were a need, I would be happy to do so! It's more important they're there and having a good time.

What's bugging me was that she wants to rent out a house for her birthday and have each guest pay 500$ EACH! Meaning 1k per couple! And drops this before the holidays needing it before the new year!

Then she tells me that my bachelorette, 183 per person plus food, 150 for the hotel room and 23 for the snow tubing, 10 dollars for the in-room activities that we wanted to do food is probably going to be 200, but people are only paying for themselves (to which I've told and reminded bridesmaids frequently of since August; so it's not a surprise) is too expensive. 

EDIT: all activities were agreed upon through general consensus of bridesmaids and checked-in privately. 

I sent her this over Facebook messenger;

""I honestly feel disrespected that you're telling me that my three-day once-in-a-lifetime event is too expensive while you're planning for guests to spend a hundred dollars more on a birthday and with how your boyfriend's joked about our may celebration. It's hurt my feelings, as I don't feel like I'm asking for a lot and am under-asking according to traditional costs.""

Two days later after she didn't respond, I sent""I don't feel comfortable spotting you right now. I told people that I would cover them in case of need, ie. Things outside of their control like unexpected job loss or hospital bills. I think you need to reconsider your priorities, responsibilities, and commitments. Not taking into account your financial obligations and promises to the bachelorette and bridesmaid dress, as agreed to in august, and scheduling a lavish and expensive birthday party instead hurt my trust in you. I question if your someone whose word I can trust, who I can count on to be there, and who genuinely cares for me. Until you can honor your word, I ask that you do not attend on Saturday (the dress buying or the luncheon) as our relationship and whether I want you as a bridesmaid is in question.""

I think I am somewhat guilty of the situation she is in right now because she would have taken out loans if i didn't promise to help her with her tuition.

"AITA for not wanting to get my drivers license even though my mother is getting a surgery and won't be able to drive? Am I the asshole for not wanting to get my drivers license even though my mother is getting a knee surgery and won‚Äôt be able to drive while she recovers. For context I f16 have a small family and my mom injured her knee last year in like March of 2021. It has always been just me, my mom and my younger brother. She tore her acl and her Mcl so its pretty bad. Shes on the list for surgery but I was told it could take up to 2 years. But for the past few months she's been telling me that I need to get my license and I am busy with school and stuff. I know how to drive and have had my learners permit for just over a year but I don‚Äôt want to get my license. My mother being a single mom I have already been taking care of my brother and most of the house chores for my entire life. I know that if I get my license I will just be doing her grocery shopping and running around for her. I feel I‚Äôm busy enough and I don‚Äôt need the added pressure on top of it. 

Not to mention I was in a car accident a few years ago with my half brother driving and crashing because he hit ice and it was dark outside. Its December so ofc the roads are slippery and that scares me. Whenever I feel the car slide on ice I get reminded about that night and the way everything was in slow motion while the truck spun out of control, looking out the window and just seeing the white of the snow. So for those reasons I have not gotten my license but my mom has been calling me lazy saying that I want her to suffer and make her wait to get her knee surgery. It's not like that at all, I don‚Äôt want her to suffer. Being a single mom she claims she doesn't have a lot of options and she‚Äôll need a few months to recover from her surgery so she won‚Äôt be able to drive me to school or too and from the barn I ride at. However I take the bus to school or walk so I don‚Äôt see this being an issue. Not to mention she has a bf that shes been dating for over a year and we have friends. She's been telling my brother and other relatives that I‚Äôm lazy but not getting my license and that she might as well wait for my 12 year old brother to turn 16 because he‚Äôll probably get it before I do. I can drive but I haven‚Äôt driven a whole lot since its gotten colder and the ground is covered in snow. But I see where she's coming from my mom doesn't have a whole lot of other options I just don‚Äôt like the way she is making me seem selfish and lazy for being scared to drive in the winter. So what do you guys think? Am I the asshole?
Edit: To provide additional context the crash I was in wasn‚Äôt too major I had to get some stitches but it wasn‚Äôt anything to traumatic driving doesn‚Äôt give me like panic attacks but it does cause me to zone out as I do this to cope with things that scare me. So zoning out while driving is probably not safe might just be me tho",0.08
"AITA for not caring about my little brother even though we're both targets for our narcissistic dad? My brother (17) and I (19F), although we get alone fine, are not particularly close with one another. However, ever since I went away to college, I feel like he's been trying to hang out with me more whenever I'm back home. But because he's very socially awkward, this usually means he just stands/sits next to me while staring at me as I'm doing something and want to be alone (e.g. scrolling through social media, video calling my friend). I usually end up snapping at him, telling him to go away and leave me alone.

I suspect that my brother might have asperger's or be atypical in some way, and I believe that that's the reason why he doesn't really have friends. However, I'm not all that interested in becoming friends with him myself. I feel like our discussions revolve around him rambling about facts in very niche subjects I'm not interested in. And overall, he has trouble respecting my boundaries, and that aggravates me even more into not wanting to hang out with him. 

But I feel guilty every time I snap at him. And even when I'm patient with him and say something like, ""Can we hang out later? Right now, I just want some time alone"", I feel guilty, knowing that I'm not actually gonna hang out with him later. I just say that so he leaves.

What makes me feel like I'm the AH is that I know how lonely and bad he feels, especially since my narcissistic dad is bullying him more, now that I'm not around and he can't pick on me. There are times where I would stand up for my brother since his go-to move is going silent, but if my brother is not in immediate trouble, I would not really care about him because I'm not that interested in us becoming friends. (Btw my mom is my dad's enabler. She also gets silent and lets my dad do and say whatever).

It is clear that my brother's really struggling because he has no support system, and I feel really shit that I'm a contributer to that. But in all honesty, I'm still trying to heal from my dad's abuse and don't want to be the sole caretaker of my brother when I myself am struggling (I'm clinically depressed, according to my school's psychologists).

"AITA for asking a friend to not play a certain game during d&d So here‚Äôs some background on the situation: me and some friends (18-20yo) were in the middle of a D&D session. Most of us do another simple activity during session to keep us busy such as art, a mobile game, etc. so it‚Äôs pretty standard for people to not be fully focussed in session. However, one player (who I will call A) is particularly distracting during session. For example, she often goes on random unrelated tangents in the middle of an active game. Sometimes she will focus fully on the other activity that she‚Äôs doing simultaneously and will only pay attention to session when it directly affects her. This really annoys me but usually I just kind of let it lie unless other players comment on it. 

Today however, A opened a game on her laptop that involves rapid clicking. I found it very distracting so I said ‚Äúplease don‚Äôt play that right now it really bothers me.‚Äù A was very irritated at me and got upset that I was telling her what she‚Äôs allowed to do on her laptop. Since everyone else does other activities during session she said it was unfair that I would target her (or only tell her to stop). I tried to explain that it was just that particular game that I had an issue with but she told me not to demand her to not do things. 

Later, she said it would have been fine if I had asked nicely rather than ordering her around. I got a bit defensive at this point because I don‚Äôt see how what I said was rude. 

Am I the asshole in this situation? I really don‚Äôt understand why my request was so unreasonable, but I could be way off base. Thanks!",0.57

"AITA for ‚Äúscolding‚Äù my SIL and not letting her see my wedding dress? I get that I may be coming across as a bridezilla but please hear me out. My fianc√© (29M) and I (24F) were having dinner at his brother‚Äôs house. My fianc√© and his brother (30s) are pretty much all each other has family wise. I have never had a problem with my BIL and his wife (30s), if anything I get along great with them.

My fianc√© and I aren‚Äôt really sticklers to tradition, but one tradition that I really love that we are going to stick to is the groom not seeing the dress until the wedding. I don‚Äôt know why, but that‚Äôs special to me and my fianc√© gets that.

So I had recently found and purchased my dress, which my sister in law asked me about over dinner. She asked if I had any pictures and I said I do, she asked if she could see them and I said sure! Just don‚Äôt show fianc√©! So I pulled up a chair next to her (fianc√© on the other side of the table) and pulled up a picture on my phone and she immediately said ‚Äúoh my god the lace on that train! And those sleeves, I thought you‚Äôd go for strapless!‚Äù I was a little dumbfounded but I pretty quickly locked my phone and just said ‚ÄúOop! Nope, that‚Äôs too much, we‚Äôre done.‚Äù I really tried to say it with some laughter in my voice but on the inside I was a little, mad? sad? That she had basically spoiled a few pretty big details about my dress that I wanted to surprise my fianc√© with. I just wish she hadn‚Äôt been so specific with her remarks.

For the rest of the night I could tell my SIL was a little down, and that night my BIL texted my fianc√© saying that I didn‚Äôt need to scold his wife like that, that it‚Äôs just a dress. My fianc√© had told me to not worry, that he still has virtually no idea what the dress looks like, and that maybe I should just apologize to keep peace.

"WIBTA if I imposed a ""college dorm"" style chore wheel on an old man? Wibta if I imposed a ""college dorm"" style chore wheel on an old man?

OK, so, for about five or six years my partner and I (both in our 40s) have shared a rental house with a man who is about 25 years older than us.¬†

The last two years have been tough for him, admittedly, but they've been tough for all of us.¬†

But, it's been over a year since he's done any chores at all in the shared area and it's driving me nuts.¬†

He hasn't once emptied a bin, or brushed a floor, or hoovered the stairs or cleaned the drainer, or picked his own food out of the plug hole, or given the main bathroom that he uses regularly a clean, or wiped any windows (we get mildew) or taken out the recycling (he'll let it pile to ridiculous levels until I give in and do it), or mowed the grass, or given anything in the communal living areas a dust, a wipe down or anything.¬†

In fact, I've started to take out the rubbish every time it is full because I know he'll just keep balancing crap on top of crap until the lid won't close and our dog will gain access. 

But I leave the new bag for him to put in.¬†
He's started to replace the bag I've supplied with a cheaper, flimsier type of bag that breaks and spills rubbish everywhere when I empty the bin. I'm sick of it, truly. And I can't trust myself not to yell at him at this stage if I tried to address it directly.¬†

It feels like I'm living with a monumentally passive aggressive teenager, not a grown man who should know better.¬†

I feel this shouldn't even need to be a thing, but here I am.¬†

I'm sick of it. I work full time, I've a chronic illness and I'm now apparently also his house maid. Does he have mental health problems? Oh, very likely. But so do I and I'm done dealing with his nonsense.¬†

I want to impose a chore wheel on him, so at least he can't successfully ignore all the chores he's refusing to do now.¬†

Is this an asshole thing to do, or am I experiencing compassion fatigue? I truly can't tell.¬†",0.17
"AITA for saying at the crowd at the concert So, this actually took place like 9 years ago but I still think about it to this day.

Me and my best friend (both F and 15 or 16 at that time) were huge fans of this now globally known artist. The artist was a well know even then but the main fame came in the following years. The concerts were usually huge so it was really surprise when we discovered that the artist will be in our town at this really small venue. The tickets were like 15USD so they sold out within seconds. We started to check if someone will be reselling their ticket and of course they did but 250USD was a lot for us back then so we did not buy any reseller tickets. Then a miracle happened and my friend somehow won 2 tickets. She told me that she will take me with her and then only a few days to the concert told me that she is taking someone else. I told her that it is okay because she can do with her tickets whatever she wants and she told me that she's joking and only wanted to see my reaction.

So, we are at the venue and we somehow managed to be in the first row. My friend, unfortunately, chose her shoes very poorly and came in heels. Before the concert even started she told me that she needs to sit down because her feet is hurting her and left. The signal was very poor to none as the venue was underground so I did not receive any SMS from her and she did not receive any SMS from me the whole time (I texted asking her where she is). I wanted to stay in the first row so she can come back but she never did and to be honest I was enjoying being there too much to leave and see where exactly she is. At this time I thought she is only a few rows away from me.

After the concert ended I started to search for her immediately and when I finally found her she run away from me. Then I got the signal again and there were texts that she is sitting outside crying because I left her to be alone. I apologized to her of course multiple times and felt like the worst person ever. After this, we did not spoke to each other for a few months and after we started speaking to each other again we never again even mentioned that this happened.

If this happened today I would leave with her so that is why I think I was being a huge asshole for staying there but at that time I somehow managed to justify that it's okay.",0.25
"AITA I made a comment about my wife‚Äôs wedding dress My wife and I recently married. The ceremony and wedding was beautiful and I didn‚Äôt sense that anything was wrong. However, she brought up an issue in an argument recently that caught me off guard. 

For our wedding, my wife wore her wedding dress but then also had a lace thing over the top. After the ceremony ended and we walked back down the aisle, we went into a small room in the building alone except for our photographer. 

This is where I may be TA. I touched the lace thing on her dress and asked if it was supposed to be a different color than the dress. Both were white but slightly different whites to me. 

She just smiled and said no and then we hugged and kissed and moved on to more photos. 

She brought this up recently as a really hurtful thing to say right after we got married. Also, she didn‚Äôt want them to be different whites and hadn‚Äôt noticed the difference. 

I thought I was just commenting on her dress and didn‚Äôt think I was being mean. But, she said in our argument that it was hurtful that the first thing I said after we were alone together after getting married was a comment on how the colors didn‚Äôt match.

"WIBTA for hiding my groceries from my roommate? Throwaway account because my roommate uses Reddit.

I'm (20m) currently living with a roommate and close friend (20m) in my grandmother's old house to watch it until she can fix it up and sell it. We came to an agreement of a VERY generous deal in my opinion of 200$ in 'rent' a month, which my roommate pays half of.

However, my roommate doesn't have a job nor are they looking for one, and they aren't enrolled in college classes either. I often end up buying all of the groceries for the house when I get home from work with my own money, which they often eat most of since they stay home the majority of the day. I'll get home to find empty boxes of food still in the cabinets, not even thrown in the trash. I feel like I'm wasting money supporting them even if they're my friend. I've thought about hiding a portion (not all!) of the groceries for myself, but I can't help but feel like I'm being selfish about this. WIBTA?

EDIT: Thanks so much for the feedback. Reading all of the comments pushed me to sit down and have an actual discussion about the situation, and we came to an agreement that we'd both buy our own groceries from now on, and that we'd both be open to more compromises in the future. Thanks again!",0.08
"WIBTA for telling my friend she's taking advantage of me/ possibly kicking her out I (24F) and my FH (30M) took in a friend of mine, Julia (23 F) around a week ago. She has issues that change every month or so. For Example. There was a month where she couldn't walk and had seizures. Now recently the issue is having multiple identitys that take over her body as well as random episodes of selective memory loss

She came to me very upset and in a panic. She told me her relationship of 3 years has been horribly manipulative and abusive and she's ready to leave and will do anything to get away from her boyfriend, even go to a woman's shelter. That he has kept her from seeing her doctors and she just can't take it anymore. Me and FH own a home together, and have a spare bedroom. As much as I didn't want to undertake becoming someone's caretaker, I didn't have the heart to turn my back on her. I know that getting out of an abusive situation is so so hard, especially when you don't have anywhere else to go. I offered her the room on the conditions that her ex is not allowed to have our address, she makes effort to stay away from him, and she is able to set up a permanent living situation elsewhere. As long as she follows these rules she can stay rent free to allow her to save money to move somewhere else.

This all came to a head yesterday. I had a 5 hour tattoo appointment that I scheduled 3 months in advance, but it happened to fall on a day that Julia and FH dad both had doctors appointments at the same time, an hour prior to my appointment. After some debate the agreement was that I would get her to the doctor and her ex would pick her up, we would arrange to meet later and get her. It was her compromise and she insisted he was the only person who could get her. 

I was almost done at my appointment when I get a message from her expressing that she has no memory of breaking up with her ex and moving in with us, she asked if she could spend the night with him until she got her memory back. 

I'm not a doctor nor do I claim to understand the details of her condition. But I wasn't born yesterday. This is the second time she has asked to go stay the night with him. I ended up telling her if she did not return home she would not be welcome back. She begged me to help her get away from him and if she keeps coming up with excuses to go stay the night with her ex there is no point in her living with me.

I want to confront her but don't know what to say. On one hand Im not a professional, and I don't want to judge what problems she's having. I dont feel right claiming to know weather her amnesia is real or not. But on the other I don't want me and FH to be taken advantage of, as this is not the first problem we've had in only a week. We don't want her to stay but I don't feel right kicking her out.

When they asked if I could drive them to an amusement park, I said that I would, but I'd want to come in, too. They said this wasn't a problem, but they were going to Six Flags.

All:
 
Attendance at Coffee with the CEO meetings has decreased over time. So much so, that I almost gave up on the concept entirely. A group of employees discussed this same attendance issue on their own and came up with an idea that I am willing to try. So, here it is.
 
You all get to have a representative to show up at these meetings on your behalf, which I will commit to hosting on at least a quarterly basis. These designated representatives will be expected to show up at meetings. Their job is to bring up issues or questions to me and report back to their peer group by summarizing what we discussed in order to keep their team/peers informed.
 
For employees assigned to the [division], each team can select 2 representatives (1 from [group 1] and 1 from [group 2]). So, if someone wants to be a rep, step up. If more than one employee wants to fill their allotted position, diplomatically work it out among yourselves. They can make a pitch to their team why it should be them. And if no one from your team wants to fill an allotted position, so be it. That position will remain open until such time someone wants to fill it.
 
For the Operations team, there can be 2 A team reps and a 2 B team reps. Same process‚Ä¶step up and be the rep; and, if there‚Äôs more interest than the allotted positions‚Ä¶.figure it out among yourselves. For the Admin team, there can be 1 rep.
 
If you‚Äôre not a designated representative, all employees are still invited to attend coffee with the CEO meetings ‚Äì there‚Äôs no change. I‚Äôll still advertise them to everyone.
 
I‚Äôm willing to give this a try provided there are enough employees willing to do the same.
 
Inform your manager who your rep will be. They in turn will pass those names along to me and I‚Äôll be in touch to schedule the first version 2.0 meeting.   
 
I‚Äôll wait until December 17th to hear from my managers. Questions or concerns, let me know.

"AITA for calling the cleaning people at work instead of just cleaning up spills myself I've worked at my job almost a year.  It's retail.  

The company that I work for  has a cleaning company that they hired to work in their stores. That company does all the cleaning and they have a special machine that looks like a zamboni  they use for the floor. It's pretty much a broom,vacuum and mop all in one. Whenever there's a spill, or something needs to be cleaned up most employees call them. I never really gave it a second thought.  

So last week, I was working  and a customer came up to me and told me she spilled her coffee.  I called for a spill clean up.  

My coworker ""Beth"" asked ""why don't you just clean it up? It's faster than waiting for them and just takes paper towel"".  Then to prove her point she did it and said ""see, faster"". 

Then yesterday a customer dropped a few jars of pasta sauce. There was a relatively big mess including broken glass.   So I called for a spill clean up. 

Beth came over and asked why I was paging the cleaning people. I told her someone dropped a few jars of sauce.  She said ""so all it'll take is a broom and a mop.""  I said ""yea... but they can just use that push thing, which will be way easier.""  She said "" they're probably busy, it's faster to just do it.""   I said ""they have a  contract with another company for that because they have the equipment,  that's the whole point "". A cleaning person came with the machine so I walked away. 

Beth followed me and said ""you act like an elitist, like you think cleaning a spill up is beneath you or something.  You're pretty much saying that's what we pay people for. You should be willing to help more."" I said ""okay but everyone else calls them for spills so...."" she said ""just because they do it doesn't mean it's right"". 

I never really thought about it, I figured it was the same thing as getting  someone to use an electric pallet jack which I don't know how to use either.

"AITA for leaving a drunk friend at a party? I (19f) and my friends (19f) Alex and Lucy went to a party last night. I only knew a few people there and we planned to leave early with Alex as DD, tho Lucy ended up not drinking that night. I only had a can of white claw, but I rarely drink so ig my tolerance is really low bc my friends said I was drunk (but I felt sober by the time we left). A girl I knew there, Max (18f), ended up drinking a lot. Alex said we should take her home, so I told Max we'd give her a ride back to her dorm. She refused to leave early and said she would walk home. I said there's no way we're letting you walk home but she refused again and I wasn't getting anywhere, so I went back to Alex to ask what we should do. She said wed have to force her into the car, and she didnt want to do that to Max in front of everyone. She talked to another friend and said he would make sure she didn't drink any more and got home safely. I asked if she trusted him and she said she did. I found Lucy and we went home. I got back to my room and fell asleep.

I found out later Max had passed out and couldnt be woken up. Lucy drove back to her after someone texted her about it (she had the car). They called Max's sister who took her to the hospital. Thankfully she didn't have alcohol poisoning. Max messaged us all after apologizing for worrying us and that she always sleeps deeply after drinking. Alex said Max had drank way too much at a previous event where two people had to stop her from drinking more, and there were past incidents too. Nobody seemed to want to do anything else, so I ended up submitting an ODOS (a student concern report) since Alex said a girl on her floor had gotten help for an ED when someone submitted one. A girl texted Lucy after saying we were a holes for leaving max and we shouldnt leave other people to take care of her. (She also said she blocked max and her sister on IG? so Lucy thinks she was saying that less out of kindness and more bc shed planned to sleep with a guy that night and couldnt bc of max passing out, but her point still stands)

I know I shouldve stayed the whole night/forced Max into the car, but I didn't realize how bad the situation was or that she had previous drinking problems. I just thought she was a bit more drunk than the rest of us and assumed her friends still at the party would drive her back or the one that promised he would get her home safely. I know I messed up by agreeing to let a guy take her back, but all I was thinking at the time was that Alex trusted him and I trusted her. (He was one of the ppl w Lucy who took care of Max, so he did keep his promise and seems like a good guy, but I should've stayed anyway since I didn't know him.)

Max is safe and that's all I keep going back to. Ik I can't change the past and Ill make the right decision next time, but I feel like sh t and I just want to know if I should've known better in this situation.",0.11
"AITA For not taking responsibility for my GFs poop This happened about an hour ago and I'm a little annoyed, but cooling off I feel like I may have overreacted

I live in a dorm building and a few friends in a neighbouring room decided to host a party. I went with my gf and we all had fun. Late in the party, She goes to the toilet and comes out after a long period of time signaling me to come help her. She shows me the toilet isn't flushing and her stuff isn't going down.

The toilet wasn't flushing because it wasn't filling with water. The hosts confirmed that it was a recurring issue that they haven't been able to sort.

When we saw this we grabbed a bucket and filled it with water to artificially flush it but it didn't work. We went to the hosts and told them the situation. We left shortly after that.

Just as I was prepping to go to sleep, some of my close friends who were also at the party came to my room to tell me that it's become a clog and that I should come up to help with the clean up/fix since it's our mess. I go up with a set of rubber gloves and fish everything out into a bag.

As I'm prepping to leave, the hosts look at me and ask ""aren't you taking the bag?"" And I just responded ""no? You can toss it out tomorrow when you go to lessons."" This lead to an argument which ended with me just grabbing the bag and binning it when I got to my room.

I feel like it's not our fault that their toilet was faulty and not filling with water to flush, but AITA for the situation?",0.02

"AITA for insulting my dad? Today I got back from a ski trip I've been on for four days with my boyfriend. While I was there, I saw this super cute raccoon plush. I immediately bought it. When I got back home, my dog tried to steal it. I took it from her and put It on the table. A couple of hours later I see her with it AGAIN. So, I take it from her. My parents kept guilt-tripping about not giving it to her. I explain that I wanted to keep that one for myself because I'd given her all of my other plushies. 

They finally give up and settle down. My dad then says to my mom, ""Honey, remember when (my name) used to be sweet?"" He's said this before too and it always hurts my feelings but I never say anything about it. So, I finally decide to fight back and say, ""Remember when you used to have hair?""

He looks at me with a kinda sad and caught off-guard look in his eyes and calls me an asshole, then walks downstairs. I genuinely can't tell if I'm the asshole or not... Help.

"AITA FOR SPAZZING ON MY MOM? So first off let me provide some background. I (17f) am currently in my senior year of high school, one semester away from getting my associate‚Äôs degree, and working part time. I do not have a car, so I mostly walk or take the bus. My high school is half a mile away, so I walk there. Then later in the day I take the bus to my local community college. On some days the bus I transfer to does not come, so I have to walk from the mall to school. To get to my job I often take the bus or catch an Uber. 

Now onto what happen today. My mother and I were talking about going to the store. I asked her if I give you the money could she pick up what I needed. This caused her to go into a whole fit about how I am lazy. So I asked her simply ‚Äòhow?‚Äô. For the last few months or so, she literally gets home before me. So I was genuinely trying to figure out what else I could be doing to satisfy her. Then she began saying these little things like ‚ÄúAll I think about is food‚Äù, ‚ÄúMaybe you need to exercise more‚Äù, and ‚Äúyou are way lazier than I was‚Äù. This is when I realized she was passive aggressively trying to call me fat. So, I went crazy. I started screaming at her and crying. She proceeded to call me a crybaby and say I cry about everything. And she also said I was crazy.

"AITA for yelling at my sister for stealing my socks I'm posting this on my main cause i don't care. And im also on mobile so im sorry for any layout and spelling issues


Quick info:: I don't know if this is needed but it helps a little more to understand why I got so mad about it. I have really bad depression and anxiety and has just recently emptied my pills and need to get new ones. But my parents wont take me to get some or get a therapist(yes I know im 18 I can do it myself but I have no money to get there and I need an id which I don't have and can't get without them). So ive been having extreme mood swings and getting extremely mad at little things. 


So i(18F) and my sister(20F) share a room/basement.  I'm on one side and shes on the other. I have been trying to fight my depression and do my laundry on a normal basis- that includes folding and putting it away when done-. I have a designated drawer for my socks, bras, whatever . the drawers are on my side of the room. My sister just uses a basket. 


Today my family had a special dinner night and everyone was upstairs . I noticed my sister was wearing my socks. I called her out and she claimed she didn't know they were mine. But theres no way she couldve not known. She had on one knee high black and white stripped sock and one grey cat paw sock. She does not own those types of socks(not even close) and only owns white socks. 


When we went downstairs I yelled at her again out of anger and how dumb it was and how bs it was for her not to have known. She claimed that the socks were on the floor and on her side. Which is completely untrue as I have been keeping all my clothes in my dresser. And we have cats but they do not pick things up and carry them places(except for their toys). And the drawers are always closed so they can't get to them.


 I got more mad at how dumb her reasoning was and said I want them back now and I'll just wash them. She said to come over and get them and I did. But they were buried under her crap and so i had to move some- to which she said not to go through her things. I said  ""where is my socks then??"" And she had to dig to get them. Then she said im not allowed to have a cupcake that she got at work which is like ????. THEN I heard her upstairs whining about it and then she comes downstairs telling her gf (loudly) on call that shes letting our brother and sister have her cake and cupcakes. 


I'm just so annoyed and done with her as this isnt the first time shes stolen my socks. And also not the first tine shes stolen from me in general(candy, money). Am I the asshole?

"AITA for walking at my past job? I (19F) am a college student. I work really hard, I‚Äôm in stem and there‚Äôs a lot of stuff to learn. However, I also need money for bills and personal spending. At the start of the school year I got a job at a local restaurant. The staff was pretty small, less than 10 of us including the owner and her fianc√©, who both work there as cooks. At first, the job was good. I was making really good money, sometimes as much at $40 dollars an hour after tips, and they always let me take food home for myself. The reason why I left wasn‚Äôt because I didn‚Äôt like the job, it was because of the owner.

Our problems started off when I told her I was going to be gone for a week over my Christmas break to go see family. The reason I told her and didn‚Äôt ask her was because I honestly was going to go no matter what she said. Family is way more important than some college job. I learned that the hard way earlier in my life, when as a kid I cared more about basketball camps and making money than seeing my grandpa. He passed away. So I told myself I wasn‚Äôt going to make that mistake again.
But anyways, I told her more than a month in advance, and she got really pissed. She said it wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúfcking‚Äù okay, that there‚Äôs a big ‚Äúfcking‚Äù difference between asking and telling, and that I might not have a job when I came back

I basically just walked away from that specific situation, even though her response made me so mad. Plus if you‚Äôre a grown ass woman you shouldn‚Äôt be cussing at your employees, especially young ones. Disrespectful. Then a few days later in the week, she went off on me and my coworker for a mistake her fianc√© made, once again cussing and screaming, she dead ass said ‚Äúdo you not fcking understand anything?‚Äù and her fianc√© stood there with his balls between his legs letting us take the heat. I walked out earlier that night, I was ready to confront her but she said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have the time to talk, you can text me‚Äù

Next day I texted her and said I was tired of being disrespected when I have always been respectful and I basically kept her doors open since at one point I was one of two servers working crazy hours taking 10-15 tables at a time when I should have been at home doing homework and studying. She responded by saying I was the ‚Äúsource of her stress‚Äù, that her restaurant was a ‚Äúfun and family like place to work‚Äù and that I was ‚Äúvery very slow, not engaging with customers, and had no second gear‚Äù. This was the last straw because none of that was true at all. I demanded she apologize and appreciate all I did and she refused. So I walked. AITA?",0.12

"AITA for refusing to transfer to another University at my mother's insistence? I (M19) am very privileged to be attending my dream school, one of the most consistently top ranked universities in the country. This privilege is availed to me because my parents are paying for my tuition in its entirety (though not at any financial hardship on their part).

On Friday morning, I got my final grades back for the semester, and although I'd worked hard during finals season, I ended up with a somewhat average GPA (3.3). When my  mother saw my results, she proceeded to get upset. She accused me of wasting my time hooking up and smoking weed/drinking alcohol/partying instead of studying. When I explained that I did those things in moderation and worked hard during most of the semester, she reasoned that perhaps the school I'm in is too hard for me, and that I should transfer to a less difficult school where I'd perhaps earn better grades. She then spent most of the weekend looking into the procedures for transferring to our state university system.

This morning, when she brought it up again, I told her to can it, because I'll be damned if I leave my university because I earned a 3.3. She became very angry, and  basically told me that the choice wasn't really mine, because she's the one who's paying for college (actually both my parents are, but that's besides the point because my dad didn't really care) and that she expects ""results"".  I think her goal for me is to work in high finance, something that many people from my school do but that I myself am not particularly desiring of.

"WIBTA if I asked my in-laws to return a mismatched part for my daughter's bed When I and my husband found out I was pregnant everyone in the family was excited. We were trying for many years and my daughter ( now 2) is my in-laws only grandchild. 
My in-laws insisted on buying the crib. They said we could pick it out and they would pay. Well a store near us was going out of business and we found a crib we liked for a really good price. My husband called to tell them and they said they already bought one. They bought a dark wood color convertible crib with drawers and changing table attached. It was not a color or style I wanted, especially since I heard stories of kids climbing up on the changing table and falling off. It also was bigger than what we wanted. But we accepted. We bought the furniture to match the crib. It took a while for me to like it, but now I do.
Now my daughter is ready for a toddler bed and being a convertible crib the front of the crib comes off and a small piece goes on to make it a ""toddler bed"". I told my in-laws we need that piece and they had no clue what I was talking about. So I showed them pictures.
They bought the piece but it is a light brown/gray and it is not even the same type of wood. I found the correct piece online, but my husband doesn't want me to say anything. So WIBTA if I asked them to return it? Or should I just suck it up and be grateful for the mismatched color piece. 

Note: I am extra hesitant because my brother-in-law just died a few weeks ago and the whole family is grieving.

"AITA for expecting my son to pay rent? My (36M) son (19M) has been indecisive about how he wants to continue his education for the last few years. I want to be supportive to him since my father never supported me growing up, but I also want to give him that push to take things in a direction where he'll be successful.

A few years ago my wife and I cut him a deal saying we'd let him live with us rent-free after he turned 18 so long as he continued his education into college or university. Initially things seemed to be going great as he kept up his grades in IB courses, but things fell off real fast when right before his diploma exams he revealed in a fit of anger that my wife had stolen thousands from the joint savings account we had set for him for petty purchases. The argument was really heated, he left the house with my wife chasing him, and I kicked her out afterwards for doing this to our son.

After a week things cooled down enough for me to work things out with my wife, and I decided to spend the money in the joint accounts of his siblings on things to improve life around the house for them so they don't have to deal with the same consequences in the long run. We got them new devices, got new furniture, just giving them stuff to have a quality upbringing compared to the mistakes we made with their older brother. We expected him to come back since we never gave him the boot, but for a few months he insisted he stay at the shelter instead.

While he's away, our landlord breaks the lease we had with them, basically telling us to leave within the month so he can move in. Thankfully we get set with a house for rent, and we convince our son to come back for a clean slate. However, months in the new house and he doesn't start pursuing upgrading his high school courses.

We had a bit of a heated argument the other day. I asked why he wasn't continuing his education, he said it's too expensive with having to redo nearly all his courses due to not being able to make the exams while he stayed at the shelter. Told me each course is about $400. I told him student loans exist, and he yelled at me saying this shouldn't be the situation to begin with. When I told him he'd have to start paying $250 a month if he didn't work on his education, he told me the money my wife stole from him would cover nearly three years.

While he hasn't explicitly called me an asshole or anything along the lines, he's effectively been giving me and my wife the silent treatment since. AITA?  


Edit: I want to address people noting that I described my wife as ""chasing"" my son out of the house. She was not chasing him in the sense she was forcing him out, he was already leaving and she tried to catch up with him to apologize and work things out in a drastic moment.",0.96

"AITA for not getting a job at 19? Obligatory ""title sounds bad but hear me out"" sentence.

To start things off, I'm autistic. If they used labels nowadays it'd be aspergers but they don't, it's all categorized as Autistic Spectrum Disorder (I may be remembering that wrong, my memory gets wonky at times).

I don't want to bog this post down with too much unnecessary information, but if there's anything I'm leaving out feel free to ask questions.

I was diagnosed with autism about 2-3 years ago. My mother never got me checked out or anything because despite me displaying some autistic behaviors I was (and I guess still am) high functioning enough for her to think it wouldn't be necessary.

On January 6, 2020, my mother died of cancer. Leukemia specifically. She was engaged to a woman, who is now my stepmom. After my mom died she took me in and became my legal guardian. That's why I refer to her as my stepmom.

My stepmom was hesitant about teaching me how to drive because of my autism, which I thought was reasonable enough. I get overwhelmed by loud noises, I get anxious easily and I'm very impulsive. Despite that though I always felt like it would still be good for me to at least try to learn how to drive and get on the road just to see how I'd act. But that never happened. Fast forward a couple years, I'm 19 and know absolutely nothing about driving. That's a big problem I think when it comes to finding a job. Asking coworkers, friends and family for rides to work will only get you so far.

The thing is though is that my stepmom always gets on to me for not having a job. Today she was pretty harsh about it, saying that I contribute nothing to the house and that I'm lazy and do nothing but ""lay on my ass all day"". I've applied for disability checks (with her help) so I won't be able to get more than a full time job if that goes through anyways.

When my mom died she left me a pretty good amount of money (I think it's a lot at least, it's like 10,000 dollars). I used some of it for recreational stuff, like art supplies. But I also use the money to help pay bills at the house, and I also bought my own phone and pay my phone bill. Now, there isn't much of that money left, only about a thousand or so. I think that's why my stepmom is being particularly bearing down about me getting a job, which I understand. I help out around the house a bit (I don't have many chores admittedly) but other than that I have a lot of free time.

This post is probably getting too long so I'll summarize. Am I TA for not getting a job at 19 years old despite having autism, not knowing how to drive and having next to no knowledge of the ""real world"" and being an adult?

Like I said before, if anyone has any questions ask.",0.38

"AITA for unintentionally offending two friends of mine? Sorry if the format is bad, I'm on my phone

Earlier today I was on a call with a few friends of mine, we were just chilling out chatting when one of my friends, S, had to help her husband with her child for a second. After she had sorted it out I made a comment about how I was conflicted about having kids. I'm sorry I'll have to paraphrase here, I wasn't expecting it to blow up like it has so I don't fully remember what I said. 

I explained that while I did want kids, I also enjoyed my life currently as it was and that I was kind of worried having kids would change it a bit too much for me, like it would hinder what I currently want out of life. When she defended having kids saying it would change life that drastically I used the example that if I wanted to go out somewhere right now I could, but with kids I'd have to plan a lot more around them, which I something I don't currently what. Not long after she hopped of and I didn't think too much on what I said.

About an hour later her husband sent me a message asking about kids being a waste of time or of your life. I thought he was joking, they normally give me a bit of a hard time in a joking manner, so I replied jokingly saying that's not what I said. He replied saying how my passive aggressive comments had really hurt and upset S and that they had kids and their life hasn't changed. When I went on to apologise saying that's not what I meant by those comments. He replied talking about how my opinions would sound to a mother who gave up her life to have kids (I didn't know this and still have no context for this) and that they had kids because they felt the time was right and that no one should say other wise.

I've tried to apologise to both of them but I've had no repose since. I feel awful that I made them feel like that but I'm also a bit pissed off because I never meant for what I said to be taken that way and I feel like what I said has been blown out of proportion.

So my dad pretty much sprung on me that I (19 m) have to go to my grandparents for Christmas, my grandparents just so happen to live in the middle of nowhere (about 4 and a half hours away) and I barely have access to wifi and such, which lowkey threw a wrench in my plans because I was Hoping to spend it with my boyfriend like last year (he came over for Christmas and then we spent the night together in a hotel because he lives a few hours away)

Outside of that, my grandparents are intensely racist and homophobic, even if they aren‚Äôt talking about it just knowing about it makes me uncomfortable being around them, I‚Äôm a trans man and I just overall feel unsafe there, my mom knows about me being trans but ultimately isn‚Äôt accepting of it, so she doesn‚Äôt care. 

It also means I have to take a day off of work and I don‚Äôt have PTO because I just now got full time, so i won‚Äôt get paid for an entire 10 hour day which really fucks up my paycheck. 

The only reason I think I‚Äôm the asshole is because aforementioned grandma has cancer, as far as I know it hasn‚Äôt been progressing and she‚Äôs decently healthy now but ofc we have no idea how much time she has left, I was never close with her and she‚Äôs not my biological grandmother, she always makes me uncomfortable and will touch me when I‚Äôve made it clear I don‚Äôt like being touched.

I told my mom why I didn‚Äôt want to go, and she got mad at me about it, basically telling me not to go because ‚Äúshe doesn‚Äôt want to these me complaining about it.‚Äù But if I don‚Äôt go I‚Äôll get Ana earful from my dad and I‚Äôd really rather avoid getting a lecture about family coming first of whatever the hell. 

That‚Äôs all for now, feel free to lay into me if I‚Äôm in the wrong, I get it",0.03
"AITA for having my students over for a study group? We had some pretty bad storms the past couple days (one of the worst we've had in years) and my daughter's (16f) school and my workplace (I'm a teacher at her school) had to close because the school flooded. On top of that, a lot of our town is experiencing power outages at the moment. Their finals will be online starting tomorrow. 

My house was not affected by the power outages so I told my daughter to text her friends that live in the areas that are experiencing power outages and invite them to study for finals at our house (some of their classes are making them write research papers or make a slideshow during their free time and present during the final period and it's hard to get ready for those things when you don't have wifi. I offered to pick her friends up and get snacks and a couple pizzas. 

We currently have 6 girls studying and doing homework in my kitchen and dining room. All of these girls are in my daughter's support class that I'm subbing in for the rest of the year. I didn't tell my daughter to only invite my students but most of her friends are in my class so I expected most, if not all of the girls to be my students. 

The girls posted pictures and videos of the food, drinks, and each other on their stories and I got messages from parents of kids that weren't invited asking why I couldn't include their kids because they also don't have power. 

I said I just invited my daughter's friends and that if their child needed a place to study, the library is open and a lot of students from the middle and high school are there. A couple parents are mad because their kids are supposed to go to the crowded library when my students get to have a quiet study group at my house. 

A couple parents even complained to the principal so I wanted to know if I was the asshole.",0.57
"AITA for calling my Friend dumb and unqualified for the job offer at my Company ? I F(19) and my Friend F(21) know each other since kindergarten. We did not always get along but still went trough a lot together. We lost touch for two years after 9th grade. I changed schools and she started working.

 It's normal to learn a certain profession in some parts of the EU after 9th grade, it depends on your graduation level. While I was grinding for my future she was treated badly at work. Her boss who's a dentist was way too strict and always badmouthed her behind her back.

Im finally getting my degree this year to pursue my dream on my dream university. I'm also an employee at a company who has the Eiffel Tower insured under them. My parents have a company with their own franchises, so I'm leading one franchise, studying for my exams and working at a high profile company. My Friend on the other hand lost her Job again and is always asking for money here and there and if someone refuses to help her out she guilt trips them into saying: ""real friends would always help and give money, yall are fake friends and don't consider my mental health at all. I don't know If you guys deserve me as a friend.""

I told her the others and I are working hard for a stable income and you have no right to make them feel bad. She ignored what I said and kept on with ""real friends would take out loans if needed."" I decided to offer her a position as an intern at my company knowing her qualifications are lower then mine and not suited but i wanted her to offer our training program. I talked with my senior who's also my best friend to interview her. He agreed and we set a date via zoom call for an interview. Guess what? Postponed interview 3 times.

Excuses:

1. ""Im mentally not stable enough right now to participate in the interview lets do it another time"" she canceled it a few minutes before the interview.

2. ""Tell him Im not in the mood"" again she canceled it a few minutes before the interview.

3. ""I have to help my Mom with chores, oh could you lend me 30 ‚Ç¨ again I need it to buy something"" This Time we've waited 2 hours on zoom looking at each other while she was ignoring my calls and text messages.

She got pissed when I got angry on her for ruining my reputation again and again in front of my senior. Me and my Best Friend could have spend time with our family or relax but she stood us up again. She told me let's do it at 6pm instead and I said okay, but thats her last chance. She ended up ignoring my calls and went partying with her friends instead and made her Friend pick up my calls and made her lie that she was in an ambulance because of the immense stress i caused her with the interview without considering her mental health.I gave up and did not ask for another possible date to arrange an interview.She texted me today asking If I could borrow her money and I said No. I snapped and said all kind of words wich came to my mind. But I ended up feeling guilty since she is in a miserable state.

"AITA for not driving to his house after silent treating me So my boyfriend of 6 months got mad at me due to minor miscommunication and hung up the phone around 3pm Monday afternoon. I texted him when I left work at 6pm. no response until after 10 pm and all he said was ""going to bed"" So the next morning (yesterday) I texted him good morning and what not. After minimal communication all day I asked what was up. He responded that he woke up (20 minutes before I texted him that morning actually) went to his appt, came home and went back to sleep. I obviously asked if everything was okay and he told me he was just tired. Fast forward to today. Now I normally drive to his house after work on Wednesdays. We have dinner and go to an AA meeting together. I hadn't planned on going tonight because until a few hours ago, when he finally talked to me today and told me he didn't feel good, I thought he was giving me the silent treatment so I wasn't about to drive an hr and a half to his place when hes hardly talked to me.. 
Also he knows how crazy busy I am with work lately. He is still going to the meeting so he's clearly not that sick. 


am I an asshole for not going?",0.11
"AITA for inviting old friend to guys game night, despite wife‚Äôs protests I recently moved back to my hometown after 10 years away, and have been able to get the old gang together via DnD night (previously they had no one with enough experience to DM). We‚Äôve had 2 sessions that were a blast. Now I‚Äôm hearing from one their wives (1st time mom of 6 months, staying at home, already dealing with multiple emotionally rough situations) that Dnd night has become an Avenue for him to shirk his parental responsibilities (which have already been lacking, allegedly). It doesn‚Äôt help that one of my best friends doesn‚Äôt like his guts at all, nor that I‚Äôm honestly better friends with his wife than I am with him. The thing is, it wasn‚Äôt even his wife who brought this to my attention, rather another friend that is their roommate, who i imagine is simply getting fed up having to hear her whine about it. 

But guys night is for the guys‚Äîall of them. Dnd every other Friday is not going to make or break a relationship. It‚Äôs selfish to expect 7 guys to cater to any one persons whim, but as DM I certainly have a veto option. So DnD continues as planned, and the pieces will fall as they may.",0.87

"AITA for not turning down a job in order to spare my ex's feelings? my (26f) ex (""James"" 26m) and I met at work. We were super good friends. he asked me out& I initially turned him down, but eventually I saw him in a romantic light. we began dating in Dec 2019. Both of us were not emotionally ready for a relationship

Feb: I went into one of the darkest depressive episodes of my life. In self destruction I hooked up with someone else. I am many things but a liar is not one. I told James. of course he was furious & ended things with me. I immediately regretted pushing him away, especially in such a hurtful way. We realize we're both miserable without each other. it took time but we got back together

April: I get into grad school across the country. We decided to be happy while we could then I would move for school. if i ever found myself back home we would see where we were at

Aug: He drives me to the airport we cry I move

Oct: over text he kept pushing a dumb argument & trying to have the last word & used my anxiety against me saying ""well at least I can do every day tasks without freaking out"" I snapped & told him to fuck off

November:I reached out to apologize. We agreed that this fight was all too similar to many we've had in the past. It ended with a heartfelt texts that we're sorry we hurt each other & hope they have a good life knowing well always care. He <3 my last message. we didn't speak again

May:my best friend Marie, also close with James tells me he asked her if she thought there could ever still be a chance for us to be together again

June:I've met the most amazing guy &post a picture of us on Instagram. a few minutes later ""James has unliked your message"" (didn't even know your phone alerted you of this) next thing I know he's texting Marie these horrible things that I'm a lying cheating gaslighting manipulative devil woman (direct quote) the last thing we said to each other was amicable & heard he was recently asking about the possibility of us getting back together. yet as soon as I post that I've moved on nearly a year after I left for school I become a ""devil woman""

today:I'm home for break & my old job begs me to come in to help with the holiday rush for the week. when i get there James says it's messed up of me to come here where HE works (as if I didn't work there first AND longer) I ask him wtf changed we were on good terms. He says that after *reflecting* he realized how horribly i treated him through the whole relationship. he claims I should have said no when they asked me to work. i want to respect his boundaries but that was almost 2 years ago now, this is a short term job & would be fiscally irresponsible of me to turn down. i'm not being malicious and really need money for school. in my books, we ended things fine & he only changed his mind when he saw I moved on. don't they say you can't expect others to control your triggers? I don't want to hurt him but I think he's being unreasonable esp when my rent is on the line

"AITA for surprising my friends with my proposal? Garbage title, since it's hard to spell out the whole story in a sentence. But recently I (21M) have decided I'm gonna marry my girlfriend (21) of 3 years. We've lived in a different city from most of my friends for the entirety of our relationship, though they've met a couple of times and everyone generally seems to like her. 

My friends and I have all had a group chat that's been used very infrequently since high-school, but we've all been friends for just shy of a decade now. Since we moved back to the area where all my friends are, I wanted to invite them to the movies where I planned on proposing. Here's where things get tricky:

I didn't tell my friends right away that I was planning on proposing for a few reasons, mainly because it'd been about 3-6 months since we'd last regularly talked, so I didn't want to overwhelm them with news of the move (we also had plans to buy a house) and a proposal, a just natural catching up, it felt like too much. I also didn't want them to want to be there for the proposal and then find out they couldn't and be bummed and want to postpone the date, since I knew when and why I wanted to do it with that event. 

So after all my friends confirmed they were able to attend the movie, i told them I'd already purchased the tickets (I didn't tell them I'd paid for their ticket early cause I didn't want them to feel bad saying they couldn't attend cause they were broke, or feel guilted into canceling other plans since I'd already spent money) and told them the plan to hold up signs saying will you marry me. 

Two of them were ecstatic, and immediately PM'd me asking how they could help, but two others said that it was kind of shitty of me to tell them after the fact, and that they feel they don't her well enough to want to help out, and might not even attend the movie either now (though I've already told them I don't want to overstep and we can do the proposal just after the movie so they aren't involved) 

I just want to know AITA for keeping secrets until they've already said they could attend, or if they're in the wrong for not even wanting to be a part of this huge stage in my life.


Update: I ended up scrapping the whole idea and instead proposing to her at new years with two very close friends of ours. The friends that were excited to be apart of it didn't get to be there, which they were bummed about, but she did say yes! I also talked with her about all this and she did agree with me that a public proposal would've been fine, and it was disheartening that my other friends didn't want to participate, so at least if I'm the asshole I found a girl to be an asshole with lol. Thanks for all the feedback, while I don't think I would've been in a bad spot just going with it, I think it turned out better anyways by me scrapping it.",0.5
"AITA for keeping customers' wrong and (or)unwanted orders for myself? 
I F22 am a waitress in a small restaurant and I had to fix my car recently so it took a dent in my food budget. While at work, a customer received a wrong order and it occurred to me that I could keep the food since they were getting their order remade.I put it in my locker so I could take it home with me later and went about my day. 

That was on Monday and I have been occasionally doing that throughout this week. Well today I got called into the boss's office. He told me that a number of my colleagues saw me stealing food and he also saw the footage. I tried to explain the logic behind it but he told me that the one thing he does not tolerate is thieving.

"AITA for calling my mom a classist and making her cry?  My (22M) mom (4) and my dad(40) came from different background, while my dad's not a millionaire his family is well-off and my dad has been able to carry that stability while working in the family business, my mom's family on the other hand grew and stayed poor, she was able to get out of that after college and, while her family mostly suck, she's still in contact with them. Since they got pregnant right after high school, my grandparents took them in and paid for both of their universities so they'll be debt free.

My dad has a best friend who has a daughter, Ivy (22F, my girlfriend), we grew up together and we began to mess up when we were 15 but only started to properly date at 16, for some reason my mom doesn't like her as my girlfriend but he likes her as a ''family friend'' and as a ''niece'', she thinks that Ivy is ''holding me back'' and that she'll use me for money. Ivy's family is like my mom's, her dad works for my dad and she's currently going to fashion school, which my mom hardly disapproves and is always hinting I can ''do better'' and that maybe we should ''stay friends''.

She's also against me spending money on Ivy, she's always asking me how much are the things I buy her (I mostly buy her flowers, fabric for her clothes and jewelry, she doesn't let me take the bills and rent for our apartment, we mostly split the checks and date and she is uncomfortable if I buy her anything else because she know my mom is always asking). She believes that Ivy has to be able to take care of herself just like ''she did'', I tried to ignore her as much as I can but last weekend I went home for dinner and I was talking about the things I want to buy for Christmas when my sister told me that I could buy my gf a designer dress, bag or shoes, since she's into fashion and she doesn't own anything like that.

Mind you, this is my personal money, is not like my parents will give me some cash to buy everyone something, this is important because my mom said that I shouldn't spend that that much money on her and that it was about time I start to be more careful with my finances, I was fed up and I told her that she had to stop trying to control me and my money, and that she isn't better that Ivy because one of the reason she's successful and stable now, is because my dad and his family was able to provide for us while being young parents and that she isn't some ''super woman'' who handled everything herself and to stop acting so classist because there's only one real rich person in the house and is neither of us. My family support me but before leaving I saw her crying in her room and I felt bad because she's not prone to cry.",0.11

"AITA for spending more on my Reddit Secret Santa than on my boyfriend for Christmas? Ok I'll try to keep this short but for the past couple of years I've been participating on the reddit secret santa (r/secretsanta) where you get matched with random people and exchange gifts. My love language is gift giving so I absolutely love it and has been one of my favourite traditions!

Unfortunately this year Reddit announced they were sunsetting the whole thing, so this was the very last official secret santa. Because of that I wanted to make it extra special for my giftee and ended up going way above the suggested budget (which I was more than happy to do), and it paid off because it seems she really liked it so wins all around! [https://www.redditgifts.com/gallery/gift/thank-you-vixexhxq/](https://www.redditgifts.com/gallery/gift/thank-you-vixexhxq/) 

My boyfriend and I usually don't do blind gifting, we just tell each other what we want (or we share a big list of things we'd like to receive in upcoming anniversaries, birthdays etc and just go off of that). This year for Christmas he was very specific about wanting a certain jersey, and that was it. Nothing else on his list, nothing else he wanted, just that jersey to be happy. 

So I bought the jersey. He still hasn't gotten it so I don't have his reaction but I'm sure he'll love it as it was sold out everywhere and really hard to get!

Now to the issue: Was chatting with some colleagues about Christmas shopping today and ended up mentioning both the secret santa gift and my boyfriend's gift, and the price ranges when they asked for it. 

One of my coworkers was BAFFLED that I spent more money in the reddit secret santa one than my boyfriend's gift. Even though it wasn't a big difference she said it was ""unacceptable that I prioritized a stranger"" and that she would be very hurt if it was her.

I tried explaining that my boyfriend is getting exactly what he wanted but she got even more aggravated and said ""if you have money lying around to gift a stranger, you should have money to buy your boyfriend more things? plus no one really mean it when they say they dont want anything else""

So am I TA here?

"AITA for telling on my grandmother to my mother? So I live with my family, which is my mother, my grandmother,and my grandfather in a house we all pay for. My grandmother has the tendency to gossip and spread information about my mother and I to others that we do not want others to hear. She has also said multiple things that are racist and homophobic in front of my family and I,which at one point got her fired.

 Recently she was talking to my great-grandmother about Christmas and started telling her how we never have a tree, but instead of saying it was because we all never had the time or money, she blames it on my mother spending time with her new boyfriend and not caring about it. I overheard from my room and texted my mother about what she had just said. That text leaded to them both arguing about it and also getting my grandfather to call me a ""big mouth"" and not want to talk to me anymore.

"AITA for not watching my daughter while my wife visited the doctor? 

I M32 am the sole income earner in our household and my wife is a sahm (she had a job but could no longer keep it due to health problems). We have a year daughter at home as well.


Eversince I started working from home my wife started treating me as if I was available to do whatever she needed me to do like fix the faucet or deal with leaking roof. But I work long hours from home and I need to be comitted and professional otherwise I'd risk losing my position.

She interrupted my work several times already. I had a conversation with her about it and asked that she stop asking me to do things until I'm done working and she said okay but it happened again days ago when she barged into my office with our daughter all of a sudden telling me to keep an eye on her while she visit the clininc. I paused my work session because I was caught off guard she didn't tell me beforehand. She said that she suddenly started feeling pain in her belly and needed to see the doctor asap. I explained that I had important work and could not stay with our daughter or keep her in the office while working. She said she won't be long but I urged her to call her sister and let her come stay with our daughter. In my opinion this seemed to be the one reasonable solution for both of us but she lashed out at me saying no because this was an emergency while my work could wait. She saidshe had no time to wait til her sister come over but I said I'd call her myself and tell her to come. I even suggested I pay here and all my wife had to do was wait few minutes til her sister arrived.


She stormed out of the office with our daughter after calling me a selfish jerk with no empathy to keep her waiting longer before visiting the doctor. My sister in law came some 20 minutes later and my wife left then. I tried calling her to check on her but she purposely hung up on me few times and when she got home she was still pretty pissed at me which I don't get because I think that I provided a solution that allowed her to go to her dr appointment and allowed me to resume my work session but no, she kept talking about what a horrible partner and father I was to refuse to provide help when she needed it and refused to sympathize with her difficult situation and making her wait for her sister when she needed to see the doctor asap. She's now refusing to speak to me altogether. I think my compromise was reasonable, I don't really get why she got so mad over it.

"AITA for putting presents under the Christmas Tree without decorating it first? 
My mother (61F) decided today was the day to finally put up our Christmas tree. Normally we put it up the day after Thanksgiving, but with me now being in college, I (19F) was unable to put up the tree when she wanted to, which caused her to be upset. 

I told her that I would decorate the tree this year if she put up the framework, as a way to make her relax. As silly as this sounds, it is common in my household for arguments to occur if something isn't done right or in a timeframe. 

Anyway, I had bought a substantial amount of gifts this year, including a fairly large present for my sister. At the time I wrapped them, our Christmas tree hadn't been put up yet, so I kept the presents in my room, which is VERY tiny.  There was barely any space to walk to my bed or get to my suitcase to get dressed.  

Yesterday, my mother put all her wrapped presents in my room as well, because she didn't want to keep them in her room, and since I had presents in mine already, what's a few more presents, right? 

If you know a thing about heavily crowded spaces, they tend to get very hot and stuffy. Now imagine me, a heavier girl who breathes a lot, maybe 8-10 wrapped boxes, and a hot PlayStation in a tiny room.You can imagine how hot it was in my room.

So when my mother put the tree up today, I was excited as I could put these presents under there and get a nice comfy room again. But as soon as I moved all of the presents out of my room and around the tree, my mother got upset. 

She began to yell, stating that I should have kept them in my room or my sisters because the bigger present was blocking the tree, and it would be doing to much to move the present to decorate. She said that no one ever put presents under the tree before decorating it and also began to berate me for not helping her put up the tree and that since I'm ""not going to decorate"" the tree then I don't get to be upset. 

I mentioned to her that I said I was decorating the tree,  the tree still could be decorated, as the big present could just slide over. I even moved the present to show her. I asked her what the big deal was, as the present isn't stopping anyone from decorating the giant 6 foot tree, and that the tree is still getting decorated whether presents are under the tree or not. It wasn't the end of the world if presents were already under the tree before decoration. 

This blew up into a huge fight. My mother kept telling me I'm wrong and that the point of it is to decorate before putting presents. I told her if it was such a big deal, I would return all my presents that way there would be no presents blocking the tree.

"AITA for telling my sister our Christmas cards were signed differently My sister (27) and I (22) have very different relationships with our aunt on my dad's side. I'm a horrible people pleaser so even if people upset me, I say nothing. She, on the other hand, holds grudges hard-core and will be straight up when she's mad. Her and my aunt haven't been close for years now, since my sister was about 13/14. I'm closer to our aunt. 

We recently got Christmas cards/gifts from her family. My sister got a simple card with a gift card. In the card was a note and it was signed ""love the *aunt's last name*s"". Mine had no note but it was signed ""love *aunt and uncle*"". I also got their family Christmas card.

I wasn't going to tell my sister originally because she gets super upset about these things (which I personally don't understand cause she doesn't even like our aunt anyway. She jumps at any opportunity to complain about her) but someone brought up the cards and I let it slip. Now she's really upset. Not with me but I feel really bad about it.

So am I the asshole for telling her they were signed differently?

Edit: A few people are asking how it was brought up. We were at Christmas with my grandparents on that side today. My sister brought up the cards to my mom. A conversation started about how they were signed and I wasn't really paying attention since our little sister and I were playing an intense game of chess and said ""they signed mine aunt *name* and uncle *name*.""",0.76
"WIBTA if I took my mom's idea for her birthday and did it for myself, but better? My mom and I share a love of creepy stuff. She's turning 50 this Dec. and for 3+ years she's wanted to do a haunted house road trip for her 50th birthday. However, I was under the impression this was no longer happening because at some point she completely dropped the subject after saying ""no one was helping her plan it"" (I'm 19 now so I was 15-16 at the time so idk how I was supposed to help her plan it).

A few weeks ago, she sprung it on me it was still happening. I was shocked and a little upset I hadn't been told before, but also excited because I'd wanted this so bad when she first brought it up and suggested places for her to go, etc. She said she thought I hadn't wanted to go because I hadn't mentioned it to her (why I would have mentioned something she hadn't talked about since before the pandemic idk), but she'd talk to my dad about fitting me into their hotel plans.

We had a family meeting about that (and if my brother (17) could stay home alone or if I had to stay with him), and I decided I couldn't go on the trip after all. I'll keep my reasons brief, but essentially the trip was INCREDIBLY last minute and badly planned out, especially for the fact they were leaving the day after Christmas and so hotel availability was gonna be scarce. Plus, they both have control issues in different ways, so being around them with the added stress of bad planning would be a nightmare.

Here's where I may be the asshole. I thought, hey, if I can't go with them this time, maybe I can do a similar thing for MY birthday. But that seems so passive aggressive or maybe even just rude, since I definitely got the idea from my mom. Imagine if you had something 3-4 years in the making and stuff didn't work out for it, and then someone you knew took your idea and had the support to actually make it turn out right. I'd be so upset if that was me. But on the other hand, this was something I was SO looking forward to and expressed that and honestly feel pushed out of by bad communication and bad planning.

TL;DR: Mom planned something for her birthday that I was excited for and wanted to help with/participate in, dropped the subject completely, and then sprung it on me that it was happening after all but in a badly planned/probably poorly executed format.

"AITA for not talking to a kid on the train? I (24f) was on my way home from a busy day at work. I work electronic sales so this time of year is hectic - especially right now. I take my seat, set my backpack down next to me and scroll through my phone. I try to avoid listening to music or anything cause you can pretty easily miss your stop if you're not careful. 

This mom and her kid who looks maybe 6 or 7 are standing and the kid is going from person to person and having the LONGEST conversations with them. Like 10-15 minutes of babbling about nothing. I don't like small children, mostly for this reason in particular. The pair are kind of moving through the train and I have about 45 minutes left to my ride. 

The kid sees me, probably sees a sparkly pink backpack and thinks I'm the gal to talk to. Before he can make it over to me I put in my ear buds and crank the volume so loud I can't hear myself breathe. I look down and lo and behold the kid is running their mouth a mile a minute and pointing to my backpack. I close my eyes and pretend to sleep while they go on and on. I lower my volume just enough to hear the announcement it's time to go. 

I grab my things, get up and make my way to the stairs. The mom stops me and grabs my backpack saying that I'm an absolute bitch for ignoring her kid when all they wanted to do was just talk to someone. She said I must be some sort of sicko to hate kids so much and huffed away.

My brother moved out a few years ago but has been living here for 4 months since his breakup. I have never moved out.

"AITA for telling him that I don‚Äôt like this gift and he needs to do better in the future? My boyfriend (31) & I (26)have had a rocky relationship. I really thought things were getting better. We have a 2.5 month old son. Money is tight right now so we agreed not to exchange gifts for each other this year.

The other day we were drinking some champagne and he was like ‚ÄúI know you like surprises but I bought you some things, not for Christmas but just because. I can‚Äôt wait wait for you to get it‚Äù (Something like that but he really hyped it up & got my hopes up)

If you‚Äôre the type to read previous posts, you‚Äôll see he didn‚Äôt do anything for my birthday when I was 8 months pregnant with our son. So this was unexpected & extremely nice.

Come to find out he ordered me 2 revolution palettes from ulta. He had the nerve to tell me they were expensive. They are $15 each at the most. While I do like make up, I have so much of it. & now I pretty  much have my set favorites because I‚Äôve been into make up for a long time. So this would probably just sit & expire. 

I feel like I‚Äôm being an asshole because a gift is a gift & it‚Äôs the thought that counts, but I‚Äôm not gonna use it, he lied about it being expensive, & he also ordered himself some Chanel blue cologne.

"WIBTA by wearing a sleeveless top? I‚Äôve recently had a disagreement with my mother on this issue and it‚Äôs likely to cause drama down the line.

I (21F) have a tattoo on my upper arm which depicts female nudity, but it is not sexual or graphic, just a nude woman. Since I first got it my mother has expressed discomfort towards the fact that my tattoo isn‚Äôt censored and has hinted to me about getting it done over in the future (I won‚Äôt be doing that).

My parents and I will be attending a Christmas dinner at a relatives house, children aged between 6-13 will be present. 

My mother is insisting that I cover the tattoo up with makeup or not wear the top I had packed for the day. She says that ‚Äúchildren shouldn‚Äôt have to see that sort of thing or have it shoved in their faces‚Äù It‚Äôs clear to me that she only views my tattoo as sexual/lewd, which no one else I‚Äôve spoken to has agreed with. 
I disagree with her about needing to cover it up as I don‚Äôt believe my tattoo will negatively impact the children and don‚Äôt intent to change my outfit unless the host of the dinner would prefer I do so (I will be asking for their opinion out of respect). Would that make me an asshole?

"AITA for making little brother believe he's getting 'something else' for christmas? Hello community. My little brother (10) likes videogames. He's been expressing a desire to get a brand new Xbox (he has an old X360 and a PS2 that I used to own). We got him one for this christmas.

Since we want it to be a surprise, we kept it secret and no one mentioned anything, however, my sister spilled the soup and told him 'you'll be getting the nice, white, squared thing you've been wanting all year'.

Seeing this, we started thinking about a backup plan and began telling him that the nice, white, squared thing is a battery pack for his toys. He refused to believe and even started snooping around the house to find his gift.

Since the Xbox controller uses batteries we also got him a pack of rechargeable batteries with its charger (which is also white). Once it arrived, we told him with excitement that his gift was here, made him close his eyes and bam, show him the batteries. He reacted with the most fake excitement and 'thank you' I've ever seen. 

He doesn't seem sad, but he's dissapointed for sure. I don't know if I ruined something or crossed a line I shouldn't. From my perspective, a little joke should be harmless, but considering how he's so young, this might hurt him. We just wanted him to be surprised once the actual gift shows up.

"AITA for not wanting my husband to work with me? I'm in a corporate position at the company I work for. The company involves working with children who are in foster care. My husband had some struggles finding something that he wanted to do after he got out of the military, and after learning more about my job he expressed that he would also like to work with children. I told him I thought it was a horrible idea for us to work at the same place, one because my professional life spills over into my personal life enough as it is, and two, the field of social work is not immune to drama and people assuming the worst of everything. We've had this conversation several times.

Two days ago, he tells me that he has an interview scheduled for today. I asked what it was for, and responds with the exact job title of the entry level position of the place that I work for. I got really upset, asked him why he would do this despite me specifically having told him not to, and he said he just wants to work with kids and the program that I'm over is the closest to our house (five minutes down the road. The closest one that I'm not over is 45 minutes away with no traffic whatsoever.) 

I told my boss about the situation, and she said it was fine, that it's not uncommon for spouses to both work at our company. Usually they grow up in the field together and just happen to get married, but still. He had his interview today, went well, but of course the found out who he was due to him having a lot of knowledge about how the program is supposed to work and pictures of our dog. I got a text a few hours later from my boss saying that he can't work at the program, and if he wants to work with the company, he'll have to transfer to the one 45 minutes away. She couldn't tell me why, but it sounded like someone complained. 

I came home super upset, and told him this is exactly why I didn't want him to do this, because now I have to work at this program and worry about dealing with extra drama.

"AITA for telling a colleague I'm leaving?  I work as a technical expert at a large org. paid below local/national average for what I do. My job falls under one department, that we'll call department A, (dA), but places me in the heart of operations of another department (dB).

With the last year we've lost a lot of colleagues in resignations, which means more responsibilities on me, I've been in permanent unpaid overtime. In my last couple of meetings with my manager (in dA) I was clear I now struggle with work-life balance, and  I needed to cut the OT hours. Our org. advertised a remote position, and I discussed with my manager who encouraged me, so I applied and I was offered the position.  
I told my manager about the offer, but said I enjoyed working with my colleagues, and I would like to stay but knowing that work-life balance wouldn't improve overnight I asked for a raise. My request was over local averages for my job, but close to the national average. My manager didn't appear surprised by the salary request, but after a few days came back and said they couldn't offer a raise. I thanked them and noted that I would be planning to take the remote job.

This is when things exploded.

The recruiter for the new job went AWOL, so I couldn't finish accepting that day.  
I worked late as always and got talking about projects with a colleague and friend from dB, including q's about how I could help him with some projects stretching through 2022. As I'm going home, given his planning I decided to give him a heads up that I was taking another position, so not to count on me. This was a bigger deal than anticipated, and he insisted I talk to his boss in dB about retention.

Next morning the hiring manager for the remote job calls. He tells me they are changing the job due to my credentials, adding additional duties due to ""operational need"" and because of the changes also plan to switch to salaried rather than hourly (which pays OT and diff), ""to reflect the type of work being done"" **\*This felt like a bait and switch\***   
I IM my manager to let them know about the changes, inform them I had brought up the job to my colleague in dB, and that and they wanted me to talk their boss (which I also do that AM)

Later that day I met with my manager, and they blew up. They called me **insubordinate** for talking to anyone about the job, said I had gone behind their back and created a situation before they had a transition plan, and **that it was wholly inappropriate for another department to offer extra financial support** as it undermined dA.

A friend from dA told me my job was posted online within a day of that conversation - despite still not having ""officially"" accepted the other job. A week later am *still* awaiting paperwork for the remote job that I'm taking (despite the bait and switch) because I can't see working with that team any more.

"AITA for saying ""our baby is so cute"" while he was sitting next to his cousin? Asking to get some perspective here as I can sort of see why my wife thought I was an AH for what I thought was an innocent comment.

My wife and I are first-time parents to a beautiful baby boy, ""Lawrence."" Naturally all parents are partial and think their babies are the cutest but we just think he's the most adorable baby to have ever lived. I try to have some self awareness about this, when talking to friends I might say something like ""I know I'm obviously biased by I think that Lawrence is the cutest baby in all of human history"" etc so I can talk about how cute I think he is while acknowledging how fundamentally silly my perception is.

I have a cousin a few years older than me; with his wife he has two kids; a baby boy ""Connor"" almost 1 year older than Lawrence and a daughter 4 years older than Lawrence. As experienced parents this cousin and his wife have been a incredibly valuable part of our support network, providing advice, baby gear, and hand-me-down clothes. In part thanks to them we hardly needed to buy any baby gear or clothes for Lawrence; we're very grateful for their support and try to express that gratitude often.

So the incident in question happened a few months ago when we were dropping off some birthday presents for their daughter; we had a small social call and let Lawrence, recently mobile, play in the backyard with his cousin Connor. While my wife and I watched the two play I was again struck by how adorable our son is and made this specific comment: ""Our baby is so cute.""

My wife kind of had a strange reaction to that and said something like ""Don't be ridiculous"" or ""Don't say such silly things"" and I replied with ""But he really is so cute though.""

Afterwards my wife told me that she thought that was a rude/boastful thing to say as it implied I thought our baby was cuter than Connor, or that Connor wasn't cute. She said that she saw Connor's mom was within earshot when I made those comments and her expression became awkward.

I thought my comment was harmless and didn't have such a implication at all; that if it was awkward it may have just been because my wife had an uncharacteristically flustered reaction to my comment when normally we just laugh about what a sap I am about our baby.

This all was months ago and we continue to be close to this cousin and his family (we exchange gifts; the stream of hand-me-downs from Connor has not abated) so obviously it wasn't a huge issue but I'm interested what reddit thinks about this. In general after this I've attempted to be more sensitive about complimenting my son in the context of being around other babies or be more general/broad about my praise about how cute babies are even if I personally believe (again, FWIW) that my baby is the cutest in all of human history.",0.92

"AITA for wanting to cancel my stepdaughter‚Äôs vacation w us? I‚Äôm a 30yr old female, married and have a 2yr old daughter and 13yr old stepdaughter. During the summer I planned a Christmas vacation w MY money for the family and I told my husband we could take his eldest if her mom would pay for the airline ticket and he would pay for the food and other expenses she would have (leaving me with just the hotel expenses). We both talked to the mom and she agreed and even said to me, to my face to calculate the expenses and we would split it.  I was even more glad because I‚Äôm a graduate student and a teaching assistant, therefore I don‚Äôt have a stable income, and my husband‚Äôs income is not enough to pay all the vacation expenses for his eldest plus the other arrangements we made.  
Fast forward we leave in a couple of days and my stepd mom said just las week she wasn‚Äôt going to pay for half of what I asked her because she had only agreed to half of the airline ticket (about $250) out of $1200 that was the total expense hotel + flight. Then, today she said she doesn‚Äôt agree to having to pay for anything because it wasn‚Äôt her idea to take HER daughter on a vacation. 

So, before anyone comes at me, this all would have been fine if she had said it in the beginning when we asked 7m ago, not last week. 7m ago we would have simply decided to go on our own or try to make arrangements to take her w us. At last minute there isn‚Äôt much we can do and I‚Äôm actually worried about my expenses when we come back. Me and my husband have separate bank accounts and it‚Äôs mostly because of his ex wife, we have a prenup as well‚Ä¶ we can help each other if need be, but I make my own money and spend on what I want when I want, and he spends his (mostly on child support and half the bills). The point is, this vacation was MY idea w MY money and his ex wife committed to paying that money to me and now she‚Äôs backing off because HE has to pay for everything for his daughter, and again this would have been fine if she would have said that from the start, but now I can‚Äôt count on that money for the trip and we would have to limit our expenses even more because of that bitch. Also, I bought a lot of clothing and accessories for my stepdaughter for the trip because it‚Äôs winter. Oh, and just in case her earnings are twice as much as ours put together. 
Now, I‚Äôm just so sick of this whole thing and I have even considered canceling everything from my stepdaughter‚Äôs part of the trip and just leave her with her obnoxious, hypocrite and blatant mom. 
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love my stepdaughter, I‚Äôve known her since she was 4yrs old. It‚Äôs her mom I can‚Äôt stand.

So, AITA?

Update 2022: 

We went to the trip. We had fun. She had covid, her mom knew and didn‚Äôt tell us, therefore we all had covid during the trip and we didn‚Äôt know until after we got back. We thought the symptoms we had were because of the change in temperature and long walks, but no. She gave us all covid thanks to het irresponsible biomom. We are suing for custody and we don‚Äôt care if biomom doesn‚Äôt give us a dime. We just want what is best for our girl. 


Update:
Just something to add:
I was really mad when I wrote this and my intention was to vent because I literally had no one to share this because everyone was working at the time. I‚Äôve been stressed all day in regards to other situations with this woman and I last week after everything I had miscarriage. 

Some context, I treat my stepdaughter as my own, I always have. I wasn‚Äôt expecting anyone to pay for our vacation, as a grad student with an unstable income I just thought her bio mom could pitch in as a Christmas present for her daughter and in my head we were just co-parenting the right way. Also, her mom always always always asks my husband to pay for half of everything on top of child support and he always does even if it means we would have to make adjustments to stay afloat. We never ask her for money, this was once again just something I thought we could do as a team. 

I was mad and out of spite these were my thoughts, but I didn‚Äôt act on them. My stepdaughter is still going on the trip, me and my husband will make it work somehow.",0.73

"AITA because I didn't tell my parents how much money people gave me for graduation? Hello, reddit.

I recently graduated college and im studying for my masters (for personal reasons).

Here's the thing, I honestly don't care nor wanted to make a spectacle out of my graduation. Ive been in my career for sometime now and it requires a lot of studying to progress further, including several tests for certifications.

My mother told me to make a cashapp for graduation money. I told her I didn't have one and felt it was unnecessary and I just wanted move on passed all this undergrad stuff so I could just study on my career.

Long story short, I made one, she sent it out, and some people sent me money. Ive said thank you to everyone.I even got a gift from my grandmother, I told her thank you and it would help cover the expenses for my career. 

Ive never counted the money, honestly I keep forgetting I was sent it because I study 2-4 hours a day. As soon as Im off work , I study. 

My parents keep pressing me about how much money I got and I told them ""I don't know, I didn't count it. I've just been studying.""

They accused me of lying, keep in mind they are AWARE of how much I study because they originally told me to quit my old job due to hours (yes im serious) then memoryholed this saying ""we never told you to quit, we said it could get in the way).

My parents cant believe I didnt count the money people gave me, and keep saying im not being grateful of other people I THANKED because im not counting the money and telling them how much I got. They say like ""one day you'll understand"" and ""just count it"". They literally care about the money more than me thanking people for giving me their charity. They also minimize my self studying a lot when without it i wouldn't have gotten my current career in the first place 

My family is not poor at all,  I just find it so bizarre they are calling me ungrateful because I refuse to count money I keep forgetting I have basically I literally focus heavily on studying.

"AITA? Not attending family gatherings Hi everyone, My mom is the sweetest human being but she's married to a guy who always controls the environment from topics of discussion to going on political rants and even rants about simple commercials. The worst part is the comments he makes to my mom, if she needs help with something he snaps at her and is constantly belittling her in front of all of us (two of my other family members recognize it as well) 

We all want to say something then and there to him but we know my mom will most likely pay for it when we leave. We've finally said enough is enough this needs to be addressed, we've all said our piece to her explaining that he should not be speaking to her like that and she understands that it is rude but ""he's just like that"". 

We all told her we will no longer will be attending gatherings until she talks with him and if the behavior changes then we can go from there. My mom is trying to somehow get us to come by even though she won't have the talk with her own husband. My two other family members are set that they will not attend Christmas dinner so that only leaves me. 

I'm beginning to feel guilty since it will be just the two of them but why should I subject myself to this toxic environment? On one side I feel like if we don't show up she will really have to come to the realization that she has to have this conversation with her husband but on the other side I feel guilty since it will make her happy.

"AITA if I call the front desk over my upstairs neighbor not having furniture pads on his chairs? I live in a condo, & The penthouse is directly above me. The penthouse is the only floor that can‚Äôt be accessed without a code, so I cannot talk to them myself or leave a note on their door. They moved in a few weeks ago and it was loud banging & hammering & furniture moving for about 2 weeks. Now that all of that has died down, I will admit they are not being unreasonable loud. But they are being unreasonably annoying. When they get up from the table/desk whatever it is, the chair is making the most obnoxious scraping sound. And they don‚Äôt get up and down like a normal person would.. because it will happen like 10 times in less than 10 min. It‚Äôs loud enough to hear over multiple fans going, a white noise machine, tv on, & dryer running. And it happens all day long, past midnight on most nights.

The reason I‚Äôm conflicted about whether this is appropriate or not is because I normally wouldn‚Äôt be that bothered by it. It would annoy me yes, but it wouldn‚Äôt disrupt my daily life enough to complain. But I have a new baby, and the noise is waking her up multiple times a day and it‚Äôs getting so frustrating. And while I am aware that it‚Äôs not their problem that I‚Äôm dealing with a baby, I thought it was kind of like an unspoken rule to have furniture pads when have downstairs neighbors? So Would I be the asshole if I contacted the front desk, and asked the penthouse to either be a) be mindful that noise is carrying or ideally b)get some cheap furniture pads to put on the legs?

I don‚Äôt want to come off as entitled, or have reception thinking that I think the world revolves around me now that I have a baby lol",0.18

"AITA for implying my teacher's notes are bad? \*Throwaway for anonymity\*

My history teacher, who I'll call Ms. T, has a reputation in my school for being a bad teacher. Initially, I tried to get on her good side but it didn't work since I ended up failing my first test with a 45/100.

I don't blame her for me failing; my issue is that she does not teach during class time. She just gives us pdfs to an online textbook, some notes that don't help, and makes us write essays and do debates. Most of the time, her instructions on assignments are so vague that students end up doing the wrong things, so when we have to debate things, the person who wins is just the person who is loudest. Her tests usually don't even reference the notes she does give, so they're basically useless.

Needless to say, people's grades are in shambles because of her. And because people don't understand anything, Ms. T goes on rants about how ""if you're failing, you're choosing that"" and ""I did this in college you should be able to do it"" (we're high schoolers, not college students), and ""I had two students who self-taught themselves the material and they excelled in this course so you have no excuse.""

Last Tuesday, we got our last test grades back and one of my classmates, Jack, excitedly turned to the rest of our table and said, ""Guess who got a 90 by only watching Heimler vids?"" and we congratulated him because up until this point, he'd barely passed his tests. Then, Ms. T, who had overheard, got annoyed and started telling him, ""you should've just read my notes and you would've been fine"" and just generally telling Jack off for passing by watching youtube videos instead of using what she's given us. Jack just kinda sat there and took it.

I got mad and said (in an admittedly not nice tone), ""well I used your notes and got a 45 so...""

She went silent and proceeded to tell me that it was my fault and strongly implied that I was stupid so that's why I failed.

Now, she's not wrong. I'm not smart in history and I suck at reading and writing, so that definitely study into my grade, but I did try to study for her test and I did spend hours going over her notes. In all my other classes, that's enough to at least get me a pass, but studying doesn't help if the material being studied is not helpful. Still, it pisses me off that she, a teacher who's basically given up on teaching us, is implying that I'm the stupid and lazy one when she knows nothing about how I spend my time.

My parents have been yelling at me s telling me to apologize while my friends have been telling me they're pissed on my behalf for Ms. T disrespecting her students. I know I was ruder than I should've been but she's the one who's always saying she values ""brutal honesty"" and uses that to justify her being passive aggressive toward us.

"AITA for giving my BF an ultimatum about his brother? Bf and I are both in our late 30's, his brother is early 30's. BF (Mario) and I have been together over 2 years and lived together about a year and a half. We moved in too soon, perhaps, but honestly our relationship is great (minus a few hiccups cuz pobody's nerfect). Except for the problem with his brother.

Mario and bro moved to our location about 3ish years ago. The plan was that bro, Luigi, was to get his own place max 6 months after moving. They rented a 1 bedroom and Luigi took up the living room with his bed/computer set up. And he just did nothing, no job, no helping. They relied on their parents support, and Mario's savings, but Luigi wouldn't even speak to them. He claims abuse, but I don't know. He cries foul about a LOT of things. And everything is their parents fault. Never had a job? Parents fault. Never cleaned up? Parents fault. His mother hired a maid because she couldn't clean up after them all. Mario has told me he never saw any abuse.

Anyway, cue me moving in. When I moved in, I was upfront with Mario - I do not want to live with Luigi long term. He's rude to me, and more. Mario agreed. We moved apartments about 8 months later with Luigi in tow. Still a 1 bedroom because at the time we couldn't afford 2. However now, we're looking at 2 bedrooms and want to move my child in with us.

I've encouraged Mario to basically stand up for himself and draw healthy boundaries. He's been trying. Luigi will sit there while Mario talks, but say nothing (he frequently uses the silent treatment) then 10 minutes later, will come into our room and list all the reasons why Mario was out of line for saying things. Everything always comes back to Luigi saying, ""yeah but you don't have PTSD."" It frequently ends in tears and Mario hugging Luigi, comforting him. I think it's emotional manipulation, but I never involve myself.

Due to the pandemic, Luigi never moved out. He couldn't get a job in his chosen field and wouldn't get a job in any other field. He isn't qualified for anything, but eventually did get a gig doing video game testing. He relies on Mario waking up early and taking him to the train station and picking him up on days he deigns to work.

We have recently (like 4 months ago) told Luigi that we plan on moving out in February by ourselves. Mario has suggested that he reach out to their parents for help affording a place, but he refuses to do that. Luigi doesn't want to have anything to do with them, but does expect for them to keep paying his way, buy him a new phone, etc. Their parents are in their 70's and have stated that they can no longer help as they used to. But they would and still do try to help Luigi constantly. It's never enough for him. He always says, ""yeah but if it were you Mario you'd get \_\_\_."" 

Well I've had enough. I've told Mario that no matter what, I am moving out in February. With or without him. And that if he isn't coming with me, we're done.

"AITA for turning up the thermostat?  I 22F came home to my parent's house for the holidays just a couple of days ago. I noticed how cold I was feeling in the house and thought it was odd since I tend to run hot so I checked the thermostat and saw that it was set to 62F. I asked my dad about it (keep in mind he is the one paying for the heating and the house) and he said that my mom kept turning the temperature lower than he would like. I asked him if I could turn it up and he agreed so I set it to 72, since it heats to a couple of degrees lower than its set making the house roughly 70 degrees. Keep in mind I have a thyroid condition so I notice the temperatures more than the average person and have a specific temperature range, I can accept having their house lower than I keep my apartment, but at 62 degrees even with a sweater, I was feeling uncomfortable. 

Now the part that might make me the asshole: I know my mom does not want the thermostat up because she believes that the house should be kept as cold as possible and if you feel cold just put a coat on, she will sit around in a sweater, thick robe, and blanket during the winter. I disagree with this sentiment and I also know my dad does as well but he doesn't want to argue with her over it. I turned up the heat knowing she would not be happy, but I don't think it should be cold to the point of discomfort in the house especially if the one paying for the heating is fine with turning the heat higher. She found out I turned the heat up and got upset saying that ""the house is hot"" and that I shouldn't be touching the thermostat, I told her that I got my dads permission to do so and she was still mad saying that we don't need to be heating the house ""so high"" and that I should just wear more layers. I don't think I should be the one to budge on this situation since both my dad and I were uncomfortable with how low she kept setting it.  So am I the asshole here?",0.15
"AITA for ""verbally abusing"" my baby Lizard? Ok so they're not actually mine, they're my gfs, but we live together so even though she bought them and had them before we moved in together, and she pays for everything related to them, they're basically mine too. 
So anyway, we have a baby beardy who's 8 months old. It is a big people watcher. It loves to watch us do things around the house. This is important. 
This is one example of many, but earlier it was staring at me and I JOKINGLY said to it (the lizard) ""what the f*** are you looking at?""
And I say stuff like that all the time. That's just my dry sense of humor. My gf doesn't mind when I joke with her like that, and she jokes like that back. But she says I can't talk to the lizard like that cause it's a baby. 
So does cussing at your bearded dragon and calling it names like b***h actually do anything to it? Is it bad for them? I'm always super gentle and caring with them when I touch or pet them (we have 3 btw, and I talk to all of them like this.) 
My argument is that they are lizards, they can't understand language. Sure they ""MIGHT"" be able to understand at most like, they're name or maybe simple commands, but they don't know what any of the words I use mean, and even if they could, they aren't smart enough to be offended or have their feelings hurt, so AITA?",0.93

"WIBTA if I got my kid to pick between presents? There's some people that are just terrible gift givers - not for lack of caring or listening or trying. We just always seem to get it wrong. I am one of those people.

I've bought my kid (a teenager) two different main gifts as one option is high risk/high reward (could go over terribly but also could be loved) and one option is fairly safe (she won't be overjoyed but won't be disappointed). My plan was to decide on christmas eve which one to give and return the other one later (can't give both due to financial reasons unfortunately and also because we want to keep things fair between all kids by giving them a roughly similar budget). Then I wondered whether it would make more sense to wrap both, clearly tell her she can only keep one, and let her decide. But I can't figure out if it would be cruel to take away a gift if she ends up liking both. What do you think? I am completely open to any suggestion.",0.2

"AITA for not picking up my trash when it ended up all over my neighbor‚Äôs front lawn? So I got a text from my neighbor while I was at work, who told me the trash bags I‚Äôd left just outside my front door before leaving had ended up busted open all over her lawn. I‚Äôd assumed she meant they‚Äôd somehow opened up and got spread around by the wind and I apologized, saying I‚Äôd clean it up as soon as I got home.

At home I found a trail of trash leading from my front door to her lawn, with the bags themselves clearly ripped open and thrown around by my neighbor‚Äôs dogs. They had wandered onto my lawn, helped themselves to the bags, and made a mess of both our lawns.

My neighbor walked outside as soon as she saw me and it was clear she wasn‚Äôt happy. She demanded I pick up the trash and asked something along the lines of ‚ÄúWhat were you thinking leaving your trash bags on the ground like that?‚Äù

In my head I thought ‚ÄúYou mean right outside my door on my own property?‚Äù but I just apologized and said I would help her clean it up. (If her dogs hadn‚Äôt been involved in the mess I would have done it by myself, but considering it was them who went onto my property and got into them in the first place I thought it was more than fair to her for us both to clean it up.) Then my neighbor got MAD and said ‚ÄúWhat do you mean help ME? It‚Äôs your trash.‚Äù I pointed out that it was clearly her dogs who got into it, but that I would still help clean it up.

She claimed that it wasn‚Äôt her fault I left my trash on the ground instead of putting it in the dumpster. I responded that she was right, but that didn‚Äôt change the fact that it was her dogs who went onto my property and made the mess. She started to get pretty heated about the situation so I told her that since the mess was spread pretty evenly across both our lawns, I‚Äôd clean up mine and she could clean hers and I walked off.  She was NOT happy but I felt like that was a fair compromise considering I didn‚Äôt feel like cleaning up after her dogs at all.

It‚Äôs been almost a week and my neighbor‚Äôs still pissed about it and giving me the cold shoulder. My friend says she should have been more gracious about the situation considering her dogs were the ones that made the mess, but that she was right when she said I shouldn‚Äôt have left my trash on the ground and I should have offered to clean it all myself.

AITA for wanting my gf‚Äôs dog to go into the cargo hold? My gf got a dog 2 years ago and has been completely obsessed with her. Her dog (Mel) is a border collie that she got from a friend who raised border collies for his farm. She bought a house with a yard just to let Mel have space. That dog eats better than her or me and she took up hiking and ski touring even though she doesn‚Äôt like outdoor sports just for Mel. Mel gets antler chews and other toys that cost like $50-69 every month and she‚Äôs started agility with her which is another $150 in lessons a month. She insists we celebrate Mel‚Äôs birthday like a humans and buys her gifts and a party for her dog. She took a work from home job just so Mel didn‚Äôt have to be alone even though she liked doing to the office. We drove out 8 hours to go visit a friend rather than an hour flight which was cheaper if you factor in gas because she wanted to bring Mel along and didn‚Äôt want her to go in a crate in the cargo hold. Mel isn‚Äôt too badly behaved she doesn‚Äôt bark at all but I do think she totally spoils her dog. She denies it and gets angry every time I bring it up even if it‚Äôs teasingly. She recently talked about getting another dog and I can‚Äôt imagine how she will spoil that one. We had another fight about it because she insisted we drive to my parents house with Mel rather than put her in a crate and fly with us. The drive is 10h and the flight is only 2h and much safer since there‚Äôs massive snowfall and driving is hazardous. We wanted to drive originally but since there‚Äôs a lot of flooding and bridges out I didn‚Äôt want to drive but she insists because she‚Äôs afraid the cargo is too stressful for Mel. It‚Äôs very hard to find boarding for dogs and none of our friends are in town so we have to take her by I think a 2h plane ride isn‚Äôt the end of the world but she won‚Äôt budge and thinks I‚Äôm the asshole for not caring about Mel.

"AITA for not wanting to talk to my grandma every day? For starters, my grandma(71) raised me(26) and she is like a mother to me.

"AITA for putting my roommates dirty dishes in a trash bag at her door? I (22F) am a student with 3 other women that are also students. 

We all share the common areas like the kitchen, living room, and dining area. 

One of my roommates is a medical student and works a part time job. 
She likes to make home made meals almost everyday sometimes breakfast, lunch, and dinner. After she is done cooking she will leave her dishes in the sink for multiple days and the kitchen will look like an absolute wreck. 

This has made the kitchen basically inaccessible for everyone else due to the messes she leaves on the stove, in the sink, and on the counter top.

I have reached out to her 3 different times telling her to clean up after herself so that everyone can use the kitchen properly. She will blame it on my other roommates that refuse to use the kitchen because of the mess she lives it. 

We confronted her about this lie and she now uses the excuse that she is too tired to clean her mess even though she will talk on the phone all night to her friends or blaring music. 

2 weeks ago we set a rule stating that if anyone leaves a pile of dishes in the sink for more than 24 hours then they will be put in a bag outside their room door

I have tried to be nice and understanding and offer some solutions to help her problem. I recommended that she clean‚Äôs while she‚Äôs cooking or cleaning directly after she is done eating. She ignored my suggestions and didn‚Äôt even acknowledge the article I sent her to help understand the methods. 

Last night, I kindly asked her to clean her 2 day old mess and she said ‚ÄúI will do it when I am not tired‚Äù.

"AITA for wanting my gf to open her gifts on Christmas Eve? So, some context. I'm 17, as is my girlfriend, and we've been going out a little over 9 months. My family is pretty disjointed (Don't talk to father, one of my siblings cut contact with my mother) so we don't get to meet together too often. Regardless, we're planning to meet tomorrow, Christmas Eve, to celebrate Christmas and open gifts. I asked if my girlfriend could come, my sister (who's hosting the get-together) said she'd love to have her.

Now, onto the main issue. Today, my gf mentioned she didn't want to open her gift tomorrow. She knew I got her Christmas presents, so I believe that's what she's referring to. I told her that everyone will be opening their gifts, and it would be odd if she didn't open hers. She began to tell me how she didn't get anyone gifts like I did, and she already felt awkward enough going to a gathering when she didn't get anyone anything.

I tried explaining to her that this is the day we chose to celebrate Christmas together, and I want her to be a part of that- that she's part of my family now (corny, I know).  But she got pretty upset at the notion of opening gifts without getting any for anyone else. I figure now is probably not a good time to tell her my sister also got something for her... Ultimately, I told her it was her choice, that if it would ruin her night she of course didn't have to open anything, but I'd like her to.

"AITA for the holiday card I sent out to friends and family   

Me (34m) am single, live alone. Every year for the holidays when I send out cards to family and friends, I chose a design where you can select 4 or 5 photos on the card. This works for me because I am single and it lends me to selecting different meaningful photos that were taken through the year with friends, family members, and different events I took part in. I may also point out all the photos I selected were originally posted on my Instagram which is linked to my Facebook. Though I hardly use Facebook anymore, it's where I have a lot of family (extended family too) follow me, so they know or are aware of what I am doing in my personal life (at least chose to share).

Now, my friends and family are aware I am a naturist (nudist). That I attend naturist resorts and member of one of the societies. I am very open about it talking about it with my close friends (who do not practice the lifestyle), my parents know and are cool with it. Also, when I go to a resort on vacation or if it's a campsite and I am camping for the weekend I'll check-in. It's no secret. And may I point out the places I attend are all official naturist places, meaning they are family-friendly, non-sexual/swinger locations. It's merely social nudity, with plenty of families and children around, a concept I am aware of is kind-of foreign to many Americans. Yes, I am an American, but my circle is progressive.

So, one of the photos I selected, which is in a small, about 1.5 inch by 1-inch rectangle is me visiting a naturist resort, which I attended this summer. The photo is non-sexual and shows noting, as stated I am a male and is taken from the top of pelvic area up, but one could tell I am clearly naked by the photo by seeing my pelvic area and they don't make bathing suits or shorts the low. But, as stated nothing is seen, the photo is taken from the top of my pelvic area up, and there is no one else in the photo, so no naked bodies blurred out in the background, just woods. I am standing next to a sign that says the name of the resort, that's it.

Like with the other photos, it was also perversely posted to Instagram and Facebook, with a lot of friends liking it, and it was so tastefully done it wasn't even flagged by Facebook's AI.

I sent out about 50 photos to friends and family. Some people contacted me saying they got it, they love the wishes/update holiday message and photos. Then, the other day my mom called to tell me how much she and my dad enjoys the card, but my aunt, who I only see once every 3 years, but is friends with me on Facebook, did not think the photo was appropriate. (I don't know why my aunt couldn't contact me directly, she has my number, and if not, she could have always asked my mom for it) And that next year, I should not use that kind of photo. I told my mom no one else had a problem with it. And if she has a problem with the card, she could have contacted me directly and next year I would just not send her a card. My mom said I am wrong",0.99
"AITA for wanting my SO to spend Christmas with me? So, I (27F) love Christmas. It's my favorite time of the year. There's two options for Christmas this year: with my family or with my SO's (31M) family. However, we have a dog (Charlie) and I don't want to leave him home alone. Basically, SO'as family doesn't like dogs and taking Charlie there is not a good idea. Also, they are extremely racist, fatphobic and sexist, so I don't really want to go there (I'm black and treating for anxiety and eating disorder).
My family, however, loves pets and, knowing my situation, they avoid talking about weight. So, I decided I should go there. The problem is, my SO wants to go to his family's, but not because he likes being there, just because he doesn't want to hear them complaining if he's not there.
I got upset, of course, but he says I'm overreacting since it's (to him) just another day. He KNOWS how important this is to me, but he'd rather having me with his family, knowing they will probably say things that will trigger my ED, than going with me to my mom's.

Because it‚Äôs not really my story to tell and I didn‚Äôt want to air my girlfriends dirty laundry while she wasn‚Äôt around I just tried to tell him that something happened and we needed a ride (in a dismissive tone to try to end the convo). But of course with my family obviously having a gossipy side to them, he asked for more details behind it all in a rather catty manner. Me, just wanting to relax and already annoyed that everyone was talking about it for some reason, ended up snapping back ‚Äúit‚Äôs none of your fucking business why any of it happened‚Äù. This left him silent and our sister joking that I‚Äôm obviously not in the mood for questions. I just finished eating and once they were out of earshot, I asked our father why brother got offended over me telling him to butt out. He said it‚Äôs because of my tone but I think my brother just shouldn‚Äôt have the audacity to attempt to gossip over something I tried to dismiss. Was I an ass here?",0.38
"AITA for telling my mom it'd be better if my dad divorced her? Okay, I know it sounds bad. It probably is, but it's hard to judge my own actions I guess.

For some context, my (15F) mom has had untreated schizophrenia for more than 15 years now. My dad has been trying so many things to help her, she's been to therapy when I was little but nothing came from it.

And I feel like the situation is getting worse and worse these days. She's always restricted my dad from seeing most members of his family because she's paranoid, but now she thinks that his mom, an elderly lady who lives alone, is a terrorist who put us all in danger. I have seen her like, twice in the last 10 months.

And I hate it so, so much. For me, for my brother and my dad who still managed to stay even after all of this. And it's insane to me to see that he still loves her. I have even seen him cry for the first time in my life last summer because he was considering divorce and it hurt him so bad. And it made me so angry, which probably led to what I told her.

A few weeks prior, she was having a fight with my brother and it escalated after I tried to defend him. She then basically revealed us that she thinks my dad's cheating on her with several women, that he has meadow and syphilis (???) and that he'll die in one year because of it. Just in case, I KNOW that all of this is pure bullshit her mental illness is making her believe.

But at that moment, I got so bitter. I then basically told her that 1) I wouldn't be able to live with her if she didn't go to therapy, and that 2) I couldn't believe the fact my dad hadn't divorced her even though it would've been better for him. 

Because he doesn't deserve this situation and her thinking of him like this considering everything he has done to try support the family (didn't say that part).

She was visibly hurt. I don't regret the first part. It might seem like an ultimatum but it's the truth. I don't want to keep contact with her if it's hurting me. But the second part was probably unnecessary. I mean, it might be true, but I know that she was not in the right mindset, especially since my dad was 'at fault' in her head. But I don't know. Everything is so complicated and I don't know what to think anymore.

TL;Dr Told untreated, schizophrenic mom that it'd be better if my dad divorced her because he didn't deserve this whole situation (having to cut ties with his entire family). Did it make me an asshole considering her mental state?",0.03
"AITA for wanting to return Christmas gifts I (23f) brought Christmas gifts for all of my immediate family ( mom,dad,step mom, nephew, and niece) I also brought gifts for my boyfriends family on his behalf.

I placed some of the gifts under her tree and when I did this she stated that she had not brought me anything. At first I thought she was just joking but now I know that she was serious. I now have next to no money for myself following the holiday. I expressed to my boyfriend that I can foresee myself getting into a financial crunch. He suggested that I return some of my gifts.

"AITA for telling my sister in law that she should leave with her dog after the dog snapped?  I was recently at my in-laws for a holiday meal. My partner has two sisters, who each have a dog. The younger sister (Emma) has an older dog that‚Äôs like 12 years old. The older sister (Julia) has like a 6 month old puppy. Both brought the dogs to my in-laws as they‚Äôre a big dog family, always grew up with them. I‚Äôve never had a dog and nobody in my family ever has either.

Julia‚Äôs dog was pretty hyper all night, and Emma‚Äôs dog doesn‚Äôt do much but lie around and sleep. Julia‚Äôs dog kept trying to play with Emma‚Äôs dog, but Emma‚Äôs dog wasn‚Äôt having it. At one point Julia‚Äôs dog was trying once again to play, and Emma‚Äôs dog barked, growled, and snapped at Julia‚Äôs dog.

"AITA For Reporting My Coworker? Hi guys it's christmas eve and i'm starting to feel guilty, since this guy got fired. I think I did the right thing but I feel like shit cause he lost his job on xmas.

Quick background: I work in a supervisor position, and the colleague in question was also a supervisor. We have many different worksites so I travel to different worksites.  


1) Start the week out at a new worksite and in the afternoon during my shift i get a text from an unknown number saying ""Hey i'm a male and I want to give you the best blowjob, all sloppy and wet let me know if your into that kid of thing"".

  
2) I think it's one of my friends with a new phone number so I jokingly respond sure and go along with it. I try to catch the person off guard and call them from a **second burner number I have on my phone. (I use this app so I can call clients/workers/or other people I don't want to have my personal number)**

3) I start to realize that this isn't a joke but this person seems to know suspiciously a lot about me. What I look like etc.

4) I try to play into it to get this person to send a picture of their face since now i'm like whot tf is this? and end the conversation and block the number. 

5) The next day I get a similar text to my **burner number** saying ""to meet me at this address, I want you to facefuck me in my car"" 

6) The address I get sent is very close to my work site and I start to put the pieces together and I realize it's my coworker. 

7) The person continues to text me and then I ask them to send me a location, and then this is where he fucked up. **He sends me a location to my PERSONAL NUMBER from HIS PERSONAL NUMBER** continuing the conversation that we were having from **BOTH OUR BURNER NUMBERS**.

8) I get him to admit it was him and immediately I'm like there's no way I can work at the job site with this guy after all the things he said to me. More importantly, I thought of the fact that he has access to all other phone numbers of employees and he's only been with the company for 4 months. If he's doing this to me and I've only been on this worksite for 3 days to a **person of equal rank**, **what could has he done or what will he do to the workers?**

9) **I also realized that he was watching my reactions on my first shift as he was texting me and it freaked me tf out.** Gave me some weird stalker vibes.

10) I reported him to my boss right away with all the evidence and he ended up getting fired. I really felt like I did the right thing at the time, but being with my family on Xmas eve dinner I was like fuck man this guy just lost his job on Xmas and I wonder I could have handled it differently.  


P.s I'm not afraid of him and I didn't really do it for me but I just thought about how unprofessional that was and that if I did that to another worker I would expect to be fired.

"AITA for getting upset with a friend over pizza? I (17M) am a high school senior and an avid theatre kid. Two months ago, my school did the musical production of ‚ÄúThe Wizard of Oz‚Äù which I was obviously involved in. On one of the last rehearsals before opening night, my friend from the cast, Tia (14F), who is a freshman this year, decided to order a small pizza to share with some of the cast and crew members while everyone was getting ready to leave. When she told me that I was going to be one of the kids she was sharing the pizza with, I told her; ‚ÄúJust so you know, I‚Äôm vegetarian‚Äù and assumed that since she knew I was vegetarian, she would order a half cheese half pepperoni pizza. 

When the pizza arrived and I went to get a slice, I discovered that despite knowing I was vegetarian, Tia had ordered a pepperoni pizza and no plain cheese. I made an upset remark about it being all pepperoni, and another friend in the cast told me I could just pick the pepperoni off. I told her I‚Äôm a vegetarian and don‚Äôt like to eat food that had touched meat. When I asked Tia why she ordered pepperoni pizza despite knowing I was vegetarian, she said it was because she ordered for multiple people, even though the other people she shared the pizza with could eat cheese pizza as well as pepperoni pizza if she had ordered half cheese half pepperoni. 

After a few minutes, I decided to let it go because it was very nice of Tia to order that pizza, even though she didn‚Äôt order any vegetarian options. I grabbed a paper towel, a slice of pizza, picked off the pepperoni, and blotted off any meat grease with the paper towel before eating it. After I finished my pizza slice and was getting ready to head to my stepdad‚Äôs car, I thanked Tia for the pizza she ordered.

Even though it happened a few months ago and I did manage to let it go (which is much easier said than done for me), I feel like my first reaction may have been a bit harsh.

"AITA for telling my son the truth about Santa? This happened a couple weeks ago and I'm still not sure if I'm an AH or not.

We live in the USA but are not Christians and Christmas isn't celebrated in our culture. We just treat the end of the year as a holiday break and don't specifically do anything on Christmas Day.

My son started kindergarten this year. Earlier this month he came home talking about Santa and Christmas and all the other kids saying they were going to get presents. I thought this would be a teachable moment so I explained that Santa isn't real but we (my spouse and I) would get him presents when his school break started. He asked how the other kids would get presents if Santa isn't real and here is where I might be in the wrong, I told him that it was actually their parents who would get the presents and give it to the kids on Christmas, but I didn't think to tell him not to tell the other kids that.

Well of course he did that and some of the parents figured out who told their kids and I got some complaints messaged to me about ruining Christmas for their kids. Part of me understand where they're coming from but I still feel like I shouldn't have to lie to my kid to protect the illusion for others.",0.45
"AITA for not buying my son a PS5 for Christmas? I(40M) have an 11 year old son"" Brandon"" with my ex(38F). After many court appearances, I was awarded with full custody of my son. I have been with my current girlfriend for almost a year. She has a son(12M) who does not get along with Brandon. 

Money has been exceptionally tight this past year and my hours were cut to part-time recently. Brandon told me that he really wanted a PS5 this year and I spent months searching for one. I did find one being sold for selling price, but the person turned out to be a scammer. 

I ended up buying Brandon some nice clothes, toys and games for his Nintendo switch. Brandon opened up his gifts and was very disappointed there was no PS5. He quickly got over it and went to play on his switch. My girlfriend and her son came over and he had gotten the PS5 from his dad. He brought the game system to the house and my son got very upset. 

My son spent most of Christmas in his room and he was very upset. I went to see him and started yelling at me that I ruined Christmas for him. I did apologize for not buying him the Christmas. I ended up yelling at my girlfriend for having her son bring the PS5.

"WIBTA if I offered my ex partner cash to agree to sign over custody of our two children to my mother. So there's a bit of story here.
   So first off I'm not a terrific dad. Iv got a bit of a drinking problem. Iv always worked at least 40 hrs, I loved putting my kids to bed, I took care of the house. I liked drawing with my kids. But yes, I did drink more than I should have, and ran away from being more honest with my partner of 8 years. 
    We've been broken up for about 2 months now. We were pretty much a married couple with two kids. We'd been together for about 9 years and have a 6 yo and a 2yo .
    The breakup has not been good. I found out she had relapsed. Shes got a history of iv drug use. I didn't think me drinking would lead to that, I mean she'd been drinking too. . My knee jerk reaction when I found out was to give the kids to my mom. I still had to/have to work full time( I had just bought a new house in September and am in the process of trying to move). I knew I couldn't take care of them. And I knew she couldn't either.  
    I give my mother cash every week to help with food and stuff. I can't keep the kids  at my house  right now because everything is in disarray while I pack and the house gets fixed. Once I move I will be able to hire a babysitter so I can keep them a few nights a week.
     She has pretty much not been present since the kids have been at my mother's. She moved a lot of clothes and furniture into my mother's house, saying she was moving in, but hasn't come home untill around 2 or 3 in the morning every day, if she shows up at all
 She does not help my mom take care of the kids.
     No one really wants to deal with her anymore. She made a scene at Christmas dinner tonight and stormed out with the kids to go to her mom's house. She said she'd be back Tuesday, but then told my mom she could watch the kids Sunday afternoon for a few hours.
    I know she has a history of drug use, not that I'm any better. I know she'll trick, she's sent me pictures since the break up.
    I'm talking to a lawyer at the start of the new year, I  want my mother to have custody. My father's reaction was different and I want to know the communities opinion.
   First off he's never liked my partner.. He suggested we give her 25000$, let her keep the truck of ours she's been using as a daily driver, and let her have one or two nights a week visitation. Shes still employed by our family. All of that instead of going to custody court. 
    I know I'm not a great person. I go to meetings now.i haven't gotten the hang of it yet. The kids are thriving at my mother's house though. At the end neither me or my partner were parents and the kids were suffering. I got my oldest transferred to a better school near my mom. My mom loves being with them, they love her. My youngest is actually talking.. I'm terrified she's going to rip them out of that situation. Idk where she stays or what she does most of the time.

"WIBTA for being upset with my gf for not spending the night at my place ever? My girlfriend(21) and I (23) have been dating for two years, we are both working hard for our careers, we've talked about a future together etc etc. I've spent countless hours with her family on vacations, at their home, at dinner and more and to the best of my knowledge, they do actually like it a lot and we all get along quite well. Her family comes from communist Russia days and are relatively traditional in the way that ""men can do what they want when they want and women need to work for their freedom, take care of the house"" etc. 

I have asked her, and she has asked her parents many times to spend the night at my house but they always says no. It's getting to the point where I feel like she needs to just do what she wants but she is scared of being out casted by her parents. I understand her need to be loved by her family but they are very nice people and who really fucking love their children and that's great but I just can't wrap my head around why they don't ever allow her to spend the night at my house. they even let us go on a week and a half long road trip, driving over 3000 miles without even putting up much of a fight. We are grown adults and it makes me feel insignificant to not be able to do such a simple but necessary thing in this relationship. her brother, who is a few years older, has no issues with sleeping at his girlfriends house or vice versa.

"AITA for telling my sister she has alienated her child this Christmas? First of all, mobile, formatting, apologies in advance. Tldr at bottom.

My (40m) sister (39F) has a daughter 'Bethany'(17F)  that lives me and my wife (40F). 

The reason she lives with us is because we are currently supporting her schooling and education. My sister has no idea how important the right support is, and has completely failed to give it. She learned from my mother, so not her fault.

Today my sister called my niece to wish her Merry Christmas, it's a nice thing to do, I appreciate that she wants to speak to her daughter on Christmas day. I am happy she made the effort. But while on the call she tells  Bethany about the expensive presents her sister 'Jo' (10F) got. All the while Bethany received nothing from her mother.

After I told my sister that it was an arsehole thing to do, that she could have at least sent her a card, or messaged me to ask her to pick up a small gift for Bethany. I said that by not making any effort beyond an easy video call she might as well have told Bethany that Jo is the favoured child.

A short while later my brother messages me telling me I'm an arsehole for saying this, and that I'm trying to drive a wedge between them. I have been incredibly careful to keep any of this from Bethany, and have also been very careful in not telling my sister how badly my niece feels, (not just today, but has for a while.) 

I probably spoke to my sister more harshly than I would have other people, but she only understands conflict. She is the kind of person that thinks shouting is the only way to get your point across.

So Reddit, am I the arsehole?

Tldr; my sister never sent her 17 year old daughter a gift, or even a card for Christmas, then told her about the expensive gifts her ten year old sister got.

Edit: minor formatting change.

Edit 2: Just wanted to clarify when I said my sister learned her behaviour from her mother, and it wasn't her fault, it was meant to be tongue in cheek. Both myself and most of my other siblings knows how important the right support is. There is no reason Bethany's mother hasn't been able to improve her behaviour, other than laziness.",0.05
"AITA for gossiping with my mom? The title might look strange, but given a huge argument ensued over it I kind of wanted other opinions. 

I (19F) have parents finalizing a divorce. The reason for this divorce is that my dad was not loyal and wishes to live and be with the woman he cheated with and her kids. 

Since I am only child, my parents very often will rant to me about what the other has said or done. Due to the situation, I often ‚Äúgossip‚Äù or discuss issues relating to the divorce with my mother, as I feel very wronged by my father. I will often tell her things my dad has specifically said to keep quiet about, given the things he says are often ridiculous, shocking and make me upset. 

My father is obviously aware of this because my mom is very confrontational (verbally). When I share things that get her mad, she will angrily confront my dad. 

My dad and I fought because he said I should not be telling her things he tells me in confidentiality, and says I am violating his privacy. In addition, due to my mom‚Äôs emotional nature, he says she sometimes misunderstands his words and twists them to make what he says appear worse than what he mean‚Äôt. To his credit, I believe there is some truth in that, but I don't believe I am wrong for telling my mom the things my dad tells me that cause me great discomfort or shock.

"AITA for not helping style my mum for her wedding? My mum (57) is getting married to her long term partner in a small, intimate wedding next April. She has asked me (25F) to help style her and find a dress. I have a good sense of style and fashion for myself and take pride in my attire. However, my mum and I have vastly different styles as well as body shapes and I only know how to dress myself. 


I've said I would come with her dress shopping for support but in terms of finding a style, she would need to consult with a stylist who has experience with mature brides to help her find the right fit. 


She has become quite upset by this and fluctuates between yelling at me or refusing to talk to me at all and doesn't understand why I won't help her. I've explained that I am unfamiliar with how to dress for her body shape and don't know how to pick out dresses that would work for her. I've given her some helpful suggestions like she should find a dress with long, loose sleeves and midi length. And I have reiterated to her that I'll still come dress shopping with her and give my support. I feel my reasoning and advice is fair. 


Where I might be an asshole is not explaining the full reason why don't want to help her. I have ADHD, which she doesn't know about as I got myself assessed as an adult. I have poor organisational skills and time management, setting aside time to completely style my mum for a wedding would overwhelm everything else in my life. I have a history of stress-induced psychoses, and I'm currently doing really well off medication but my life is a very fine balance and I don't want to tip it. 


Where I might be a real asshole, is that I really struggle to participate authentically in activities that don't interest me and I'll be honest, having to find styles of dresses that would work for my mum is a task that seems overwhelming and I'm not interested in doing.

"AITA for not picking up my GF from the airport We are in a long distance relationship for the past 8 months.

"WIBTA for returning a gift my BF took time to pick? Okay, so I know it sounds bad, and that's actually why I'm here.

So my (24F) BF (25) offered me a bracelet that I love, as well as earings that I really don't like. When he did, he said that I could return them if I didn't like them, to which I answered that I loved them, well...  Because that's the polite thing to do.

The thing is that I don't like them. I actually told him to check with my mother to know what to get me, which he did, but then he didn't listen to her. Now, I know it took him A LOT of time to pick those, so I don't want to hurt him. He put a lot of thought into it.

But they also look expensive, and I know I'll only wear them when I'm with him, and  just enough so he doesn't ask why I never wear them. So this is a waste of his money, and I don't like that. I would have actually prefered something less expensive but more fitting to my tastes.

And of course, I wish he had offered me something I liked more because wearing his gift all the time (I always wear jewlery, only pieces that are gifts and remind me of the people I love), would mean thinking about him everytime I wear them.

"AITA for asking my husband to cut Christmas with his parents short because I can‚Äôt stand them? Husbands parents and I are very different people. They are decent folks but I just don‚Äôt understand them or like their lifestyle. They are just different people. 

They like to do everything together. They have no sense of personal space which is a huge issue for someone like me who has social anxiety. They seem to have a comment on everything happening in our lives. I perhaps feel that I may be over sensitive to these things at times, but I truly believe that one should live and let live. 

They also have no understanding or empathy for what‚Äôs important to my husband IMO. It doesn‚Äôt seem to bother him but bothers me a lot. For example: Husband has done some pretty great things at work recently and this will not even evoke a simple well done from them.

Husband was recently responsible for raising a huge huge amount of money for charity and has worked really hard in making this happen (talking saving lives type stuff). His mums response was ‚ÄúPeople at work recently ran a half marathon and also raised money‚Äù. Good for them but why can‚Äôt you just acknowledge your sons achievements?

Examples like this piss me the hell off. I can see this bothers husband but he is always defending them. He tries so hard and that breaks my heart. 

On this particular trip, I have constantly let my husband know how unhappy I am to be with them for an extended period of time (we are visiting them for 10 days. This is day 3). 

In the past, I have said that I‚Äôd be happy to spend 2-3 days with them but no more than that. He is pissed off that I agreed to spend 10 days (which I did) with them but I am now changing my mind, which I am. Honestly, I did this to make him happy but frankly, I can‚Äôt take it. 

Today, I am at my wits end because MIL has gone out of her way to make me feel like a terrible mother. This is despite me telling her that she should stop commenting now as it isn‚Äôt helpful. This is over my son having a persistent cough (no, it isn‚Äôt Covid) and me telling my in laws that we are having it looked at, that we are doing everything we can to investigate it. Her response: You are damaging his lungs. You aren‚Äôt doing enough. 

At this point husband and FIL tell me to be cool, and that MIL only has the best intentions. I am sure she does but I don‚Äôt really want to be the bigger person and put up with this. 

Later I told my husband that I‚Äôd like to cut the trip short because why should I have to put up with this? 

Now, he is sad and upset and I feel like I am the asshole. 

AITA?

Edit:

I suggested that I leave without him or my son and I could leave without him. 

I have plenty of reasons I could use to leave. 

Most genuine one being that my son had a sore throat and I‚Äôd be more comfortable tending to him in my own home. 

I told my husband that I genuinely don‚Äôt mind if he wants to stay. He should totally do what he wants to. 

Husband however wants us all to stick together which adds to the complication.",0.42
"AITA for offering to pay for my nephew‚Äôs tuition? 
My nephew got accepted into Stanford medical school.

At a family gathering, things got awkward at the dinner table because my wife‚Äôs parents asked my nephews parents, Kim and Jack, about Stanford.

My nephew, Kyle was looking glum all night and when his grandparents asked about stanford, he got really upset and started arguing with his parents right there at the dinner table.

His father Jack banged his hand on the table and everyone in the restaurant looked at our table.

Jack said that he and Kim had no way of paying for a school that expensive and that Kyle was gonna just have to save up the money himself. 

I asked how much tuition was going to be for the undergrad and my nephew said it was about 60 grand a year. Then his mom yelled at him for talking about money at the dinner table.

I make decent money and I‚Äôve been sitting on a massive inheritance that I was considering using to start a goat farm. But I was always raised that family should come first, so I offered to pay Kyle‚Äôs tuition until he got to grad school.

Jack and Kim started yelling at me and Jack even told me to ‚ÄúGo f*ck yourself, you rich snob.‚Äù

My wife was just glaring at me the whole time. Kyle was balling because his parents said there was no way they were letting me pay for his school.

I spoke up again and pointed out that Kyle was 20 years old and that he should be allowed to make his own decisions. I said to Kyle directly, ‚ÄúJust come up and visit us some time and we can talk more about it.‚Äù

Then Kim stood up from the table and said Kyle would never stay with us or would not be allowed back home.

My wife was apologizing profusely to Jack and her sister Kim while I was just trying to get a grip on the situation.

My father in law just shook his head at me and laughed angrily and then said ‚ÄúThanks for ruining dinner, if you wanna flash your money around why don‚Äôt you pay the fucking bill so we can leave.‚Äù

When my wife and I got home, she told me I was an embarrassment and that I opened up a rift between her sister and her that had taken years to repair.

I have faith in Kyle and I just want to see him succeed. I know he could get through Stanford but there‚Äôs no way he could save up all that money himself. I thought I was doing a good thing.",0.33
"AITA for rejecting a mistletoe kiss? Hello everyone. First time posting here.

I'd like to know, in your opinion, how rude is it to reject a kiss under mistletoe during Christmas Eve?

Granted, I did a little bit more than that but everyone around me is acting like it was quite mean on my part to publicly say no.

The story goes like this: my parents threw a relatively big Christmas party with family and friends. One of them is an old coworker of my dad, who's son always had a big crush on me. I should probably mention that this guy has high functioning autism, and probably misinterpreted my friendliness in the past.

Anyways, he and I went to the store to buy more snacks for the party and when we came back, ""someone"" had placed a branch of mistletoe under the entrance of the living room, prompting people to playfully tell me to kiss him. Even my mom started to cheer for it.

The guy's eyes lit up as he stuttered and licked his lips. He even said ""Don't worry, I won't use my tongue unless you want me to."" At first I thought about giving him a tiny kiss on the cheek, but after that I was so grossed out that I couldn't even do that.

I simply said ""No thank you."" Which prompted the small crowd to insist (playfully). He tried to grab my hand but I quickly turned him away and audibly said ""don't fucking touch me."" Everyone kinda went silent after that, and during the rest of the party I avoided all contact with this guy. I also went to bed early to make sure I didn't have to spend any time with him, since he and his family are usually the last people to leave (sometimes even spending the night with us).

Later, my mom, aunts and cousins told me I was very rude and I could have just given him a little peck or something. I also felt like a hypocrite because last year I also pressured my uncle to kiss a complete stranger during the Christmas party (they're now happily engaged, though). 

But truth is that I just didn't want to do it. I didn't want to give the guy any hopes for anything with me at first, but he was quick to gross the hell out of me. He's always behaved in ways that are barely acceptable, but due to his condition I tolerated him and even included him in my friends circle. However, at that point I don't think it would've been good for any of us to play along. Granted, I lashed out and maybe it was unwarranted, but I felt overwhelmed at the moment. 

The guy stayed pretty quiet for the rest of the evening, my cousin said he catched him crying in the bathroom too. So I certainly hurt his feelings.

I haven't apologized, and I honestly don't want to. Should I feel bad about that?

Am I the asshole?

Tl;Dr - I harshly rejected a kiss during the Christmas party, most people seem to think I was rude. The guy is probably devastated at the moment.",0.06
"AITA for asking for a refund from a private chef Names have been changed for privacy

My friend Amy and I decided to surprise our boyfriends for a private chef meal as a Christmas gift to them. We planned the evening a few weeks in advance and hire Jack (a private chef we‚Äôve hired before) to cook for the four of us at Amy's apartment. Right when I get there, Jack announced that he's drinking with us. Invited himself to take shots of alcohol whenever we were taking shots. He even poured himself wine whenever we were having wine. We didn't say anything because he's a nice guy and it's just a bit of alcohol. The meal was delicious and after the dessert course, Amy paid him and tipped him in cash, a total of $500.

Here is where things started getting crazy, we decided to stay in and play some board games and drinking games. Jack invites himself to hang out with us, but instead of drinking wine or beer like the rest of us, he takes straight shots and gets wasted. Then out of nowhere Jack receives a call and goes downstairs to meet someone. When he was gone, Amy asked if Jack invited someone over, which would've been rude. Jack comes back a few minutes later with coke, He then snorts it and offers it to everyone there, nobody wanted any as we were just having a chill night.

I get exhausted at this point so my boyfriend and I decided to head out. We asked Jack when he would be leaving and he said he was staying and started to drink more. He is just helping himself to Amy's alcohol at this point. When I get home I text Amy to see if Jack has left yet and he hasn't. Hours later he still hasn't left. Amy and her bf are ready to go to bed and he still doesn't leave. They keep implying to him that he needs to leave but he doesn't leave and makes excuses like ""after I finish this drink"" and continues drinking. They don't straight up kick him out though because he is wasted. Amy and her boyfriend did all the dishes at this point and pack up all his things. I text Jack and ask for his address so I can send him an uber but he doesn't reply til hours later and has the audacity to ask if I had a good time. I am extremely pissed at him at this point.

Amy and Jack don't know each other outside of these two dinners so I feel extremely terrible. I told Amy we should ask for a refund but she thinks I'm making a big deal out of it since the actual dinner portion of the night went well. I still think $500 is a lot of money for a terrible experience. Jack is the head chef at a very nice restaurant and should've been more professional. This was also my Christmas gift to my boyfriend and I don't think he had a great time.

AITA for wanting to quit the job my stepmom got me? My stepmom got me a job in August working with her at a third party insurance company. I work in between finance & clerical. The work is not stressful or hard but the people are extremely disrespectful. I (18f) am the youngest in the office and people don‚Äôt seem to take me seriously. One example is this one woman came up to me while I was in the finance office and asked me ‚ÄúDid you go through all the mail today. I didn‚Äôt get any manual claims‚Äù I said yes and she continued by saying ‚ÄúWell obviously you didn‚Äôt go through all the mail or I would have my claims.‚Äù She said it as she was walking away so I couldn‚Äôt even explain myself. It doesn‚Äôt seem that serious but when it‚Äôs something like that everyday it gets tiring. My coworker who only works clerical is around 35f. She is ok at her job.. she could be better and she takes a while to catch onto simple things although she gets there eventually. Everyone always goes to her first for questions or help and they just blatantly ignore me constantly. I am just getting tired of the energy in the office and the disrespect. I am contemplating putting in my two weeks. Also my stepmom is on maternity leave although I wouldn‚Äôt have expect special treatment. WIBTA?,0.03
"AITA for being upset over Stolen Mommy Moment I‚Äôm finding out that after 4 years of being with my husband, my MIL is a covert narc. Latest episode that truely triggered me was I had to get an MRI done 4 hours away from home and my husband came with so we had my MIL take care of our two girls (1 year and the other is 7 years). The one year old is my biological daughter. She‚Äôs the first and only I plan on having. 

Anywhos for the last couple of months I had been debating as to when I would like to paint her nails for the first time and I had decided on a light pink, non toxic, peel able color that could be removed without acetone. I hadn‚Äôt decided on exactly when as I think 14 months is a bit young.

Today my MIL sends me a picture of my daughter sitting on her lap with her toe nails painted in BRIGHT red and tbh I almost lost my shit. My instant thought was ‚Äúwow that‚Äôs so cute‚Äù quickly followed by 1) why didn‚Äôt she give me a heads up or even asked? And 2) why wasn‚Äôt I there?

MIL is very high conflict and takes any opposition or contrast in opinion as a personal offense. I don‚Äôt know how I can approach this without rocking the boat too much all I know is I refuse to stand for this. If she could do this with fingernails whos to say she wouldn‚Äôt try it with her first haircut?

Im so angry, disappointed and hurt by her actions. I know if I don‚Äôt say something she will take it as a green light to proceed with similar actions. But I‚Äôve also never been good at asserting my dominance if it means getting isolated. I also don‚Äôt know if perhaps I‚Äôm just being dramatic. 

I had my daughter at 30. I have a terminal illness which will most likely limit all the ‚Äúfirsts‚Äù I‚Äôll get to be present for so I try to make the most of all the milestones knowing very well it could be the last I witness.

"AITA for telling my dad that my habits are victimless? I'm (18m) currently home for the winter break from college, and my dad (53m) is getting on my nerves. He keeps lecturing me about my habits, like having my headphones on when I go on my laptop (I'm not even listening to music, just need to concentrate), or getting up at about 8 in the morning. I have nothing important over the break, so I don't even see why he's lecturing me about this. He's making a big deal over it, and nags me about it and is visibly mad about it. During the school days I get up at like 6:30 am, I just need some rest over the break. Or every now and then I get a snack like crackers and hummus, and my dad yells that I will be fat, even though they're not that unhealthy, and I exercise 5-6 times a week, yet he's the one who's overweight.

In contrast, his habits are gross and annoying. For example, he sneezes very loudly and abruptly, and it sounds disgusting. Also, he makes loud slamming sounds when he opens or closes doors, and he smacks his lips when he eats. He constantly has sauce stains on his face when he eats and tries to approach others, and he makes a ton of gross guttural noises. He sweats everywhere, and he touches people on the shoulder and back when he talks to them, and I mean literally everyone.

"AITA for Not Taking my Brother‚Äôs Aspergers Seriously? Background: My (23 nb) brother (20 m) has a form of Aspergers that manifests in a lot of anger issues. These usually result in him throwing screaming fits and hitting things, sometimes causing them to break. I know it‚Äôs something he can‚Äôt control because it‚Äôs part of his condition, but I myself happen to have a sensitivity to loud noises. Said sensitivity can be triggered by things like sirens, loud or shrill crying, and yelling, and tend to result in me having a panic freeze and my ears ringing for a few minutes afterwards depending on the intensity. 
My family doesn‚Äôt really acknowledge my condition because it didn‚Äôt become difficult to manage until I was in my teens and tend to think I‚Äôm faking it for attention, compared to my brother who was diagnosed early on. 
My brother has serious ‚Äúgame rage‚Äù that tends to trigger his screaming fits frequently which consequently triggers my noise condition. Most of the time. I‚Äôm in a situation where I can quietly walk outside and peacefully avoid him for the hour or so his fit lasts and come back home when he‚Äôs done. However, sometimes his fits happen when I‚Äôm doing something I can‚Äôt leave the house for like online interviews or working on art commission.  When this occurs. there‚Äôs nothing I can do about it, so I‚Äôm forced to ‚Äúgrin and bear it‚Äù because my family will yell at me if I do any of my coping mechanisms like cupping my ears or folding my knees against my chest. 
This time in particular, I was drinking a cup of tea while working on an art commission and my brother was struggling with a video game and started having a particularly loud meltdown. It caught me off guard and I choked on my tea, spitting some of it up on my laptop and spilling some of the contents on the keyboard. Now my laptop‚Äôs mouse bar isn‚Äôt working and none of my troubleshooting seems to work. Even as I frantically tried to troubleshoot, my brother continued to scream and throw things , and I yelled back at him to stop because his actions startled me and caused me to mess my laptop. He turned his wraith upon me, this time joined by siblings and mother, saying he can‚Äôt control his anger and how it‚Äôs not his fault I do stupid things like eat and drink in my room or have hysterical reactions to normal loud noises. I told him that having Aspergers doesn‚Äôt erase the consequences that arise from his actions. Now, he‚Äôs sulking in his room and my family thinks I don‚Äôt take his mental health seriously. 
I don‚Äôt know what to do at this point, and I understand that oftentimes, when everyone says you‚Äôre being an asshole, you‚Äôre probably an asshole. But just in case, I‚Äôd like a second opinion.

"AITA for barely leaving my room when visiting my sick grandparents? I‚Äôm (19 M) currently visiting my grandparents for Christmas. I initially went to see my dad‚Äôs mum for a few days and I‚Äôm currently seeing my mum‚Äôs parents. Whilst I‚Äôve always known my dad‚Äôs mum, visiting her a few times a year (we live quite far away), my mum was estranged from her family for over a decade, meaning until about 2 years ago I hadn‚Äôt seen her parents since I was really young which I barely remember. 

Whenever I visit either my dad‚Äôs mum or mum‚Äôs parents, I tend to spend a lot of time in my room away from everyone else. I don‚Äôt mean to be antisocial but I get overwhelmed very easily in unfamiliar environments and I‚Äôve never felt much of a connection with my grandparents, even my dad‚Äôs mum. I like talking to her but I get drained very quickly in social situations when I feel like I can‚Äôt relax fully, especially when I‚Äôm uncomfortable. It‚Äôs always too hot in her house and unfamiliar noises are overwhelming. 

It also doesn‚Äôt help that I‚Äôm transgender and can‚Äôt be out to my dad‚Äôs mum so I get misgendered and dead named there (not on purpose as my gran doesn‚Äôt know but if I told her she wouldn‚Äôt respond well). 

I‚Äôm also terrified of growing old, especially because both of my mum‚Äôs parents are very ill (my grandad has cancer and my gran has dementia) and my grandad keeps telling me that he feels trapped in a decaying body and that he wants to die. He only ever says this when we‚Äôre alone together but bearing in mind I barely know him because of the estrangement and I know that my mum‚Äôs parents were abusive to her in the past, I just feel really uncomfortable in their house. 

Although I understand why I isolate myself a lot when visiting, I feel like I should be making more of an effort to socialise and overcome these problems, especially when considering how sick my mum‚Äôs parents are. My dad‚Äôs dad passed away about 9 months ago and I never felt like I knew him as well as I‚Äôd have liked and I don‚Äôt want to have more regrets. My mum in particular has expressed frustration for how much time I spend alone in my room when I visit but I feel like I‚Äôm trying my best. 

I‚Äôm conscious of the fact that every visit could be the last time I see them but that just overwhelmed me more and I shut down and isolate as a coping mechanism. 

I realise I‚Äôve made A LOT of excuses but I‚Äôm genuinely not trying to justify my actions but explain where it‚Äôs coming from? I‚Äôm very willing to admit that I‚Äôm being selfish and need to try harder. 


TL;DR: I stay in my room a lot when visiting my grandparents because they make me uncomfortable but my parents are frustrated and I‚Äôm wondering if I‚Äôm an asshole for not making more of an effort",0.2
"AITA for not letting my daughter move in with me? My (56f) oldest daughter (26f) and I have had a strained relationship pretty much since she was in middle school. We often had shouting matches about her clothes (she did not need to be wearing tank tops and short shorts at 13!), school (she was often lazy and wouldn't study unless I made her, and this worked - she always had straight A's), and extracurriculars (I wouldn't let her quit violin and piano because she was so good at them. She also wanted to do gymnastics and ice skating, but by the time she wanted to start those, it would have been too late for her to be good at them). She went to a boarding school for high school and rarely called or visited. Same when she went to college. I made so many attempts at fostering a better relationship with her, but she pretty much never answered the phone. She paid for her own education and didn't really ask for anything. Eventually I accepted that we just wouldn't be close.

Her sister (24f) on the other hand was much better behaved. If I told her to do something, she wouldn't complain as much. She studied without being yelled at, and I didn't even have arguments with her. We have a great relationship. I was a little more relaxed with her since I didn't feel like I needed to fight her on everything. After she graduated and got her first job, she lived with me to save money, which I was more than happy with. I also paid for her car and education, and gave her money whenever she needed it. She's now a full time med student in another state.

My older daughter (let's call her Sarah) recently fell on some hard times. Due to health problems and covid, she lost her job and is burning through her savings. Honestly, I was hurt I wasn't even told about her health problems which date back to college. Apparently she had a heart attack and liver problems and they got worse the past year. She asked if she could move back in with me for a year or so, since I live close to her hospital, and she would save on rent while she looked for a job and an apartment. I agreed, as she is my daughter and I care about her, and I want her to know that.

However, less than an hour of her coming to stay with me, we got into a screaming match. All I did was express how sad I was that she no longer went to church and cared about God, and somehow that made her go crazy. She asked for some space, and whenever I tried talking to her (a couple times a day), we would get into arguments. Eventually, I was feeling so stressed, I decided to tell her it's probably best for her to move out, but I would be happy to support her emotionally. She then screamed at me about how I never did anything for her growing up, but always favored her sister. Which wasn't true. Her sister was just better behaved than her. Sarah moved out, and I tried asking her to get lunch with me a few times and come over for Christmas, but she just ignores me.

First let me put you on context I‚Äôm dating a girl since 3 months ago but we are taking this serious so we know each other family and we know each other very well 

When we first met we talked a lot and we talked about sexuality too when she told me that she never had any sexual contact and I was ok with it, Until a couple of days ago while we where at her house and we where just talking and chilling when she decides to tell me the truth ‚Äúsexuality‚Äù when she told me. That in the past (a couple of months before we start dating)she had a dark moment in her life and that she used to hang out with a lot of boys and had  sexual contact (she didn‚Äôt specifically said what)

To be honest in that moment I felt like my world was falling, not because of what she did but because I was pretty honest with here since the beginning about sexuality and I felt cheated and a lot of anger Because that‚Äôs the kind of thing that  she could tell since the begging so I told her that it hurt me that she waited this long just to say this maybe I didn‚Äôt communicated the best way because I was pretty mad at that point when she began yell at me that she is sorry and so.

Well my next step was to get out of the house because I didn‚Äôt felt like being next to her anymore and she made a scene just because she didn‚Äôt wanted me to live even crying and hugging me.

So I finally left that place and we didn‚Äôt talked anymore since 2 or three days ago

"AITA because I didn't accept responsibility for ""distracting"" the driver? We were leaving a restaurant. Husband was driving. I was in the backseat next to toddler. We were not moving yet. I ask him for the phone. He doesn't answer - guess he didn't hear me. So I ask again and we start moving, while he's apparently looking for the phone to give to me. He backs into a parked car. He exclaims ""YOU WERE DISTRACTING ME!"" And I respond, ""Don't even!"" (as in, ""don't even blame me for this happening!"")

So, is it my fault that he backed into the car? I looked up what legally counts as ""being distracting to a driver"" and I wasn't doing any of those things - we weren't arguing, I wasn't touching him, I wasn't trying to show him something or make him look at me. All I did was ask a question. 

He says him backing into the car is 50% my fault and believes ITA because I got defensive about being at fault, because I didn't immediately apologize for distracting him (even though right after it happened I was freaking out that he backed into a car) and that I didn't comfort him and make him feel better. That I'm a ""bad wife"" because I didn't do these things and didn't respond to the situation ""in an appropriate way.""

Also, I did apolgize for distracting him less than 5 min later (to make him feel better) but apparently me saying ""Don't even!"" right after it happened means my later apology doesn't count - and I didn't ""say enough"" when I said, ""I'm sorry I distracted you.""

I think he ITA because he isn't accepting his full responsibility, is blaming me for his own actions and is mad at me for being defensive and not ""responding appropriately.""

There's no room for another car anywhere. the street that can fit 4 maybe 5 cars now only has 2 cars on it. my sister and/or I don't have anywhere to park, so we have to go to the neighborhood over to park.

A while ago my dad put the trashcans in front of our house as per usual, and when I was coming home from work, I got stuck behind the trash picker-upper guy and he passed our house. I noticed that the trash can was up on the curb and K was parked where the trashcans were supposed to be. They're usually on the street, and once it emptied, dad takes it to the house. The trash was full, K moved our trashcans to park in front of our house. I ran the trashcan to another block to see if the trash guy would still take it. another neighbor (B) saw me doing this and helped. B helped me bring them back told my dad what happened. dad went over to Ks and told her never to touch the trashcans again and to stop parking in front of our house, he explained why (cameras, my daughters can‚Äôt park, etc.).

It is now December and it has not stopped. my dad called M and asked him to talk to K, we heard M yelling at K, but it still hasn't changed anything. a few days ago, she parked the Camry in front of our house and took the Sentra out.  when I got home, I decided to park in front of her, blocking my parents‚Äô driveway and leaving NO room for her to get out from the front. My sister got home and I had her park behind K's Camry and left her no room behind either.

the next morning, I was getting ready with the window open and K asked me to move one of the cars so she can leave and that she was running late. I told her that I was taking a shower and she'd have to wait, it‚Äôs not my fault she's running late, and if this was such a problem, she should stop taking up so much space with 2 little cars. She struggled for 20 minutes but did end up getting out. Since then, I've been doing this daily and my family and other neighbors like B help by telling me how close to get.

I told a friend about this, she said I'm being an AH for making her late. K has been asked many times to park normally. We put good money into our cars, my family wants the cars to be on camera. AITA?",0.24

"AITA for cancelling plans with my two best friends because they are discussing my private life without my knowledge? Ok so the title doesn‚Äôt really do justice to the issue but it‚Äôs hard to sum it up so stick with me. I am F18 and so are my two best friends. The three of us have been thick as thrives for years now and I trust them with my life however there are certain things i‚Äôm not comfortable discussing with one of them. Because it is pertinent to the story, I will mention that I am gay. When I moved away to university, it was awesome. All of a sudden I was free to explore my sexuality and learn about myself and it was great. Without going into too many details, for me, part of this exploration happened to involve me ‚Äúexperimenting‚Äù (if you catch my drift) with a girl I had met. We are not in a relationship but it was a good experience for me. I told friend A about this because I knew she wouldn‚Äôt judge me but friend B tends to be quite judgemental and I knew she would judge me for not being in a relationship with this girl and would never let me hear the end of it. When I told friend A, I made it very clear that I did not want friend B to know. Well, flash forward to today, when I was supposed to hang out with the two of them, friend B started messaging me pressuring me to ‚Äúadmit my adventures‚Äù. I asked friend A and she admitted that she has been telling friend B all of the things I asked her not to. At first I wasn‚Äôt terribly angry, more just upset, but when I told them I was upset with them, they told me that I was completely overreacting and that it wasn‚Äôt a big deal at all. I decided that I needed to take some space away from them, partially to figure out if I was just reacting in pure emotions and not with logic, so I told them that I didn‚Äôt want to hang out with them tonight. Both of them are now continuously calling me and texting me to tell me how big of an asshole I‚Äôm being for cancelling last minute on our game night and now i‚Äôm not too sure if I‚Äôm in the right here. Before anyone makes a comment about this just being petty teenage drama, I am aware that it is not the biggest issue in the world however I‚Äôm really anxious over this because so don‚Äôt want to lose my two best friends over a stupid fight where i‚Äôm in the wrong. So am I the AH and if I am any advice on how to fix it?

Edit: the situation has now escalated. They have now stopped to level of telling me that everything that happened with my abuser is my fault. Not sure if I‚Äôm going to ever be able to look at them the same again. They know how difficult of a topic it is for me and how hard i‚Äôve worked to realize it was not my fault.",0.07
"AITA for getting angry at my spouse for trying to seek unsolicited mental health resources for me after opening up to her? Preface: I (35m) have struggled with various bouts of depression and anxiety pretty much my entire life and am very introverted. As a result I have become very good at bottling up emotions and feelings unconsciously and building walls so that to outsiders I appear normal and happy. I know this isn't healthy and I've been to therapy before but a few bad experiences with therapists and counselors have left me extremely distrusting of them. I also hate the thought of people worrying about me, so not even my closest friends or family are aware of my struggles.

My wife has always kind of known that I struggle with stress and anxiety and depression, especially in recent years with my job and having two kids under the age of 5. Recently we had a deep discussion and I let down my walls a little bit, and told her the truth about my mental struggles and how I sometimes have intrusive thoughts and and how while I experience fleeting moments of happiness all the time they don't seem to damper the depression as much as they used to. Sharing this made me extremely anxious, and I told her that the reason I don't talk more about them more is because of my trust issues with outsiders, especially strangers. She seemed understanding.

Fast forward a couple days later and she asks if we can talk. I agree but right away I feel dread. She brings up a document on the computer and starts reading this clearly rehearsed speech that hits all the hallmarks of typical counselor language. I listen patiently but I am very upset. After finally opening up and explaining my mental state and my trust issues with outsiders, in only a matter of less than 48 hours she had already told someone else, a professional clearly, who had given her talking points. She hadn't asked me if I was OK with it or if I wanted it. I felt so betrayed.

I listened until she finished, then told her that I was not going to engage with this conversation because I felt my trust had been betrayed. She kept pushing, telling me how worried she was and how she had done nothing wrong. She wanted me to answer some probing questions. I told her I would if she could swear she wouldn't be discussing them with anyone else. She remained silent, which was all the answer I needed.

I know her heart is in a good place but I just feel like the trust I had is shattered, and the walls are now back up even stronger than before. I know she means well but I didn't ask for her help, just her support and empathy. Am I the asshole for feeling so upset about this?

EDIT: For anyone who says maybe I am wrong about her talking to someone else, I did later confirm that she did in fact talk to a counselor and a member of her women's group for suggestions.",0.5
"AITA for selling my exs things? My ex (25F) used to live with me (26M). We broke up about a year ago (she started seeing someone at her work and I didn't want to stick around for that) and she left a lot of her things at my place - dressers, purses, things from Target she's never opened. I think the only things she took were some of her clothes. There's no bad blood between us now, but the week we broke up, I asked her to come grab her things. She said she'll come grab it the following weekend, but never came, so I figured maybe she's busy. 

A month goes by and I ask her again on a weekend to come grab her things and she says she's feeling a little lazy and to just keep it here. I offered to pack her stuff up and bring it to her, but she said no.

Fast forward two months and I ask her, again, to come grab her things as I'm getting ready to sell my home and would like her things out so I know what to touch-up on or repair. At this point, I think I've asked her 5-6 times to come grab her things over the course of 4-5 months. Still, no sign of her. So I decide to start selling some of her things online. Mind you, I'm getting ready to sell my home and have no space for her things. I made a few hundred bucks. I gave away some of her things to my younger sister. I donated some of her clothes that she left. 

I feel kind of guilty though. Her things weren't mine to sell or give away, but again, I asked her multiple times to come grab all of her things. Am I an asshole for that?

Edit: she still hasn't asked about her things after almost a year. Safe to assume that I can sell the rest of her things?",0.09
AITA for telling my friend his house is dirty? [deleted],0.5
"AITA for ruining my sister‚Äôs family outing? My (M27) father had to spend Christmas alone, for various reasons that really couldn‚Äôt be helped. He doesn‚Äôt care the slightest but my sister S (F45, two kids) and I felt very guilty. S suggested we had a little family dinner at her place on the 30th, to make up for it. But on the 29th, she told me that she and her husband R wouldn‚Äôt be able to host dinner after all because they were already having a very busy week (what she actually meant, as I learnt later, was that R didn‚Äôt want to host dinner twice in a row as they were having friends over the next day for NYE), and that they were just going to go spend the day in the mountains hiking. She would bring our father along to make up for dinner and Christmas (he loves going to the mountains). I asked if I could come with, but the car doesn‚Äôt sit six people. She was apologetic but insisted she‚Äòd already had a hard time convincing R to go along with it and that re-opening the negotiations to try and add me to the plans would be very hard and painful for her. (R almost never wants to go anywhere and she always has to dedicate a lot of time and energy getting him on board.)

I felt very sad to be excluded from the new plans and I couldn‚Äôt help but cry about it. (S wasn‚Äôt with me, all our conversations happened through phone or text.) I discussed it with my dad (and this is where I might be the asshole: I should have called S back, but I was crying and I knew if I called her she would start crying too and feel terrible, and I was hoping dad would tell me what to do), who agreed the situation wasn‚Äôt right and offered to ask them if he and I could drive their second car (we were both ready to pay for fuel).

S started crying and yelling at my dad that I never think about her and how hard she has it and that she thought I would understand, that dad and I ought to know the second car ‚Äúisn‚Äôt the kind of car that can go to the mountains‚Äù (dad has driven it and has no idea what she means by that) and that we knew making that suggestion would create more problems with R. I tried to explain that she shouldn‚Äôt have changed our plans to new ones that excluded me without talking about it with me first but she kept coming back to the logistics. Knowing that I had cried about it ruined the whole thing for her and she said she wouldn‚Äôt be able to enjoy the day out with her family now when it was something she‚Äôs been needing lately to get a breather from her house currently filled with tension between her and R.

Dad no longer wants to go, and I can‚Äôt help thinking that if I had kept my mouth shut he and S would be able to enjoy a nice walk out tomorrow. All I wanted was to join them on the family outing, but it all feels selfish now. Should I have not said anything?

TLDR; my sister cancelled our dinner plans with our dad and replaced them with a hike in the mountains to which I‚Äôm not invited for logistic reasons, I cried, now our dad won‚Äôt go and my sister says the plan is ruined for her anyway. AITA?  


EDIT: the crying seems to have thrown several of you but I don‚Äôt really know what to say, I felt really sad that S had made new plans that excluded me and just started crying because I felt alone and unimportant. I had been planning to spend most of the 30th with my dad until we went to dinner together and suddenly I had to spend it alone while the rest of the family was to go have a fun time together without me. I don‚Äôt know guys, people have different sensibilities and family dynamics, and like, it‚Äôs okay to cry when you feel sad.

I admit that I should have called S back rather than our dad but I didn‚Äôt call him to cry about it but to try and find a solution (he‚Äôs more reasonable than S, who really didn‚Äôt want to have to bug R about changing the plans, but my dad is better than me at convincing her). I actually ended up wondering why he had agreed to go without me, knowing that I was supposed to be with him that morning. (Turned out he had mentioned it to S before agreeing and that she said she would talk to me about it but she just. Told me that was what they were doing.) Anyway, the fact that I had been crying was not the reason why he decided not to go, it was the way S reacted. But then again, it wouldn‚Äôt have happened if I hadn‚Äôt called anybody. So I might still be the asshole.",0.84
AITA for exposing my sister [deleted],0.84
"AITA for not wanting to pick up my girlfriend from the train station. My girlfriend lives in the Netherlands, she is getting the train from the Netherlands to London. She wants me to pick her up from the train station in London at around 5pm. I live roughly 1.5 hours drive away, in rush hour traffic. And I finish work at 5pm anyway.

I suggested she get the train from London, to the train station nearer my house. Which would take her roughly 30 minutes to do. She said she doesn't want to get the train, with all her luggage, and be travelling alone.

I've told her there is no difference between getting the train from the Netherlands to London, and London to my house. But she refuses to want to do it. It's 3 hours of driving for me, vs 30 minutes extra of train travel for her.

She thinks I don't care about her feelings, and she is mad that I'm willing to let her travel alone. But she is already doing that, I don't see the problem in the extra 30 minutes of train travel.

She is currently mad at me, And I don't know if I'm being a bad person.

AITA?

INFO - No, I don't think it's a cost issue. She is debating getting an uber instead, which I said is gonna cost her like ¬£100, and that she should just get the train instead. She says its because she isn't comfortable getting the public transport. What I don't Understand is, how is the euro star not public transport? what is the difference between her getting that train, and her getting the other train? Am I being stupid?

INFO 2 - No, The train to come closer to me, will barely be different than the euro star. There will be places for her to sit, it won't be overcrowded, there will be plenty of carriages.

INFO 3 - The train to me, will be no changes, if she gets the correct train, there will be no stops either. She will not have to get off the train until she arrives at the station near mine.

&#x200B;

UPDATE - I'm just gonna accept the fact I'm probably being an asshole. I told her I am gonna try get off work early and come get her.

It baffles me that she doesn't see my side though. It is literally 30 minutes of effort for her, vs 3 hours of driving for me. Can't win them all I guess. 

Thanks for the info people; Feel free to keep letting me know if I'm the A-hole or not. Would be interesting to see the result once more people have seen it :)

"AITA for bringing up my cousin‚Äôs living and job situation? At Christmas, I got overwhelmed from spending too much time with my family, so I left before everyone else. 
The week has been bad for me because I have autism, and I have been working from home since 2020. I find I get overwhelmed more by lots of people. 

Today in a restaurant, I spilled a glass of water and broke the glass on the floor because I felt anxious.  My cousin started laughing at me and called me a loser. He‚Äôs surprised that I can manage on my own.  This particular cousin has been a dick to everyone. 

He keeps egging me on and tells his autistic kid, sees this is why you have to do social activities, so you don‚Äôt end up like me.

"AITA for getting angry at my husband for deleting old recordings of myself? When I was young, I had many opinions. Things used to be either black or white to me, and I had the habit of recording myself giving speeches or performing as if I was someone who mattered. These videos were never shared in any platform, all private and it was one of my hobby.


The content of my recordings could vary from cringe-worthy 1 person comedies to speeches of philosophy and moral values(1 sided opinion mostly). When I got older and lost that hobby, I kind of just forgot about it.


I got the recordings back from my parents some time ago in a portable hard disk, they said they found it among my old things and think that I should take it. I went ahead and shared the contents with my husband, thinking that some of them may make him laugh. I was wrong and he got offended by some of my recordings, saying they were disrespectful, ignorant etc. I stopped sharing and kept the hard disk.


A few days later my husband came to me and told me that he had deleted some of the recordings he found offensive, for example, one that I talked about how people who abort are monsters, and another one which I painted myself black head to toe and do funny dance.


I screamed at him for touching my belongings without permission. Whether or not those videos were offensive or disrespectful, they were part of my childhood and I was like what, 10 years old or something? I learnt more as I got older and the me in the past does NOT define me now. I never shared them to anyone except him, but since he doesn't like them I can just keep them to myself.The recordings were my precious memories, good or bad or cringe worthy, and he had the nerve to judge and delete them.


My husband's reasoning is that such things should not exist, as there is always a chance that others will see them and ruin my image, that he is trying to protect me from such possible outcomes. He also said that our future kid may even come across them by accident.


He seem to make sense, but I am still angry. Am I asshole for getting angry?


Edit: To those saying I was proud of those videos, I have to point out that I don't remember most of the things I've recorded as they happened many years ago. It was only while watching them that I went like ""Oh, that happened? Yeah, that happened.""


As for why I don't want them deleted, it is because they are my precious memories. Even if I delete some it doesn't change the fact that I did shitty things. Those videos are all me, the past me, in which I hopefully have grown out of and become a better person. I don't want to forget them.


And yes, I am not remorseful. I find it in a bad taste for sure and would not do it or speak so harshly if I had known better. However, this was history. I had some fun, nobody was hurt, nobody knows(except for you all right now, but it was private and this account is throwaway). As long as I treat everyone with respect, I don't think I am a bad person, maybe a brat in past but I have nothing to feel bad about now.",0.85

"AITA for not going to the zoo with my husband on our anniversary? Throwaway and repost for going over character 

BIL came up to visit for the holidays with his kids who are all very close in age to my kids. Initially I was planning on us all going to the zoo so the kids could all meet Santa and see Christmas lights but the weather has been bad so it kept getting put off. They can no longer meet Santa but they can still see the lights and animals so we were going to go at the beginning of the week but it got pushed off because of rain and cold to the next warmest day before they leave which happened to be today, me and my husband's anniversary. The past few days I've been dealing with my bil's youngest kids attitude and last night was one of the tipping points. I had been telling the kids for hrs they needed to settle down and go to bed (it was 1 o'clock in the fucking morning and they're all under 10) so I had bil go up and tell them. Well it didn't last but maybe 10mins. I gave it 10 more and was fully fed up at this point so I went and told them if you guys don't knock it off and go to bed right now we're not going to the zoo tomorrow. I go to the bathroom come back out and I still hear them fucking around so I was waiting by their door for a moment so I can tell them to knock it off, again. Well while I'm standing there I hear my oldest shushing them saying ""you guys be quiet! dont you wanna go to the zoo?"" Then I hear his youngest ""I. Don't. Caaaare."" I was fucking pissed I swung that door open so gd fast and yelled for them to knock it tf off, tell my husband who tells his brother so he goes up there again. Well that was it for that night. Then today they're all in the kitchen helping cook and his youngest is wanting to pour the noodles in. I said thats fine wait for the water to boil. Idk if she got mad because my oldest was still holding the box or what but she got an attitude. So my oldest asked her whats wrong, bil youngest said nothing, she said I can tell by your face you're upset, bil youngest snapped and said something like you don't always have to be smiling you know! I told her im tired of her being so rude there's no reason to respond to someone like that and she starts bawling. So bil takes her in other room so she can tell him what happened and hes passive aggressively repeating it like its ridiculous. I tried to explain to my husband hoping he'd throw some logic out there on my behalf that snapping at someone who's only concerned about your feelings is rude as fuck. Anyway I was pretty done at this point, im sick of expecting a modicum of respect in my own home and getting flack for it so I told them im not going to the zoo.

I felt awful after he said that but this was never something planned for our anniversary and honestly I really just didn't want to go after all of that. Am I an asshole for not going?",0.02
"AITA for asking for a refund? This happened over a month ago. I was getting my haircut at this local barbershop in which I've been getting my haircut from for over 10 years now. The person who cuts my hair knows me and my family. We know each other, and I like to think we're fairly close. Well, I was getting my haircut, he just started trimming, and we get to talking like usual. He tells me that a person in our neighborhood, our social circle, got an abortion. Now, the person who got an abortion, was previously pregnant in high school and had the kid. So, I slightly chuckle and say something like ""Finally, if only she did that in school, huh?"" and he looks at me in disappointment, like he was offended, and said ""Alright, you haircut is done."" Now, it took like 12 minutes. It usually takes 20 minutes to cut my hair. And I look myself in the mirror and noticed that barely anything was cut. So I ask him about this and he assures me ""Oh no, it's fine, that's what it usually is."" I just shut up and give him money even though I wasn't satisfied with my haircut. Later, I was thinking to me self how ridiculous that I gave him a fully $20 worth of a haircut, even though he barely did anything with my hair. I have in my contacts, so I message him asking if it's possible I could get a refund or if I can get some of my money back. I waited for a week, and got no response. Still haven't got a response. I can't even file an appointment because whenever I call, he doesn't pick up. So, the next day, I walk in his shop. And start talking to him as he is doing someone elses hair on why he hasn't been answering me. He tells me it's been incredibly busy. I laugh and act like it's okay, but if he is not going to cut my hair anymore, I only think it's fair I get some financial compensation for a haircut he didn't even finish weeks prior. I mention this and he starts getting and tells me to get out and never come back. So, I walk home in defeat.

"AITA for asking the receptionist to mute the television in the waiting area? TLDR: I asked the receptionist to mute the tv, and an old guy next to me got upset and implied that I was selfish.

I was at a doctor‚Äôs appointment recently and had to fill out a TON of paperwork in the waiting area. The waiting area had 3 or 4 people in it. There was a TV right next to my seat that was on pretty high volume, playing some home renovation show, and playing commercials at high volume.

I asked the receptionist if it was important to have the TV volume on, and what her feelings were on muting it. She said something like ‚Äúwell we usually leave it on to entertain everyone else, but I can mute it if you want me to.‚Äù And I said ‚Äúif that‚Äôs okay, that‚Äôd be really great!‚Äù

She muted it, and an old guy next to me said ‚ÄúDid you just ask her to mute that? Is that what happened?‚Äù When I said yes, he shook his head like he just couldn‚Äôt believe his ears, and said ‚ÄúI just can‚Äôt understand people who do that. What if I asked her to close the blinds because I don‚Äôt like the light?‚Äù When I said it wasn‚Äôt a big deal and we could turn the sound back on, he said something like ‚ÄúNo no, it‚Äôs fine, I just can‚Äôt understand people who want to change everything without thinking of anyone else.‚Äù

This is a bit of a tangent, but as someone who doesn‚Äôt watch cable tv, commercials are unbelievably invasive and annoying. I just genuinely don‚Äôt understand how anyone can stand listening to them. It‚Äôs like having someone burst through the door and shout into your ears about soap for 10 minutes, every 5 minutes.

Here‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm the asshole: the guy‚Äôs point was that I wasn‚Äôt taking other peoples feelings into consideration when I asked for the volume to be turned off. But here‚Äôs the thing: who asked me about my feelings before turning it on in the first place? Why is it considered the default for the room to be filled with noise? It used to be the default for indoor places to allow smoking, but then we banded together and realized that you should be able to choose whether or not you want to be exposed to smoke. Why doesn‚Äôt the same principle apply to noise?

Also, no one was even paying attention to the TV. Everybody has smart phones, and everyone was staring at them, even Mr. grumpy britches who told me off.

So, internet, am I the asshole? What‚Äôs wrong in my thinking?",0.18
"AITA for suggesting to my dad to get divorced? I'm really frustrated with the current situation with my parents and need to know if IATA?

I (31f) had a very close relationship with my dad (60m). We have similar humour, interests and way of thinking. I've never been very close with my mum (66f) due to her openly favouring my younger brother, telling me that she loved the family dog more than me, comparing me to her when she was my age, my weight/physical appearance and how I haven't had any children yet, amongst other things.

Just shy of a year ago, my dad told me that he'd had a fling, not slept with, a family friend and my mum caught him. She refused to talk about it and both of them made me promise not to tell my brother. I am very close with my brother and hated not being able to tell him.

I thought that was the worst of it until my dad told me one day that he was still talking to this woman and even told me he had slept with her, unbeknownst to my mum. I really didn't want know. He even said that the family friend was very similar to me in personality and was happier with her, which made me feel very uncomfortable. He asked for my 'approval' of her if things broke apart with him and mum. I said as his daughter I would want him to be happy but he would need to accept that I would be there for mum as well. He understood and at that point, I believed he would leave mum for this other woman.

Meanwhile, my mum would constantly say things about him and his 'mistress', mentioning how all men seem to let her down etc. I asked her if she was happy with her marriage or not and she replied that it was he who is not happy and he needs to deal with it. She is not willing to talk about it and she gives me the impression of wanting to continue to punish him. My dad has told me how unhappy he is and I mentioned that he is drinking more and more.

I should probably mention that I have an anxiety disorder and stress about the smallest of things, so this has been hard to deal with mentally, on my own, as I can't tell my brother anything and I don't want to discuss this with my dad any more. He says a lot of sexual stuff about women that makes me uncomfortable and would just wish he would stop. This brings me to the 'AITA' bit.

A couple of nights ago, he started complaining about how he and my mum don't really spend time together and how they aren't intimate any more and wants me to be the mediator of the relationship and I just bluntly told him to divorce her. He went quiet for a bit and we haven't really spoken much since and I feel like I hurt his feelings about it but my thinking is, if he isn't happy any more and my mum doesn't want to address it, divorcing seems to be the most logical thing to do.

I feel bad as my dad doesn't really have anyone else to talk to about it but, but I'm angry that I can't tell my brother and I don't think my dad should be talking about this with me. I feel I have this massive burden of not telling my brother anything and not telling my mum about the affair. AITA?",0.02
"AITA for ruining mine and my (former) best friends relationship? I‚Äôm writing on mobile so if the formats a tad janky for you, jus get a phone lmao, I‚Äôm also not sober aha, it‚Äôs 00:39 Nyd. Me (M 19) and my best friend (F 18) were just chatting normally. I mentioned somn minor that had happened where my sister (21) had body shamed my dad over his weight which he has been horribly self conscious over lately and although he didn‚Äôt show it, I could tell it hurt him. My sister has Down syndrome so she definitely didn‚Äôt intend to harm him, but also struggled to comprehend how what she did was wrong.

Anyways, I mentioned this scenario to my best friend because ya know, conversation. She initially agreed that I was right to shut my sisters comments down immediately and get her to apologise. But then started saying she shouldn‚Äôt be making comments when she‚Äôs ‚Äúthe size that she is‚Äù and then proceeded to indirectly call my sister fat (also somn my sister is self conscious of).

This started to annoy me because in my mind you can‚Äôt agree that targeting someone‚Äôs insecurities is wrong then immediately do the exact same thing yourself. I clarified to her what she was doing basically confirming I was interpreting it right and giving her the opportunity to apologise. Instead she chose to double down saying shes allowed to make comments such as that since she has a belly herself (shes very slim).

At this point I told her she can go fuck herself because like kind people don‚Äôt target anyone‚Äôs, let alone peoples with down syndromes, insecurities. It‚Äôs been like 3 days and we haven‚Äôt spoken at all. I‚Äôve sent a few messages but she‚Äôs aired them all, I haven‚Äôt attempted to apologise because at this point in time I don‚Äôt feel as tho I acted out of line.

"AITA for telling someone they should shower? I (17m at the time) had a close friend (17m) ,we would talk a lot especially during school. After a while I noticed he‚Äôs been wearing the same clothes for a while, and that he had a ‚Äústench‚Äù.

I didn‚Äôt want to sound rude or anything, since not everyone is able to wear clean/different clothes everyday. After a while I had to just point it out, he looked pretty mad already. He replied to me saying that he didn‚Äôt have to shower, nor did he want too. I‚Äôll rephrase that, he was able to shower, but didn‚Äôt care to do so.

I asked him why and he was already super bothered. He replied in an angrier tone and said that no one can force him to.

"AITA for telling my brother how I‚Äôd like the recipe done Obligatory throwaway for obvious reasons and I‚Äôm on mobile so sorry for formatting. 

I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm posting this cus it‚Äôs so ridiculous but here goes. I (22m) recently learned how to make loaded potatoes and my family seemed to like them. The recipe is fairly straight forward but I spent a lot of time researching the best recipe, techniques, etc so I could get it right the first time. I guess it came out good because I was requested to make them again for my family‚Äôs New Years Eve meal and I agreed. 

Now here‚Äôs the conflict. My twin brother (22m) asked if he could help cus he wanted to learn the recipe too and I said sure. So we are in the middle of doing the recipe and it comes to the part where we have to cut the potatoes open. I showed him the technique I learned from the multiple videos and recipes I researched and ask he follow my example. Instead he wanted to try it his way and I reminded him while working on ‚Äúmy‚Äù recipe to do it the way I was told by the recipes to do it. Immediately he started blowing up yelling ‚Äústop trying to control me‚Äù and ‚Äúlet me do it my way‚Äù. All I wanted for the recipe (while it was put under my responsibility to make) to be done the way I learned it. Especially since he said he wanted to learn the recipe himself.

Here‚Äôs where I might be the AH, I said ‚Äúif you aren‚Äôt going to do it the right way then I can do the recipe by myself‚Äù. He went upstairs and refuses to speak with anyone or eat until I apologize. Everyone is now mad at each other now.

"AITA for no longer talking to my best friend‚Äôs ex even though we used to be friends? this is a complicated story but senior year of high school i had a very close knit friend group. my best friend and her now ex were a part of it and obviously started dating but broke up right before we all graduated. before she broke up, she came to me crying about how she was miserable in the relationship and how she felt he was condescending and dismissive of her, and never actually got to know her. she wanted to break up with him and i supported her. 

of course this posed an issue: drama in the friend group. my best friend is someone i have always supported and always want to support and he broke her heart, so automatically i kind of just picked her side. the break up blew the friend group apart, and most people ended up siding with my best friend. we still tried to talk to her ex, but every time he was around her she would begin to have a really bad panic attack and it was a mess so inevitably the friend group split up. 

now we all left for college, and i am going to college with my best friend who is also my roommate. i never reached out to her ex and i took him off of my private stories. i never personally had bad blood with him, but he broke my best friends heart and i wanted to protect her privacy as i was now spending a lot of time with her. 

some of our other friends tried and pretty successfully have kept in contact with both of them separately, and she has said that was fine to their face but then complained behind their back that it felt hurtful to her. 

now we‚Äôre back home for winter break, and one of my friends confronted me yesterday about not supporting him and cutting him off without giving him a chance and how that made me a shitty friend. she said that he didn‚Äôt understand what he did wrong, and that i was the only person she confided in. she said that everything she found out about my best friend‚Äôs feelings was through me, and she didn‚Äôt tell her ex anything. my best friend claims that she told everyone how she feels and she‚Äôs upset that they‚Äôre all still friends with him.

 he‚Äôs upset that everyone cut him off without giving him a chance. she‚Äôs pushing me to reach out to him.  but i kind of want to leave everything behind and start fresh.

My bf used to be in school while running a small business, and that small business covered his expenses. But due to covid, his business gradually died and I ended up having to cover his part of the rent and some other expenses. He paid me back some of them when he had income but borrowed more when he did not. His debt to me is now around 7.5k.

For context, we had our first child a year ago and I had been dealing with Postpartum depression and anxiety. 

Originally, we had agreed to both be stay at home parents (we live off of his disability comp) when we decided to have a child. Things became harder to unexpected expenses & a pandemic. One of us had to go back to work. 

My husband works graveyards 3 days a week, 12 hour shifts. And those days I usually have baby from 5pm to 2pm. Here is where issues began...

I asked my husband if he could wash at least the bottles so I had some for the night while he's at work. He never did them but instead played video games & had his ""me time."" For 3 weeks he hasn't touched the dishes or washed bottles. I do the laundry, sweep, mop, dust, shop for groceries, cook and pay the bills (& the dishes when he doesn't do them before work). I also run my small business.

At LEAST he could do the dishes, throw the trash, help hang laundry & pick up after the dogs & cats for me so I don't get overwhelmed. That's half of the chores, right? 

The night of our argument he told me he needs his me time & it would be nice to have a wife that didn't need his help to do the dishes - he wants to come home to a clean house & doesn't like when I nag him. He told me that I should stop my small business because he didn't like that I need time on his days off to complete orders from customers.

"WIBTA if I ask my neighbor to be more mindful of how loud her kids are  

Like many college students, I will be doing part, if not all, of my winter quarter online. My main problem with this setup is that my neighbors have extremely loud kids (3M&1F between 8-13 yo) that love to yell every time they are outside. The first lockdown was an absolute nightmare because it happened every day. It is impossible to move to a different room because I'm already in the furthest room possible, and I can still hear them when I'm wearing earphones. It makes it hard for me to listen and pay attention to my lectures.

During the summer months, the children were playing outside almost every day with the screams that seem to accompany them where ever they go. They also have gotten into the habit of tossing balls and other toys over the fence, running over to bang on my front door to get the toys that they tossed over. And then they mad when we can't find the stuff they threw over.

They also like to play baseball in their yard, and we have found multiple baseballs in our yard, and now my mom is a little hesitant to go outside because she is worried she might be injured by one of these balls when she is outside.

WIBTA if I asked my neighbor to be more mindful that people are either going to school or working from home and it's hard to do that successfully if we can hear the constant loud shrieks of children in the background. I'm also not sure how to approach them, I'm a nonconfrontational person, so I was planning on sending the mom a text, but I'm unsure how that would be perceived.

I'm not telling the neighbor to shut her kids up and not let them play outside, only to be more mindful of how loud they are.

I completely understand that kids need to run around and have fun, and they are on their property, so they are allowed to do whatever they want. However, it is important to remember that there are people in their houses that don't appreciate loud noises daily.

"AITA for telling my daughter she doesn't need to attend my son's wedding I (46F) am married to my husband (47M) and we share two children, a daughter ""Olivia"" (22F) and a son ""Liam"" (20M). My husband also has a son ""James"" (28M) from a previous relationship. James' mother is not in his life, and I have raised him ever since he was a baby. I love him dearly, and consider him as my eldest child. James has been engaged to his fiancee ""Emma"" (28F) for the past three years, and they are planning to get married in the next two weeks. Emma is a nice and wonderful girl, and I know she'd be a great addition to the family. Olivia doesn't like Emma, as she has always wanted her best friend to marry James. Olivia works as a clothing designer and owns a small boutique. She told Emma that she would only allow the wedding, if she could design her wedding gown. Emma, however, politely declined and said that she wanted to wear her late mother's wedding gown instead. Frustrated, Olivia came up to me and complained that she would not attend the wedding if Emma did not wear a gown designed by Olivia. I calmly explained to Olivia that it was not her wedding, but Emma's, and that only Emma had the right to choose her wedding gown. Olivia broke down in tears saying that she was not going to the wedding, to which I said was completely up to her.

It seems that she has complained to Liam about it, as he called me later asking me why I was siding with another woman's son's fiancee rather than my own daughter. I was shocked hearing this, because I don't know where Liam got that impression because I always consider James as my own son. I'm not sure if I'm the AH, because Liam says that Olivia's feelings are hurt and that I've forgot to prioritize my own daughter's feelings. AITA?

Edit: I spoke to Liam about his behavior, and he has apologized to me for his words. He said that Olivia ran to him crying, telling him to say ""why are you siding with another woman's son's fiancee rather than your own daughter"". Liam said he wasn't exactly comfortable saying it, but he said he wanted to stick up for his older sister. I'm not sure if Liam is telling the truth just yet, but it seems plausible enough.

Edit: I finally got a chance to sit down and talk with Olivia and asked her why she feels upset about James' wedding and why she made Liam say such things to me. She admitted to me that she made Liam say that to make me feel guilty. She said that after she realized her best friend could not marry her brother, she at least wanted the opportunity to design the bride's dress to promote her store. I told her that since it's Emma's wedding day, only she can choose her bridal gown, however, I told Olivia that she could possibly talk with Emma about wearing a dress she makes for their wedding reception or perhaps another event. I told her what she said about James was out of line, to which she apologized. After I promised Olivia to have a ""spa weekend"" following James' wedding, she agreed to attend the wedding. ",0.33

I (F, 35) told my spouse (M, 40) that if he wanted to help me clean the house he could vaccum two area rugs because they were covered in dog fur. He agreed and proceeded vaccum. When I saw the rugs afterwards, there was still noticeable dog fur on them. I debated telling him vs just vaccuming them again but figured I should tell him. I did start out by thanking him for vaccuming but said fyi there's still a bunch of dog fur. He laughed and basically called me ungrateful and demanded pictures of the dog hair on the rugs (he was watching TV & eating and didn't want to get up.) I was annoyed but sent him the pictures and he reluctantly said he'd vaccum again but he still thinks I'm an ungrateful bitch.

For reference, he's done this before with stuff like dishes. He'll wash pots etc but put them away with obvious food residue still on them and I stopped saying anything because he just tells me I'm ungrateful and to just wash dishes myself if I don't like the way he does it. So I just re-wash them and move on with life but today I was tired from cleaning and really didn't want to have to stop what I was doing (laundry) to vaccum the floors again.

My ex had our son (age 5) over the weekend and I met up with his girlfriend to pick up my son today and she explained they forgot to wash clothes and would return the outfit I sent my son to his dad‚Äôs in at a later date. When my son saw me, he wanted me to pick him up and hold him anyway but I didn‚Äôt realize until I put him in the car that he didn‚Äôt have shoes on. I asked him why, and he said his dad and dad‚Äôs girlfriend said they didn‚Äôt want his shoes to end up at my house. Keep in mind, they have an outfit of his and a pair of shoes that came from my house but are worried about their pair of shoes. It was 30 degrees and flurrying outside when this was happening. I brought it up to my son‚Äôs dad that that didn‚Äôt sit well with me and asked that it not happen again. He explained to me that our son was in the cold all of 5 minutes between cars and that I had no plans today so it didn‚Äôt matter. He also told me ‚Äúit doesn‚Äôt seem to be a big deal when you send him in clothes that are too small‚Äù but that isn‚Äôt the case and he didn‚Äôt know what kind of plans I had today. My ex is also the type that has never paid child support willingly and for the past 5 years I‚Äôve been working with the state to get child support from him and still to this day have no luck with that. I told him if he had a problem with what I dress our son in he could actually pay some child support and I would buy him all the clothes in the world. I also told him he had no idea what my plans were with my son but whatever makes him feel like less of a piece of shit. He laugh reacted at my text and that was that.

"AITA for taking my husbands side over our ex? I (22O) and my husband (would prefer to stay completely anon), added a third to our marriage Dec 4th 2020, they (25GNC) promised not to be like anyone else me or my husband have been with.

&#x200B;

A few days before we picked them up (drove from OH to NY), I informed their ex that we would be picking them up at X time and would like cooperation since we had been told their ex was super abusive and mean. Their ex, another married couple, one M, one F of unknown ages, told me that they would be lazy and that all they do is smoke weed and complain about doing chores. I defended them, only knowing what I'd been told by them.

&#x200B;

The first 4 month were great, it was like it was meant to be. We all clicked, I had a smoking partner, my husband had someone to game with him ass early in the morning, it worked out great. But then things started to go downhill rather rapidly. Now, we told them that we would spoil them when we could. That's how we are with people we truly care about, we get them what they need and want, assuming we can. Me and my husband get SSI (I am mentally disabled and he is both mentally and physically disabled), so we only had so much to work with after bills and getting things we need, paying for gas to go food shopping, restocking toiletries, getting food for the animals and litter, etc. After all of that we only had, maybe, $200 between the two of us, max. $100 went for flower, since I use medicinally and they claimed to as well, so that leaves $100 to use for whatever.

&#x200B;

They would pitch a fit if we couldn't get whatever it is that they wanted, if we financially weren't able to. The reason I say they claimed is because they absolutely \*were not\*. Whenever they weren't high, they were mean for literally 0 reason, if we ran out they would be mean for no reason, we would run out \*because of them\*, they had to be high to function. So when we couldn't restock mid month, when the $100 was supposed to last all month, they would throw a tantrum and ""vaguely suggest"" for us to sell our stuff for flower money and would threaten to (use your imagination), and when we didn't want to because we barely had them for a month, they would post it to marketplace without our knowledge or permission and wouldn't tell us anything about it until the buyer was already half way to our house.

&#x200B;

My husband has mental illnesses, and they would say mean/abusive things that would trigger my husband into anger or depression and then would get mad at him for having those emotions, and would add fire to the flame continuously until there was a argument and then turn it around and play victim. There are other horrid things they would do but I can't mention them, as per the rules. And when they broke it off with us, they told people that my husband was abusive and did other specific things that are physically impossible for him to do, as he is semi paralyzed from the waist down.

"WIBTA if I want someone out in 2 weeks My partner‚Äôs ex has a pretty shitty family, and overall wants to get out.

My partner wants to offer her some sense of shelter for a bit until she gets her own place. We live in an apartment, and as far as I know the max extended stay before we‚Äôd have to apply for her as a third roommate is two weeks. If we had a house it would be no questions asked yes.

She has a decent paying job, to the point where she can afford an apartment on her own (my partner and I don‚Äôt live paycheck to paycheck, but there‚Äôs not much wiggle room either). I‚Äôve seen the toll of people overstaying their welcome before, and especially with the risk of getting in trouble with the landlord, I basically only want her here as a place she can safely look at other apartments and apply. We can only offer our couch as we don‚Äôt have room for a third roommate.  

I feel like an AH because two weeks doesn‚Äôt feel like a lot of time, and I don‚Äôt want to kick her out just to have her back at an unsafe environment. However, if this stay goes on longer we could face eviction.

"AITA for calling my personal assistant a cleaner? We have someone, Susan, who cleans and cooks for us. When we hired her, she wanted the title of personal assistant. So that's what we hired her as. She's been with us for about 4 months now and there haven't been any issues until yesterday. I've already apologised but I'm still not sure if what I did was offensive or if she just overreacted.

So I work from home and I was in the office in a meeting when Susan came in with a vacuum and asked if she can clean the room. I said sure, and in the meeting said something like ""Stepping out for a second, moving to another room while my cleaner cleans this one"". Then I moved to another room to finish my meeting. Afterwards, Susan confronted me about referring to her as a cleaner to my coworkers when we hired her as a personal assistant. She seemed quite distraught so I quickly apologised and promised to not do it again.

I feel really bad but my coworkers would be so confused if I said personal assistant. I'll probably say something like ""while this room gets cleaned"" if this comes up again.

"AITA for making my girlfriend lose a friend? sorry if this doesnt make sense right away, im tired writing this but i need it clearing up

&#x200B;

for a bit of backstory about my girlfriend, she never had a good relationship, every boy who loved her, either well didnt love her, faked his love for her, lied to her, and lied about their age, she wasnt used to such a good boyfriend, then she met me.

and also she gave me her accounts to everything she could, because she wanted my full trust, i tried to decline at first, but she persuaded me to have them

well this happened in june last year me (16m at the time) and my girlfriend (17 at the time lets call her merry)  we were going strong four months in the relationship, my best friend (16m and lets call him zak) got with a girl who broke him terribly he had severe depression from it, she said some things even i have no idea about, it hurt him that badly he didnt want to say it.

then fast forward to the 13th of june, merry had an idea to cheer him up, it was to ""pretend date"", this only included messaging nothing physical, i was hesitant at first but as she has done it before no problems i let it happen, but looking back on it now it was probably my biggest mistake, as for why its my biggest mistake...

i woke up that day with a notification telling me that he called merry sexy, which i just agreed with, and i was also told of that ""pretend dating"" aswell right when i woke up.then at one point she said she liked him but i paid no attention to it until i got bored later on after a video call.

i went on her discord account, as she gave it me and requested i do weekly checks on her messages so i can see if she is messaging in a way i like, so i do that,  then when i went to her messages with my best friend, it was the ""pretend dating"" thing then i scrolled further, zak said he loved her in roleplay way, but merry thought he meant it for real and that they were gonna keep it a secret.

honestly my reaction wasnt the best, i said horrible things in the spur of moment madness, then she wanted a break so she can think about things, and get her mind straight. in the end she chose me, and only me and tried to forget her love for zak

now to present time, she recently started messaging my best friend again, and she told me she thinks she still loves him even after 6 months, and i even felt insecure, so i told zak and he offered to stop messaging her for a while so she can forget her feelings or hopefully so, but merry is upset, due to her losing her only true friend and shes been crying for the past 2 days

i feel like i am to blame for ruining their friendship

t.l.d.r:  i woke up to messages being told about merry pretend dating, i went on her msgs as a weekly routine and found her secret, we had a break, she chose me, fell inlove with zak  again, he stopped messaging her and merry is upset right now and i feel terrible

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

edit 1: for clarification, i dont check her messages now, i realized it was an invasion of privacy, so i only say i do to satisfy her, and the only reason i checked her messages in the first place was cos she was scared of cheating on me, as she cheated on her ex in the past",0.93
"AITA for asking my wife to get her friends to stop calling me a house husband?

I don't like the term 'housewife' either.

"AITA for writing an essay for school that I knew would be controversial and strongly against my parents' and teacher's beliefs? 


My English class had a project to write an essay with the point of persuading people to agree with an unpopular opinion.

My family is Christian, most of my community is, I was raised that way but am no longer faithful. But they still are, and say gossiping is sinful.

I thought it would be interesting to write an essay saying that gossip is good.

I came up with a bunch of arguments that I'll give you for context. 

1. Gossip acts as a warning and helps people protect themselves. For example I wouldn't date anyone who I heard was cruel to their exes.

2. Gossip can reveal other people's values and help determine social compatibility. For example if I met a person who gossiped nastily about LGBT people I would know to keep away. 

3. Gossip can be a bonding experience between friends, it is cathartic to vent about emotional events rather than stew in silence. 

4. ""Gossip"" is a gendered term, men's talk is rarely called gossip. Perhaps the reason that talk is seen as negative for women but neutral for men, is that women's voices are often undervalued and demeaned. Also, some people fear the impact of women sharing their experiences and thoughts freely. 

5. When conversations are called ""gossipy"", it can often be out of suppression rather than kindness. For example, when the church discourages negative talk about religious leaders, that is dangerous. 

6. Yes, some talk is hurtful. But it should be called bigoted, racist, or something specific. Not simply called gossip, because calling it gossip minimizes it. 

I turned it in a little nervous about how my English teacher would react because I felt like I picked a really unpopular opinion. She's always telling students not to gossip, so I was worried she might also take it personally. 

Today, my teacher told me that she and the guidance counselor wanted to discuss my essay in a meeting after school this week. I asked why and she said we'd talk in the meeting. I asked about my grade and she said she hadn't assigned a grade yet. 

My parents were also called, and when they found out i wrote an essay called ""In Defense of Gossip"" they were mad. I wanted to read them the essay but honestly they were so mad I didn't think they'd listen to 15 pages.

They said they didn't raise me this way and that I was encouraging bullying, and saying that I was being provocative on purpose.

I feel that's kinda unfair, my teacher told us to defend an unpopular or controversial opinion and now people are mad I followed the assignment earnestly? 

I guess I can see where my teacher is coming from a little, because it might feel like a personal attack since she hates gossip. And my parents too, it might feel like I never listened to the stuff they taught me about kindness. 

But I feel also like I was honest.

AITA for writing that essay? I had a feeling it would be controversial.",0.06
"WIBTA if I told my dad that him expecting me to do the dishes EVERY day is impossible? So right before winter break, we had midterms and my parents allowed me to come home after my exams (2 a day) with the condition that I did the dishes when I got home. I was fine with this, since obviously I'd rather do the dishes than have to stay at school after taking exams. However, this extended into winter break. Weird, but whatever. Now, last Friday (the 31st) my mom told me to not worry about doing the dishes because she would be doing them this weekend. I spent Saturday and most of Sunday at my grandparents house, and when I got home the first thing my dad told me was that I needed to wash the dishes that I had left sitting the entire weekend. I'm like, really confused and started texting my mom but she didn't respond. Either way, I couldn't do the dishes on Sunday when I got home since my history teacher decided to have an chunky assignment due today, the first day back. Obviously, that was my first priority over doing the dishes. I ended up staying up past midnight working on it (my fault- it's difficult for me to focus sometimes so tasks can sometimes take longer.) so once I finished I immediately went to bed.

Now today. I'm in my room, trying to take a quick like 30 minute nap (still tired from the night before) and my mom comes into my room and says that I either have to go wash the dishes RIGHT now or make dinner. I responded, ""well YOU said you were going to do the dishes this weekend in my place, so I'd much rather make dinner."" We go out to the kitchen and my dad IMMEDIATELY starts throwing a tantrum, asking why is it so hard for me to follow ""direct orders"" and why does my mom think her authority supersedes his. Annoyed, my mom and I just switched and I washed the dishes. As I did, my dad goes ""she KNOWS she's supposed to wash the dishes EVERY day, how is she supposed to last in the real world if she can't even follow basic orders?"" This ticked me off, since the only reason I stopped ""following orders"" was because my mom said she'd fill in. Personally, I think it's ridiculous that I'm the ONLY person ""allowed"" to do the dishes. If my mom or my grandma (she's 56 btw- only mentioning so that a frail woman with gray hair isn't pictured lol) even tries to wash a dish, my dad throws a shit fit demanding to know why I'm not washing them.

I'm a junior in high school. It's January, and I'm about to enter the most difficult part of the school year within the next few months. Frankly, I won't have the time to do the dishes during the week between doing hw and studying for my upcoming exams. WIBTA if I told my dad it's physically impossible for him to expect me to take on that kind of chore when I have much more pressing matters on my plate?

ETA because it's been brought up a lot: doing the dishes is not my only chore. I take care of our seven pets in every aspect (excluding medical things of course) and I also do laundry. I used to do laundry for the entire house, but when I started doing dishes my parents said that it was fine if I only washed my clothes.",0.78
"AITA for expecting my husband to equally split childcare? It seems so easy, obviously the answer is yes but he really thinks I'm being unreasonable and I need new eyes on this.

Hubs (early 30sM) and I (early 30s F) have been together for 12 years and have an 11month old girl. We split childcare mostly 50/50 in my opinion. My husband is really struggling with the changes still, which frustrates me and I'm losing sympathy because we planned our child, discussed it for years and he was totally on board once I got pregnant. I did a lot of research about kids and the impact it has (both actual books as well as parenting subreddits) while he did nearly none. Now he's constantly surprised by how hard it is. 


Anyway, I finally convinced Hubs to get on some parenting subreddits, I find it helpful and cathartic and I thought he might too. Well turns out all the posts there from stressed out women about their lazy useless husbands has made him think that he shouldn't have to do as much with the baby. He literally said that he ""could be so much worse"" and wants me to ""cut him some slack"". He's also stated that since he makes more than me that's his contribution to the family and I should be doing more childcare.  For context we both make 6 figures, his salary is ~20% higher than mine, I typically work 40-45 hours per week but 45 is rare. He  works more like 35-40 hours per week.

We've argued about both of these things a lot. I told him it doesn't matter how much money he makes because he doesn't make enough for me to be a STAHM so he needs to do his share. Also told him since he works fewer hours it's more fair for him to pick up the slack. And I said that if he wants to be a lazy husband he can expect to be divorced before 40 (we're in our early 30s).

Now we're at an impasse because I'm being ""more demanding than other wives"". None of our local friends have kids yet so he doesn't have any in-person examples to compare against. I'm also appalled at this from him as he's truly never displayed this kind of thinking before and both of his parents worked. Once in a while he's annoyed if I have to work a lot but it's always been about not wanting to share his time with me.

AITA? Is 50/50 too much to expect too soon in 2021? Should I be happy he's not out cheating and getting drunk all the time and just let it go?

Edit: adding in labor split since it's relevant. I feel we do about 50/50 of easily tracked tasks. Like we take turns with getting up in the morning with the baby, doing an overnight feed, taking the baby for lunch (baby stays home with a nanny, we wfh so we take the baby when the nanny takes lunch), and taking the baby after work when the nanny is done if the other person still has work to do. He's expressed he feels like it's more 60/40 with him doing the greater share. I think it's possible he's right, but I'm not sure that's unfair to him since he works less.

Edit 2: I think I worded this confusingly. My problem isn't with how much work he's currently putting in, I think he's pulling his weight with the baby and around the house and I'm not unhappy with it. The problem is that he thinks he should start being able to do less than 50% because ""most men"" do and because he makes a little more money.",0.33

"AITA? We took a Christmas present from our daughter Our oldest daughter (23) sent my youngest daughter (13) 250 feet of LED color changing lights with a remote control. 
Here's where the situation goes south. The whole string of lights has an extremely sticky backing, meaning the only way to hang them is to stick them directly to the walls or ceiling. We, as parents, immediately told our youngest that she isn't sticking any of that to our walls. They'll totally ruin the walls and ceiling. Then we told her that we'd go out and get a more appropriate lighting system in exchange for the one she got from her sister as a gift. My youngest texted my oldest and told her that she got her present, but we took it away from her. So my oldest got pissy and called my mom and told her that we took away the gift for no reason. That we had to right to take away something that didn't belong to us. Now my mom is involved and throwing a tantrum. My mom called and yelled at us and hung up on us before we could explain anything.
Later that night after my youngest went to bed, me and my husband sat down and talked about the lights. I thought that maybe we could cut them in half and work out something to put them on. My husband, who rarely says no to anything, vetoed that. Since he rarely ever said no, I had to ask why he wouldn't allow it. He said with all of the other borderline inappropriate crap my oldest has gotten our youngest, her bedroom is starting to look like a nightclub and he has to draw the line somewhere. I can see his point of view. My oldest has almost always sent my youngest inappropriate gifts and then gotten irate when we don't let her have them. She got my youngest several pairs of thong underwear for her 11th birthday. Last year she got her a fireman calendar where the men are missing the majority of their clothing. And there was the vape pen a few months ago. We're always made to feel like we're TA when we take away gifts from our daughter. My mom being involved isn't helping matters because she's the master at sending inappropriate gifts, mostly to my husband. Every time he sees a package addressed from her he goes into full panic mode and he's scared to open it.
Now we're over here questioning if we're bad parents for not allowing my youngest to have any of these gifts. And we've also told my youngest that any contact between her and her sister and her and my mom is prohibited until we can get all of this drama stopped.

"AITA for not contacting my sister about coming out as Trans? All names changed to superheroes because I like it this way. 

I (31M) just came out of the egg as Trans last week for part of my New Years resolution. Before this happened, I informed close friends, my brother Kent, (40sM) and most recently, (as of Dec 24) my mother Jane F. (60sF). I wanted to know if I had their support beforehand. 

My sister Diana (40sF) is upset that I didn't contact her specifically before I made it public. We haven't been in constant contact, speaking over text every few months or so, or only calling on birthdays. I am in contact w/ my nephews and nieces over my mom's phone so I can keep up with the kids. 

I didn't tell her because Diana has a history of telling people my secrets. I've overheard her talking about my kid secrets to Mom, or talking to her friends about things I didn't want known. Unfortunately, when I would talk to Diana about this, she would deny she did anything, saying that I wasn't allowed to have secrets because I was little. When I told Mom about being Trans, we both agreed that Diana couldn't keep this secret before I was ready to be public.

From what I understand, Diana doesn't know what to tell her kids about my transitioning, and thinks I'm deliberately hurting her for not telling her before I went public. She is insisting that since I didn't tell her privately, it's now my job to call her so I can answer all her questions. BIL Bruce will back her up on this, he's a ride or die guy. I can't fault him on it, but that means I can't reach out to him for help. 

Mom is dropping hints that I should just call Diana to tell her personally post-coming-out that I am coming out. I told Mom that we've had very little contact beforehand. I don't think I should have to be the one to call, especially when I know I'm going to be the one doing all the emotional labor while Diana tries to tell me I'm not who I say I am, or ""broken"" enough to be this way (We have a history of family abuse from Dad, Thanos).

"AITA for getting home late on my boyfriends birthday? Yesterday was my boyfriends [32 M] birthday. It was also my [28 F] first day off after working 7 days straight over the holidays. I work swings, so I normally get home around midnight, have dinner and pass out at 2am. The night before, when I got home BF asked me to rub his back to help him sleep. I stayed in bed rubbing his back until 1am, was too exhausted to eat and fell asleep on the sofa.

The next morning he woke me up around 8 wanting to run an errand together. I was up and out the door in under an hour with no coffee, and skipped my adhd meds. He was cranky all morning because I took too long getting ready. He left for work around noon and I fell asleep on the sofa again. 

Now, I worked a total of 106 hours over the last few weeks. Because of this he had told me to treat myself to a spa day, massage, mani pedi, etc. Even though it was his birthday. All he wanted to do for the day was hang out and eat burgers and cupcakes.. When I woke up at 4pm, I left for the nail salon but skipped the massage so I wouldn't miss time together. It took about two hours and I texted BF to let him know where I was. 

On my way home I picked up burgers and a cake because I hadn't had time to bake cupcakes. I also canceled my weekly dnd game so I could spend time with him. When I got home he was furious. He said he was hurt that he came home to an empty house, and he had to wash the dishes because I didn't do it before I left. He said that he set his expectations low so I wouldn't disappoint him, but I did anyway. He also said that my actions that day proved that I don't respect him. I tried to explain my perspective that I was exhausted and only did my nails because I know he likes when I look nice, and everything I did that day was for him. He isn't hearing it and hasn't spoken to me except to say he's disappointed and I clearly don't respect him.

I have no family in the area and my only friend group is from work. My friend threw a Friendsgiving and my bf and I went. The entire time my bf was on his phone and sitting away from everyone. I asked him three separate times to come join the group, pull up a chair, and join into the convo and his response was ‚ÄúI‚Äôm good‚Äù. A few of my friends even checked on him to make sure he was okay and one of them asked me if he and I were fighting. I wanted to leave early as the situation was uncomfortable for me. In the car on the way home I asked him what his problem was. He said it was on me, the inviter, to make him feel included. He also said he‚Äôs very introverted and is usually in the corner at most group gatherings. I told him I did try to include him and these people were the closest thing I had to family here and that their opinion meant a lot. I told him he was immature and could have at least faked it and tried to be present at the table and get involved in convo to which he said this is how he‚Äôs always been. Now my friends don‚Äôt want him to come when they have get together. AITA?",0.01
"WIBTA if I don't tell my landlady that my cat peed on her couch? I live in a finished basement that's almost it's own apartment, minus a full kitchen. My landlady lives on the upstairs level and we share the kitchen. If I'm cooking or doing dishes, I typically let my cat join me, though he's been known to pee on furniture, beds, laundry piles, etc before. I've had him for three years now and I feel like I largely know his triggers and can prevent accidents. 
While I did the dishes tonight (maybe ten minutes), he was able to be in the kitchen or upstairs living room. I check on him frequently and spray the couches with an essential oil deterrent from time to time. Generally I don't even see him get on the couches. But after I was done with the dishes, I went into the living room expecting him to be looking out the window as he usually does, and instead he was standing atop a big, fresh pee stain.
I chased him off and hesitated momentarily with whether to call my landlady or attend to the stain right away as I have a product that works best that way. So I decided to treat the stain and haven't called her yet.
So I guess it probably feels pretty common sense to just never let my cat in areas that don't belong to me. But this is our first time living 'alone' (our living space is separate; we've always had roommates) and I think being stuck in the basement is stressful for him and actually makes him MORE likely to pee, especially if he gets a chance to sneak somewhere. He'll go months without any bad behavior and I'll think he's reformed, only for something like this to happen again. The weather has been cold and there's an aggressive cat lurking on our property, so he hasn't been going outside like he's used to, where he'll usually do his business once or twice a day outside of using his litterbox.
The reason I'm hesitating on whether to tell my landlady is because this is a trauma trigger for me. I'm terrified of 'getting in trouble' with her and having to forever keep my cat in lockdown, always worrying about him trying to make an escape. Unfortunately, we got kicked out of a living situation a couple of years ago because he ruined my landlord's couches. The home we lived in after that, he never once peed anywhere he shouldn't in nine months. Then the next place, if my roommate would leave clothes on the floor, he'd pee on them. Which I warned her he was prone to and to keep the door shut.
I know that this is my fault. I shouldn't have left my cat unsupervised in my landlady's space knowing he's prone to doing this, even if it is infrequent and I've taken precautions. I did my best to treat the stain and will replace the couch if need be. But AITA if I don't say anything until I establish if the couch is ruined? 

TL;DR Cat peed on landlady's couch and I'm wondering if it's ok to wait to tell her only if the couch is actually ruined.

Edit: I do have a vet appointment for my cat in a few days and I am prepared to replace my landlady's couch if it is in fact ruined.",0.71
"AITA for not letting my son's girlfriend drink alcohol? My (48F) son (25M) has a girlfriend (18F), I had met her a few times and thought she was nice but childish. They met on a dating app, she goes to college here on New Hampshire but her family lives on Hawaii so she wasn't going to spend christmas with them. My son then asked me if she could be with us and I said yes.

After that, her mother (46F) sent me a message on facebook thanking me for receiving her daughter and we started talking. At one point we were talking about wine and she told me that she was worried about her daughter drinking at college. After she and my son arrived, I talked to her about what her mother has told me and asked her to not drink alcohol at dinner.

She was surprised but said it was ok and nothing happened. The next day, my son called me to say that what I did was rude and that I shouldn't treat his girlfriend as a child. I think that I am in the right, the law is on my side and I was just following her mother's wishes.

"AITA for telling my daughter to get a grip My daughter (16) has an interest in crime cases and in general human brutality throughout history. She watches a lot of shows like CSI and stuff on her laptop related to it.

I noticed since new years she's been acting very weird, a lot more silent, I heard her wake up in a mild panic one night (our house is pretty small) and I really hope she's not acting this way in school.

I decided to ask her this morning at breakfast about what's bothering her and she told me she did research into a crime in the US (as usual) that really haunted and freaked her out. I asked her why exactly and she said that's afraid it could happen here, she feel's sick thinking about it and what happened to the women in the case. 

I decided to be decisive about it and told her to get a grip and focus on other stuff, talk to her friends, I assured her nothing will happen, too relax and I also told her the obvious how millions of children in the impoverished world deal with alot worse and don't act how she is. She got fairly annoyed at the last comment which I expected but when she got home today she still seemed the same and probably mad at me.",0.73
"AITA for shouting at my group after a dreadful grade? I (M15) chose to do Business studies for my GCSE‚Äôs. I love it and strive to do the best I can, however It causes me a lot of stress. In the past I was an A* student however this has recently taken a major hit As a result of a group project.
 
To give some context this project consisted mainly of research and ended with a presentation put together across a month with a final week in which was our holiday time which we could finish this project off. So we had a reasonable amount of time to complete this project. Across these months we compiled our research and I was the only one to continue this research outside of our  lessons and any research they contributed was minuscule. Towards the end of the project we decided that we would each compile our slides for each portion of research in which we divide it equally and would all work on one PowerPoint to be done over the final week and we would have a video call, All to confirm we had finished.

 Fast forward one week and no one else turns up to the video call for confirmation of completion. I checked the slide and managed to find that no other parts of the research had been put on. In a panic I stayed up almost all night attempting to finish these slides. I created flash cards for a brief summary of what each slide said so that they would know what to talk about. Once we got to class I explained to them what I had done. They each had their excuses such as why they didn‚Äôt do the work such as I was on holiday or I completely forgot. Once our group was called up for the presentation it was a mess, instead of explaining the slides they simply said what was on the flash cards leaving me to talk through the entire slide show which I was not prepared for. As we walked back to the table they asked why my flash cards had so little on, I stayed silent. Our teacher asked us to stay behind and said that he was disappointed in how our presentation turned out. He stated that he would be checking our research to make sure we did that at least. He walked out of the class letting us pack our stuff and leave. (F15) said ‚Äúwe are all screwed ‚Äù as she did not think that anyone had put research on the document as he had a way that he was able to see who edited each piece of text, however I responded in a outburst as, I had snapped stating how they were all useless and that I would have been better of working by myself and not thinking I could depend on anyone. They all said that I was too harsh and that I should not care so much.

"AITA that I don't want to pay back what I broke...?!? Hear me out please.. (english is not my native language). I have a group I work with for a creative school and we have to do work together. For the class that we follow, we want to do a shoot and with as many attributes as possible.

Now there is one person who is not interested in the shoot, because it is not obliged. (Nothing is obliged, but it is an art school and everyone want to stand out). Now we want to use objects and clothing etc. Useful stuff. 

Now did I spoke to this person and she find everything nonesense. She said to me that when I grow up (I AM 23 and she is 30) I will understand what is important in life. I was fuming, because eventually she said that this school is Just An art school and I don't understand the value of life.

Now the bad part, she didn't want to participate in the shoot, but I could pick up some stuff we could use. She put all her stuff in a paper bag (very heavy) and I was on the bike (because that is what we do in Europe). Halfway trough the paper bag teared apart and everything fell on the ground and something broke. 

Apparently she gave me a statue of a value of 260 dollars (that was the object that broke(... I really do feel terrible, but dont think it is my fault.

"AITA for calling out the commissioner in my fantasy football league? **tl;dr - last-minute commish actions led to me getting ""2nd"". I want an acknowledgment and first prize winnings.**

I am in a 10 person fantasy football league with friends. I made it to the championship round with a fella named Tony. The week before the championship, some of my leaguemates not in the finals dropped all their players. I was a lower waiver rank than Tony, but I put in requests for valuable players and figured I'd nab one or two. When the waivers cleared, I was surprised to see that that I had received most of the players I requested and Tony hadn't added any. In fact, he had not made any changes to his team, even those injured. I figured this was an oversight on Tony's part. Our group thread started popping off that it was dishonorable to add those dropped players. I assumed I was receiving the brunt of the abuse b/c I was projected to win 1st. After all, others in the league had added some of the dropped players, yet people focused on me.

Over the next few days Tony added some players from waivers, including some of the dropped players, but I was still projected to win by a lot. The day of the championship, the commish (not in the finals) used commish privileges to add his best players to Tony's team ""to make the championship more interesting"". I thought this was clearly unfair, since he acted unilaterally to help Tony's team. I did not have any opportunity to add the players and they wouldn't have cleared waivers in time anyway. I thought it was a joke and he would revert the changes after the game to see who actually won.

With the additional players, Tony's team came out ahead. The commish sent a screenshot of a congratulations venmo payment to Tony. Still thinking it was a joke and I was the victor, I said that this year I would give 2nd and 3rd place a % of the pot rather than winner-take-all.

A few days later I hadn't heard anything, so I reached out to commish privately. He said he thought that since I added several of those dropped players, that anything was fair game. (Side question: is there an unspoken consensus not to add dropped players before the championships?) We did the numbers and saw that I would have won if: a) the commish hadn't added players to Tony's team or, b) no teams added any of the dropped players. The commish said he'd reach out to see if Tony was agreeable to sending me the winnings. I again suggested we give a % to 2nd and 3rd place instead of winner-take-all.

Tony msgs me privately and says that the championship was a gongshow, but that he wants to be fair. He offered to go 50/50 on the pot. It's not a lot of money, but his offer doesn't feel right. I know this whole thing is small potatoes, but I put a lot of stock into being fair. ""An injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere"" sort of thing.

"AITA for being pissed at my mother for leaving me to deal with my drunk brother? So my mother L (49f) took my brother M (29m) out for some drinks, around lunch time. I (20ftm) haven‚Äôt been well the last few days so I decided not go.

Note that i‚Äôve recently moved into my new place but still don‚Äôt have any wifi so I go to Ls so I can do my college work online. So i‚Äôm currently at her house.

She sent me a text around 11 asking if i‚Äôm at her house, I respond yes and i‚Äôm nearly finished to go home. She asks me to wait so that I can let M in the house, which is fine. She said that he‚Äôs ‚Äòwankered‚Äô. Now. All of my family are heavy drinkers, I grew up in pubs I‚Äôm used to seeing my family members  drunk.

L calls me to say that M is outside, to bring him in, M cannot stand, cannot walk. He‚Äôs falling all over the place, ground is icy and snowy, man‚Äôs gonna fall and break something. I‚Äôm trying to get him in the house, taxi drives away, doesn‚Äôt help. that i‚Äôm not even 5ft M is 5ft11 -ish.

I get him in the house, he doesn‚Äôt know where he is or how he got there. So i text L to let her know and to ask when she‚Äôs coming back, I don‚Äôt want to leave M like this especially since he‚Äôs trying to leave and walk down the street; i don‚Äôt want him to get hit by a car etc. She says shortly. I ask her to bring M something to eat on her way to try and sober him up. She tells me not to be nosy, which look, i get but M is drunk, paranoid n falling about, idk what to do. So that‚Äôs what i tell her, she left me to deal with a drunk M which she got him drunk on purpose, and she laughs.

I don‚Äôt find it funny, i‚Äôm worried about my brother, he could choke if he‚Äôs sick.I again ask her to get him something to eat as she‚Äôll be home shortly. She tell me to order as she‚Äôs going to be awhile. 

I‚Äôm frustrated cause she‚Äôs done this before (just her not with M), she‚Äôs not coming home for an hour, which turns into four etc, so i ask her if this is the case, she says that she‚Äôs at a party and for me to just go home. , i can‚Äôt leave him home for hours whilst he could choke. he can barely form a sentence never mind sit up when vomiting. i tell her that it‚Äôs irresponsible and ill just deal with it, i‚Äôm fed up.

she calls me, she‚Äôs frustrated that i keep ruining her night with my concerns. tells me that M is a grown man and to just leave him. which fair enough, he is a grown ass man. but she got him pissed and then dumped him on me. hell she was in the taxi and didn‚Äôt even help him to the door. she told me to stay or go home, so i said okay. which wasn‚Äôt the right answer cause she got more frustrated with me n told me to f off, to which I hung up. 

I got M to bed he said that he wasn‚Äôt feeling too great so now i‚Äôm even more concerned. i‚Äôm used to being around drunk people but have always avoided them, never stuck around long enough to deal with them. 

I know that i should help my family out, and should want to, i just really don‚Äôt do drunk people. now i feel kinda guilty for pushing and asking so many questions so AITA for being pissed at my mother?",0.07
"WIBTA for warning my teenage cousin about an upcoming 'family intervention' so that she doesn't get blindsided? My cousin has been getting into some teenage drama at school lately. It's the usual teenage stuff. This guy broke up with this girl, that girl doesn't want to be friends anymore, etc. The type of stuff that seems like the end of the world when you're fifteen years old, but is next to meaningless when you look back on it from college and beyond. Her grades have also been lackluster. 

&#x200B;

The other day my cousin came home quite upset and decided to vent to a few family members about her frustrations with school, her friends, and life in general. It was pretty obvious to me that she was just looking for someone to listen to her concerns for a few minutes. My family, however, decided that this constituted a crisis situation. 

&#x200B;

At this point, I should probably mention that there is a significant age gap between the generations of our family. The older generation (My parents, her father, our grandparents, etc.) are all past sixty. My cousin is a teenager and I am in my mid-twenties. 

&#x200B;

Being older my family jumped to the conclusion that all my cousin's problems stem from technology and social media. I overheard my parents talking and apparently, they think that the silver bullet solution to all her teenage angst is to take away her phone. More than that, they're planning to hold an 'intervention' where they confront her 'over-emotional' behavior and low grades. I, personally, think this is a terrible idea.

&#x200B;

I know it's not my place to parent, but I can't get over the feeling that they're punishing a teenage girl for being a teenage girl. Rather than teaching her discipline, I think this will teach her to never share her feelings with anyone again. I also think that it will take away the only social outlet she has during the pandemic. Since everyone in my family is older she isn't allowed to see any friends even if everyone is vaccinated, wearing masks, and social distancing. 

&#x200B;

I'm wondering if I should give my cousin a heads up as to what's going to happen tomorrow in order to soften the blow. 

&#x200B;

I've thought about voicing my concerns to the older members of my family, but I'm pretty low on the totem pole. The pandemic ruined my financial situation forcing me to move back in with my parents and, because of that, I'm seen as the family failure. Nobody listens to me.   

&#x200B;

On the one hand I don't want my cousin to be blindsided. On the other hand, though I'm not sure that I have a right to interfere with my family's parenting decisions. Doing so very well might make me an asshole. 

&#x200B;

**TL;DR: My family is planning a big, dramatic, intervention for my cousin to put a stop to her 'phone addiction' which they believe is the source of all her 'emotional hysterics.' I believe she is just a teenage girl being a teenage girl and that this intervention will ultimately cause more harm than good. Would I be the asshole if I warned my cousin that this is coming so that she doesn't get blindsided by a surprise punishment?**",0.02
"AITA for making an insensitive joke? Am i the asshole for making an ‚Äúinsensitive‚Äù joke?

"AITA For not allowing my depressed son to have bottled water? My son, 16, was diagnosed with depression two years ago, and has since been going to therapy twice a week and put on medication. I share 50/50 split custody with his dad. 

A system his dad set up was buying eight two litre bottles a week for him to have in his room so he doesnt have to leave his room to drink. He will drink more than two litres a day, and his dad occasionally gets him energy drinks and such.

We have been doing this in my house, but bottled water is expensive. I have five other kids with my husband, its an unnecessary expense we could do without. Plus, you know, plastic in the ocean.

So, instead, I got him a large water bottle and told him to fill it up as needed from the tap. This led to the slightly sticky situation of my son filling it and trying to make it last him all week so he didnt have to refill. 

He was pretty lethargic all week, but thats not out of the ordinary. I assumed he was coming down and filling it up at night/while we were out, as he doesnt like his siblings all that much. Four y/o, three y/o and 18 mos triplets.

Monday he goes to his dads and tells him the new system. Ex called me, angry, called me an abusive mother. I explained cost, he said I should ""stop breeding"" and prioritise our son over the younger ones, who dont have mental health issues.

I apologised, but told him the plastic waste is unacceptable. If our son needs me to, I can fill the bottle. Ex is still incredibly angry, stating that his health should come first. 

I think he's being unreasonable, but I do understand his fear and anger to an extent, with the thingswe go through regarding our son. 

Son has stated he'll stay with his dad, skip my week, and he'll be back week after next. I think he's trying to guilt me. He was like it as a tot. If one of us upset him, he'd beg to stay with the other to make us feel bad and give in.

Am I being an asshole? I understand he lacks energy, but its not really an excuse. Like I said, I'm more than willing to help him if need be.",0.82

"AITA for ratting out a coworker? So I am a shift supervisor at a major coffee company. We had 3 other supervisors and one SM. We were already short one supervisor. This is about one particular supervisor, C.

I worked opening shift 4:30-12 and C worked closing shift 3-11. One day C slipped (not wearing slip resistant shoes) and injured a tendon or something of the like. Basically she couldn‚Äôt put weight on that leg and therefore couldn‚Äôt work. She tried to work in the register a few shifts but it was impossible for her to do her job as a supervisor and the store suffered. She eventually went on paid medical leave with plans to come back.


This changed a lot at my store. I was no longer opening 5 days a week but having to close 2 days a week and 3 open shifts. It was almost impossible for me as my baby was very young at that point and I was used to sleeping with them at like 8pm. I wasn‚Äôt getting my one weekend off a month either which was livable but annoying.

What really pushed me to the edge was being told I couldn‚Äôt take my vacation I had requested off for months in advance due to lack of coverage. I told my SM I was going anyway as it had been paid for.

"AITA For not correcting my step-daugther So I(21F) have a step-daughter (5F) who lives with me and my fianc√©. He has full custody and the mother of the child takes her about 2 nights a month. I've been in the child's life for more than 2 years now so she was 3 when we first met. Since I'm the adult women she sees the more often, she started sliping up and calling me mom from times to times. She usually corrects herself and call me by my name which I'm very much fine with. In public, people have a tendency to refer to me as her mom. She never corrects them and neither do I because more often than not it turns a 20 sec interation into a few minute one for nothing. 

Well last week, we drove her to her mother's place and she turned back to me and said ""bye mom!"". If her mother's eyes could have killed me I would have been dead on the spot. She left without saying anything but texted me later that day asking how this vould have happen since she's supposed to call me only by my name. I explained that as a child she does say it only impulsivly when she's excited or has big emotions. She blew up on me. Leaving my voice messages yelling that I'm trying to steal her daughter from her and insulting me profusely. 

I don't know what to think... I feel like by correcting her all the time she would start to stop herself from talking to me when she has those big emotions by fear of slipping up...


Edit** all of you are very nice! Most people recommended we chose another name for me.

"AITA for not spending time with my nephew today? I am 38F, and I live with my bf (34M) and his family; his mom (68F) brother (39M) and nephew (3M). 

History: I don't work due to personal issues with health, so I've always been a great babysitter for others I consider family. I have known them for 3 yrs and 6 months, living with them for 3 years. I moved in with them due to conflict with previous roommates, and they opened their arms to me in their home. I attend weekly therapy, take meds and have finally learned how to try and set up boundaries for myself. I very often ""fawn"" and rather do so bc it subsides conflict.

Today, I planned to spend the day with nephew. Bf and I went quickly to stores to get necessities. We sanitize in the car and when we get home, ourselves and our products. We get home and we hear brother continually say ""aunt needs to shower"".

Brother tells me, ""can you please shower before hanging out with nephew?"" I told brother, ""why do you keep feeling I need to shower? I've sanitized well and you act like I don't take precautions. If I shower every single day I'm going to get sick."" Hot and cold weather give me chills and sniffles regardless if I'm around people or not. 

I became very offended bc he said ""it's just that it's disgusting out there"". I felt he was practically calling me disgusting and continued to call out ""I guess I'm a germ. I must be disgusting. I need to be sanitized! I'm a walking disease!"" 

I told my bf ""I'm going to shower because I'm disgusting if I dont"". So I showered and came back to the bedroom to cry. I don't like confrontation, so I said nothing to brother. At this point, I'm upset, hysterical crying and bf is consoling me. Bf has to go to work and I'm left in an awkward position. 

Yes, I'm aware I overreacted. The straw broke my back bc I very often bite my tongue when brother says things. 
I'm aware I don't owe anyone anything and it's not my responsibility to care for nephew. Nephew and I are very close bc I've helped raise him since he was born. I love my bf immensely and have loved his nephew as well. We treat nephew like he would be our own kid. 

Nephew and I are best friends and he is currently obsessed with ""hanging out with me"". He is often the medicine to my depression and brings me great joy. He reminds me what it's like to be a kid and how to be now compared to how I used to be. so he is often asking for aunt. 

So. Am I the asshole for not wanting to help watch nephew just bc his dad has been dealing with him all day? I often feel guilty for not helping more bc again, I immediately react with ""fawning"". 

I'm mostly venting and I thank you so much for taking time to read this if you have. Ty for your patience. I appreciate any and all feedback. Thanks reddit!

"AITA because I decided to not invite a coworker to my wedding because of how she was treating me??? .. She's mentioned she hasn't received an invitation to other coworkers... As the title suggests, I decided to not invite a co-worker to my wedding. 

A bit of backstory; We're both cashiers at a local grocery store. We've gotten along fine since the store opened, 2 years now. I've been engaged since October 2020. 
Around the time I was getting invitations ready for mailing, I was asking my coworkers whom I want to attend for their addresses. Around the same time, this coworker was in the process of moving. She wasn't quite familiar with her new address, or so she kept telling me... I decided to ask her landlady for the address, as she is a frequent customer. (no harm, no foul? Or so I thought)
My coworker took umbrage at the fact that I'd circumvented the gaining of the address, and decided to ""freeze me out"" by ignoring me blatantly, pointedly talking to other coworkers, and being rude in any way we had to interact.
Brought this behaviour up with our management team, and they made time for the coworker and I to ""talk it out"" before a shift. 
Her reasoning for acting the way she had been, was because of my asking her landlady for the address. 
I had previously apologized for going around her, and she said she didn't hear that. 

Now everything between us is all fine, but I'd already sent out the invitations. 

Am I the A**hole for not sending her one based on how she'd been treating me???",0.4
"AITA for being blunt with my dad? Edit: I do not give permission for this to be used anywhere else. 

Background: My dad was always an absent parent, he was always there financially and he did take us in when we got took of our mum due to pretty severe abuse but he wasn‚Äôt around and I had to step in as a parent role for my younger brother. He is also a pretty heavy drinker, if he had a day off, it would always be spent in the pub. During those times that he drank, we would get into screaming matches because he didn‚Äôt understand what I was going through (SH). He would periodically kick me out when I was within the ages of 11-18 and I had to sleep outside sometimes. 

Now: Despite our background, we have a semi good relationship now simply because I don‚Äôt take his shit and I have clear boundaries with him. He‚Äôs recently married, and he‚Äôs also recently had a stroke which was said to be because of his history with binge drinking. The doctors have advised him to stop drinking, smoking, and he is adamantly against this. He‚Äôs also taken to verbally abusing his wife because she worries about him staying out all night getting blacked out drunk. His wife and I have a pretty good relationship so she messages me whenever he starts screaming at her, I have received 20 minute voice notes from her that feature him saying the most vile stuff. It all came to a last Sunday when as usual, I received messages from her saying he was at it again and I had finally had enough. 

I sent him a message telling him what he was doing to her and his children by his adamant refusal to stop drinking. I won‚Äôt lie, I went nuclear at him. I‚Äôm not a person who has any kind of tact so I just unloaded on him about everything he was doing and how it was making everyone feel around him. (If people want to see the message I sent, I‚Äôm more than happy to share it I‚Äôm just worried about length). His response? He was tired of people telling him what to do and how he felt like he was losing his sparkle. Bleurgh. 

It didn‚Äôt do anything, but now I‚Äôm hearing that he‚Äôs even more pissier than usual and taking it out on everyone else. I honestly don‚Äôt know what to do anymore, my partner feels like I went too far but I don‚Äôt know. AITA?",0.06
"WIBTA if I didn't go to my sibling's destination wedding in 2 weeks? My (28F) brother (23M) is getting married in 2 weeks. Hurray! I'm excited for that part. What I'm not excited for is how expensive it‚Äôs going to be. I‚Äôm considering not going, and I feel horrible.

My brother and his fianc√©e (22?F) got engaged about 2 years ago. About 1.5 years ago, they asked me to be part of the wedding party, and I definitely planned on going. Also, the wedding was supposed to be in our home state and would be at most a 3-hour drive.

Cut to 3 months ago (late October 2021), my brother's fiancee tells me they've changed the venue to Colorado--specifically, a cabin in the mountains of CO--to have a more intimate wedding, reduce stress/depression she was experiencing, etc. I felt for her while being pretty irked at this development, given the wedding date was only 3 months away and everyone would have to figure out travel arrangements. But at that point, sure, still planned on trying to make it work.

Also should note that at some point here, my brother asked my fiance (33M) to be one of his groomsmen. So both my fiance and I are in the wedding party. We planned to carpool to Colorado with my mom, who is very against flying and therefore wanted to make the 15-hour drive.

We had a busy holiday season, so are just now considering the overall cost of this venture (that's on us). Just today, my mother decided not to go (for a myriad of valid reasons), and she was the main reason we were going to drive instead of fly.

If we now decide to fly, it's about $360 a ticket round trip. If we keep our decision to drive, it's going to take us 2 days there and 2 days back, which also 4 nights of hotels between the travel and wedding days. Also, this cabin is in the mountains and requires 4-wheel drive to get to... so our original thought of taking my 2-wheel drive car with good gas mileage is not gonna work; we're gonna have to take my fiance's gas-guzzling beast, which will probably double the cost of gas. And as a contract worker, I don't get paid for missing work, so I'll be missing out on 2-3 days of work either way we swing it, which is $360-$550.

Last week, my brother and his fiancee announced they were live-streaming the wedding. And they told me yesterday that only 13 people are coming in person.

All of this is to say, it's going to cost me and my fiance each about $800 to attend this destination wedding. My brother and I aren't super close, but I love him dearly and want to be there to support him. It just almost doesn't feel worth it to make this happen--part of me wants to do everything possible to be there for him, but it just doesn't seem like a good idea right now (given everything going on). Would I be the asshole for not going?

(P.S. Definitely planning on chatting with my brother very soon, just wanted to post here and hear judgment from the masses.)

"AITA for being angry my BIL is buying my FIL's house? My wife's parents have owned a house for 20 years. Her mother passed away a few years ago, and since then her father has been living in the house alone. Her brother's family helps out a lot and has him over for dinner almost every night. My wife and I visit about once a week and help out, but not as much as my BIL's family.

My FIL owes about $150k on the mortgage, and the home is worth about $500k. My BIL's family has been talking about taking ownership of the home and letting my FIL live with them for years because he wants to age in place but he doesn't have any money to retire. The plans have always been very vague and no one has ever shared any details with me and my wife or discussed how things would work. I always assumed that my wife would get a portion of the equity of the house, either when my BIL bought it or when my FIL passed away.

We were out to dinner last night and the topic of the house came up and my BIL mentioned he would be putting his own home on the market in about a month and buying his father's house. I suggested that all the family should get together with a lawyer to figure out a fair way of distributing the equity. My BIL and his family got very upset, said we only care about the money, and that they are only looking out for what's best for the father.

This morning we visited my FIL to try to discuss the situation. It did not go well. It seems likely he had willed the house 100% to his son, but he wouldn't tell us one way or the other. Everyone thinks we're huge assholes and we're trying to ""claim our inheritance"" while my FIL is still alive.

No one will give us a straight answer about the plan, but it seems like my BIL is going to take ownership of the house without having to pay much if anything for it and that they will get the house completely when my FIL passes away without any other family members getting anything. They say that since they're going to let him live there and fix the place up that they should get it. They don't seem to be willing to discuss any alternative arrangements.

If my FIL wants to just give the house to his oldest son, that's his choice and we would respect that. No one will tell us if that is or isn't the plan. If my FIL's will says for the house to be divided by his three children, we would probably get around $50k-$100k if he were to pass away without my BIL buying it. If he buys it it looks like we would get nothing. My SIL angrily said they weren't going to ""pay us off"" when I asked about our interest in the house.

It's so tense that I don't know if I ever want to see my FIL and BIL's family ever again. It's not the money, it's the secrecy, deception, and unfairness. They say all we care about is the money, but at the same time they seem perfectly willing to keep the $350k in equity on the house and give us nothing.",0.5
"AITA for calling a guy a asshole and flipping him off So I was just at the store buying some things and when I got to the self checkout a spot open up and the guy in front of me was flirting with some girl and and he wasn‚Äôt going and I just wanted to pay and leave so I cut in front of him, anyway while I was paying the guy I cut in front of walk up to me and call me an asshole and a little bitch and told me to move even though other spots open up so told him hey their is another spot go to that one (btw he was a adult in his late 20s and I‚Äôm 15)

So after he finish checking out he waits for me at the door so I leave through the other doors not trying to cause anything, so when I leave the store he follows me out and yells at me to stop and call me a little bitch and I stop because I didn‚Äôt want them to follow me home and he call me a asshole and expects a apology and their I say I‚Äôm not going to apologize because you didn‚Äôt open your eyes.

Anyway after he was done he walk away and call be a little bitch faggot and I usually don‚Äôt call people assholes in public nor do I like to flip them off but I did this time and I feel like an asshole now and I just wanted peoples opinions.",0.59
"AITA (28F) for refusing to cook for my picky eater spouse (29M)? I (28F) have been with my spouse (29M) for about 10 years, married nearly 6. I grew up in a separated home with parents who loved to cook good, healthy food and, of course, passed this love to me. My spouse grew up in a very traditional southern home where his pickiness was catered to: his family cooked meals they knew he liked to make sure he was eating SOMETHING. After many years of this, his palette has developed into a very sugar, salt, butter, cheese and red meat-heavy one, and he often gravitates towards processed fast foods. 

Especially since we‚Äôve been married, I‚Äôve tried to keep us both healthy by making meals I grew up eating that were full of vegetables, grains, and lean meats. I am met with resistance almost every time I cook something, unless it is one of his favorite dishes (of which there are maybe 5). I‚Äôve really resorted to letting him handle cooking lately because it seems like it‚Äôs the only time he‚Äôs satisfied with a meal, but as I mentioned above he usually he prefers heavier, less balanced meals than I do. I want to be a good spouse and handle cooking since he works so hard, but it seems so pointless. I finally hit my breaking point today and decided that from this point forward, I am done cooking for the two of us. 

I have tried and tried, but throwing away half of the healthy food I make is wasting food, time, and money and is making me frustrated to the point of just giving up on my efforts altogether. AITA if I just cook healthy meals for myself and tell my spouse to find something to eat?

ETA: My younger brother used to be a picky eater! My mom would tell him to eat what she made or go hungry. She set him up for success as he is no longer a picky eater! I fully intend to take this approach if my spouse and I ever have kids as well, which adds an additional AITA: if I make my kids eat healthy balanced meals that I cook and they see their other parent won‚Äôt eat it, AITA?

ETA2: My spouse loves to cook his select few favorite meals! I just get tired of them cycling over and over again with no variety or vegetables other than potatoes or corn.",0.33
"AITA for throwing out my roomate's stuff? I am a college student (25F) and I live in a dormitory with 2 roommates. One of them, Alice (21F), was there with me last year, and she was ok to live with, we have a friendly relationship. But this year our new third party, Bea (21F) is a nightmare. 

So, it all started off well. Bea was friendly, talkative, easy to be friends with. But... It turns out that she is hard to live with. 

She has all these bad habits, like leaving the door wide when she goes to class, but all our stuff (laptops, iPad, money) is in the room... Or leaving a mess all around, dirty clothes on the floor, dirty dishes on the selves and desks, hair in the sink.... She is using our stuff without asking. She keeps waking us up in the night (sometimes 4 in the morning!) with loud steps, movement, light, laughing with her BF. The two of them even started to smoke in the room when I am not there! Just one thing, that all our stuff is stinking, but it is forbidden to smoke in the dormitory. There is no fire alarm. 

Also, she has tons of stuff and she slowly started to occupy my space too! I like to keep my desk empty and clean, but she started to use it to store her mess there when I'm not around. Often she sits on my bed (I found her hair on my pillow, so God knows what else they were doing...). Since I have the middle desk and bed, it's only bothering me, not Alice. 

Alice is fine with Bea, they have no conflict at all, since Bea has not reached Alice's space yet. The smoking and night wake ups are bothering her, but she is just trying to avoid confrontation. (She only likes to watch our conflicts (with popcorn)). She is not fed up yet. Still, she understands that I am mad at Bea and thinks I am right.
 
I tried to talk to her to change some things, but she apologises and continues to do it the  again and again. She even acts like I am the stupid to ask such thing as closing the door when leaving... 

Slowly, my relationship with Bea became hostile. Or... More like ignorant. I don't even say ""Hello"" to her. And I am just tired of putting her stuff back to its place every time. So, the truth is, I started to throw out her stuff to the garbage. Everytime I arrive back to the room finding something of her on my desks or bed, I just throw it out. She is so messy, that she is not even noticing. Oh, something is missing? Nevermind, she forgets it in an hour. AITA?",0.68
"AITA for not serving my dad food? So my dad just came home from work and I (26F) had just finished making dinner. My mom asked him if he wanted some, and he said yes. This might have been where I messed up I guess. I made my plate and sat down, which caused him to get pouty and leave. He doesn‚Äôt live with us anymore, so he left for good to go to his house. I could immediately tell that he was upset that I didn‚Äôt make him a plate. 

As soon as he left, my mom confirmed my suspicions and gave me a lecture about how it was rude that I made myself a plate and didn‚Äôt make him one. I truthfully can‚Äôt see how it was rude because he could‚Äôve just gotten up and made himself one. But now I‚Äôm being forced to apologize even though I don‚Äôt think I need to. So, I‚Äôm asking a bunch of strangers to help me realize if I‚Äôm the asshole or not for this lol.

"AITA for deciding to transition despite my mother's wishes? I (22FTM) promised my mother I wouldn't start my medical transition until after I finished college - This wasn't a willing agreement, She cornered me the night before I moved into my dorm implying, though not outright saying those were her terms for me to have any help from my parents paying for college. I, panicked, agreed. 
Three years later (just before my final year of college) I decided to go forward with starting testosterone anyway.  I paid for it (including all appointments and testing) with money I had saved and with some of my earnings from my part time job. My parents eventually found out, and my mother threatened to (though seeming hasn't) stop helping with tuition, she says because I disobeyed and lied to them.
I was made to go home for christmas, so I stayed with my parents for the first time since they found out I was on testosterone. I haven't come out to my extended family yet. My mother insists I'm ignoring the impact on her, because she doesn't have anyone to talk to about my transition (she doesn't have any friends outside the family - that's not me being rude, that's what she's said). I'll admit she's right on that front, I probably do have more people I can talk to about my transition and the arguments we have about it. During this same discussion, she refused to let me drive myself to my blood test (this was the final day I could do so, as in my home state it is covered by charity but in the state I go to college it costs over $250) until I came out to my family (my father stepped in here and took me) as well as mocked me for being unable to afford an additional 250 dollar bill (which I wasn't expecting to need to pay, since the tests are free in my home state.) Her justification was I shouldn't have the appointment anyway, because I wasn't supposed to be taking testosterone and I had lied to her.
I, of course, think she's being absurd, but I understand the situation may look different from the outside, and I wanted to know if I'm being unreasonable as well. I do live at home with them when I'm not in school, and they do pay the vast majority of my bills. AITA for not following their rules, since I live in their home?",0.01

"AITA for doing my boyfriend's laundry and organizing his kitchen? My boyfriend and I (late 30s) are currently in a long distance relationship due to my job being in another country. We see each other every other month and have never lived together. Fortunately, my work allows me to work from there so I can stay with him for long spans of time before having to come back home. 

The last time I saw him was last month - a 3 week stay, which was the longest non-stop we had ever spent together in the same apartment. His apartment is small and he has a lot of stuff, he has a lot of responsibilities between work and his kids, that he doesn't get a lot of time at home to breathe, nevermind do anything else. My office closes down between Christmas and New Years, so I had a lot of free time on my hands for some of the time I was there. I love to cook, but his counters were so cluttered with stuff, things were on shelves that had already expired. So I decided to rearrange some things (not everything, just a few shelves) so that more items could be stored in cabinets instead of sitting on a counter.

I also started to go through his pile of laundry that was sitting in the corner. His hamper was overflowing to the point that the pile of clothing was taller than me. Since I wasn't sure the delicacy of some of his clothing, I cleaned a lot of it under the ""delicate"" cycle. The problem is he doesn't have a dryer, so I started to just hang everything on hangers and put them on doors so that they were out of the way and wouldn't get wrinkled. 

Apparently, I shouldn't have done any of these things. He was clearly unhappy when he saw what I did, criticized me for how I did his laundry (it'll take too long to dry that way! You made the load too large!) and didn't like how I organized his kitchen. I was shocked, he bottled up all of this anger he felt over it and then exploded about it later on. After he took some time to cool down he later admitted he felt I was essentially being a jerk for changing everything in his house as a ""guest"" and I clearly didn't think his home was good enough. I think that all I was trying to do was help him out and also make it easier for myself to be there for 3 weeks.

"AITA For Calling My Dad a Hypocrite? So the problem stems back to a few days ago. We were going to have this frozen meal for lunch the next day because we‚Äôve already had it sitting in the freezer for a while now. My dad tells me to defrost it in the fridge so it would ‚Äúcook faster‚Äù. Mind you, the packaging clearly says KEEP FROZEN, DO NOT DEFROST pasted bold on the front. Now I don‚Äôt know much about frozen food, but I‚Äôm pretty sure if it says ‚Äúkeep frozen, do not defrost‚Äù then it should probably be kept frozen, and not defrosted. I let him know, and told him I didn‚Äôt want to take any chances. We then got into this petty argument about how I should ‚Äústop following instructions all the time and use my common sense.‚Äù

Cut to yesterday, I leave my school for lunch because of medical reasons. My dad comes to pick me up, we sign out, and then I come back in time for my next period. It usually goes smoothly since everyone else eats at school and the lines at the front office aren‚Äôt very long. However the line that day was longer than usual for whatever reason. The school is extremely understaffed because of covid, and there was only one lady working front desk at the time. To manage the lines slightly better, they usually have two lines (one for students, one for parents, the parents being the ones attended to first). I got there later than my dad, and the student line was literally looping around the corner so I went to the stand in the parent line. I found him standing in the corner on his phone. I got his attention and told him ‚Äúyou could‚Äôve lined up‚Äù. I admit, I could‚Äôve worded that a lot better and it was my fault for not thinking before speaking. After we checked out, he started yelling at me in the parking lot about ‚Äúhow he was supposed to know there were two lines. And how I should be following school instructions and stand in the student line‚Äù. First off, I don‚Äôt think I was breaking any rules since technically I had a parent with me. Second, the line was so long, much would probably be over before I even got to the front. This was beyond embarrassing since a few teachers walking to their cars glared at us and quickened up their pace. I didn‚Äôt say anything back to him since I didn‚Äôt want to cause a bigger commotion. 

When we got home, I sneered at him and called him a hypocrite. How he has just told me to ‚Äúnot follow the instructions the other day, and now he‚Äôs telling me to do the opposite.‚Äù How at school, I‚Äôd only called him out for something he could‚Äôve easily seen if he just paid attention to his surroundings instead of staring at his phone. That‚Äôs when he absolutely exploded at me and started yelling ‚Äúthis is why you have no friends, you‚Äôre not as smart as you think you are‚Äù‚Äî 

Anyways, he hasn‚Äôt talked to me since and my mom thinks we‚Äôre both in the wrong. There were some things I could‚Äôve said better, but I don‚Äôt think I was the AH. AITA?",0.57

"AITA for setting an ultimatum with my sister over sign language? ETA: Not asking for judgement on the personal medical decision MY family made for OUR daughter. She has not had an interest in an implant but if she does later on, the option is available. We wanted her to have the choice, but also to grow up in deaf culture. I am not going to defend this anymore to Internet randoms, but please consider researching deaf opinions on the matter. As a hearing person, I can only give a very limited perspective. 

Hi all. I (30F) am hearing, married to a deaf man (32M) - I‚Äôm going to call him Walter - and we have a deaf daughter (6F) - I‚Äôll call her Cora. Walter comes from a primarily deaf family but my family is all hearing. We have chosen to raise Cora with sign language and not go for an implant - this is simply for context, I am NOT seeking judgement on this!

Before Walter and I got married, my parents began to take classes to learn ASL, as did my brother and his family. My sister, Emily, took them for a bit but ended up not continuing due to ‚Äúlack of interest.‚Äù She and her husband have not taken any lessons, nor have their 3 children. Walter tried introducing their daughter to baby sign when she and Cora were both very young but my brother in law asked him to stop, as he didn‚Äôt want to ‚Äúconfuse her.‚Äù Cora and her cousins play as best they can with the language barrier but it‚Äôs extremely frustrating for her to feel like she isn‚Äôt being understood. When my brother‚Äôs children (who visit only a few times a year) visit, they interpret for her, or Walter and I have to constantly be looking over their shoulders to help resolve their miscommunications, which is too helicopter parent for me. 

When we learned Cora was deaf, Emily pestered me about getting her an implant and continues to send me shame-y Facebook posts about the benefits of the implant and those videos of babies hearing for the first time. She constantly says it‚Äôs ‚Äúbetter than having to learn two languages.‚Äù She‚Äôs been very pushy about it, to the point she and Walter got in a heated argument over it. Since then, she has not pestered him about it, only me.

My last straw was this past weekend. Emily was with all her kids, teaching them a game. I noticed that Cora wasn‚Äôt joining, so I brought her over and Emily outright told me that Cora couldn‚Äôt play, because it‚Äôs a game ‚Äúfor people who can speak.‚Äù I was fuming and pulled her aside. I told her that my daughter can communicate, just not how Emily wants, and said that I won‚Äôt have my daughter excluded for something so petty. I told Emily that we will be cutting contact unless she starts putting in effort - learning ASL, teaching her kids, including Cora, and not being so disrespectful. We got in a spat about it, so my family left. Emily has not had contact since. My parents think I‚Äôm being unfair to Emily but agree she should make more of an effort and my brother has completely agreed with me. Walter feels I‚Äôve been extreme but I‚Äôm honestly frustrated that I haven‚Äôt been this extreme sooner! I do worry that I‚Äôm being clouded by Mama Bear rage and this is actually super irrational, so I think I might be TA. So, who‚Äôs the asshole?

"AITA for having the word ""weeb"" in my bio? Let me firstly say, this will not be the most exciting story on here. In fact I redownload reddit just to see if I'm an asshole. So if your looking for something interesting just skip this post.



A bit of context: I'm was in a discord sever for about 5-6 months at the time of this happening. And one of my friends of that sever invited me to a smaller sever for close friends.

A=guy who muted me
M=me(of course)

Anyway I joined the new sever and started typing in chat. Not even the first message is out for a minute and I get muted. I ask my friend who invited me why? They don't know and ask around, come to find out thay I was muted for having the word ""weeb"" in my bio. So I DMed the person who muted me and asked why? This is what happened:(also I don't really remember alot and I'm to lazy to go back and check, but I will if you guys want me too for more clarity)

M:hey! I would like to know why you muted me on (insert discord sever name)?

A: because your a f*cking weeb.

M: and? What's wrong with that??

A:you know what's wrong with it lol.

M:No, I don't. Weeb is someone who watches anime.

A:No it's f*cking not, it's someone who is obsessed with Asian culture and wants to be Asian. Now please leave me alone.

I knew this but never use it in this context because no one else I talk to does either. So i was confused when they said it at first.

M: Hey again i just wanted to let you know that it's not Asian culture but Japanese culture and that I also don't use it like that, I've taken it out of my bio to make you happy thought.

A: A. Didn't ask
     B. I unmuted you so leave me alone now.

M:okay thanks....I guess.

At this point I left the close friends sever because I could see that it was toxic, but now A has been made mod of the other sever I'm in. And I've tried being nice and talking to them but ever time I do they said ""I hold grudges"" like I did something wrong. So that why I want to know If I did something wrong.

When I brought this up to her it went really well, we all agreed it would be great, and she even had a meeting with my boss where she committed to the job. Then I reminded her this week (it was told to her first during the meeting a couple of weeks ago) that she would have to pay our boss the $150 per person liability insurance, but that's the yearly rate. All of a sudden her attitude changed. She feels like it's happening too fast and she thinks paying this insurance would keep her tied down to this place. I explained that she needs this insurance regardless of where she works but it's cheaper to get it through our boss. To me it feels like she's saying she won't stay at least a year which I think would be unprofessional to consider before you've even had your first day. 

To put her at ease my boss agreed to let her make payments and reimburse her if she needs to cancel within a specified range but it's cheaper easier to remove her from the policy rather than add her later on. My friend is freaking out. She says she's feels pressured and refuses to call my boss to talk it out. My boss extended a huge favor to both of us by giving us jobs right out of training and I feel like after I've talked her up after the job was offered to me it would look bad on me. I'm being as gentle and patient as I can be, but I kind need her to pee or get off the pot. I feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. I explained several times that she does not need to feel obligated to work there because of me but her last minute cold feet is making me very nervous about my image with my boss. She's been committed for well over a month with no signs she was not taking it. I even offered to pay it for her and she can pay me back, if the money was the issue, I know times are hard for everyone. 

I genuinely thought I was doing both of us a favor, because she worried about finding a job, and we clicked so well in training, but now she's saying this situation and the pressure to make a decision is stressing her out.

"AITA for turning down my friend‚Äôs plans? I (17f) have been dating my current boyfriend (18m) for six months now. This is my first relationship that I have truly felt comfortable in, as I can be myself around him, and I am so happy about it. 

My friend, who we‚Äôll call Holly (18f), have been friends for about four years, but lately we‚Äôve just drifted, as well as disagree about certain issues. We used to work in the same place, but I had to leave the job, which is when I last talked to her (which was about a month or so ago). Yesterday, she reached out to me over text and wanted to catch up. I was happy she did, and we talked for a few minutes. 

She then asked me if I would be willing to go to a lacrosse game at our school with her. She had been talking to this guy that plays this said sport, and didn‚Äôt want to go alone. Under any normally circumstance, I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to go‚Äî this was me and Holly‚Äôs thing. We‚Äôve gone to any sports games, whether it was at school or somewhere else, for years‚Ä¶ But the thing is, this guy she‚Äôs talking to is on the same team as my ex.  My ex caused me a lot of problems, and while I am indeed over it, I want absolutely nothing to do with him. 

The reason this issue is prominent is because me and Holly went to lacrosse games in the past to go support my ex. It was the only time we had ever been to a lacrosse game. If I were to go, I would be completely uncomfortable. Not only does it bring up old memories that I‚Äôm not really okay with thinking about, but it also doesn‚Äôt really feel fair to my current boyfriend. So, because of this, I politely declined, but I tried to think of other things we could do‚Äî go out to eat, go to a different sports game, or go hang out somewhere else in general. 

Holly flipped. She said I was just making up excuses to not hang out with her, and that I should be ‚Äúover it‚Äù. She also said that she‚Äôs always supported me with my past relationships, so I should ‚Äúdo the same with her‚Äù. Her words hurt‚Äî I always felt like I‚Äôve been there for her, and through her relationships. Not to mention, she knows about the stuff my ex did, so I felt like it wasn‚Äôt really fair to say that.

AITA? I want to say that I don‚Äôt think I am, but I feel bad about what happened. I want to be there for her, but I don‚Äôt want to make myself uncomfortable when I don‚Äôt have to.",0.07
"AITA for telling my mom Draven would be a bad name for her son? My mom is 5 months pregnant. She wasn't planning on having another kid 15 years after having me but she chose to keep it. It's been hard on her because it was so different compared to me so she's been resting a lot. Last night I was playing some VR out in the living room because that's the biggest room in our apartment and the topic of baby names came up.

My mom said she was thinking of naming the baby Draven after the character Eric Draven from The Crow. The movie is important to her and has been for a while, so that's why she would consider the name. I told her just because she likes the name doesn't mean he (the baby) will like the name. She said that he will have to deal with it if she did pick that name and asked me if I liked my name. 

I told her my name was mediocre and she said I could change my name when I'm an adult. I already planned on changing my name because 1. I'm trans and 2. I really don't like my name, it's boring and bland. I didn't tell her this, I just said I only have to wait 3 more years before I could. She got mad at me and said I could name my kids what ever I want. She doesn't know I don't want kids so I just stopped talking so the conversation would end. 

She hasn't talked to me since. I feel like I was in the wrong for criticizing her name choise and that I shouldn't have said anything. Am I the asshole?

EDIT: My mind blanked and I forgot to add that she asked for my thoughts on the name.

Edit 2: she's naming it after her dad and keeping the middle name Draven",0.18
"AITA for expecting my roommates to do the dishes after I cook?   

Me (21f) & bf of 6 years (22m) moved into a two-bedroom apartment with our friend (21f) at the end of August. We're all university students with part-time jobs. It's been good so far, except they will sometimes leave dirty dishes for days until they finally clean them or I do. When we moved in, we agreed that I would cook which I enjoy doing anyways if they did the dishes. They normally will do them, though sometimes not right after dinner. I don‚Äôt expect them to bc sometimes we will eat really late. I work until 9:15 some nights & my bf works until 10:30 so dinner is sometimes as late as 10:30-11. I cook almost every night for us & take care of most of the grocery shopping too, we split the cost of everything three ways. I've voiced my frustration about the division of labor in the past, & I think it improved but I lashed out at them today. 

I worked until 9:15 last night & the night before. I prepped french onion soup with homemade stock before I had to work the first day, so all I had to do was heat it up & assemble the baguette & cheese & make a quick caesar salad with homemade croutons. The next day I made pancakes for breakfast in a still dirty kitchen & in the afternoon my roommate half-did the dishes by putting the plates in the dishwasher (but not starting it) & leaving the rest in the sink. I started work at 4 & I told them I was just going to make the same dinner tonight bc there were leftovers. Neither of them had anything to do besides a bit of early schoolwork (we started Monday) & when I got home at around 9:30 the kitchen was still a mess. I had just mopped for 2 hours & my back was killing me & I had a headache. I was really frustrated the kitchen was dirty & all the things I needed for dinner were still dirty. My bf cleaned the ones I needed after I asked, which I appreciated but I felt like he was pissy about it. Now today I did the dishes from last night & night before around 4pm. My bf started work at 5 so I didn't expect him to help, but my roommate just sat on the couch while I did them for 45 minutes. I‚Äôve been in a bad mood about this since last night and I blew up & said how it was unfair how even when I'm tired from working I still make dinner but they won‚Äôt do the dishes. I said from now on if they wont do the dishes after I cook I will pay for all the ingredients myself & do the dishes but they cant have any of it.

I mention everything is homemade bc I put a lot of effort and time into my cooking. My love language is acts of service so I genuinely want to cook for them bc I love them & that's how I express it. They always thank me for cooking but it upsets me when they don‚Äôt do the dishes. It's not like I expect an act of service in return, but it would be nice to feel like they put in the same amount of effort that I do. The time they spend doing the dishes is not even comparable to me cooking and shopping, especially bc there are two of them to split it up.",0.15
"AITA For telling my parents to cut my brother off? My 36 year old brother lives off of my parents and his 20 something girlfriend. He is fully capable of working and has an Associates Degree in IT that it took him six years to get. The only job he has ever had was a year long stint stocking shelves at a local grocery store. He quit because he didn't like his manager and hasn't worked since. For most of his adult life he has lived in an apartment paid for by my parents, eating groceries my parents bought him, playing video games all day. My dad is 66 and still working because he is still helping him out financially. He currently lives with his girlfriend who is in her 20s and works as a pharmacy tech. It was always her dream to go to pharmacy school but she gave it up to support him.  He is oblivious to the fact that other people have given up so much to be able to support him. I started telling my parents this year that it is time for them to cut him off and start thinking about themselves. But, they got incredibly angry. I told them that he should be able to support himself by now and that they needed to think about themselves and their retirement. I am trying to do everything I can for my parents including taking them to Costa Rica this spring because they've never had the opportunity to travel. However, I can't financially give them back the amount of money they spend on him each year, even though I've tried. I think I am right in telling them to cut him off. They should have the opportunity to retire but at this rate they will work until the day they die and I don't want to see that happen to them.",0.45

I asked nicely if she could go about this another way as it was kind of hard to see posts like that on his page, then suggested she add his friends to her own profile.

"AITA for cancelling a trip because my best friend can‚Äôt come anymore. Me (21f) and my friend (22f) ‚Äúhope‚Äù planned a weekend trip to France just the two of us. When my best friend ‚Äúcathrine‚Äù (22f) found out we were going she asked to come along, I said if it‚Äôs alright with hope then yes. She is very good friends with hope aswell so she agreed to let her come. A couple days later hope asked if her boyfriend ‚ÄúKyle‚Äù (20m) could come aswell which we both all agreed to. 

Just to add this was a last minute trip that was planned about a two months in advance.

About a month before the holiday, cathrine told us she could no longer come as she couldn‚Äôt get the time off work. This caused an issue for me because now it was going to me and another couple going on this trip. As many may know France is considered a very romantic country and we were staying in Paris. Also this couple is comfortable with PDA and I have felt like a third wheel when hanging out with just the two of them. 

I told my friend hope that I don‚Äôt feel comfortable going to Paris with just the two of them and explained my reasons why. We decided to try and find someone else to come on the trip with us but because it was so last minute we had no luck. I asked hope if we could uninvite her boyfriend and arrange a trip with him another time as it was originally just going to be us anyway. She got very upset with me and said that if she uninvited her boyfriend it would cause him to break up with her and she doesn‚Äôt see any issue with just us three going. She also said the only reason she invited him in the first place is because she didn‚Äôt want to be a third wheel with me and cathrine. 

This confused me as she has never mentioned feeling left out around us before and I actually spend more time with hope in general so I didn‚Äôt feel closer to cathrine as a friend, we‚Äôd just been friends longer.  We also asked most of our mutual friends if they‚Äôd ever felt left out when hanging around with us and they all said not at all. Also hope is very good friends with cathrine anyway so I don‚Äôt see why it would‚Äôve been an issue with just us girls being on holiday.

Because she refused to uninvite her boyfriend I decided not to go on the trip and we haven‚Äôt spoken since. I know her boyfriend was excited about the trip aswell and would‚Äôve been upset if he wasn‚Äôt aloud to come.

So AITA for giving her an ultimatum that could possibly cause issues in there relationship and then not attending the trip.",0.39

"WIBTA if I went off at my friend? Obligatory on mobile and I‚Äôm a native English speaker. Mistakes are mine. 

So I (26F) have a best friend (25F) who I‚Äôm about to lose my sh*t with. She has another friend (25F) who she‚Äôs been friends with for ages but who I don‚Äôt like (she bullied my little sister to the point where my mum pulled her out of that school and sent her to another one. Not relevant to the story but background info). We‚Äôll call my friend J and her friend E. 

This morning J msgd me asking how to report someone for animal abuse. I told her, gave her all the info and asked what was happening. E‚Äôs dog (small breed) just had 9 pups and J showed pics of the mumma dog to her aunt (who breeds dogs of the same breeding). The aunt said E is massively underfeeding her dog and told J she should report her. J then tells me she‚Äôs now got to think about whether she should or not. 

Guys, I‚Äôm so close to losing my cool with J. E is an abusive relationship that‚Äôs resulted in this dog being shot by E‚Äôs partner. They have a toddler (2ish F) together and J is always going on about how worried she is about 2F growing up in that household with E and her partner. I‚Äôve encouraged her to report them to CPS for neglect of 2F but she hasn‚Äôt done so. I can‚Äôt do it myself because I don‚Äôt know where E lives. 

Now J is debating about whether she should report E and her partner to animal control and other animal rescues for abuse and I know it‚Äôs because she‚Äôs scared E is going to figure out it was her and drop her as a friend. But I think there is a dog and a litter of pups at stake here and J should suck it up and do the right thing. WIBTA if I snapped at J about being a sook?

ETA: I‚Äôve been asked this a fair amount already so thought I‚Äôd put it here. I cannot report E myself. I don‚Äôt have the necessary information and no way other than J to get it to make a report to anyone. I don‚Äôt even know for sure which town E lives in because she‚Äôs always moving according to J. I can‚Äôt ask J for it because I honestly don‚Äôt think she‚Äôll give me the info. And yes, I‚Äôve made reports to both CPS and animal control/rescues before. I know what information they need and what I‚Äôve got will do as much good as not reporting E myself.

I‚Äôd also like to point out that I‚Äôm asking for judgement regarding my feelings towards J, not for anything else so kindly stick to that. Thanks",0.42

"AITA for telling a woman I‚Äôll ruin her life if she sets foot on my property again? Those at my (17F) high school in the top 10% of the class get a lot of special accolades and incentives, and your class rank is a major factor for our school‚Äôs endorsement for college recommendations and scholarships.

I noticed that I was passed in class rank by a girl (17F) who I know for a fact is not taking as many AP classes as me. I keep track of everyone who is near me in class rank (their classes and grades) to make sure no one passes me up. AP classes are weighted in GPA over honors classes, which is what she took this semester since she said she wanted an ‚Äúeasy semester.‚Äù Based on how my school calculates GPA, the only way she should have been able to pass me was if I got all Bs and she got all As, which is not what happened at all.

So I mentioned I was confused to the principal‚Äôs secretary since I‚Äôm her student aid. She looked into it, and it turns out the girl‚Äôs rank was miscalculated. They did not weight her honors classes correctly, and they‚Äôve since fixed it and moved her back down to where she belongs.

The girl suspected it was me who brought it to their attention and told her mom. This girl lives three streets away from me, so her mom came to my house and confronted my mom and was like ‚Äúhow dare your daughter interfere with my child‚Äôs rank and her future, etc.‚Äù And my mom was just like ‚ÄúI guess your kid should‚Äôve taken harder classes. Don‚Äôt ever step on my property again.‚Äù

Several days later, my parents weren‚Äôt home, and the mom returned to our house. I answered, and she was like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here to see your mom again.‚Äù And I told her I‚Äôll call the police if she doesn‚Äôt leave, because she‚Äôs trespassing. We‚Äôve told her she‚Äôs not allowed on our property. And she blew me off and was like ‚Äúoh please. Let me see your mom.‚Äù And I said that we have cameras filming her trespassing and threatening behavior, and her life will be ruined if she comes back. We will absolutely take legal action.

The woman left spitefully, and my mom was pleased with how I handled it when she returned. But the woman went on our neighborhood site and passive-aggressively badmouthed us in a half-page rant without mentioning our name, saying we are ruining her daughter‚Äôs life. So my mom was forced to respond, saying the woman is a repeated trespasser and harasser and we will take legal action if forced and we have film evidence.",0.33

"AITA For Embarrassing My Brother In Front Of His Crush 
I‚Äôve always given my younger brother a few dollars of my monthly allowance because of our not so good home life. Mostly for snacks and things. Sometimes I can‚Äôt do this because of how tense the situation is. So I tell him to save up the few dollars I do give him as a whole so he can start buying his own stuff. 

So I got my little school money and found him telling him I wanted to go to the store after school today.
I give him a few dollars and go back to my table. Only I see him sneakily try to give the money to a girl he has a crush on. She has a boyfriend. She wouldn‚Äôt like him. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with him she just isn‚Äôt his type. She‚Äôs told me so. 
I blew up at him in front of people and I did expose that some nights he goes hungry because he doesn‚Äôt know how to save money(people called me a jerk for this because I gave him a gift expecting gratitude) 

The girl gave the money back to him and told him not to give her money anymore. He‚Äôs embarrassed because of what I said. I‚Äôve tried to stop giving a fuck about how my parents screwed us over with their choices but I wasn‚Äôt really caring about that because I wasn‚Äôt in a preppy school where everyone had enough to eat and I was the odd one out. Everyone at my school has shit going on and it‚Äôs just normal to have shit going on. However he says he didn‚Äôt want her to think he was poor and unable to provide for her. 
I called him a fucking Simp. I said this because he‚Äôs giving her money and bringing her gifts knowing she has a boyfriend(they‚Äôre ‚Äúoff and on‚Äù) and saying he wants to pursue her. But she doesn‚Äôt think about him like that. He said he didn‚Äôt expect anything out of it but he clearly is infatuated with her and isn‚Äôt doing it because she‚Äôs his friend. He does expect something and it hurts him when he sees she is still with her boyfriend. 
I called him a Simp to lighten the mood and get across that I wasn‚Äôt angry at him just frustrated. 

He told our mom about what I did and she tried to take the money altogether. I barely kept it safe. 

My friends say I‚Äôm a bad person for trying to make him grow up to fast. That I should just let him be a kid for as long as he can. I get that they don‚Äôt understand my situation but I‚Äôm not anyone‚Äôs mother. I stepped up to care for these kids because no one else. When they are old enough to know how to do it themselves I‚Äôm going to let them. Don‚Äôt depend on others especially if they show you they aren‚Äôt dependable. You need to be able to take care of yourself. I know he‚Äôs just a kid but so am I! I didn‚Äôt sign up for three kids in high school. I never go out anywhere because of me trying to make sure they have fun weekends. I just wish he‚Äôd realize that stuff isn‚Äôt magically going to get better and he isn‚Äôt a baby anymore. I‚Äôll always help him but won‚Äôt support stupid possibly life threatening decisions. Am I The Asshole?

"AITA for contacting someone who blocked me Now I know the title sounds bad but hear me out. Me and one of my ex-friends got into a friendship ending fight. I am not going to specify our ages but we are both in high school. Over our fall break they posted very insensitive things on their snap story which unset my bestfriend of 7 years. We both slid up on their story and confronted them about the things, and something important to note about them is that they are a very stubborn and argumentative person who doesn't change their opinions and views very often. We went back and forth arguing for about 1 1/2 hours, and during the argument I was screenshoting everything as well. After the very long argument they ended up blocking the both of us, which I assumed would be the end of us interacting. Since I was screenshoting everything I sent it to 2 of my other friends, which important to note the 3 of us were in a friend group with them as well. When I sent the screenshots both of them took my side and agreed that they were put of line, they didn't block them but pretty much stopped talking to them. 

Fast forward 1 to 2 weeks when I just figured this situation would be over just figured this situation would blow over. But then out of no where one of their friends decided to message me telling me to stop starting shit with them and that I am only making their life, reputation, and mental health works. I proceeded to explain what actually happened and they seemed to believe me and I thought it was over AGAIN. 

Then fast forward another week where another one of their friends messages me and this time they are way more aggressive about it. They went through the same spiel that the other person did as well but they also added on some more comments. The comments consisted of  ""Don't make me have to deal with you"", ""You're pathetic"", and ""You're a social reject"". The more insult comments didn't really do much but when they threatened me say they were going to ""Deal with me"" that concerned me since they have a history of being an aggressive person.

This is when I ask my friend to let me use his phone so I can contact the person who blocked me so I can tell them to fuck off and leave me alone. This led to another argument between us so I just needed to hand back his phone to him and just get a break from this and just end it.

Of course it wasnt over and the very next day after me and my friends were coming up from lunch there was a group of 4 people waiting for me (the person who blocked me wasn't one of them) and one of them came up to me and grabbed my shoulder. I was starting to freak the fuck out in my head and almost had a panic attack because I thought I was about to get the shit beat out of me. And I truly think I would've if there wasn't 3 teachers within 30 feet and my friend who stepped in the way to separate us.

I was very reluctant at first, because (1) I didn't feel it was appropriate to be taking a beach vacation during a pandemic and (2) I am not the beach/tropical/sun-bathing type. However, since he really wanted me to go with him (and wanting to make him happy), both of us being vaccinated, and the safety restrictions being strict, I agreed to go.

As to his friend Dan, my bf spends a lot time with him. The thing is, when my boyfriend finishes talking to him on the phone or when he comes home after hanging out, he complains about Dan nearly every time (about the stupid things he says, how they only do the things Dan wants etc.). I have no issue when my bf talks to me about his problems (that's part of being in a relationship). However, I *do* have a problem if it's constant bickering (he also talks to me about his problems at work, which is nearly a daily occurence).

So back to the argument: My boyfriend came home after hanging out with Dan, and sure enough, he started complaining. I got very irritated and told him he should stop being friends with him if he's just going to complain. He kept on going. Knowing that he will call Dan during vacation, and not wanting to deal with this BS, I told him to break off all contact with him while on vacation, or he can go by himself. My bf then accused me of being jealous, which completely pissed me off (considering that I have no problem with him spending so much time with Dan, or when he looks at other guys in public and telling me how attractive he finds them (among other things), I don't think you can call me the jealous type). I tried to explain to him that my issue is the constant complaining, not the fact the he hangs out with Dan so much.  I didn't want my vacation ruined because of his bickering. Besides, it was only for the duration of the vacation, not permanent.

Once he realized I was dead serious, he tried to find a compromise by promising me to only talk to Dan when I'm not around. Knowing that he can't keep quiet when something bothers him, I refused the offer. We eventually agreed that he is only allowed to text Dan (no voice messages). My bf still didn't think it was fair and Dan was pissed and thought I had no right to interfere in their friendship. So AITA?

I also want to point out that we have been together several years and our relationship is very strong. We very much enjoy each other's company, but also allow each to do his own thing.",0.67
"AITA For Moving Now That My Son No Longer Wants To Live With Me? Throwaway Account

I (37f) share a son ""Tommy"" (13m) with my ex ""John"" (37m). We split up when Tommy was a toddler so he lived full-time with me and then it was 50/50 when he around 8. During my first year of marriage John received a job offer back in his home state, we live in the USA Midwest, and I initially didn't want to go but John eventually wore me down. I never really liked where we lived and would often talk to John about possibly moving again, but since we were in his home state and he had family here John never wanted to discuss it.

When we were in the middle of a divorce the idea of me and Tommy moving away was brought up and John freaked out, saying that I had no right to take away his son and I was hounded by his side of the family. Tommy is literally the only reason why I still lived where I did and I have always hated the weather and missed my friends. Before the pandemic Tommy approached me about living with his dad full-time and when I asked him why and he assured me that it wasn't anything about me or where we were living just that at his dad's place he had more room.

John made more money than me and lived in a four-bedroom house while I had a two-bedroom townhouse. I won't lie and say that I was a little sad at the idea of seeing my son less but I wasn't going to stop him if he wanted to go. It was agreed that Tommy would spend a weekend a month, Spring Break and Summers with me while John and I alternated Holidays.

A while back an old friend reached out and it was great reconnecting. It wasn't long until we found out that we worked for the same company (it's a nation wide firm that has multiple offices across the country), and my friend offered to give me a recommendation for a new position that I was trying to apply for. I was grateful and sad that I didn't get the job but a week later I was surprised when the firm offered me another position that paid more money and offered more benefits. It was also back in my home state so I would get to be near my family again. I immediately said ""Yes"" and when Tommy came to visit me I told him about the job and asked him if there was anything he wanted to keep while the rest of his stuff would just come with me.

Tommy asked why I would want to move and aside from the money, I told him that I never really liked living here and was always planning on leaving once he turned 18 and graduated high school. Tommy seemed to take the news well but his dad called me furious and said I was manipulative because our son now thinks that I'm ""punishing"" him for wanting to live with his father full-time. AITA?  


Edit to add: Sorry had to step away for a bit but after seeing some comment and messages I wanted to clear up a few things

1. John and I were married when we moved to the Midwest. 
2. I never tried to move with Tommy; I just brought this up as a possibility during the divorce.
3. After the divorce I focused mostly on Tommy so I never had another relationship after the divorce so there's no S.O.. 
4. I haven't formally accepted the position yet and have until the end of the week to do so.
5. If I do accept the position I wouldn't leave until around the end of March because I'm assisting with a project.
6. On paper I still have 50/50 custody and the visitation arrangement is just a verbal agreement John and I have because we didn't want to have to pay for lawyers. 
7. The current visitation is set up the way it is mostly because John and I sat down together and asked Tommy what he wanted. 
8. Tommy has been living full-time with his dad for a little over a year now.
9.  If/When I move of course I would still have contact with my son. I don't know where people are getting that I would stop talking to him just because I live in another state.
10. I know everyone's situation is different but John and I don't have the type of Co-Parenting relationship where either one of us can just stop by so the ""dinner every night"" isn't a thing.",0.33
"AITA for yelling at my friend in public because he was being insensitive? So recently me (f17) and three friends went out to lunch and to hang out for the day. During our lunch one of the guys asked a question about how my medical conditions affect me in terms of school. I explained to him in simple terms about things like chronic fatigue, pain and mobility and balance issues. I also explained I could get into college on lower grades than able bodied people because of my frequent absence and difficulties. The conversation changed to something else and I thought that was the end of it. Then my other male friend who we'll call Jake for this made a really insensitive comment. His exact words were ""oh so your chronic illness means you get to get into college easier than the rest of us, and you get better accommodation, damn I wish I was sick"" then he started laughing and seemed surprised when nobody else did. I saw red and didn't even think about where I was I went off ""I LITERALLY JUST EXPLAINED HOW MUCH PAIN I'M IN DAILY JAKE! YOUR ACTUALLY SO FUCKING STUPID!"" I realized how loud I was and lowered my voice ""you think it's funny you being an uneducated little shit who wants life given to him easy, because it's not your pathetic either educate yourself or stay away from me"" he starts saying how it was ""just a joke"" and he didn't know ""what my problem was"" my other friends suggested to him that he may have crossed a line but they didn't want to get involved beyond that. I left early and went to a Cafe for a while to cool off.
I hate that he said that to me, it really pissed me off but I also feel bad for yelling at him inside a restaurant in public and I also embarrassed my other friends.

"WIBTA if I told my girlfriend to stop posting about the kids she nannies? My [26M] girlfriend [24F] recently took a job as a live-in nanny. She is having a great time with the kids and gets along very nicely with the family she moved in with and I‚Äôm really excited for her that she found a job she loves doing. However, I‚Äôve noticed she tends to post about what she is doing with the kids very frequently on social media to the point it‚Äôs starting to weird me out and frankly is a little bit obnoxious. She‚Äôs been working for close to 4 months and I‚Äôd guess about 75% of her Snapchat stories involve the kids in some capacity, more than a handful of Instagram posts, and I think she‚Äôs even made a tik tok or two (I don‚Äôt have tik tok so I‚Äôm not too certain but she has showed me something about them on tik tok).

I‚Äôve held my tongue since I thought she was just excited to share with people what she‚Äôs up to in her life and the kids are a big part of that now, but the frequency of the posts has not slowed down in the slightest. I wouldn‚Äôt care if she only sent them directly to me/others (which she does do) but it‚Äôs the fact it‚Äôs not even her own kids that she‚Äôs showing off to the public that makes me think it‚Äôs really strange. I‚Äôve never explicitly told her what I think about it but I‚Äôve asked why she posts them and she says it‚Äôs because ‚Äúthey‚Äôre just too cute‚Äù. She‚Äôs also said to me that she‚Äôs received a couple DM‚Äôs from people asking if they‚Äôre hers so I‚Äôm definitely not the only one noticing it. She‚Äôs had nanny jobs in the past but she‚Äôs never publicly posted anything about the other families to this degree before, it‚Äôs just this new family. 

I don‚Äôt know if telling her to cut it out or at least tone it down would be an AH move, since it seems like she thinks it‚Äôs completely harmless and normal what she‚Äôs doing, and it could just be me. WIBTA?

Sidenote: the mother/father of the kids do follow her on Instagram so they are aware she puts them on there, but I‚Äôm not sure their personal opinion on the frequency of posts.

TL:DR; Gf is a live-in nanny and makes social media posts about the kids on a common basis. I think it‚Äôs weird/annoying because the kids aren‚Äôt hers and she seems to be using them for clout and I don‚Äôt know whether to tell her my opinion on it or not.",0.83
"AITA for claiming my dad was trying to get out of chores? TLDR My father‚Äôs attempts to get out of doing the dishes was falling on my head so I threw him under the bus. I‚Äôm 16M, dad is 38M, mom is 42F. 

Dad hates doing dishes. It‚Äôs not a secret, and I‚Äôm only half angry at him. Mom is anal retentive down to how she wants the Tupperware stored and I struggle sometimes too, especially when I put dishes in the sink overnight to soak. But her basic rules are large on bottom, small on top, for Tupperware and pans and pots. Like Russian nesting dolls. Dad has decided that a perfect way to get out of *all* dishes, not just pots and pans (he‚Äôs already gotten a pass because his ‚Äúbad back‚Äù doesn‚Äôt let him bend to put the dishes away, so it falls to me) is to act like he‚Äôs fucking stupid. So he‚Äôll toss a bottom in without its lid to the Tupperware storage, or a lid without its base. Or he‚Äôll stack the mini single egg fry pan underneath the giant copper square pan, and every other pan that goes inside that pan, and act confused why me or mom is up in arms about having to rearrange several pounds of pans just to get at the pan we need. 

It came to a head when mom and I made banana bread together and *every* item we needed was out of order. The big mixing bowl? The bread pan? The ceramic baking dish? All out of order. Even down to the fucking measuring cups. 

Mom‚Äôs working a lot so she‚Äôs not in the kitchen as much as she was last year (she‚Äôs healthcare) and I have restrictions dad can‚Äôt deal with (vegan and nut free) so he basically cooks for them not me. Today was the first time in months Mum‚Äôs been in the kitchen and it resulted in her blowing up on dad. Dad turned it on me, saying that I cook just as much, which means I put things away too as much, and when I pointed out he doesn‚Äôt follow her rule about big to small and cooks 3x as much as I do (he cooks breakfast and lunch for himself and mom sometimes, I pack usually skip both or occasionally lunch on weekends) he said I do worse because I let things soak overnight versus just cleaning them up. She came out of the bedroom and yelled at us both (dad+me) for making a mess of things and ruining her kitchen. I repeated about dad‚Äôs shitty putting things away habits and she turned on him and ignored me. Dad said I was selfish for manipulating my mom. Did I mess this up?",0.01
"AITA for implying my friend should let their cat die? I know the title sounds awful but hear me out.

I had a friend that got out of a bad relationship and had no money and nowhere to stay, so I allowed them to move in and paid for things like groceries and utilities as well as them having no rent.

About 4 months into this arrangement their cat who was already old and in poor health needed emergency vet care in an after hours hospital. I was asked to loan them money for the stay and the medicine which I did.

A day later I get a call from them asking if I can loan them $5,000 for a surgery that we later found out only had a 50% chance of working. I asked my friend realistically how long them thought he would make it after the surgery and they became irate and hung up on me. While I admit I could have been more sensitive my point was that I knew they couldn't afford to take on this amount of debt especially for a cat that likely wouldn't have lived much longer anyway.

That night they moved out stating that they wanted to be living somewhere were stone would always be home since their mental state was poor. A few weeks later I messaged them asking if they still wanted a piece of furniture I had told them they could have. They replied with a several paragraph message about how they didn't want to be friends with me anymore or even talk about what had happened.

"AITA for ""helping"" my (17F) sister (6F) control her food intake? My sister is six years old and 49.6 inches tall and weighs 77 lb (obese?). She came up to me asking me to help her lose weight. I said sure. I am looking into whether the kids are teasing her at school (she says they don't, and her teacher says they don't).

What I planned for her is no food after 7 pm(she eats A LOT after), HEALTHY snacks 2-4 times a day, little/normal amount of candy, a reasonable amount of food for breakfast, lunch and dinner and of course some physical activities/cardio for kids. 

She usually eats enough breakfast, lunch, and dinner for 1-2 adults. She would have up to 3 plates sometimes and eat party-sized candy (chips, gummies and chocolate). She eats until her stomach hurts.

My family and the people surrounding us are mostly in the healthy range and active.

I think I could be an AH because she is starting to act nervous and lie to me. Also, because my family tells me, I am an AH. I can't always tell if I am being too honest and/or mean, and I am usually told I am not a tenderhearted person. 

I am afraid what I'm doing is making it worse for her. My family is not giving her enough attention rn, and my family is just not so stable at the moment. She feels awful every time I tell her she had enough food/candy (she makes sure to express that), and she feels like she fails every time she ends up eating too much, I'm sure.

It's been a week or so. I plan to stop because family continues to call me an AH and give her snackes whenever (chips, gummies and chocolate....), and she continues to resist. She would now eat what I prepare for her and feel the frustration and then have what she would usually eat when I'm not around. I am stopping, however, I would still like to know if I am the asshole for perhaps making her feel too self-conscious at such an age.",0.55

"AITA for telling my nurse friend if she is done bragplaining about making $155 being a travel nurse? I have a friend call her Lisie. In the past two years, Lisie has really gotten rich, she worked before as a nurse in our city hospital, I think before she used to make $38 an hour, and was also eligible for Overtime so she made good money. But ever since the pandemic, she has been able to do really crazy travel nurse contracts where her hourly is in the 150+ and she gets these living stipeneds too. She has bought a brand new model S, goes on vacation like every other weekend.  


We are all happy for her, but recently when we were hanging out she was just bragging but acting as if  it was complaining. She is on some contract where its 36 hour weeks (3 12 hour shifts) but on top of that is eligible for OT on that too. She starts complaining that her taxes are so high and that its messed up, and that she has to purchase health insurance since she isn't employed. And she says that nurses are so under appreciated in this country. That the government should cut taxes for the countries heroes...   


I got really annoyed like some of us are barely making rent, and she is complaining that her life is so hard making all this money. And also all this Overtime and all is completely optional too. So I was like Lisie, you are such a hero, I am sorry the government only gives you a $150 an hour... they should give you at least $1000 and a bonus for each Tik Tok you make.   


She got so angry at that, one of my friends started laughing. Says that she was just sharing her frustrations, and that I am jealous. I am like read the room we are poor here. She is angry with me, but I think because some of our other friends sort of agreed with me she didn't get angrier with me.",0.75
"AITA by telling my friend he irritates me sometimes? I was not sure how to word the title, just bear with me for this.

I've been friends with this guy and a handful of other people in our friend group for 6-7 months now. In that time span I haven't had any problems with him.

Recently (we'll refer to him as Sho), he's been getting on my nerves. The group of friends Sho and I are in use tone indicators, as it really helps with tone over text. Sho doesn't particularly use ton indicators and it can be a bit confusing sometimes.

I admitted in the group chat that he sometimes irritates me, but not saying I disliked him. Though I've expressed this, and have only gotten irritated a few times, it's hard to tell if he actually takes it seriously. In this specific instance, Sho, me, and another friend were talking currency in our countries. I asked if my other friend could roughly translate the yearly salary of a monthly pay to my currency. Sho sent the message: ""Math OP"" with no tone indicator.

Admittedly I got a bit more irritated at this than I probably should have. I'm american, and though I joke about it, my friends from other countries make them more often than I do. Because of this, I replied: ""I'm just asking the conversion, it feels like you think I'm stupid because I'm american /srs (serious).""

Sho is Canadian, and already being irritated I got more upset by his next message. ""im literally american OP"" ""Sho you're canadian"" ""why would i think you're stupid for being america | nawwww don't even! are you trying to say u know more about where im from than MYSELF?""

This is where I might be the asshole. I didn't his tone, so I said, ""look Sho i know you're younger and your humor is different but im not happy, nor am i joking right now. it bugs me you might not be taking this seriously."" Another one of my friends said bringing age into the argument was a shit move on my part. I thought I made it clear what upset me, but Sho didn't know.

I gave up and admitted it because at that point I've had trouble with knowing when to stop talking. Some of my friends asked if i just, didn't get along with him, but i had little problems. A third friend, also expressed they feel guilty and don't want to make Sho upset, but they also have been getting a bit irritated at him as well. It gets a lot more complicated further along.

I believe Sho was trying to make light or make a joke of the situation, saying ""I got a hate club on me hello! Love my hater and fans <3."" I said I never hated nor disliked him, I just sometimes got irritated in some situations. It feels like he just didn't want to deal with it or didn't care about what was happening, as his messages were, summed up, felt like he wanted me to admit if I disliked him or not. Afterward, he just said, ""this is boring, im gonna go draw.""

That's the best I can put it into words as someone not very good at writing down situations. Please reddit, AITA? Any advice would help; even criticism.

"AITA for yelling at my brother for not walking my dog? I (20F) recently moved into an apartment with my mother (covid long-hauler) and a few of my siblings to help my mom out with rent. My mother and I are the only ones that pay rent. I have a dog and work 2 jobs. My agreement to moving into the apartment and helping out with rent was that my brother at least walk my dog in the mornings and sometimes afternoon if i‚Äôm not home. But, if he doesn‚Äôt walk her then he needs to get a job and help with bills. My brother is 19, he does not work or go to school and he does not take care of the house or himself. He sits in his room all day playing video games and doesn‚Äôt even bathe himself. He barely throws out the garbage or helps out with anything at all. He refuses to get a job because ‚Äúhe doesn‚Äôt have to‚Äù. I feel like he is taking advantage of my mothers kindness especially seeing as she is sick and cannot even work during this time. I am working 2 jobs to help out with bills, rent and other things. My brother has not been walking my dog at all recently. My dog sits in the house and has been having accidents because she is not being walked while i‚Äôm gone. Today, I got home and found out at 7:30 PM that she has not been walked all day. My mother asked my brother to please walk my dog. He said ‚ÄúShe just got home, why can‚Äôt she walk her?‚Äù My mother explains that I have just had a long day of work and it would be nice if he could walk her. He refused, saying that she is not his dog or his responsibility. He sits home and does nothing all day, I feel like the bare minimum he can do to help is walk my dog.

"AITA For Blowing Up at Someone Who Promised to Buy Me a PC? So back in December around my birthday one of my friends DM'd he and offered to buy a PC for me as a late Birthday/Christmas gift. As someone who really doesn't have the funds to save up for one I said ""Sure but don't go crazy, I just want something bare minimal to run VR games.""

He said that if I talked to him on the 29th he would take care of it and I thanked him. A few days later he mentioned he had to be tighter with his spendings as he said he was going to run away from his family AND he was going to send cash to his gf in the UK to support her. I said to not worry about it and that the offer alone was more than generous as he offered to get me a monster of a rig.

Then around that time, he gave a total of 1k to two streamers we both knew. I looked past it and moved on. However, a week later, around the 29th, he said he was bored and put a bunch of streamers on a wheel and said whoever it would land on would get spoiled. He gave 500 to the streamer it landed on and then said he felt generous and spoiled everyone on the wheel. Naturally I DM'd him and blew up in his face and asked him whay the fuck happened and if he just blew smoke up my ass.

He tip-toed around the question and said that he intended to buy me the PC, but since I was taking a break from S.M. for my mental health and that I was making a reasonable amount every week (which I only get after working another half week's worth of OT) he put me at the bottom of his priority list. Mind you, he gave more than enough away to the streamers to not only cover the PC he agreeded to purchase, but everything else that would be needed for a complete setup. I quickly tried to defuse the situation by saying we should forget this happened and move on. The next day I wrote an apology saying I was being a jerk and probably overstepped some lines in my spell of anger and said I wasn't worthy of a generous gift. A few days later he blocked me and I haven't heard from him since. 

Note: At the time I was dealing with a lot of shit and mentally I was stretched thin with how much BS I could put up with, so I just wanted a clear ""yes"" or ""no"" answer so I could just move on and try to focus on what's in front of me.

"AITA for showing everyone how little my brother knows about his kids after he's constantly claimed his ex is a terrible mother for ""not knowing anything about the kids""? This happened at new year's but I'm still getting shit for it so here we are.

My brother has 2 kids with his ex wife. Ever since they split he's been constantly saying she's a terrible mother who doesn't know anything about the kids and doesn't deserve any custody of them, but the examples he gives for this seem to me like moments of absent mindedness. Things like her giving a wrong date of birth (she said 8th instead of 18th, then corrected herself), forgetting which kid is in which sporting team, not knowing one of them only eats one flavor of a particular food and buying the wrong flavor.

I know his ex, and from what I've seen she's a great mom. So unless I'm seriously missing something, it seems like my brother is just exaggerating to make her look bad. I've also always had a sneaking suspicion that he doesn't know very much about his kids. His wife had them for new year's and I figured he'd have a lot to say about it, so I found out some info about the kids and when he started claiming his ex knows nothing about the kids and is therefore a terrible mother I quizzed him on his kids. It was pretty simple stuff, favorite toys, teacher's names, allergies, favorite colors, favorite TV shows, what they want to be when they grow up. He didn't do very well. Incidentally, my other brother and sister knew all of that information about their own kids. 

My brother was mad at me then and is still mad at me over 2 weeks later. My parents say I need to apologize for embarrassing him in front of the whole family. I think if he was gonna claim his ex knows nothing about their kids and that makes her a bad mom, he should be prepared to demonstrate that he actually knows things about them.",0.06
"AITA for refusing to pay my friend back for dinner? For context. My three friends and I have known each other for about five years now. I am the only male of the group. The rest of them, for privacy sake we‚Äôll call them A,B, and C are all female aligned. We are all in our early twenties. 

When we go out, be it dinner or movies I‚Äôve been the one paying for everything. At first it was fine since it was only every now and then and they used to pay me back. Now lately they‚Äôve stopped paying me back unless I hound them and it‚Äôs expected of me to pay. A and B usually do their best but I have the most issues with C. C expects me to pay for them every time er get food be it with the others or getting fast food after work. At first I didn‚Äôt mind since we used to switch off but they‚Äôve stopped doing that. 

The last few times we‚Äôve went out it‚Äôs been awkward stares at me until I pull out my card.

"AITA for insisting on a double barrelled name for my future children? Me (27f) and my (29m) boyfriend have been together for a little over a year. Through out my life I have never been sure if I wanted children but meeting my boyfriend made me realise that I would want children with him in the near future.

Some important background information: my boyfriend is British and I‚Äôm from Western Europe. We live in the UK and I moved here 7 years ago. In my culture you traditionally get your middle name from your mother and your last name from your father, but in the UK it doesn‚Äôt work that way and your middle name is kinda like a ‚Äúsecond‚Äù first name. 

We got to the topic of last names and my boyfriend is firm on wanting our possible children to have his last name only whereas I think it‚Äôs more fair to go with a double barrelled name since it represents both of our cultures and it saves the children explaining why their middle name isn‚Äôt a traditional middle name. It is a compromise as I see it. My boyfriend doesn‚Äôt like the idea and the only reason he could give me was that he ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt like the look of double barrelled names‚Äù, that he has been ‚Äúwanting this all his life‚Äù, and how his previous girlfriend was ‚Äúfine with it‚Äù. He also tried to say that because I have said a few negative things about my home country that I must not want anything traditional from that country such as last names.

"AITA for giving my roommates a cat ultimatum? Hi - pet lover here but no pets of my own. I live in a city where renting is tough and expensive and I believe in responsible pet ownership so until I'm stable in my home environs I am opting out of getting a pet. 

I recently moved into a shared space - current occupants are a couple and I'm the third wheel but paying an equal third of rent in a decent size place. When I first met my new roomies, they admitted to feeding a stray kitty and letting her come inside some times to warm up. Bleeding heart/animal lover in me says absolutely NO problem, glad we can help an animal in need. 

Fast forward to me moving in- the cat is becoming more of a fixture in the house and I'm not sure what I think of that... But we get the news that she has a home!!!! Her owner reached out to us and admitted Kitty ran away when they got some puppies and owner has been wondering where she's been getting to. But she's an outdoor cat and owner seems unfussed about where she goes. 

Then Kitty starts peeing on everything in the house. Couch, chair, roommates AND their bed (multiple times). So now I'm not a fan of Kitty but I keep my bedroom door firmly closed. Until the day she sneaks past me on my way to work and winds up locked in my room all day. I come home to a cat piss soaked mattress, bedding, and treasured items. The mattress, at only a year old, is the most expensive item I own and memory foam is hard to clean. 

So I tell roommates this is enough. I don't want the cat to stay in the house anymore. They promise to look into rehoming her and I leave it be for over a month. They are getting real close to the Kitty and I'm beginning to feel like she may stay and I'll have to make a call on how I feel about that... Lucky she hasn't been peeing in the house lately. 

Today: I witness Kitty in our yard spraying a literal STREAM of urine on outdoor furniture. I am so disgusted I decide enough is enough. I'm giving my roommate's the ultimatum: me or the cat. No more dithering or making me wait. 

I understand they have grown close to the cat and also feel like if they bring her to a shelter she will be euthanized. I feel like they can just bring her to her actual home- as many times as it takes for her owner to understand she can't come back in our house. I don't think I signed up for this when I agreed to move into a place that said they occasionally allow a stray in for food/warmth.... But AITA for making them choose between me and the cat??",0.06

"AITA for interrupting my coworker when I asked him a question So I (38f) work with ""Adam"" (50ish m) who just irks my last nerve. I try to keep it as professional as possible at work but last week I kinda lost my sh*t on him. I have absolutely no problem asking for help or if I am doing something wrong at work. So I asked Adam a question (a simple yes or no if I was doing something right). Adam sat back in his chair crossed his arms and answered me with a toddler story. So a toddler story is a story that makes no sense and really doesn't give you any information. It also takes at least 25 minutes to tell you anything. I was slammed and didn't have time for one of his stories and told him all I needed was a yes or no. He then told me that yes I did need to hear what he wanted to say to me. I said no I'd don't. If I ask a simple question all I need is a simple answer. If I ask for a reason behind something then yes tell me why. I turned around and went back to work. He seemed a little miffed but went back to work also. 

So here is why I think I'm the AH. The other day I had another coworker ""Susan"" ask me a question. I wasn't 100% sure on the answer so I asked Adam if my answer to Susan was right. Adam got into his toddler story pose said yes and then proceeded to start in on the ins and outs of why. I interrupted Adam looked at Susan and said there is your answer. I then proceeded to go back to work. 

 Adam got upset with me again and said I'm an asshole and need to apologize. I don't think I am after I had already told him once that I didn't want or need his toddler stories.  So Reddit am I an asshole for interrupting my coworker so I didn't have to listen to yet another toddler story?",0.79
"AITA(25F) for joking around with some kids and ‚Äúhurting‚Äù their feelings? My friend convinced me to go to some vintage clothing store on the other side of our city. After we were done with our shopping we were going to grab some sandwiches nearby when some teenage (maybe middle school?) boys told me my boobs looked like watermelons as we were walking by and snickering. I decided to play along and told one of them he was fat and the other was a pizza face and it was unfortunate that not only were they ugly, but poor, living on this side of town. They called me and my friend bitches and later on my friend said I went too far. AITA? I was just throwing back things their way, I didn‚Äôt mean any real harm, just some fun.",0.47
"AITA: To refuse conv. with my child My 16F child has mental health issues that we are working on identifying and get the right treatment.  One of the things they do is have conversations with me where everything about their body language, tone, words indicates that they think I am at fault in all their childhood 'trauma'.  They will continue to debate/reason with me on why I am and tell me I have NPD and it is clear that the only resolution is for me to admit it is my fault.   I am not going to debate health issues that I may or may not have based on my 16yr old non-medical opinion.  

I have tried to end conversations with them by agreeing to disagree but when that doesn't work, I simply refuse to continue the conversation.  Am I being an asshole for refusing to continue the conversation?

EDIT:I put trauma in quotes as my child hasn't told me the trauma.   Or anything that I have done to cause trauma or hurt them.   Only insisting that I admit it's my fault.  I want to get through this and we are working to get therapy going again for all of us.  I love my child and just want them to be happy and healthy.",0.67
"AITA for telling my dad his wife was not invited to my wedding? Backstory: my mom and dad (we‚Äôll call him Bill) divorced when I was 1 or 2 after Bill turned out to be an AH. 
Fast forward. Bill remarried had two more kids and that wife left him too for the same reason about three years ago. I love the ex wife and my siblings very much and talk to them frequently. 

Fast forward to the present. I am not close to Bill because of the way he has treated me and my siblings over the years also because he is simply an AH. But I am trying to keep him pleased so I was still inviting him to the wedding In attempts to mend our relationship some. Bill recently got married to wife #3 who has a young son. I feel I‚Äôve made it clear I want nothing to do with his new family and the child he chose after he acted like I didn‚Äôt exist. 

Bill got very mad at me recently because I told him my wedding seats were full and that only he would be invited. I would be willing to allow the wife to come to my state (they live out of state) and I would meet her but that she would not be at the wedding. 
Bill blew up at me and said that if I couldn‚Äôt find a seat for her by removing someone I‚Äôve been close to my whole life that they just wouldn‚Äôt come at all. That they would come to my state to see my other sister but would not bother to come see me.

"AITA for accepting a higher paying job without considering my girlfriend? For the past three years, I‚Äôve worked my current job as an engineer. For the last two years, that position has been fully work from home. Around a year ago, I met my girlfriend on an app and we fell crazy in love. She lives about 100 miles from me (1.5 hour drive). Since I work from home and she has a crazy schedule as a nurse, I have spent a large majority of the past year working from her apartment and spending nearly everyday together. 

For context, I bought a home in my city around a year and a half ago, 6 months before I met her. It was a large investment but I knew I wanted to stay in my town. We have been making plans to move in together in the Summer of this year. 

After some frustrations at my current job, I applied for new jobs and last week, I accepted a new job at an 18% pay increase + a security clearance. However, this job is not work from home. I accepted the job knowing I would still be able to see my girlfriend on the weekends and whenever she had days off plus she was moving in to my house just a few months from now. She says I should have considered her before accepting my new position and the impact it would have on our relationship. I told her this was an amazing opportunity in my career and that we would figure things out over the next few months and that I had extreme confidence in our relationship making it. 

Edit 1: She was fully aware of my willingness to leave my current job, my applications to new jobs, and all of my interviews. She wasn‚Äôt in the dark on me getting a new job.

"AITA for not giving any sympathy for my mothers hurt shoulder? For a bit of backstory, my mother recently slipped and fell on the ice this winter after an ice storm, and hurt her arm pretty badly, she says she tore he rotator cuff, but wont go to the hospital to have it checked we don't know. It could even be worse then a torn rotator cuff, like a torn tendon, or just a bad bruise.

My side, why I don't have any sympathy for her: A year ago, I had a severe shoulder injury that left me with a torn pec major, micro tears in my pec minor, peculiars tendonitis, upper trapezius tendonitis, broken AC joint and a long head tendon injury. AKA my right arm was borderline useless. After the injury and before getting it checked, I have to do normal daily activities without my right arm, and having my mother and father repeatedly call me a ""pussy ass"" with ""zero pain tolerance"", and then precede to have me move an entire tree (about 25 feet so not too big) by myself after a storm. 

The next day my arm is frozen and very swollen, so that's a pretty good indication to go to the hospital, where I get a diagnosis. 

So after being put through physical therapy and recovery for months, and still being insulted, I'm still pretty upset. 

I feel like I am the asshole at least partially, because I am now fully recovered, and she is my own mother, and I should respect her and care for her, but I really cant find it in me to have any sympathy.

And on the other side, they are the assholes too, because my mother and father feel like they deserve it, after never having any for me.

I have a good feeling its going to be a partially the asshole, but we will see.",0.1
"AITA for not wanting my mother in law to come over? My husband (23M) just informed me (24F) that his mother will be coming over tomorrow, because she needs a computer to send her welfare applications, and apparently her own doesn't work. I got very upset for this, because our home literally looks like a landfill. Both my husband and I have some mental health issues, and this is the worst our home has ever been. Most of the home is filled with trash, dishes, clothes or other cluttered things, and I feel very ashamed of it, and my husband knows it. I've been meeting with my friends and family members outside or at their houses, because I haven't wanted them to see any of it.

My husband claims that his mother wont mind the mess, but I don't really believe it. He says that my MIL needs to get these applications done, otherwise she won't have enough money to pay her bills. I understand this, but there must have been some other options too! My husband's brother lives only a short walk away from MIL's house, libraries have free computers, and I could've even lent my laptop to them so my husband could've gone to her house instead. 

Now I feel very anxious, ashamed and upset, and I do not understand why my husband didn't even ask my opinion before inviting his mother to our apartment. Am I overreacting to the situation and/or being unreasonable?",0.17
"AITA for confronting my brother‚Äôs girlfriend about something that hurts my feelings? Hi. I‚Äôm going to apologize beforehand for format, as I am on mobile. I (22F) am currently on vacation with my family, which includes my parents, 3 brothers and 2 of their girlfriends. This post is about my brother‚Äôs (18M) girlfriend(18F), Carly. She recently started living with us and I love her a lot. I love having her there to hang out with and I was so excited for her to come on our vacation, because I consider her a very close friend. But since we‚Äôve been here, she‚Äôs been cutting me off or talking over me pretty much every time she hears my mom and I having a conversation. Which is infuriating because A) it‚Äôs rude and B) it really hurts my feelings. And I don‚Äôt mean she cuts me off and then we all keep talking, I mean she cuts me off or talks over me and then cuts me out of the conversation. I‚Äôve noticed this before but not to this extent, and I genuinely feel like this girl is trying to compete with me for my mother‚Äôs affection, which is ridiculous. It also bothers me because I have always wanted a closer relationship with my mom and she‚Äôs just not interested, but this girl who‚Äôs been staying with us for a month has somehow achieved the level of closeness with my mother that I want, and is continually pushing me out of conversations with my family. This seriously had me on the brink of tears for 2 days, and I knew if I didn‚Äôt say anything I‚Äôd cause her more issues.

So today I tried to talk to her about it, over text when they were out of the house for a bit. I don‚Äôt know how to post screenshots otherwise I would, but I was straightforward in my text and told her this was bothering me and why it was bothering me, and that even though she might not realize she‚Äôs doing it it‚Äôs hurting my feelings. She first didn‚Äôt believe that she could be cutting me off or talking over me so she asked me for examples. Then when I gave her the examples off the top of my head, she became angry, denied that it happened and told me she would just ‚Äúkeep her mouth shut‚Äù for the rest of the trip. I told her I wasn‚Äôt asking her to keep her mouth shut but that i was telling her something she was doing was hurting my feelings and to be more mindful, to which she responded ‚Äúok‚Äù and has since stayed true to her word. Every time I walk into the room, or try talking to her, I either get the silent treatment or one word responses, even if she had just been having a conversation with someone else. I really didn‚Äôt want to start anything since we‚Äôre here until Saturday, I just wanted to bring it to her attention instead of letting it simmer and then blowing up on her for it. So, am I the asshole?

TLDR: brothers girlfriend kept cutting me out of conversations with my mother and when I confronted her about it she snapped at me and began giving me the silent treatment. AITA?

Edit: Yes I did it over text. The reason being we‚Äôre staying in a house where there is no privacy, as in the only time I get to myself all day is in the bathroom, so I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to pull her aside or say something without the entire family either overhearing or butting in, which would‚Äôve made it a bigger problem than it needed to be. Which is also why I don‚Äôt snap at her or comment on it when she does it, I didn‚Äôt want to embarrass her or make it a big argument in front of the other 8 people staying here.",0.06
"AITA for being upset at my girlfriend for wasting so much meat I‚Äôve (24M) been dating my girlfriend (22F) for a little over 8 months. As a little background, I became a vegetarian about 3 months ago. My girlfriend, as you may have guessed from the title, eats meat. This hasn‚Äôt been an issue in our relationship since she will order her own plate with meat and I‚Äôll order something without meat when we go out. At home, I do most of the cooking when we‚Äôre together and will cook meals that can be eaten with or without meat and I cook meat alongside it for her.

My girlfriend adamantly won‚Äôt eat most leftovers - instead preferring to buy or cook new food instead. Until recently, when my girlfriend was done with her food, she‚Äôd just give it to me and I‚Äôd eat it. Now that I‚Äôm a vegetarian, I can no longer do this and she just throws her food away.

This weekend was a breaking point. On Friday she surprised me and made dinner for us, and she bought a rotisserie chicken to add meat to her portion. However, after grabbing a few bits of chicken (perhaps a leg‚Äôs worth), she threw the rest away since she ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt need it for anything else‚Äù. Saturday we ordered a pizza and got chicken on the side so she could put it on her pizza, she said the chicken was dry and threw it all away. Sunday she ordered chicken tenders, I suggested she could take the leftovers home and heat them up in the air fryer (she doesn‚Äôt use it, so I thought it could be a new way that could help her enjoy leftovers). The next day when I offered to heat them up, she said to just throw them away because we didn‚Äôt have the condiment she wanted to dip them in. 

Before Sunday, I would just say something along the lines of ‚Äúthrowing x away feels wasteful, which may be passive aggressive. However, Sunday the leftovers sparked a small argument and I said something along the lines of the following:
‚ÄúEating meat hurts the environment and in many cases creates bad situations for animals. I don‚Äôt and never have had a problem with you consuming meat, but wasting it is different. It is painful to watch so much meat be wasted so frequently for arguably superficial reasons‚Äù. 

She said she ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt want the lecture‚Äù. She said my comments were passive-aggressive in the past and didn‚Äôt plan on eating food she didn‚Äôt want. I told her that I didn‚Äôt want her to change her behaviors for me, but that it is painful for me to see so much be wasted. She questioned whether I was directly asking her to change or not, and I said I only want you to alter your behavior if it‚Äôs something you actually want to do. Our conversation basically came to a stalemate here and we just sorta dropped it, but I think we both have a little resentment from the convo.

"AITA for making a rule for when my friends can shit? I wish this didn‚Äôt sound (and quite literally be) a shitpost, as much as I wish this wasn‚Äôt a problem. But my dear friends and I are going to a festival, and since everyone decided to go much closer to the date of the festival when prices are too spicey for the bank account, I‚Äôm the only one with a place for us all. But alas, as I planned this months ago, I got a tiny place incase I needed to afford it on my own, with an even tinier, and more importantly SINGLE, bathroom for us all. 

Now space will already be an issue, but I can deal with that for four days, but the one thing I can‚Äôt deal with is smelling everyone‚Äôs shit. So I said, rule one, no one shits in the place. We‚Äôre literally going to be at the festival for like 14 hours, with a plentitude of restrooms as far as the eye can see, and no wait, and only going back to the Airbnb to sleep, wake up and immediately leave. They‚Äôre acting like this rule is the end of the world, but I know their shits will be the end of mine. I‚Äôm outnumbered male to female, and the amount of gas and shit they hold has turned me religious as only God can explain how it‚Äôs physically possible, and I‚ÄôM lactose intolerant. Plus they think shits and farts are funny, and they are, when they don‚Äôt make my mascara run.

I told the boys, and got the expected, ‚ÄúIm gonna NEED to shit during the single hour that we will be awake in the Airbnb‚Äù, and you KNOW it‚Äôs going to be in the morning right before we leave and take forever. Why can‚Äôt we all relieve ourselves at the festival? It‚Äôll save us time, spare the Airbnb damage fee, and we can all shit at the same time and not waste precious festival time. I could understand if we were going to be in the Airbnb for a decent amount of time, but it‚Äôs small and we really won‚Äôt spend more than an hour awake there.

"AITA for telling my wife's family our secret? I (28M) have been with my wife, Rebecca, (29F) for four years. Rebecca comes from a very religious family and we have hidden a lot of aspects about our marriage. We have some contact with them and only see them on holidays and special occasions, like weddings or baby showers. One of the biggest things they disapprove of was not having our wedding in a church, it was such a big deal that we now hide aspects of our marriage, like the fact we are going to be childfree

One thing the family does not know about is that Rebecca and I have an open marriage and have had an open relationship ever since we started dating. So I was meeting up with another girl at the bar a few days ago. It was going well and I didn‚Äôt notice anything strange. Well, today we went to Rebecca‚Äôs sister‚Äôs ‚Äúbaby shower‚Äù ( the large baby shower was canceled since the plague so it really was dinner with her family). We get there and everyone is glaring daggers at me. The whole thing is tense until we get to a slideshow on her sister showing pictures of the nursery and other baby stuff. In the slide show, there was a picture of me with the girl at the bar. It wasn‚Äôt an innocent picture and looking at it everyone would think I was cheating. 

The whole family starts yelling at me and calling me a cheater and how dare I do this to Rebecca. I look at Rebecca for help but she just stays quiet. I try to get them to calm down but nothing is working. So I just yell out Rebecca and I have an open marriage. This causes everyone to start freaking out even more and we quickly leave.

I‚Äôm in the car with Rebecca and she starts to yell at me about how could I tell her family that.

"AITA for saying the house wouldn't function without me? Throwaway account because I know my dad browses this sub. 

I (24m) still live at home, I'm completely fine with this arrangement and so are my parents. The rent is cheaper then any nice place I could find in my city and my parents and I get along great. Their work schedules are very hectic and can lead to one or both of them often being out of the house from 8am-10pm. My work hours are more lenient so I manage a lot of the housework, grocery shopping, cooking, and appointments that the animals may have. This is not to say that my parents don't do anything or that I hate doing this, in general it's enjoyable to cook and do house work to me. I also think that my parents deserve to not have to come home to a messy house after how hard they work. 

Yesterday my Aunt, uncle, and cousins were over and I was talking to my aunt. She was asking about my life and what my plans were and then she asked me when I was going to move out. I told her I didn't plan on it anytime soon since I liked living at home and also jokingly said something along the lines of ""the house wouldn't be able to function without me anyways"". My mum asked me what I meant and I said that a lot of the housework and cooking wouldn't get done, or done at reasonable time, if I wasn't living at home. She said that she and my dad are perfectly capable of caring for their house and that I shouldn't be rude. My aunt said that she thinks I was just joking but my mum was still pretty upset by it. 

She hasn't talked to me yet today despite it being her day off. I'm planning on apologizing because what I said seemed to really upset her. I think she assumed I think of her as a bad mum and wife because of my statement. I think both of my parents are great people and I know they worked hard to give me what I'm able to have now. I'm wondering if what I said was really out of line. I do think it's true that my parents would struggle with managing a lot of the housework, on top of their work, without me but should I have just not said what it?",0.11
"AITA for not Giving My Son Rare Pokemon My 6-year old son and I (30M) are both into video games. We love to play together. He's adorable and very competitive when he plays with me. When we play PvP games, he cries when I beat him. When we play RPGs, he gets sad if my character is a higher level, stronger, or further along in the story than his character. To address this, I go easy on him when we play, congratulate him when he wins, and make sure to keep my characters weaker than his. Well, most of the time....

One of the games we play together is called Blockman Go: Trainer's Arena. It's a Pokemon rip-off game developed using Minecraft mods. Most of the childish games we play are inconsequential, but this one is awesome, and I'm quite invested in it. I've lost quite a bit of sleep training up my team while my wife and child are asleep. I'm proud of the progress I've made and the Pokemon team I've built. Unfortunately, my Pokemon are far stronger than my sons.

The game is very challenging. If you don't have top-tier Pokemon in your roster, it is very difficult to progress in the story. Pokemon are mostly obtained through random draws. The strongest ""Legendary"" tier pets are highly sought after, and very hard to come by.

The other day, my son and I were playing together and he saw me capture a legendary Pokemon, which was an exciting moment for me. The moment I succeeded capturing it, he begged me to give the pet to him (which is something you can do). When I refused, and he started to cry. He felt like I was valuing the game over his feelings.

My son adores me, and imitates practically everything I say and do. This competition he has is likely an expression of his adoration, and reflects his desire to be stronger than his Dad. I want to foster this desire, because I want him to be confident and strive for growth. Moreover, I want to make sure he knows that I love him and his mother more than anything else in the world (certainly more than a dumb video game). At the same time, I'm invested in this game (too invested?). Moreover, I don't want to foster entitlement in him. He shouldn't expect his father to give him whatever he wants.

What should I do? Thanks in advance for the advice!

EDIT 1: I'm asking if it's wrong of me to not give him the Pokemon. Am I being mean to my son by refusing to give the Pokemon to him, or is this okay parenting-wise? Sorry if this post was unclear.

EDIT 2: Wow! Thanks so much for all the helpful suggestions guys! I've decided to not trade my son the legendary, but instead I'm helping him catch his own by trading him helpful items and teaching him how to progress. Also, I realize now that this subreddit is more geared toward determining guilty parties in an argument. Had I known about the parenting subreddits, I would have posted my question there instead. To be clear: I do not blame my son in any way, nor would I ever want anyone to judge him as an asshole in this situation.

"AITA for asking my son how to disburse my estate I (52M) am having a heart procedure done soon and my mortality is weighing on me.  I had dinner with my oldest child (21M) tonight and told him I was thinking about leaving him a little less than his stepbrothers (2 boys 17 and 19) and adopted brother (19) because his mom (we've been divorced for several years) and grandma had a lot of money and he'd never want for anything, whereas the other 3 boys, I was the only provider.  
He got very upset and told his mom that he felt diminished because I wouldn't leave as much to him.

"AITA for not calling my Mom when my Grandma died? As always for this sub, please read before judging, I know the title sucks.

So my Grandma passed away on the 7th January but I was not close to her at all unfortunately, my Grandparents lived in a different country to myself growing up and so we were never too close. My Mom was also not particularly close with my Grandma (her Mom) but none-the-less losing a family member, particular a parent is never easy.

When I initially found out myself from my Dad, I said to him that I was going to come home (I am in a LDR with my GF and I was at her place) to make sure that my Mom was okay, to which my Dad said that there wasn't too much point as there wasn't anything I could do and that he would make sure that my Mom was okay so I left it at that. My Dad also informed me that my Mom was flying to see my Grandpa and of course help organise the house and help to get rid of some of my Grandma's stuff. My Dad also flew out on a seperate day.

We have a family group chat and so when clearing out the house, both my Mom/ Dad were posting old photos that they had found of them (when they were younger), me, my sister and my Grandparents to which I was responding saying how lovely the photos were and that they were really lovely to see.

I spoke to my Dad throughout the week and every time I got on the phone with him I asked how my Mom was and how my Grandpa was too. The reason why I called my Dad often was due to the fact that when I was at College or they were on holiday or even out and about, my Mom is terrible at answering the phone so I call my Dad and then I will speak to my Mom (my Dad will pass her the phone) but all in all, I rarely call my Mom regardless of this situation because 9/10 she is with my Dad and I speak to her then.

The problem is, I never directly called my Mom or spoke to her throughout the week. The reason why I never thought to call her was because I assumed that she was incredibly busy helping my Granpda organise stuff and that when I spoke to my Dad, he reassured me each time that my Mom was okay and never at any point did he hint that maybe I should directly call my Mom.

I sent my Mom a paragraph that I had written for my Grandma's funeral to which she replied saying that it was lovely. I then said that I was thinking of her and that I loved her, she responded and said that she loved me too.

I posted on the family group chat on the day of my Grandma's funeral that I was thinking of my Mom and that I love her.

I have then seen her in person today for the first time since my Grandma's passing and she is very upset at me and said that I clearly do not care about her. Asking me why I didn't bother to directly phone her. I told her my reasons and that I felt that if she wanted to speak to me that she would phone me, I then apologised and it was clearly and oversight from me but I truly did care and that I checked in with my Dad to make sure that she was okay nearly every day.

WIBTA OR AITA? Roommate problems [deleted],0.06
"AITA for not giving the house to a relative who basically rented it till it's paid off? I got the house a while back when it was just $200k. It is now worth $450,000. 15 year mortgage. It is now paid off. Basically my relative did not have the money nor the credit to get the house 15 years ago. So I basically put my name on the mortgage for them. I also put the down payment, roughly spent about $30k closing cost. 

Now his wife have the money and they say they they can pay me that $30k back and that I should  because they basically paid it off. He said they'd give me twice the money I paid, so $60k.

I don't particularly like him. He is lazy and always leeching off of his wife. He never had a steady job and my sister in law paid most of the rent if not all. Even though he is already almost 50 he is still addicted to just sitting down and playing on computer or Xbox. For the past 18 years I have met him he was never able to hold a job for a year all he wanna do is smoke MJ all day because he said it calms him down, makes him relax and happy, or whatever excuse he wanted to make. I have nothing against this as I smoke too but I always have a steady job.

Honestly if he is a responsible, hard working guy or if he is out of the picture I would have probably given the house to my sister in law who is nice and sweet and the sole reason why I did the favor, but because he is in the picture, I won't give the house. That's the only reason why I won't give the house to them, it's because of him. I don't like him. Btw, his wife is fine, she said she can get another house. 

FYI. My sis in law is also upset that I won't give it to them because she had to hear it from him 24/7, but that's the only reason why she's upset. She said she never expected me to give them the house since the beginning. But she loves him, so I am torn.

AITA for refusing to give them the house just because of his existence?

EDIT: Thank you everyone for your feedbacks. It did gave me some realizations. I truly dislike him, so what I have decided to do instead is make a Will and Testament that when I die my house will be sold and will be divided : 
20% will go to my SIL,
20% will go to my SIL first son,
20% will go to my SIL second son, 
20% will go to my niece, 
20% will go to my nephew. 

But him personally, nothing for him, even over my dead body. ITA till I die bishes.

EDIT 2:
To place things in perspective, I bought the house at 24 years old after cashing out my 401k and a portion of my inheritance from my stepdad. He was 34 year old at the time. I did pay for the repairs myself as at the time the property did not have enough equity yet to be used. The repairs came from me taking out 401k loans and cashing out my health savings account and a HELOC on my inherited home so I am not rich, I am just lucky. I have a house from my step father so getting the house did not hinder me from getting a house of my own since I already have one.",0.5
"AITA for not responding to my first name? I'm on mobile and tired after work so beware of bad writing. 
(Background)
My parents named me (22F) after my dad's favorite star and it's a common one as well. All my school life I was surrounded by people in my classes with the same name as me ,so I had to be called by my first and last name because my last name is further down the alphabet. Even then,my first name was either misspelled or misheard because I had/have a bad lisp and my first name has a nice long sssssssssss in it while my last name has none. 

 Whole point is that my first name has bothered me. Once I started working and learned I can CHOOSE what I can be called,I went by my last name. I love my last name because it's unique,but not hard to spell if you're not stupid. Its also known in my town because my dad worked around a lot and has a lot of connections,which has landed me my current job at a retail store. 

(The problem)

I have a team lead who is a nice dude and is usual decent to work with when he's not stressed. He's known me by my last name and has even worked with my dad,however He recently has found out my first name and has now started calling me that. He knows my issue with my first name since I've told it in the orientation as a 'get to know me' thing.

We also have a person at my store who has the same first name as me and I sometimes get confused on who he is talking to or calling in the overhead for  when he calls us by the same name. I've recently decided to not answer to my first name anymore. My badge says my last name,I go by my last name and I will now only answer to my last name. 

So far I've ignore him 5 times and he's starting to look a more annoyed each time. It seemed funny to me until my coworker said that I was being a dick for not answering him since he is my higher up and he's already stressed out because of all the work we're being swamped with ,so now I'm just kind unsure.
 8 times out of 10 I know he's talking to me because the other person works in a different department so it's only occasionally the confusion happens.

"AITA for sending out an email thread to 77 people? For context-

Me and my friends one day had this dumb idea. Yearbook without the ""y"" is earbook. What if we made an ""earbook"" with pictures of people's ears instead of faces? We made a google doc sent it to the whole class, and asked people for ear submissions. 

A couple of days ago, my friend sent out an email to everyone saying that we were going to have a competition for the ears (coolest earring, most unique ear, etc)  Well, this caused a huge problem. This email was sent to 77 people. A few  people replied with ""This is stupid."" ""why though"" ""this is the dumbest idea i've ever heard of"". Some people sent in submissions. About half the people didn't reply. This thread got over 100 emails. People started getting very mad. Most of the emails were from people who were saying stupid things about how they hated our idea and other people arguing with them. Me and my friends barely sent any emails. We were all just trying to troubleshoot everything.

We asked people who didn't want to participate to email us so we could remove them and they could stop emailing us.

Today someone told a teacher and me and my friends had to talk to 3 different teachers after school. We don't think we are in the wrong. We tried to include everyone, made sure to ask for permission before taking ear photos,  and removed people who didn't want to participate. The teachers still got mad at US.

"AITA for being upset with my brother for having his one night stand around my kids? Recently my wife had a huge medical scare. I drove her to the hospital and called my brother in a panic to pick up our children and look after them (8F & 6M twins)-- school was about to let out when the emergency occurred.

We spent about 14 hours in the hospital and got home in the middle of the night. My wife is now okay. The next morning, my daughter kept asking my brother questions about his 'friend'. My brother told me he was at someone's house when I called and not within quick public transportation of the school, so this man drove him to my kids' school and took them back to my house. When I pushed a little he said this was someone he knows from Grindr. He is quite a lot younger and still living that early 20s promiscuous lifestyle. I can sort of understand the car ride even if it makes me very uncomfortable that a stranger was driving my kids around. What I cannot get over is that apparently the guy stayed at our house for half an hour, making the kids a snack and putting on a movie for them while my brother was calling all of our family members and sorting out logistical things for us.

I don't like the idea of a complete stranger around my kids, especially during such a terrifying moment. My brother has apologized and said that he was in a panic, that the guy is a kindergarten teacher, and that he didn't think things through because he was so distressed about my wife and was just desperate trying to look after my kids and not frighten them while also dealing with the practical side. I understand, but I want to impress upon him how unsafe it is to bring some random person around a bunch of small children without knowing anything about him. But my wife thinks I'm being an asshole for making a fuss about it at all, and that I should just thank him for dropping everything and being there for us. The whole argument got sparked up again today since apparently the guy messaged my brother saying he hoped our family was alright and he felt the need to pass that on. Now my sister called to yell at me because my brother called her crying.

Usually when my wife and my sister both agree that I'm the asshole, they're right. I can't bring myself to apologize for putting my children's safety first, but I realize that sometimes our parental instincts make us unreasonable. AITA?

**edit**: I called to apologize to my brother. We had a good talk. He said that his feelings were a bit hurt but he totally understands why I was upset, because a lot of the men he meets on Grindr are not people he would want to have around my kids-- but I told him that's exactly why I should have trusted him, because he cares about my kids and has good judgment and wouldn't have brought anyone unsafe over. I guess him and his friend had met on Friday night and spent the whole weekend together (apparently Monday was a pro-d day in the friend's school district?) and he felt like he knew him well enough at that point to lean on him when he was hysterical with worry about my wife, who's been a part of his life since he was 11. I asked if there was any chance of them seeing each other again, because my kids liked him and he's clearly an upstanding man and I would like to thank him in person, and he just laughed and said he wasn't going to be 'monogamous and boring' at his age. (I reminded him that I met my wife at his age, and he said 'exactly'.)

In the past I might have tried to talk about the joys of a serious relationship, but I did absorb the comments calling me a prudish judgmental asshole, so instead I told him that all I care about is him being happy, whatever form that takes. And I thanked him profusely for being there for us in that moment, and told him what a weight off my mind it was to know my kids were safe with their uncle. I think it was a good conversation, and I would have gone about it all wrong if it weren't for everyone telling me that I was completely out of line.

I should also apologize for the title of my post. I was trying to outline the parts of the situation that made me uncomfortable-- that it was someone he didn't really know, met on the internet-- but I made it sound over-sexualized or like something inappropriate happened around my kids, which was not the case.",0.5
"AITA for Being a Bad Employee I am a lawyer, licensed for less than a year, so very much a baby who knows nothing. I got hired by a solo practitioner right after I graduated from school.¬†

I am his only employee. I received one day of training by his previous assistant and then was expected to figure everything else out on my own.

We rent an office space with other lawyers and he likes to work when it's quiet, so he usually gets into the office around 4pm (if he comes in at all). My hours are supposed to be 10-6. When he's not around he never calls or emails me with work to do. I used to always check in every morning asking him to let me know if there was anything I should work on, and he rarely gave me anything. I stopped asking after a while. 

Sometimes there are things to do, but for the most part I spend a lot of the day playing around online just trying to pass time. I used to try to make an effort to read textbooks to study the field, but I stopped because I wasn't getting much out of it.¬†

A few times he asked me to write down my hours and what I do every week before he pays me. In the beginning I used to do it, but I stopped because I don't even know what to say I'm doing. Today he brought up that he asked me multiple times to write down my hours, and he needs to know what I'm doing.¬†

He pays me well, relatively. And I am generally not a lazy worker or someone who takes advantage. But he doesn't show me that he cares at all about anything, so I don't really put in effort anymore. 

I'm most likely leaving the job soon anyway because of life circumstances, so I guess it doesn't really matter, but he is sometimes really snappy with me and I don't feel like I deserve it. And I have such a hard time standing up for myself. There is a lot more I want to mention, but can't fit in this post. So, am I wrong in this situation?¬†",0.5
"AITA For Not Inviting Brother's Boyfriend to Family Meal? I \[16m\] am one of four, but I only have one brother ‚ÄúLuke‚Äù \[15m\]. It was obvious that Luke was gay since we were really young so when he came out a few years ago nobody was really surprised. Through his dance group, he met his current boyfriend, ‚ÄúHarry‚Äù \[18m\]. Luke and Harry have been dating for about a year and Harry has come on family outings with us a few times.

I don‚Äôt like Harry. He drinks a lot (not illegal here) but he always offers Luke alcohol even in front of our parents. He is often late and he will grab Luke and make him sit on his lap even if he doesn‚Äôt want to. He also takes him on late night drives for hours without telling our parents so they are always worried about where he is.

This week was my mother‚Äôs birthday and I put myself in charge of organising her surprise party because it was a milestone birthday. I booked a table at one of her favourite restaurants near the beach, ordered her main present and invited some of her friends and family. I didn‚Äôt invite Harry.

Everything was going well, we had a nice meal, my mother caught up with her friends, until my mother asked Luke how Harry was doing. This prompted Luke to go on a long rant about how angry he was that Harry had not been invited when our sister \[20f\]‚Äôs boyfriend \[21m\] had been, which is ridiculous because they have a child together. Luke said that it is unfair I am unwilling to treat Harry as ‚Äòfamily‚Äô and that I don‚Äôt like them just because they‚Äôre different to me, which is not the case, I do like my brother, although we don‚Äôt have much in common, I just don‚Äôt like Harry.

Luke‚Äôs outburst ruined the tone of the night and he resumed complaining when we drove home. He said that I need to accept that Harry will always be a part of our lives now, but I think he needs to understand that not every event needs to include his boyfriend. It wasn‚Äôt about him, it was about our mother.

However, my mother later confessed that she wouldn‚Äôt have minded if Harry came just to appease my brother as she knew it means a lot to him to feel accepted. AITA? Should I have invited him?

Edit: To clarify two things, a.) the event was for my mother but my sister \[20f\] and I were paying b.) nobody in our family is homophobic. We've known my brother is gay most of his life and nobody has an issue with it, why would we?",0.08
"AITA for how I reacted to my friend's tattoo? My (27M) friend (25M) recently got a tattoo on their wrist. It was of an animal since it was part of their middle name in Swahili. They aren't the biggest fan of the animal, but decided to get one of it anyway, since they said it's part of who they are, in hopes that the tattoo artist could make it look nice.

So this is where the conflict comes in. He sent me pictures of the new tattoo on their wrist asking if I liked it, was it nice, etc. I replied that I only really like dogs (I just never really cared for other animals/wildlife), but that if they liked it and had some sort of sentiment then that's really nice! He then proceeds to send me a handful of paragraphs saying that they were not happy with what I said. They felt like that I was being passive aggressive/trying to hint that I thought it looked bad. He says it doesn‚Äôt matter if I liked it or not but that I should have at least said one nice thing about it because the tattoo was going to be permanent on his body.

I tried to explain that it was not the case at all, and that I had simply meant that I would not personally get it and that since it was something that had sentimental value to them, then that's all that really mattered. He then goes on to say it doesn't matter, as this is something permanent and because of the way I reacted, they're going to forever doubt the tattoo.

I understand that I may not have been as kind in my response as I could have been, though I don't feel like it warranted such a reaction or defensive response from them either. AITA for not being more positive/supportive or are they overreacting a bit?",0.78
"AITA for bruising a man's ego? My roommate and I (F23) were invited out by one of our closest friends (M24) for a birthday celebration with a couple friends of his that were in town. For context, we all went to the same small high school together, so we already knew of each other but my roommate and I weren't close to his friends.

Everything was going fine at first and everyone was getting along well with each other, but one of the friends -- we'll call him Visitor (M25) -- was definitely on the quieter side. However, he would randomly bring up weird comments about how popular he was in HS (my roommate even called him out for it a couple times). 

Fast forward a couple bars later, and we're all much drunker and rowdier. I thought Visitor and I were getting along just fine and had been chatting throughout the night. I had made a comment that I didn't know what his personality was like because he was so quiet. He told me he is a shy guy and takes longer to open up. We played ping-pong as a team and were even chest-bumping, basically acting like we were BFFs.

10 minutes later, Visitor makes a huge scene in front of the entire group saying that I'm the most disrespectful person he's ever met in his entire life and he doesn't want to see me ever again. WHOA. He's looking around like everyone should understand what he's talking about, but no one does. Everyone is as shocked and confused as I am. I found out later that my roommate had even said to our friend right before the outburst that she thought we were hitting it off. LOL.

I've been known to be pretty loud and outspoken, especially when I'm drunk, but I've never been told that I've seriously disrespected anyone before. I was actively trying to be nice to him and coax him out of his shell the entire night, which I don't usually go out of my way to do.

After his guests had left, our friend told me that all Visitor had to say about me being disrespectful was that I called him a ""p\*ssy"" and told him ""he had no personality."" Out of context, these sound mean, but 1) they hadn't been said maliciously or together, and 2) we had all been poking fun at each other the whole night. As I mentioned earlier, my roommate had also been giving him sh\*t, but he had no issue with her.

Our friend said that I had nothing to worry about and that this guy's reaction was out of left field. Visitor never took anyone aside or said anything  about how he was feeling up until he blew up at me in front of the whole group. Based on what people from our HS have said about Visitor, he thinks pretty highly of himself and doesn't know how to interact with women that aren't actively trying to get with him (when we first met up, he was super eager to boast about a random girl who had bought him a drink the other night). After I left, Visitor apparently even tried to change his flight to the next available one because he was ""so disrespected.""

Even though my roommate and our friend sided with me, the whole situation still blows my mind when I think about it. Am I the \*sshole?",0.12
"AITA for giving my boyfriend gift away On Christmas my boyfriend went out of town to his family, called and said he got me a gift. I couldn't believe it and was really happy. I asked him twice did he really get me a Christmas gift and he said yes to come get it. I asked again did he really get me something and he quit responding for the next few days. He comes back and said the gift wasn't expensive but it was nice. So he comes home a few days later and we meet up. I ask for my gift and he says he left it at home and I have to remind him next time. We met up a few more other times after and still nothing, he ""forgot"" every time. During the time, I got him a gift because he said he got me a gift. I didn't have enough money on Christmas but promised I would get him something in Jan. I got the gift early because I really wanted to surprise him. Still, 6 days after Christmas no gift. So I just came to conclusion he didn't really get me anything because he stood silent when I would ask for my gift. I ended up giving his gift away to my sister, someone who actually got me a gift. I told him I got him a gift but gave it away and he's still so salty about the fact that I gave his gift away. Weeks later he is still mad at the fact I gave his away.",0.62

"AITA-Dog sitting nightmare AITA-I house/dog sat for a friend this week. I also do this on the Rover app but this was separate. She did not tell me she has cameras in her home. She has two dogs that I was watching; a 5 month old Samoyed puppy and an older husky. She stated she would pay me $80 night when my usual rate is $120/ night for house sitting. I charge this amount as I need to board my own dog when I house sit, breaks my heart but I need the income. She stated in her very detailed list of directions that ‚Äúthe dogs could be left for 4 hours, 5 hours max and the puppy in her crate‚Äù. I left the house for 5 hours and 20 minutes and she lost it on me, that‚Äôs when I realized she was watching me on cameras. She became very malicious and nasty towards me via text. Now she is stating she will contact Rover to report me (again, this wasn‚Äôt on Rover), she is going to contact my exam department to become a physician assistant and tell them I lied on an application, and tell all of the neighbors that I babysits/house sit/dog sit for that I neglected her dogs and left them alone ‚Äúfor more than 5 hours.‚Äù I‚Äôve only been friends with her a few months and she‚Äôs very aggressive in a lot of instances.

"AITA for uninviting my(25) girlfriend(24) to a family dinner because she refused to dress modestly? So my GF and I have dated for just barely 3 years. She has met my immediate family and but she has never met my extended family.

So we have a tradition where once a month my grandmother hosts a Sunday dinner for the entire family at her estate. We all show up and if you‚Äôre old enough to use a stove you cook. 

My girlfriend has never attended until very recently, the first time she did was in December prior to Christmas. This is because my grandmother would prefer to not have non family and partners that haven‚Äôt been around for a while present. 

When she attended in December, I got word that my grandmother didn‚Äôt approve of her choice of clothing and won‚Äôt welcome her back if she doesn‚Äôt dress better. My aunt told me that grandma thought she dressed, ‚Äúwhorish‚Äù. Now I fully disagree and so did my family and my aunt. My girlfriend was admittedly dressed slightly less conservative than the other women but I wouldn‚Äôt call what she was wearing immodest at all.

So I told my girlfriend and asked her if she would dress more conservatively next time. So come January the dinner is this Sunday. I wanted to not have a repeat of what happened last time as I want her to get FaceTime with my family. 

I asked my girlfriend to show me her dress before this weekends. She did and the dress was less conservative. Again, it wasn‚Äôt immodest, but just less conservative and I know it‚Äôd piss my grandmother off again. She said no as she really liked the dress and it was modest. I told her that what‚Äôs modest to her isn‚Äôt going to be what‚Äôs modest to a 89 year old woman. I told her if she wanted to buy a dress I‚Äôd pay for it. 

She refused. After some arguing she proved that she was not going to budge. I told her that I‚Äôd she didn‚Äôt change it would be better if she just not show up and we try to find a solution for next month. She then said she wasn‚Äôt getting a different dress and I told her that it‚Äôs best she not come and I‚Äôd go without her.

She told me I was being unreasonable and putting an old woman‚Äôs outdated views over her freedom. I feel like I was being very reasonable.

"AITA for not agreeing to have my white children call my white MIL Abuela? My wife and I have two young children below the age of two, and when the first one was born we decided to let all of the grandparents pick what they wanted to be called. We assumed that they would all pick something like pops, nanny, or meemaw. All of them pretty much lived up to this expectation besides my MIL. She is insisting on being called Abbi or Abuela. 

I could understand this if she, her husband, my wife, or ANYONE in the family had any Hispanic heritage, but we are all super white. My wife's family is third generation Irish and they still take trips back to Ireland to see their cousins. And I'm from deep enough in the South East that my family doesn't even understand what Abuela means.

EDIT: Adding some clarification that I've given to a few comments already. She does not speak any Spanish and has made no effort to learn. This has nothing to do with Encanto although we (myself, my wife, and my kids) love the movie. We have told her we are not comfortable with having our kids calling her that and she does not care. We asked her why this was important to her, and she claims it's because  'abbi' makes her feel young so she's going to be Abuela.

"AITA for rehoming my dog? I got my first dog before Christmas this year. He was NOT  a Christmas puppy, I paid for him with my own money after weeks of breed research and having always wanted a dog since I was a boy.
Edit: he was a rescue, I paid the people who rescued him because he had cost them a lot in vet fees beforehand and they weren't in the best financial situation, he was originally from a horrific situation, but that wasn't the people I paid.

At the time, I lived with my dad (paying rent) and his 3 dogs, they're little yorkshire terriers, my dog was an Akita/Cane Corso cross.

When I asked my dad about getting Dozey (my dog) he said, exactly 'if it gets on with my three, it can stay.' And that was that. I went to get Dozey, brought him home and all was well.
Edit: I phrased this simply because length, me and my dad reached this conclusion after days of discussion, and months of finding different dogs and discussing temperament needs and issues of size and being used to other dogs.

Here's the problem, my dad also looks after 2 dogs for my sister's abusive ex (that's a whole other story) he doesn't get paid for this, and does it exclusively because he says he wants to. These two dogs are a pug/beagle cross, and a terrier (mutt, he's about the size of a small collie) the terrier's name is Winnie.
Winnie has never been socialised. His owner believes that so long as he pays for food and vet bills, he's fulfilling the dog's needs. This created a problem because obviously Dozey is quite a bit bigger than Winnie. So when they met in my house at 7am after being dropped inside without a word from their owner (who knew we had a new dog and needed a careful meeting) Winnie immediately turned aggressive. For the next week my dad insisted that I keep Dozey shut away in my bedroom whenever Winnie was there (which is 4/5 days a week) except for walks. This continued for three weeks, being accompanied by my dad bringing Winnie for 5 minute walks with me and Dozey and this led to no improvement. 

So I spoke to my mum, who is always a font of wisdom (I live with her now) and she saw the situation, tried introducing Winnie to Dozey with my help and after a couple days of trying told me very simply that the level of Winnie's aggression coupled with his owner and my dad's unwillingness to stop Winnie being at the house almost constantly meant I couldn't keep him. I agreed, and so I arranged to rehome him with a good friend and did.

It's important to note that in all this Dozey was never aggressive, he got on well with every dog except Winnie and even with Winnie he only tried to defend himself and never went for him. My dad has since been iffy with me and did directly say to me that I made a stupie decision and 'gave up on him' by rehoming him without getting my dad's advice. He started saying this to me the night Dozey was rehomed. 

I think I made the right choice, my dad made it clear that if I kept Dozey he would be forced to live in one room for the majority of the time (7am till 8:30pm 4/5 days a week) except for walks, and I refused to abuse my dog like that. But I can't shake that if my dad is this strong felt about it, maybe I did make the wrong choice?",0.1
"AITA for getting really frustrated in a fast food drive thru line? I wanted a quick drink and a chips and cheese so I went through the Taco Bell drive thru, thinking it would be a simple and easy trip. Upon entering the drive thru line, I found myself behind a car that seemed to be taking longer than usual to order, but who cares. I was jamming to some Led Zeppelin and not really paying attention. After a few minutes, the car moves forward and I order. After I complete my order, I pull up behind the original car mentioned. OKAY‚Ä¶ now the story begins. I watch the driver in front of me pay with a $100 bill, along with some $1‚Äôs and some change. I begin to realize the situation: giant order. After several minutes of watching the driver and employee banter back and forth, I begin to get upset that this is taking so long. I (not thinking anyone can hear me) yell out ‚ÄúWhat the F**K!?‚Äù The driver in front of me hears me me and starts yelling out her window that I am an impatient asshole and needs to shut the f*ck up. I yell out my window that she should be more considerate and NOT order $100 worth of Taco Bell in a drive thru. After 15 minutes of waiting in line, she finally got her order and as she pulled away, continued to berate me. Her order: 4 twelve packs of tacos, 3 other bags of who knows what and 4 slushies.

"AITA for pressuring my boyfriend to ask for my father's blessing? I, (24 F) and my boyfriend, (24 M) have been dating for 2 years and about 6 months ago he bought a ring. He told me about this as he doesn't feel like it should be a secret. We are both an old fashioned couple and we both agreed he should ask for my dad's blessing upon his proposal and eventual marriage. We have made our relationship work long distance (3 hours away) for 2 years. I have  accepted a position and will be moving closer to him within the next month. We came upon the agreement that I need the commitment of a ring before I pack up my life and stability to be closer to him. However, he hasn't proposed yet because, he hasn't asked for my dad's blessing. I have tried to get them to spend more time with each other so he feels more comfortable asking. However this is extremely difficult as my dad works 3 jobs, has 4 kids, a newborn grandson and also has proposed to his girlfriend. I've become rather frusterated because my boyfriend keeps procrastinating on asking for my father's blessing although the opportunity has been knocking for 6 months. I have explained my frustrations to my boyfriend more than once and all he can say to me is ""it will happen, when it will happen, don't rush it."" This conversation has angered me many times and it usually causes a fight. Am I the asshole for pressuring my boyfriend to ask my father?",0.71

"AITA for not eating dinner with my girlfriend‚Äôs family. History: I have been going out with my GF for almost 3 years and know her and her family very well. I have never been a big eater and only eat about 1 meal a day. When I tell people they oftentimes don‚Äôt believe me because I am a larger woman. 

Last month my gf (18f) and I(18f) went on a date where we got lunch and walked around a mall, normal teenage date stuff, and at the end my girlfriend asked if I wanted to eat dinner with her and her family. I said no because I wasn‚Äôt hungry and she gave me a strange look. I took her home and when we got to her house she asked one more time and I responded no. Her mother was at the door and asked if we were both excited for dinner and I said that I wasn‚Äôt eating dinner with them and that I was sorry she gave me the same weird look as my gf. I felt a little awkward and said my goodbyes. When I got home I got a text saying that I was rude for not coming to dinner and that my gf was mad at me. AITA or am I just missing something?",0.46

I open the windows to let out the vapor, but he closes then and LOCKS THEM. I get mad, so when we get home, I tell my mom. She says to stop meddling in adult business and to just respect them. She then tells me to apologise. I told her that I'm not apologizing. She got mad and yelled at me. Am I the asshole?

"AITA for telling my best friend to grow the F up For context, me and my friend ‚ÄúGinger‚Äù have been friends since we were 12 and struggling with our mental health. We‚Äôve been there for each other for years and spent most of our days together. So years pass, I‚Äôm not 18 and she‚Äôs 17 (7 months younger than me) she‚Äôs always gotten on my nerves for having irrational fears and acting younger than she is but I try to be understanding. For example, we wanted to have a picnic outside her apartment building and I thought the back of the apartments would be best since there‚Äôs not heavy traffic and it‚Äôs the parking lot. She refused because there might be ‚Äúzombies in the woods‚Äù‚Ä¶ yeah. Lately she‚Äôs gotten even worse about being fearful of the smallest things and trying to be a *quirky* girl.

Ginger came back to town after being away for a year, I was so excited to see my best friend and planned a whole day for us. Immediately off the bat I was getting fed up with her non stop talking, but again I was trying to be understanding, she was probably just excited. Through the night she tried holding my hand (which she hasn‚Äôt washed her hands since picking her nose or using the bathroom. Plus in a pandemic. Ick) and kept making attempts to kiss me and kept asking if I wanted to make out. Every time I said no she kept insisting. Obviously this made me want to distance myself from her because it made me extremely uncomfortable and I even told her it was making me uncomfortable. I was genuinely so annoyed with her after she did this that I started to hate her for everything she said and did afterwards. Every time she texts I have a deep feeling of ‚ÄúJesus leave me alone‚Äù. 

Yesterday Ginger called me on FaceTime crying over deleting an app with little characters in it. She said she doesn‚Äôt want them to feel abandoned and she regrets deleting the app. (I‚Äôm currently pregnant so I‚Äôm having a hard time leveling my hormones or controlling my anger). I yelled at her to never call me again with ‚Äústupid ass shit‚Äù and told her she needs to grow up or I‚Äôll stop talking to her and hung up. I feel really bad about treating her that way.

"WIBTA My mom thinks my house is an open invitation So my husband, 4MO and I just moved to a new house after previously being in a condo (that my mom never visited because no grandchild and elevators) 

Since we moved we‚Äôve asked her to watch our baby a few times while we went out to get things for the house/errands (we weren‚Äôt home - she was babysitting) 

One day we came home and my aunt was here. Turns out my mom just invited her. I said ok, I like my aunt, but like can you let me know so I can make sure my house is clean and I have food for guests?? I let it slide. Context: my aunt has a pool and I often visit it, but I ALWAYS ask first. I never just show up. And she‚Äôs always home. 

Then it happened again. And again. 

And now it‚Äôs like every time my mom comes over she‚Äôs like ‚Äúoh your aunt might come over to‚Äù. Or the most recent ‚ÄúI invited your aunt, uncle, and cousin over ‚Äú. She doesn‚Äôt tell me until she‚Äôs already here. This was when we went out for our first late/drinking night and coming back drunk to my parents is one thing, but my aunt, not what I want in my own home. 

My husband and I are pretty possessive people. Like our shit is our shit. My house is not your house. I have to tell her she needs to ASK permission. I‚Äôm going to be blatant. This is my house. You need to ask to have people here when I‚Äôm not home. 
But like she‚Äôs doing me the favour of watching my baby.  But ugh it‚Äôs so irritating. 
It‚Äôs going to start so much drama. 
But it‚Äôs happening tomorrow.

"AITA for staying friends with my ex's dad after we broke up? I (M26) was with my ex(F26) for like 2 and a half years. It was a good relationship and didn't end badly at all (so it seemed), just different life paths and such and we agreed we wouldn't work out right now. Well over the course of that time, I had become friends with her dad! He's retired and we have similar interests, so sometimes when her and her mom wanted to go out shopping or whatever I would kick it with her dad. We would tinker in the garage and make neat little inventions or repair electronics or geek out over computers and stuff (he used to be an engineer and I'm just a nerd). We started working on a trebuchet and would work on it whenever we had a few hours of free time, since we would really get into it, which leads into my ex getting really mad at me for this.

Well like a month after we broke up, her dad texted me seeing how I was and if I wanted to come around to work on the trebuchet since he didn't want to finish it alone, so of course I said yes because I want to finish it so we can launch some stuff and its a trebuchet, who turns down that. My ex wasn't home at the time but did get home before I left, was there probably 3 hours? She was pretty upset, asking why I was doing this to her, tormenting her?? It wasn't like that, her dad invited me and we genuinely have a good friendship regardless of me and her, and we both tried explaining that and she wasn't having any of it. Turns out shes really upset at the breakup and thinks I'm not and she feels hurt by it (I am, just not going to let it bring me down), which I had no idea about because as I said earlier it ended fine, we would still catch up now and then. Still have mutual friends, so it wasn't like I hadn't seen her in the month or so since we broke up. 

She's not talking to me or her dad (we both feel awful and don't know what to do).

"AITA for calling my brother's new girlfriend out. My brother 33M has been dating his new girlfriend for about 4 months. She seemed like a nice girl except she just doesn't like my other brother's wife. I've heard her talk alot of shit about her. That she's ""weird and her hair color is ugly"", just stuff like that. My brother's wife is a weird character but she's a sweet person that changes her hair color often. 

Might sound bias after saying that. I don't say anything the times I've heard her talk shit about her. She usually says it discreetly later on to my brother. 

Yesterday we had a family dinner at a nice restaurant. My brother's wife came in wearing a dress. Truth be said, it was tight and low cut. Nobody judged her and we had a great time. 

My brother and his girlfriend rode with me and my sister. We rode together to the restaurant. While we were driving, my brother's girlfriend randomly says ""did you see hoochie in that dress, she looked like a hooker."" There was a long awkward silence before I said ""excuse me?"". 

She says ""who wears a dress like that to dinner?"" My sister looks at me to say something. I say it's none of your business and I'm pretty tired of you talking shit about her. She against says that it's the truth . I say okay let's see how bad you are and we ride in silence.

We meet up at my parent's house and we walk in and I go up to my brother's wife and tell her that my brother's girlfriend has something to say about her. She goes red in the face and calls me an asshole for instigating. My brother and his girlfriend leave. Everyone asked what I was talking about and I told them what she said.

"AITA for thinking it was rude of my friend to announce her pregnancy at my place while I was in another room finishing cooking? GF and I were hosting a group activity (think a game night of some kind). People start arriving, we have a huge spread made, people nibbling and we‚Äôre gonna start the activity soon. I‚Äôm actually in another room finishing off some of the cooking. When I get to the main room holding a tray of food, everyone‚Äôs jumping around, huddled around one friend (lets call her Sam), and GF‚Äôs laptop was open to a video call. GF sees me, pulls up and whispers *‚ÄúSam just announced she‚Äôs pregnant‚Äù*.

Turns out I missed a lot. While everyone was trickling in, GF had some stuff to prep on her computer. One of our friends (lets call her Jen) demanded to use the laptop saying she has an announcement to make and wanted to call the rest of the friend group. With everyone's attention (except mine), she starts some speech only to be suddenly interrupted by Sam going ‚ÄúI‚Äôm pregnant‚Äù. Turns out it was misdirection, Sam and Jen were in cahoots and the real deal was that Sam was pregnant.

So everyone‚Äôs distracted, Sam‚Äôs the center of attention, and it's over an hour before we finally get to the activity we were supposed to host. The vibe was thrown off and a lot of planning and work got glossed over by the announcement.

(btw, pregnancy went fine)

I was really upset by this, though I didn‚Äôt let it show and I haven‚Äôt let it impact my relationship with either Jen or Sam. I definitely trust them less though since they never realized how rude it was. GF was bothered by it too, but she thinks I should let it go. Here‚Äôs my reasoning though:

It felt disingenuous. We weren‚Äôt let in on the surprise until minutes before. Sam clearly planned it, if she told us we would have been able to prepare. I‚Äôve wondered why they even needed to misdirect us at all. The only reason I can think is that Sam knew there was a chance we‚Äôd say no and didn‚Äôt want to let us. I feel like a good friend would have let us know instead of withhold our ability to consent. It‚Äôs not something you should spring on a host, especially at their own event.

Second, there‚Äôs the matter of me not even being present for it. It's weird that I had to find out while holding a tray of meat. What am I chopped liver? In my culture we take hospitality very seriously, so to me this kind of thing is unheard of. I felt embarrassed to have witnessed them do something as socially inept and disrespectful as not waiting for the host before doing anything important in their home.

That‚Äôs why I can‚Äôt let it go. It wasn‚Äôt a minor faux pas. Announcing a pregnancy at someone else's party while they‚Äôre not even there is the utmost disrespect. She commandeered my time and space which was allocated to something else. While I wasn‚Äôt even there to see it, she made the whole party about her. Idk what bothers me more; that she did it in the first place, or that she‚Äôs never seen anything wrong with it after all this time.

tldr: A friend surprisingly announced her pregnancy to our friend group at my place during an event while I was in another room cooking food.",0.01

"AITA for telling my fat friend that her doctor wasn‚Äôt being fatphobic telling her to lose weight? Before I start I‚Äôd like to stress that I am by no means denying that fat bias exists within the medical field though as someone who is healthy, fit and skinny I have never had to experience this. 

My friend (27f) recently went to the doctors about her mental health. I don‚Äôt know the full story but I know she broke down in tears and talked about how she hated the way she looked, how it limits her going out and makes her only want to wear joggers and hoodies because she feels disgusting. She mentioned something on the lines of being unable to eat in public because she knows people are watching her but eats copious amounts of comfort food in the house before bursting into tears even more with food guilt and hating the way she looked. I didn‚Äôt know it was that bad because she had only told us bits. 

Her GP stated he believed she was suffering Cynical Depression, Generalised Anxiety, and Body Dysmorphia as well as Binge Eating Disorder. He put her on anti depressants and referred her to an mental health specialist. Because she is unable to work right now he also offered to give her a referral to the leisure centre for a personal training to help her loss weight. Even from her biased retelling it sounded like he was truly just trying to help her since her size is clearly impacting her mental health but my friend broke down in tears and vented into the server that he was fatphobic and how he hates her for being fat. She also said she was going to ignore the mental health referral because she can‚Äôt trust anyone with her weight. I told her it sounded like fatphobia and he can just see loving your size clearly isn‚Äôt working for her. She logged off and isn‚Äôt speaking to anyone. Our friend group is really divided with some saying I should have been more sympathetic towards her because she‚Äôs going through a hard time while others said I was right the GP was just doing his job. 

I do feel guilty but I still think she should listen because losing a few stones might actually be good for her mentally. Some people are happy being fat - she might be the saddest person I know, especially to get three diagnoses at once. GP‚Äôs typically require multiple appointments before they do anything. So am I the asshole?",0.5

"AITA for getting the kids in my class suspended? I live in a conservative area and school. I am also a person of color in a predominately white school and area. I was especially offended at #3 and #5. At my time there, I have seen countless incidents of racism. I will list them in order.

Case 1: Asian eyes #1

In Social Studies class one day, we were watching a video about China where A made the Asian eyes gesture and the teacher caught it. 

Case 2: Asian eyes #2

Jump forward 2 years and we have a new Social Studies teacher and we are discussing the Progressive Era and China came up and these 2 kids O and Z were jokingly making Asian eyes at each other and I caught them but the teacher did not.

Case 3: N word

Fast forward a little bit to during study hall where A was talking to his friends and I hear him faintly saying the n word and he then looks behind him to see if anyone else heard him but no one else did. 

Case 4: Indian telemarketer

O was speaking like a Indian telemarketer one day and it was a very stereotypical India voice. 

Case 5: Kool Kids Klub

H, O, and Z were writing ""Kool Kids Klub"" on the board but I knew it was a reference to the Klu Klux Klan.

Case 6: Let's Go Brandon 

During a school event, E, O, and A were chanting ""Let's Go Brandon"" which means f*ck the current president of my country. No teacher caught them but I did. 

For #5 I got the kids involved suspended from school. AITA for getting them suspended?

Edit: I also have to mention that O also mocked they/them pronouns. Also, O has the lead role in the musical so this might affect that.

"AITA for keeping in touch with my father? Sorry for formatting, I am on mobile. 

First, for context, my entire family on both sides are in a cult. I grew up in it. My parents grew up in it. We‚Äôre like 3rd or 4th generation. 

I was kicked out at 18 because I left it. Eventually my brother left, and then in 2018 my mother left it and divorced my father. 

Both my father and my mother were extremely abusive growing up. Psychological, physically, mentallly. You name it, I‚Äôve got the physical and metaphorical scars. All in the name of that cult religion. 

After she left, I made up with her and my brother. My father is still in the cult but has recognized his behavior wasn‚Äôt okay, and apologized. He is actively getting better and help since the divorce, despite still being in the toxic cult. Frankly if I don‚Äôt talk about religion, it‚Äôs the closest I‚Äôve ever had to a genuine father-daughter relationship. I have found closure and moved on from their abuse, and tried to have some semblance of a family as an adult. Also I have been through years of therapy to help me move on and be happy. I am 27 now. 

Last night, I called my mother to see how she was doing and say hello. She was drunk. When she drinks, she gets pretty toxic and says things she‚Äôs angry or upset about. 

I am inbetween jobs right no and needed help paying partial rent this month. My mom started going off on me about still talking to me dad. She insinuated that I talk to him more than her (I don‚Äôt) and thatis hurts and is shitty that I still talk to him despite  having been abusive and not her (she doesn‚Äôt believe she contributed to the abuse despite being responsible for half of the damage). And that I should be ‚Äúcalling my father and telling him I need help with my rent or I am going to be homeless on the street.‚Äù She then ranted for 6 minutes about how she‚Äôs tired of being the go to parent when my brother or I need help. For clarity, she was the bread winner and my dad makes just enough to get by like me‚Ä¶


Feeling upset that she suggest I participate in toxic manipulation, I made an excuse about needing to make dinner and hung up. 


I know her behavior isn‚Äôt okay. I know she was being an ass. However, it‚Äôs made me star questioning if I am actually an asshole for staying in touch with my father‚Ä¶ while he has admitted to the abuse, he doesn‚Äôt admit to all the damage he did and still claims to have been a good parent because cult. The cult is sexist af and actively protects really bad people who I can‚Äôt name or the post will get removed..

. My best friend thinks I should have cut him out long ago, my mom too. But‚Ä¶. My parent are victims of the cult too. Classic victim turned abuser. My fathers entire world is in that cult, I want to be available if he ever wakes up from their programming.. and in the end, they are my blood. I never found anyone to replace them as family.

"AITA for ruining my best friends and I friendship after 6 years together 
So this all starts 2 years ago. So I (17F) and best friend (18F) went a party. At this party was also a guy (18M) who my friend had kinda been seeing but nothing official. Anyway at this party I get way to drunk and end up blacking out for periods of the night. To this day two years later I don‚Äôt remember a whole chunk of the night. But from what I‚Äôve been told from a bunch of different friends is that me and my friends decided to leave the party and go to someone‚Äôs house. But when we ordered the Uber there wasn‚Äôt enough room so we had to order another one. The guy my best friend had been seeing decided to get in the Uber with me and my friends jumped in the other Uber. Apparently in this Uber me and the guy hooked up ( I don‚Äôt remember any of this ). He tells a bunch of his guy friend. About 3 months later at another small party I once again get way to drunk ( I was young and did not know my limit ) and end up passing out on my friends bed. I also ended throwing up on my friends bed. Whilst I‚Äôm passed out one of our mutual guy friends tells my best friend that the guy she was seeing hooked up with me in the Uber all those months ago. Apparently she was devastated and spent the rest of the night sobbing. The next morning I feel terrible cause I have an hangover and I threw up all over her bed. I come downstairs and her mum if furious with me and I thought it was because I threw up all over her bed so I apologise to everyone, I just get told to leave. My best friend says she will walk me home so we can chat. She asks me if I and the guy she been seeing hooked up? I said no I would never. Then she tells me that we did and he told everyone. I start to cry and say I don‚Äôt remember and that I‚Äôm sorry and I would never do that if I was sober. She‚Äôs crying and says a guy could never ruin our friendship of 6 years. We are both really upset. That‚Äôs afternoon I go back over to her house with flowers and champagne to give to her mum to apologise for the bed. She (50F) ends up yelling at me for a solid 5 mins while I stood there crying. Basically just saying how I could do that to her daughter. That they have done so much for me. To be honest I don‚Äôt remember a lot of what she said cause I was just crying so much but it hurt. Also the most terrifying situation I had ever been in. So months go by and I don‚Äôt hear from my best friend. I text her asking if we can talk and clear the air and she just says she is not ready. I would invite her to things all the time and she would never come or she would come but not talk to me at all. Made it really awkward for the rest of our friends whom were friends with both of us.

"AITA for give a bad review even when they told me they were sick I made a purchase online in a medium local business, in the site they said my package will be delivered the next day between 10am to 8pm, they didn't give me a track number, but I choose the option of sent me the delivery status of my package to my email and cellphone.

So the next day, I wait for my package to arrive, but it never came. I check my email and cellphone looking for some missing call or email that explain something, but there is nothing. I try to contact in phone number from the same website, but no one answer my call, I did this at least eight¬†times during that¬†day. Furthermore, I put a comment under the promotion ad, writing about how I haven't had news about my order, the CM reply to me asking for my order number, I write it, but again, they didn't answer me.

The next day, I called again but no one answer, I wrote to the Facebook page telling the same thing. The cm answer me and told that he is the owner, and he apologizes because he and part of his staff is sick. I tell him that I understand, but they have my contact number and email to tell me that my delivery it will be delayed.

I said that it's okay, I just want to know when I will get my package. He asked me for my order number and when I give it to him, he stops answer me. I sent¬†two messages one¬†hour later, trying to restart the conversation, but no one replys me.

At this point I'm very upset, I tried to contact for all possible way, and they didn't care, so I wrote in a Facebook group if someone had the same problem as me (the promotion was being recommended in this group) I put all the screenshots and the calls I made. I said that they did not answer, and how I did not recommend shop here. Suddenly, an hour later I receive a call from this business telling me my package will arrive in 15 minutes (to this point it's 6pm) I receive the package. The owner wrote on the post how they sorry about the inconvenience, that a mayor part of his workers had gone sick and how they were working with half of the staff. That they will give me a gift for all the worries. I answer that I did understood, but they didn't put in contact with me and didn't tell me where my package was until I made this post.

Suddenly other members put that no one would die if I didn't receive my package, that I have to understand that healt is more important than my stupid purchase, how I was looking for free products and how they were on business side because they were working even with a virus outbreak. .

Owner was answering all this comments, saying thank you, even to the mean ones.

"AITA getting mad at BF for not wanting to go to my grad party? Me (23F) and my (now ex) bf (29M) were together since Jan 2020 &amp; when the pandemic hit, we hung out at his place where I stayed over a lot. I was genuinely happy &amp; enjoyed each other as a couple bc we agreed on topics I usually wasn‚Äôt on the same page with my family/friends (i.e. sociopolitical issues)

Around Apr 2021, I was dealing with rescheduling my graduation party that was postponed on 2020. My class agreed on late July but I was indecisive on even attending it myself. Just like many, I became unemployed during the pandemic and I was worried on how I would afford everything the party entailed (dress, makeup, hair, shoes, accessories, wine/alcohol, appetizers for guests, tickets to the event). I wanted my closest people there w/ me on that special occasion. The tickets alone (7 guests) would be around 7k MXN, which was unthinkable; I didn‚Äôt even have enough for the party preparations. I asked each guest to cover their ticket and I would ask to borrow someone‚Äôs dress, do my own hair and makeup, anything to make do. 
I was venting to bf about how expensive it was going to be &amp; even considering not going, he blurted ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt count on me with that‚Äù. I was hurt.

The next day, I ask him to come by my house so we could talk and expressed how hurt I was over his comment, bc I wasn‚Äôt even asking him about going yet and rejected the idea straight away. His reasoning was that he didn‚Äôt expect for me to want to go to these kind of ‚Äúsnobby‚Äù events where people would usually be discriminated against bc of their wardrobe. He never even went to his own bc he wouldn‚Äôt perpetuate that behavior. (his usual outfit would be Hawaiian or colorful design on a shirt, shorts, tube socks &amp; sneakers. He used to be punk and identify himself as an anarchist when he was about my age.)

I wouldn‚Äôt think that wearing a suit to an event that was meant to celebrate me was the issue. He said how he thought I was placing unrealistic expectations on him by wanting him to go &amp; pay to wear something that would make him feel uncomfortable and partially yes, I was but I saidI was actually expecting him to be supportive of me as his girlfriend. I was disappointed over his reaction but he assured me that he was proud of me and happy I was graduating but he just wasn‚Äôt comfortable with the idea of these events and that he thought I‚Äôd feel the same since I complain about school so much. I decided to understand his POV and he promised to go.

The day of the party I overhear bf at the table saying something to one of my friends who didn‚Äôt dance either: ‚ÄúI hate these rich white ppl events‚Äù. Hurt again. I wanted him to at least look past it on that day since he knew how much it meant to me but ig he couldn‚Äôt. said I shouldn‚Äôt be upset bc I knew how he felt and still made him go, told him he was being very selfish &amp; he proceeded to tell me how selfish I was and how I lack empathy towards him, that I should mind his view. AITA?

Edit: Each person (7 people total) was asked upon invitation if they would be willing and able to pay the ticket, knowing the better and traditional option would be to pay for their tickets so they could join me, but given my financial situation I hoped they would view this as their grad gift to me: their presence. All of them gleefully accepted except for my ex (bc of situation above lol), two of them weren‚Äôt able to go due to covid, so it ended up being 5 guests and later covered those two tickets.
5 guests were my mom, brother, best friend, high school friend and ex bf.",0.89
"AITA I‚Äôm not letting my former roommate stay in his empty room BURNER
English not my first language and mobile so apologies ahead of time. 
I live in 2 bedroom apartment. I had a roommate living with me for the last six months. His lease ended and he moved home. About 40 min away. A month later the apartment complex still hasn‚Äôt assigned anyone to the room. Ex roommate is now asking if I can let him stay in his room whenever. I said yes just try to give me a heads up. He texts me ‚Äúhey are you able to let me in tomorrow?‚Äù I say ‚Äúprobably not this week but maybe next week or something like that.‚Äù
Hasn‚Äôt responded to me since. 
I don‚Äôt want to just let him come and go we are friends and everything but this is my apartment now. I pay electric and AC. So this is my apartment. But he did live here for a bit  and we‚Äôve been friends for a while so idk.

I told them I was not comfortable with her using my mother‚Äôs name as my cousin didn‚Äôt know her. My aunt called me overdramatic and basically told me to get over it. Maybe I am overdramatic. I have always been very sensitive about my mother and her death. 
So, am I the asshole?
(We‚Äôre not a very catholic family. I did allow my cousin to use the name but I feel like I could‚Äôve handled the situation better) I always feel like it is a grieving competition with my aunt because she tells me things like ‚Äòoh you didn‚Äôt even know her that well‚Äô or ‚Äòshe was your mother, but she was my best friend‚Äô and I just snapped when I heard their plans about the usage of the name.",0.43
"AITA for cursing out guy blocking the driveway? This evening I was leaving my apartment to take my daughter to her dance class. There was this guy in his car blocking the road. There's no other way to get out since our apartment building is between two other buildings, so only one car can get through at a time. I honked at the guy to get out of the way and there's no response so I get off my vehicle to approach his window and ask him to move. When I get to him he tells me not to come up to him like that, and he rolls up his window. 

At this point I was livid so I open his car door trying to explain to him that I need to get my daughter to her class and that I need him to move off the way. He starts to get aggressive telling me to back up before he ""knocks me out"" and I keep imploring to him that I just need him to move. I tried to calm down and I go back in my car as he said he was going to move if I did. 

He still does not move, so once again, I come up to his vehicle. This is the point where the guy that he was dropping off comes up to me threatening me and talking about ""bloods"" like they were gang members or something. At this point I lose it so I start cursing both of them out about how they're not gangsters, and that I just need to get the car out of the way so I can leave. My wife said that my response was warranted, but looking back on it I feel like I should've been the bigger man and not resort to yelling, as we're all adults here and yelling is not an effective form of communication. What do you guys think?

Disclaimer? (Not sure how you add those here). Just to clarify when I approached the guy's window I didn't even know if there was anyone in the car, as the car had been on the road for a while. I approached the window to see if there was anyone in the car and if not so I could find the driver. I figured they weren't aware that I was there as there was no response when I honked, I couldn't even finish my sentence asking him to move his vehicle before he rolled up his window.",0.15

"AITA for calling out a liar? 17F here, this ones a wild ride. (Mobile sorry for format)

TL:DR- girl lies about cancer so I call her out 

In my other posts I‚Äôve mentioned this, but I‚Äôm a cancer survivor. 2007-2010 were the hardest years of my life, battling ALL (blood cancer). Naturally, as I‚Äôve gotten older the chemo has caused me severe health issues, but I don‚Äôt mention them a lot as most are in my lungs/heart/nerves. Anyways, my friend, 16F, who we‚Äôll call N, is the closest to me, she knows about all my issues and how hard I‚Äôve fought to stay healthy. This girl, 14F, we‚Äôll call T, comes in the classroom we‚Äôre sitting in during lunch hour to talk to our teacher. Our teacher is an incredible lady, she‚Äôs like a friend more than a teacher, and she‚Äôs super easy to talk to. T begins to talk to the teacher about how the doctors think she might have cancer. Mind you, this girl has come in multiple times and has never mentioned this whatsoever, no health issues, no symptoms, hasn‚Äôt even left school. I get it, I know a cancer diagnosis can be sudden, etc, but it can also be fairly obvious in what she was describing. I suffered bruising and severe stomach issues, it wasn‚Äôt nothing. 

Here‚Äôs where it got suspicious though, she just kept describing a doctor, no specific doctor just ‚Äúthe doctors‚Äù. I kinda got curious and asked her (we‚Äôre not friends but we know each other) she just kept saying ‚Äúthe doctors‚Äù. Typically if you‚Äôre in this situation, you‚Äôll have an oncologist or a hematologist just for diagnosis, along with pediatricians. She keeps talking, and starts to act panicked and goes ‚ÄúI‚Äôll lose my hair!‚Äù‚Ä¶ yeah‚Ä¶. It was odd to say the least. At this point the teacher and N are all looking at me and we‚Äôre all just awkward, we know what‚Äôs happening. She hasn‚Äôt once mentioned blood tests, MRI‚Äôs, scans, or anything indicating she‚Äôs had any tests remotely done for diagnosis, just saying ‚Äúthe doctors‚Äù think I might have cancer.

Once the room clears out after lunch, and everyone‚Äôs out of earshot I went up to her and said, ‚ÄúI know this isn‚Äôt much of my business, but what cancer do they think it might be‚Äù (btw I‚Äôm still gonna stay civil, I don‚Äôt want to fight and I want to support her if I can). She just goes, ‚Äúcancer‚Äù. So I told her, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt trust that that‚Äôs truthful, you aren‚Äôt acting like someone who might have cancer, nor are you able to answer what it might even be‚Äù (I didn‚Äôt phrase it like that but you get the gist), she asked why I cared so much so I finally told her I‚Äôm a cancer survivor, I have lots to prove it, including pictures and scars so there‚Äôs no real way I could fake that. Instantly she changed demeanor and just kinda shut down and walked away, she knew she had been caught and it was fairly obvious by the way she acted, she hasn‚Äôt mentioned it since. I know it wasn‚Äôt a great thing to do, but there‚Äôs nothing cool about trying to fake something that took my normal life away, and even took my friends life (old posts)

Edit : forgot to say, no, I‚Äôm not licensed to diagnose anyone, but it‚Äôs also not something to lie about.

Edit 2 : Yes she lied, I just want to know if I‚Äôm in the wrong for calling her out?

"AITA for asking my husband to not include his mother on his birthday dinner I would like to start by saying that me (38 female) and my husband (39 male) have been living with my mother in law for the last year. she moved in with us since she doesnt have any other place to live and she suffers from fibromyalgia. I have been away from home for the last month (i traveled to chile to see my mom as she was diagnosed with bladder cancer early stages and what to help out since she lives with my sister and she works all the time). I will be returning home the day of my husbands 40th birthday and since i will arrive around 5pm i thought it would be good to celebrate his birthday with a romantic dinner at a nice restaurant just the 2 of us since we havent seen each other in a month and mentioned that he can celebrate with his mom during the day with a nice birthday breakfast and lunch since i will not be there and we can have birthday cake all 3 together and later just go the 2 of us for a nice romantic dinner and celebrate as a couple and reconnect. However, my husband thinks that i am being an asshole for not wanting to include his mom since it is his birthday and he wants to have dinner with the both of us together, i said that since we havent seen each other in a month i was hoping we could celebrate together just the 2 of us and kind of reconnect after such a long time away, after all he would be celebrating with his mom during breakfast and lunch (which i am sure she will take him somewhere special). I want to mention we have been married for less than 3 years and the last year living with mom he has always made sure that all activities include her and we dont really have any moments when is just the 2 of us. So, am i the asshole for not wanting to include her in the dinner?",0.18
"AITA for not agreeing with my friend and telling her to mind her business about a fake service dog in a store? I(24f) went grocery shopping with a friend(23f) last week and while we were walking around we kept seeing a few people shopping with a dog. It was a large doodle type breed, very tall and probably at least 80 pounds, and it was definitely not a service dog. It wasn't wearing an markers indicating it was working and it was also behaving in a way a service dog wouldn't(trying to say high to every stranger it walked passed) and the owners were letting everyone who asked pet it, but other than that it wasn't being very disruptive. It wasn't barking or behaving aggressively and I honestly didn't see a problem with it being there.

My friend was visibly upset about the dog being in the store and kept shooting dirty looks every time we crossed paths with them. I didn't understand because I know my friend loves dogs and it seemed very out of character to her. She just kept silently grumbling to me like ""can you believe that?"" or ""I can't stand people who do that."" and it was completely ruining our time together. At one point we were both in the bakery section of the store and the people with the dog were there too and the dog was tall enough that his head was over some of the display tables and could stiff at the food on there and my friend just completely stormed away because it made her so upset to see the dog stiffing at the food. When I caught up to her she just kept saying how it was wrong and gross and at that point I just told her that it shouldn't bother her that much what people do and she just needed to mind her business and there wouldn't be a problem. My friend looked at me like ""are you serious?"" and then we went straight to check out and she drove me home and dropped me off without really saying anything else to me. I didn't hear from her this week which was strange and when I tried to reach out to her she just said she needed space.

I was just being honest with her and what I said was true because she was letting it get to her, but she said she sees as a moral issue between us now and that's why she wants space.

Edit: We were in Walmart and the people with the dog walked in before us and the clerk asked if it was a service dog and they said yes so my friend was upset by this because it was pretty obvious it wasn't a service dog or even in training.",0.96
"AITA for asking my sister to pay me back for my lost AirPods This all started back in October of 2021, At the time I had been living with my sister for about 2 months. She (22 female) had 2 jobs and liked to listen to music on her shifts (as anyone would) but she had cheap earphones and couldn‚Äôt enjoy it much. At the time she had asked me to borrow my AirPods as I wasn‚Äôt using them much, obviously I said yes because she was already doing so much for me. After about 2 weeks I‚Äôm leaving her place with all my stuff and she tells me that she lost my AirPods but doesn‚Äôt have the time to look for them. I tell her to look for them when she can and that we can meet up when she finds them. A month passes and I hear nothing from her, no updates just nothing. I text her asking if she ever found my AirPods and she says ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just pay you back‚Äù, I assume she couldn‚Äôt find them and agree I ask her where we‚Äôd meet up and no response. Weeks pass and I hear nothing from her. Eventually on Christmas Eve she texts me ‚Äúmerry Christmas Eve‚Äù, bothered and confused I ask her about my AirPods and if she‚Äôs going to pay me back since this is the first time in a while she‚Äôs texted me.

"AITA For Telling My Mom Not to Invite Her Coworker Over for Girl's Night? My original post was too long and I apologize. This is a shorter repost. Again, sorry.

I (24F) am a very private person, and still live at home for various reasons out of my control. I have horrible SAD (Social Anxiety Disorder), and my mother hasn‚Äôt been very understanding. Because of her I keep ‚Äúrelapsing‚Äù into my old behavior and can't heal as she appears to have made it her mission to undo any healing I begin. I have gotten into numerous arguments with my mother about this only for her to trash me behind my back to anyone who will listen, even within my earshot.

My mom was planning on having a girl‚Äôs night in, and texted me while I was at work about her plans. She said she was inviting some of her GFs over, and that she was thinking of inviting a girl who was my age so I could ""make friends"" with her. This girl works with my mom, and Mom claimed to know her well, and she was just like all my other friends. But my mom doesn't know how my friends really are, they are afraid to be themselves around her b/c they've seen her shit on me at every possible opportunity. And I can't trust that my mother hasn't run her mouth and put an image of me into this girl's head before I even have the chance to give her a first impression in person.

My initial reaction was to try and be gentle with my mom, as blatantly saying ""no"" never goes over well and my wishes are always overridden if I'm direct. This led to my mom trying to pressure me into it, using gaslighting tactics which immediately had me on defense mode. Again, I tried to gently decline. This girl could've heard any number of horror stories about me swayed by Mom's unrealistic views of my personality. My mom sent back a TEXTBOOK sized response. To paraphrase: she called me a selfish bitch, and told me she hoped I would be forever friendless. I tried to stay calm and told her that this whole event was her idea. If she wanted to play hostess to her friends she could, but that it was unfair of her to assume I would be comfortable being co-hostess. It would've been one thing had we all been meeting up for dinner in a neutral location but this would've taken place in our home, and I would have been forced to allow a complete stranger into my personal space. My personal space is extremely sensitive for me. Having someone who I don't know being invited into it without my explicit permission is a huge boundary breach for me.

I shared screenshots with my friends and let them read the whole thing for themselves. All of them agreed with me that my mom was overstepping, and that it was within my right to say no to all of this. But because of my anxiety IDK. Do you think I‚Äôm the asshole?

Edit: Apparently there is some confusion, and I can see why, so I'll clarify. I never told my mother she could not have a girl's night at all. I told her I would prefer it if she didn't try to force me into inviting over a complete stranger to hang out with ME for girl's night like some kind of ""adult playdate"". She's had other girl's nights previously and we've never had issues before as I have always made my own plans or simply spent some quiet time in my room so as not to bother anyone.",0.06

I could bring them but I honestly just do not want to. Simply because I feel like he deliberately had them delivered when he wouldn‚Äôt be here because he expected me to put them up.

"AITA for possibly getting my coworker fired for stealing from the company? TL;DR my coworker is stealing meals from the kitchen, so I told my boss. Due to my actions, my coworker could get fired. Thats why I think I'm the asshole here. 

I work in a relatively small residential treatment center (MH/SA). We have a kitchen on site with shockingly good and nutritious food. Employees can get 10 meal tickets per pay period for $40, so each meal costs $4. Our kitchen budget is really tight, and we can't afford to give out food for free. This is also how the kitchen staff gets paid. If you're strapped for cash and need a meal ticket, or 5, at least 3 people will offer you one on any given day. Everyone knows this. We have a ticket donation box that's always full, because many of us win free meals and/or don't use all the tickets we get for that pay period.

Anyway, so my coworker, who has only been with the company for a month or so, told me yesterday that they were going to buy a roll of identical tickets online for $7, so they can eat for free (which comes out to a little over $1000 they would be stealing over one year). I was like ""uhh okay, to each their own, I'm not getting involved"", then I realized there was a client right behind us, who hates my coworker, and he overheard the whole conversation. There was a really good chance that he'd say something. I asked a close coworker of mine what I should do. She was like ""uh, they're stealing directly from the kitchen staff, if you don't say something and that client does, you'll catch hell for not taking action"". I just got promoted, so I'm technically one of this person's direct supervisors.

So I told my boss. He was not happy. Especially because this coworker has been screwing up a lot since they were hired and is likely in the wrong field of work.

I feel like a fucking asshole, because I know how it feels to not be able to afford food. However, this coworker is well aware that they can ask for meal tickets if they can't afford them.

"AITA for being upset after my partner leaves me alone in the pub with his mates? I (25f) moved in with my partner (28m) 2 years ago. Every time we have gone out with my partners friends he has at some point if not the entire night has left me sitting down on my own and hasn‚Äôt help make me feel welcome. We live an hour away from his friends and only catch up with them every so often. 
Last night we went to one of his mates birthday at a pub. We were staying at his close friends house while we were here. I sat down with his mates wife who is older then me and it‚Äôs kinda awkward because we aren‚Äôt really close or friends really but she leaves an hour or so into the party. We were staying at their house but she didn‚Äôt offer for me to come back with her. Which is understandable she wants to do her own thing and relax and plus it‚Äôs not her responsibility to look after me.
I‚Äôm sitting alone trying to mix and mingle without trying not to hang off my partners hip like a lost puppy. I‚Äôve tried on multiple accounts to try and include myself but to me these people I‚Äôve only met a few Times and it makes me anxious as I don‚Äôt wanna seem like I‚Äôm hanging off them too. So I sit down and try to make myself comfortable but alway kinda get left alone.

"WIBTA if I tell my friend I'm not paying for my ticket? A few months ago, my best friend Franny announced she was buying tickets to a concert for a musical artist she really, really likes. I don't really listen this artist, but she's a big fan. I was there when she bought two tickets for the concert that was 7 or 8 months away. We agreed that with the amount of time she had before the event, she would be able to find someone (a date, partner, other friend who is a fan, etc.) to go with, and in the event of a last-minute cancellation, I might be willing to go along for the company. Again, I'm not a huge fan of the artist, so I'd only be going to make sure Franny wasn't lonely at the concert.

Now, it seems like I may be going, since the other people haven't worked out. Franny has started hinting that I should pay for the ticket, but the thing is, I'm not sure if I'm alright with that. The tickets are EXPENSIVE, and this is not an artist I really enjoy. I could pay for the ticket, sure, but it might be a bit of a financial strain, whereas for Franny it's not. I see going more as a favor, and if I were to go, I would certainly have to provide the ride to the concert.

The problem is that eventually, we will need to communicate about this more directly, and I'm not sure if it's fair of me to say that I can't/don't want to pay for the expensive ticket. If it came down to it, I would probably choose not to go rather than pay for the ticket, but the preferable option is for me to go and provide company for her.

Would I be the asshole if I told my friend that I am unwilling to pay for the EXPENSIVE ticket even if I am going with her?",0.06

So me and k were on this groupchat a few days ago with all her friends when suddenly she started cussing me out and telling me how I get jealous so easily because she has other friends (which was sorta true because I got anxious that she would ditch me for that other friend because my anxiety does that) and starts talking about things that had happened months ago and all the tiny details I've done wrong. For example, thinking her partner was toxic, telling a very VERY close friend how I thought she was mean a bit, moving seats when she decided to sit next to me because I thought she was a stranger, those things. Then told me how she could never be friends with me because I caused her to try to off herself (which acctually we had an aurgument and I didnt agree with her so she tried to guilt trip me with that) I then took a deep breathe and exposed her lies about me and sent screenshots of our chats where she said I did something but really I didn't.

"AITA for letting my dog get into bed while I'm naked? My (24m) girlfriend (23f) have known each other for about a year because of adjacent friend groups and have been dating for close to three months.  We're at the point in our relationship where she's starting to spend the night.

I've also got a three year old Samoyed named Sheldon living with me.  He's just about my favorite person in the world.  He's got his own bed but sometimes decides that he wants to sleep with me, and I let him.

The issue for my girlfriend is that I sleep naked.  I always have.  When she found out that I let my dog into my bed while I'm naked, she was upset and told me that it was weird.  I asked why, and she said it just was, normal people don't do that.

I told her that was stupid.  He's just a dog; to him, me being naked is just the same as me wearing clothes.  Besides, when I let him sleep with me, it's not like I'm letting him into the covers.  There's still a layer of fabric separating my nakedness from him.

But she was still upset, insisting again, that normal people don't do that.  I asked her what, exactly, about it was bothering her so much, and she said that it felt like I was, in her words, ""having intimate relations with the dog.""

I'll admit, I found this hilarious.  On the one hand, he's a dog, and on the other, he's a guy and I'm not gay.  It was also funny how it felt like she wanted to accuse me of bestiality, but couldn't bring herself to actually say the word.  I laughed and she got annoyed.

I decided to start pretending to ""flirt"" with Sheldon in front of her, cuddling with him and saying things like, ""It's okay, she just doesn't understand our love.""

This annoyed her even more, and eventually, she asked if I loved her more or the dog.  Easy answer, Sheldon.  She stormed out of the apartment.  I think we're breaking up, but honestly, I don't feel too bad about it.

When I was telling my friends about this, though, they did say it was a little weird that I let Sheldon into bed at night knowing that I sleep naked.  It got me thinking.

So I came here to ask, AITA?",0.11
"AITA For calling my ex crazy when she asked for an invitation to my upcoming wedding. Quick background, my ex and I were together for almost 10 years. During that time she was emotionally, verbally, financially, and kind of sexually abusive [would use sex as a ""reward""]. About 6 years ago she's acting different, hiding her phone, going out a ton with her ""friends"" and other things. During that time my dad lost his job so we moved in to my parents to help them out financially, but after about 6 months she tells me she's leaving me. At this point I could not care less, it had been almost a year since we had sex, we wouldn't touch at all, at this point she was just someone I shared a bed with so I told her ""That's fine, when will you've out"". She was out by that weekend. Turns out she was also cheating on me with a coworker and got pregnant. I should state that I'm a lesbian so there is no chance it's mine.

During that time she was working in retail for a chain that has since gone out of business, I heard from her brother that she now worked for 7/11. About a year after we broke up I got a new job and met my now fiance and I've never been happier. 

Now to the story.

There is a 7/11 around the corner from my work that I go to about 3 times a week, sometimes less. When I first saw here their I ignored her, but the next time I was in I asked another employee if she worked at that store full time. I only asked because if she did I would rather just not go there, she's honestly someone I'd rather not see again. Turns out she's a supervisor so the risk is small of seeing her. 

It's been 2 years that I've been going there and have seen her now 3 times. In those 2 years I've become friendly with the employees and I mentioned my upcoming wedding to one of them. Today during my lunch I went there for a drink, noticed my ex couting inventory or something but I just got my drink and went to pay. The cashier, not knowing she's my ex [I assume] asks me how the wedding planning is going. 

This is when my ex comes rushing towards me and ask if I'm getting married. I said yes I am, this is when she flipped out. How can I get married and not invite her, she demands a table for her and her family. Honestly I couldn't help it, I laughed in her face and called her crazy. I told her I would NEVER invite her to my wedding,  and I want nothing to do with her. 

I told my fianc√© what happened and while she agrees that she's obviously not invited I should not have called her crazy at her work. So AITA for calling my ex crazy?",0.08
"AITA: We named our rooster after my FBIL and now my sister is mad Throwaway 
So a few months ago, my husband (38m) and I (32f) began raising chickens in addition to our cattle and horses. Fresh eggs and all, right? Two weeks ago we adopted a rooster to keep the ladies company. We've named all of the chickens after divas (Celine, Mariah, Whitney, etc.)

Onto the story. 

We had dinner with my parents, my sister (26f) and her fiancee (Jake, 30 something male) this weekend. We all get along well, but where my parents, my husband and I are farmers, the fiancee is way more metropolitan. So, he has a man bun and a beard. No big deal, just not something we're all used to seeing. Our rooster has a knot on the back of his head and a classic rooster beard. My husband pointed it out one day and we started calling him JJ. (Jake Jr)

While we were eating, I brought up Jake's namesake and showed him a picture. He started cracking up. But my sister got really upset, saying we hate him and don't respect him. It was really all in jest and Jake even started making expected rooster jokes. 

Today my sister called and said we're completely disrespectful and should have never named a farm animal after her fiancee. Now I feel terrible. I thought everything was cool because Jake was laughing and joking about it. AITA?",0.2
"AITA if I contact ex-friends boss So I had a close friendship with a tattoo artist for years and it has recently broken down. She‚Äôs become really manipulative and emotionally abusive and seems hell bent on destroying my life.

She‚Äôs done a lot of tattoos on me over the duration of our friendship including ones on my chest and under my boobs and she‚Äôs tattooed my butt. She took photos of them when she was done and said she wouldn‚Äôt show anyone but wanted to keep them as she was proud of her work. 

I wouldn‚Äôt be happy with anyone else seeing these pictures. When things turned sour, I asked if she could delete them from her phone please and she laughed and said ‚Äúthose are mine to do whatever I want with‚Äù.

She works in the studio that I got them done in (I always paid full price so was a ‚Äúregular‚Äù customer) and has a boss. Would I be TA if I contacted him and said one of his artists was insisting she has the right to keep fairly intimate photos of me because she tattooed the area and making vague threats?

"AITA for looking at my phone when he picks the movie? My (35f) boyfriend (43M) and I have been together for 5 years. We are really different people with different tastes but we love each other. I believe the way we have made things work is honest, direct communication. I try to say what I mean as literally as possible, without passive aggression or hidden meanings, and count on him to do the same. 

Recently with the pandemic we have been watching a lot of movies. We have really different tastes and we can‚Äôt watch movies separately. So, to be fair, we made an agreement - we alternate whatever we are watching, and whosever night it is gets to choose and the other has no veto power. 

Sometimes I pick out movies that I know he will not like. When this happens, I can tell he spaces out a bit and isn't really into the movie. It bums me out a little, but I don't mind that much, because its part of the deal we both agreed to. 

When he picks out a movie I think is boring, sometimes I mindlessly look at my phone at the same time. My phone is not bright and does not interfere with the movie, but helps the time go by. However he notices that I am not engaged and says he feels hurt  I‚Äôm not enjoying it with him. He says I am trying to control his choice of movie by doing this, which is against the spirit of the deal that allows each person freedom to watch their movie of choice. I reply that this is not fair - he‚Äôs not always engaged in my movies! Also, the stated deal is that the other person picks the movie, and the other watches. There is nothing in the deal that the other must enjoy or pretend to enjoy each movie. I would not have agreed to this deal and if that is what he expected he should have communicated it. AITA?",0.54

I own a small house, im a student and i dont have much forniture, I told him he would be staying on the floor, (because i dont have a couch or anything where he could sleep in).  
He was going to be the only one staying and got really upset for not offer him a place in my bed (usually when he comes we sleep on the same bed) I didnt do it because my boyfriend (long relationship, basically married) was here with me and I just assumed i was going to sleep in my bed with my bf.  
Friend got really upsed for being the only one on the floor, I asked if he wanted me to sleep also in the floor, but never thought on him and my bf sleeping on the bed or sending my bf to the floor.  
He is really mad, blocked me and delete me from his social media and said he didnt want someone who puts their bf over friends in his life.

"WIBTA if I gave my (non-pregnant) friend my old maternity clothes? I (34F) am currently due to give birth to my second child and post birth, will no longer have a need for the maternity clothes I have accumulated during my pregnancy.  I have a close friend (34F), let's call her Mel, who I think would look great in them!  The difficult factor here is Mel is not pregnant.

Mel is LOVELY.  A complete sweetheart and would give you the clothes off her back.  She's unfortunately struggled with her weight over the past decade, and has recently had a gastric bypass/weight loss surgery (partly so that she herself may get pregnant as her doctors have indicated to her she may struggle to fall pregnant naturally due to weight-related PCOS complications).  The results have been incredible and has done wonders for her self-esteem.  

Mel has also frequently had the horrible experience of being mistaken as being pregnant fairly often over the years (both before and after surgery) as she unfortunately seems to hold a lot of her weight in her stomach region.  She struggles to find flattering clothing for her shape because of it (and doesn't have the best self-esteem when it comes to shopping as it is, despite all us girlfriends cheering her along).  She also doesn't have a lot of disposable income to completely revamp her wardrobe (nor do I to contribute due to my imminent birth as I would love to help her out by buying new clothes if I could!)

Over my two pregnancies - I've accumulated a lot of maternity clothes which are in near new condition and Mel would honestly look GREAT in them.  The clothes I prefer don't so much accent the bump - its just that they have a bit more ""give"" in the stomach area (think stretchy band jeans, or tops/dresses tailored not to ride up in the front due to a baby bump).

So my question here is - WIBTA if I gave/offered Mel my maternity clothes?  I honestly think she would look great in them, but I don't want to hurt her.  I could just as easily never bring this up and on-gift the clothes to someone else without ever bringing this up with Mel.

EDIT/UPDATE - Thanks for your input everyone. I accept my judgement (IWBTA). Appreciate there may be a tactful way to navigate it, but seeing some of the replies about how they would feel in Mel‚Äôs situation just makes me think it‚Äôs not worth it (last thing I want is to upset her). I‚Äôll donate to charity and continue to support Mel in other ways. Thank you!",0.42
"AITA for telling my girlfriend to not buy a 600 dollar hair curler? My girlfriend and I, both (extremely broke) college students, are working to pay for school, with little money to spare for dates. Most of the time, we end up doing free/cheap things like hiking, picnics, and having movie nights, as we tend to struggle for spending money.

Recently, she has been seeing a lot of tik toks relating to a product known as the Dyson Airwrap, which in my opinion is just a glorified hair curler. I understand it is healthier for your hair, it is more efficient and futuristic and so on, but her sole argument is that it would make her happy. **I am all for her happiness**, but it should be noted she has been depressed recently due to not having money. I do not take depression lightly. It has been a few weeks back and forth of sadness as I myself have come up short in funds, recently living paycheck to paycheck, but my girlfriend works a stable job. The only problem is that we, as I have aforementioned, are broke college students. Her debt is racking up which I know causes her stress (because she makes it apparent) and by her buying this airwrap, it effectively takes money away from the things that we initially found to be important together, i.e travelling, dates, college tuition. She can sometimes have a negative body image because of the women she sees on social media, but I try to tell her these things are edited and not an accurate representation of how beautiful women like herself are expected to look. 

I brought this up to her over a facetime call, presenting the many wonders that 600 dollars can buy you in life. I told her investing is important, travel is an experience she will never forget, paying tuition is an investment she wont regret, and much more. She was upset that I was trying to tell her how to spend her money, which I understand, but I also don't think I can deal with the sadness that comes with struggling to pay bills and make ends meet. I am not asking for any of her money. She has worked for it. I generally pay for the dates we go on, as she has accrued more debt than I have.

To top this all off, she will be getting a bonus from work for referring employees, which *should* total to around $500. I understand this is a hefty chunk of change but once again, think it should be spent investing in ourselves and our future. We are committed in our relationship, and have no plans of breaking up soon.  

AITA for not wanting my girlfriend to blow her money on a hair curler because I think more bad than good will come of it?

Tldr: My gf wants to buy a $600 hair curler, I say there are better options. We are both college students, she is mad that I told her how to spend money in this situation. AITA?",0.5
"WIBTA if i asked for less responsibilities? I (F18) am on a gap year before Uni next year, I live at home (split parents; Dad (M41) Mum(F40), see them both 50/50), and I have two jobs

My Mum hasn‚Äôt had a FT job since my sister(F7), P, caught pneumonia when she was 3; she was ill for 6 mo, and Mum never went back to work

At Christmas, Mum got a new job, and asked if I could take and pick up my sisters from school when I don‚Äôt work. I agreed, as I wanted to support her

When the time came to do the school runs, it was ok, and then my work rota came in, and I was working 7 days a week. I could do the school runs around these hours, but it was a lot on my plate so I spoke to mum, and told her I wasn‚Äôt as happy doing the school runs

She wasn‚Äôt happy, she got mad and said that I‚Äôd agreed to do the days (I was doing 3 while one of her friends from school did the other 2), and that it wasn‚Äôt fair to say i didn‚Äôt want to; she couldn‚Äôt find another way to get them to school. I later got a text from my grandad, saying I needed to support mum, plus other things pushing me to do everything I could

We argued, and I asked; If she couldn‚Äôt find anything, what were her plans when I went to uni next year, or what would she be doing if i‚Äôd gone this year?; She said she didn‚Äôt have to think about that, as it wasn‚Äôt until September

So to cut short i continued to do Mon, Thurs, and Fri school runs since Jan until this day, plus my jobs

So now comes the tipping point

My youngest sister, P, caught covid on Thurs just gone (it‚Äôs now Sun). Mum took wed, thurs, and fri off to look after her, but she said she got in trouble from work, as their policies state that she‚Äôs only allowed one day off; to find childcare so she can then come back to work. So she asked me to take care of P on Mon. (Since Thurs when we found out P had it, I‚Äôve been staying at dads to avoid it, I have a 6mo niece I don‚Äôt want to pass it onto)

I initially said I would look after her on Monday so Mum could go back to work, I didn‚Äôt really think about it, but as I work in childcare, my job don‚Äôt want me to go back as I may get it 

I work for dad as other my other job and he asked me to not come in, as my grandad is going into hospital and they don‚Äôt want to risk getting it and making him sick; I‚Äôm losing seven days of work

I‚Äôm not sure if this is fair on me, I also feel like I‚Äôm letting my mums side down if I don‚Äôt do it

If I say anything, she‚Äôs going to be mad at me about it, so I want to have some perspective before I bring it up to her 

My stepdad can‚Äôt look after P as he works away

Mum asks me to collect shopping, pick up dog food, pick up her medications etc, not regularly, but every now and again, she also expects me to clean the house if I‚Äôm at home

When I say ‚Äúschool run‚Äù, Mum leaves the house at 8am, so once she leaves I‚Äôm responsible for getting sisters ready for school, and taking them

She has no underlying issues which prevent her doing these jobs

"AITA for eating meat in a vegetarian household I (22f) have been dating my boyfriend Danny (22m), for just over a year. I have known Danny for about 3 years. After we had been dating for about 6 months, Danny & his family (dad 46m, mom 46f, sister 25f) told me I should move in with them since Danny & I couldn‚Äôt find a place to rent on our own due to prices being outrageous. *I pay rent in their house

Everything was great at first. Danny‚Äôs entire family is vegetarian and that wasn‚Äôt a problem but I have weight issues and I need meat in my diet. I often cook my own meals but sometimes I eat the meals they cook and just add meat. I also cook vegetarian dinners for them. They had tried to convert me to be a vegetarian for awhile but were understanding when I explained that if I don‚Äôt eat meat, I lose weight. I made an effort to eat only vegetarian with them at first but lost 10 pounds and knew it wasn‚Äôt a lifestyle I could maintain.

Fast forward, I made a pasta dish with bacon and put the leftovers in the fridge. One day after work Danny‚Äôs sister, Sam, told me it‚Äôs not fair that I have ‚Äúunlabelled‚Äù leftovers in the fridge that aren‚Äôt vegetarian because she almost ate some of my pasta. I told her that the glass containers are mine so she can avoid any meat by not eating anything from the glass containers. 2 weeks later Sam told me that she finds it too tempting to have meat in the fridge because it makes her want to eat it. This escalated and Danny‚Äôs entire family told me they have a problem with me having meat in their fridge. I told them I would buy a mini fridge for my room. We all thought this was a good solution.

I thought this would be the end of the problem but it wasn‚Äôt. Danny‚Äôs family told me that they don‚Äôt like me cooking meat in the kitchen because ‚Äúit smells so good they want to eat it.‚Äù They say I am tempting them and it‚Äôs unfair. 

I talked to Danny 1-on-1 and he said that it‚Äôs just temporary until we find our own place. For context, he‚Äôs not vegetarian by choice, he‚Äôs vegetarian because that‚Äôs what has been forced upon him. 

2 days ago, I received a text message while I was at work from Danny‚Äôs dad saying I am no longer welcome in their home until I stop eating meat. They said I‚Äôm being selfish and inconsiderate and if I don‚Äôt want to be vegetarian with the rest of them, then I must move out immediately because they can‚Äôt handle it anymore. I told them I respect they are vegetarian but I can‚Äôt cut meat from my diet so I will move out.

Since then Danny & I have been fighting a lot because he didn‚Äôt stand up for me to his parents and tell them how ridiculous they are being. His family has told me I‚Äôm not allowed to come over and eat dinner with them since their lifestyle doesn‚Äôt fit mine which means now I barely see Danny.

"AITA for giving my friend an honest opinion on her job prospects? My friend wants to become a therapist. I used to believe that she would be really good at the job but recently she has become significantly more judgmental than before. It seems like she likes to embarrass me if we go out in groups. She‚Äôll say hurtful things and then move on like nothing‚Äôs wrong. For example, the other day she got upset that I was in a hurry to leave because I had to be home by a certain time and she insinuated that I had nothing else important going on.

Yesterday she was stressed out about school and for whatever reason she ended up getting mad that I sent her a picture of my bird. She insinuated that it was childish of me to own a bird and that she was tired of my bird being my only personality trait. I‚Äôve never tried to make my pet a personality trait, so I was hurt by the comment. I told her that her comment hurt my feelings and that whether or not she liked it, I was going to own a bird. There were plenty of things that she consistently talked about that I didn‚Äôt like but I excepted it because I knew that those things were important to her. 

We went back-and-forth for a little while and she said that she was just stressed about school and trying to become a therapist, and she asked me honestly if I felt that it was the right path. I told her that she had potential to be a good therapist but she tended to make judgmental comments if she was frustrated. 

There were times where she said things to embarrass people and make them look bad, which you couldn‚Äôt do with clients that were paying you. She said that she was just speaking her mind and that she was entitled to her opinion, which I said was true but she didn‚Äôt need to be rude about things and she would have to be a bit more open minded in order to make it as a therapist. If someone finds comfort in their lifestyle, it‚Äôs not up to anyone to judge them. She got mad and said that my opinion didn‚Äôt matter and that she would succeed in therapy even if she was judgmental. She didn‚Äôt appreciate that I called her immature, which I didn‚Äôt do. 

She‚Äôs not speaking to me now and I can see why she was upset, but she asked for an honest opinion which I gave her. If she wanted me to sugarcoat it, she should‚Äôve said that.

They only saw her at larger family events and holidays for most of the marriage. She agreed to this arrangement of limited time spent, and never sought more time with them. 

Eventually I got the courage to start over and leave H in early 2020, when the kids were 15 and 16. The pandemic slowed things, but I left everything to H in order to end it peacefully and quickly, and started over.

Fast forward to now. H has been reaching out to my kids to spend time together because she ""misses"" them. She started by having them at her new place (when they were all underage and I was living in my office). I only found out because I asked my daughter for dinner and she guiltily said she was going out with H. I was upset, but said have fun and sent her on her way. I later asked all three children and H to stop meeting at her new place, and to please let me know if they were going out. They met at her place again for dinner, and I found out after the fact. 

I lost it, and repeated the same requests. Again, this past summer, they met her for lunch in a restaurant but did not tell me ahead of time. Obviously I was upset, and got into an argument with them, and then their mother (who can't stand H) for allowing them to go and not tell me. They didn't speak to me for two months, and their mother and I are not on good terms any longer. 

I found out today that my girls saw H for lunch last weekend because someone saw them and told me. I'm at a loss. I left the marriage because of her treatment and disdain for my children, something they could sense and my youngest even made jokes about her step mother hating her. 

I have told them my two boundaries are: 
1. Not at her house
2. I want to be told ahead of time. 

They have repeatedly broken those boundaries. 

So. I guess I'm asking AITA for not wanting my kids to have a relationship with her?",0.69

"AITA for threatening to tell on my stepsister My \[18M\] dad got married this past summer. His new wife, my new stepmom, moved in this summer but the stepsister \[16F\] only moved in last month.

I have two younger brothers \[16/11\] but no sister so i don‚Äôt really know what's normal. My brothers and I generally say out of each other‚Äôs business and don‚Äôt like go running to dad for stuff, and that goes for her too, like she snuck out and I noticed because she forgot to put the house keys back and I covered for her not a big deal.

I drive all of us home from school but the rule is that if you're staying late you just have to figure out your own ride which usually isn't a problem.

Last week there was this car accident involving a few senior guys at another school driving crazy recklessly on this one road near us, it was sad, it came up at dinner and her mom told her not to get into cars with any of the guys at our school and that she'd pay for her to Uber instead. She also told my brother and I to drive carefully and not do anything like those guys were doing when our friends driving, but she didn't actually say any rules and my dad didn't either.

This afternoon, my stepsister was like I'm getting a ride with Jake, and I was like no you're not because of what your mom said. And she told me to be cool and I was like no if you get in the car I'm telling your mom, you can either come with us or get an Uber later. She was pissed but did get in the car with us.

Which yeah technically I was just following what her mom said but honestly if it was my brother and if my stepmom had made that same rule for all of us instead of just my stepsister, I would definitely not have noticed or stopped my brother, which is why I think I might be an asshole. Also I maybe I would have felt different if the guy wasn't a junior (she and my brother are sophomores) and sort of known for being weird.

Now she's pissed and giving me the silent treatment. I told my girlfriend and she told me I was being controlling and should have stayed out of it.

**TL;DR: I stopped my new stepsister from breaking a rule but would prob have ignored it if it was my brother, AITA?**",0.76
"AITA for telling my sister I feel I'm being treated differently now that she's married Throwaway account.

So I (23f) have a twin sister (23f) who got married last March. We are the only children of our single mom and grew up very close. We shared a room our entire lives and have only recently been apart due to her moving. We are literally best friends and hang out in the same friend group. We didn't grow up with a lot, so we shared everything and have built a relationship with the understanding of what we were missing. 

Okay, so about a month ago, I told my sister that I was getting kind of frustrated with a change in our relationship. I've been feeling like she's leaving me out of things about her life and that she's not thinking I'm worthy of her opening up to me anymore now that she is married. She talks to our mom a lot about how her life is and what advice she wants, but I feel she never reaches out to me anymore. I don't want to be passive aggressive about it but our mom is a single mom who raised the two of us alone, in and out of rocky relationships with men. I just don't see why she would rely on her for relationship advice knowing all that. I digress. 

So I told her that she might not mean it, but I was getting frustrated with feeling like I'm being treated like a little kid because she isn't sharing with me. I didn't demand anything from, just frankly told her that I wanted to let her know how I was feeling. She responded positively and said that it wasn't her intention to make me feel that way, but there are just some things she isn't comfortable sharing with me. 

That REALLY hurt me, more than I let on. It's not like she is talking about her sexual activities and doesn't want to share those with me. I usually overhear from our mom but it's just XYZ happened, what should I do? Or ABC is happening and I did X, should Y have been better? Just generic stuff like that. Or even just simple sharing about anything regarding her life. 

I don't want to demand anything from her and I don't want her to feel like she \*needs\* to talk to me so I don't get upset. I don't know. I mean we're not in a fight or anything, I just feel upset and like maybe I should not have told her. I don't want this to put a strain on our relationship. 

Also, I don't want me stating these things making it seem like I should be treated like a little kid. It just felt like I was being looked down on or ""unworthy"" of being a part of her married life anymore. A part of me wonders if it's self projection of my insecurities being the only single one in our circle where all are married or getting proposed to. 

I don't know, so reddit, AITA? I think I included everything I need to. For the record, her husband is a great guy and we get along very well. When my sister visits, it's also great. I just feel like we lost a layer to our relationship and now she's telling me she isn't comfortable opening up to me. I'm not going to push it, but should I have not said anything?",0.8

"AITA for lying to my mother So I 18f live with my parents. I booked a piercing appointment to get my nipples pierced about a week ago for the 18th of feb. Today I told my mom that I'm getting it done in a few weeks. She said no and that I will be kicked out of the house if I get it done and that she will be doing checks of my breasts to make sure I don't get them pierced.

I don't earn enough to move out as it's really hard to find a job and my current one doesn't give me stable hours. I'm just gonna go ahead and get it done anyway as I'm 18 and can do whatever sort of stuff like that done to my body that I want. My sister is supportive in me getting the piercing as she was gonna come along with me to get it done, however she thinks that I am an asshole for lying about my appointment date to our mom and saying that I'm canceling it so if she does do any checks, they're all before my actual appointment.

My mom says she doesn't want me getting them done because she's worried for my safety yet I have done research about which place to get them done as I know there are some piercers out there who are creeps. The place I'm going to highly regarded and is one of the two best piercers where I live.

I want to get it done partly because I think it look cool, and partly because it's a way for me to reclaim my sexuality regarding my chest as I've had unconsentual stuff done to me since I was a literal child in elementary. My therapist supports me in this reclamation and said that if it's what I think will help then she supports me.

I get that I could be the asshole for going against my mother's wishes and lying to her, however I tried being honest and I am 18 and it's not like I just turned 18 either or suddenly wanted the piercing. I've thought about it for a few months now and even talked it over with my therapist.

So am I the asshole for lying to my mom about my appointment date so I can hide my nipple piercings from her?",0.23
AITA for filing my taxes jointly when I‚Äôve been dependent most of the year? [deleted],0.67
"AITA for avoiding my tenant? I live in a house with multiple apartments that I rent out. Whenever I had problems with tenants in past, it was pretty clear: you don't pay- time to go, you play bass guitar at 3 AM on amplifier- time to go. 
Anyways, I rented one of the apartments to whom seemed a cool lady at the time. She was really friendly, polite, had an alternative style... I liked her. 
When she started moving in I realized that she doesn't get some things right away: like how to open a balcony door. So I explained everything in detail, even though some things were quite obvious: how to turn on the tv, how to turn on the shower etc. At first I was like yeaah, she's new, she just needs to adjust, she is a bit slower. 
For the reference, I am 25 and she is 29. 
Everything seemed cool, but every now and then she would call me about some problem to come check at the apartment. None of those things were actually problems; like the light bulb would burn out and she would bring me to it and be: 'it stopped working', while pointing at the bulb blankly. And I would be like yeah, it burned out, you need to change it. Since she obviously never changed a bulb I went to my place, got a new bulb, changed it and showed her the proccess of changing it. Then day after a day I would get these dum*ass calls and texts. One day, the electrician came to put a new washing machine in her bathroom. Later that night around 11 PM she called me to tell me that she just washed her hair and can't dry it cause the only outlet in the bathroom is now taken by the washing machine. To that I replied to unplug the maschine while she dries her hair, of it is washing, I am sure she can dry her hair in her bedroom or hallway. To all of these obvious solutions she answers with somewhere between 'thanks so much, never thought of it' and 'genius' and then procceeds to tell me some funny random story and I can barely get rid of her. 
Few nights ago, she called me for the 20th time to ask me on which side does the radiator turn on since it is not working, and the answer is obviously the opposite from it is on now!
 If she was really young or really old I would get it somehow, but if you call me to ask about radiator not working after I showed you 20 times how to turn it on... How am I suppose to react?! I couldn't listen to this anymore so I blocked her number and when I come home from work I sneak in so she can't see me. She is not mentally retarded, I just feel like she is not the brightest light on the tree. Ofcourse, after I showed her how to change a bulb, she called again to let me know 'there is no light' when another burned out. If I showed you something so simple last time, then you don't want to do it or? I don't care what she is really, but I know that I can't throw someone out for being boring so I feel like there is no other way. 
 My boyfriend agrees with me avoiding her, but my mom who also lives in the house, thinks I am an asshole who doesn't want to help her. Am I the asshole?",0.13
"AITA for accidentally sleeping on the couch with my husband? UPDATE: I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm doing this right but there‚Äôs an [update ](https://www.reddit.com/user/throwawaymom11_/comments/sjjmv6/update_aita_for_accidentally_sleeping_on_the/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf)on my profile. 


My (24f) husband (24m) and I are visiting my family. 

My husband, kids and I were getting ready to go to our room for bed when my parents started acting really awkward. Like something was off. 

I asked them what was wrong and my mom quietly told me that my husband should sleep on the couch in the living room. I was a bit shocked because... why? Apparently my dad doesn‚Äôt feel comfortable. I called her and my dad weird and told my husband to ignore them. 

We finally put our kids to sleep and are getting ready to sleep when my mom barges into the room while we‚Äôre changing and says that she doesn‚Äôt want us in the same room alone in her house. My husband is freaking terrified at this point because he was in the middle of changing so he leaves for the couch and my mom says she‚Äôs sorry but she‚Äôs not in the mood to deal with my dad‚Äôs complaining all night.

I pointed out that my younger sister (21f) and her husband have slept in the same room at their house MULTIPLE times and she‚Äôs never said anything and she goes ‚Äúwell... your husband is white so your dad feels weird.‚Äù I was over it so I said fine. 

I got up at like 4am to drink some water and I saw my husband wide awake just lying on the couch. He said the couch is uncomfortable as fuck (which yes it is) so I sat down next to him and we both accidentally fell asleep. 

I woke up later to my mom freaking out. She was whisper yelling (so she doesn‚Äôt wake up my dad) and asked if we‚Äôre that codependent on each other that we can‚Äôt spend one night alone. I tried explaining that it was a mistake but she kept calling me disrespectful and said that I was selfish etc. I was upset but my son called for me so we ended our conversation.

Now I‚Äôm wondering if I really am the asshole in this situation? My mom says I am because I was being selfish, disrespectful and completely disregarded how difficult her life would‚Äôve become if my dad found us. My whole thing is that it was an accident, I‚Äôm 24, my dad is being weird and my sister‚Äôs husband doesn‚Äôt have to do this so why does mine? AITA?

Edit: 

My family and I are south asian.

Edit:

Yes, I know a lot of this has to do with my husband being white and them being racist/prejudiced.

I called my parents weird/strange/awkward because of what they were doing (glaring at each other, swearing at each other under their breaths, randomly going quiet out of nowhere etc). They do this pretty often and have been doing it for as long as I can remember. So much that my sister and I call it the ‚Äúweird mood‚Äù. 

Like ‚Äúkeep an eye out for mom and dad, they‚Äôre in their weird mood.‚Äù

Sorry for so many edits but this should be the last one. I‚Äôm getting a lot of people asking the same thing so I‚Äôm just going to copy one of my replies.

‚ÄúMy kids were not in danger. 

We live over 8 hours away, it was snowing HEAVILY and the roads would‚Äôve been icy and pitch black, it was after 11pm, my sons are 2 and 3 and the nearest hotel is pretty far away. Not to mention my husband and I had been driving for literal hours and were completely exhausted.

"AITA for feeling this way about a life insurance policy? 

Hello. 
I don‚Äôt know much about these as I‚Äôve only talked about it a few times with my dad. I‚Äôm 23 and plan to get a life insurance policy and was talking about it with my other half. So please don‚Äôt judge!

So my boyfriend of 3 years and I had been talking about life insurance policies. 
He said he wouldn‚Äôt put his 3 kids as the beneficiary because he didn‚Äôt want their moms to take the money. I‚Äôm the mother of his youngest. I didn‚Äôt know how I was supposed to take it but I‚Äôd never in my life steal money from him and not share with any of his kids, I‚Äôm not that kind of person and he knows that I‚Äôm not. He‚Äôs said it many times on other things. But here‚Äôs the thing. 
I also have two kids from a previous relationship and then my youngest with him. He said he‚Äôs only going to do his three kids and not include my other 2. Granted I know they aren‚Äôt his biological kids, but he is the only father figure in their life. The only man they actually have to look at as their dad. It bothers me a bit because we had talked about getting engaged and getting married soon in the future, yet I feel like him saying that he doesn‚Äôt look at my kids as his own ? That being said. Should I be upset about him not wanting to include them or I on his life insurance policies if we were to get married ? Or am I wrong for feeling this way ? I mean if he dies and left me no money for a funeral, what would I do ? I wouldn‚Äôt put it all on his kids, regardless. That wouldn‚Äôt be right to me. And even if he weren‚Äôt to leave me any money at all for his funeral, I still wouldn‚Äôt do it. I‚Äôd find a way, but it‚Äôd be extremely hard for me to do considering I don‚Äôt make too much money from work myself. But it‚Äôs because (when and even now if it happened) we got married, it would be my responsibility to make sure everything is taken care of. Not because I‚Äôm his SO, but because I do love and care about him and his kids so very much. Am I wrong to feel the way that I do ? I want to ask him about it myself, why he wouldn‚Äôt want to include my oldest 2, but I‚Äôm worried he‚Äôs gonna get offended and get angry with me ? Is it normal for people to not include their step children in those things ?

Edit to add: 
He doesn‚Äôt want to make his three kids beneficiaries while they‚Äôre under the age of 18.

"AITA for helping a sad friend when my mom was getting me birthday food? I was 19 when this happened.

This happened years ago but I still don‚Äôt know if I was an asshole. My mom was going to go shopping and get ‚Äúbirthday food‚Äù. It was my birthday a few days ago and she decided to get food for me. My friend was feeling sad do I decided to go see her for emotional support. 

I came a few hours later and my mom got mad at me. She said that I was disrespectful and ungrateful because I wasn‚Äôt home when she brought the food for me. I explained to her that my friend wasn‚Äôt feeling great and she said that I was lying and just finding excuses. I didn‚Äôt text her saying that so I suppose that I should‚Äôve done that but I didnt. 

She then decided to punish me by not letting me bring friends home for 2 months and told me that I was ungrateful. I felt bad because I could had told her that I was seeing a friend. My mom was extremely pissed.

"WIBTA for cancelling my ex's phone contract without warning? i stupidly took out a phone contract in my name for my ex when we were together. (because his credit score was crappy, i know that was stupid) when we broke up there was still a year on it so he agreed that he would pay me each month, and keep the number instead of me taking it back. for the most part he has transferred me the money, even though we don't really talk anymore. it's worked fine for the last 6 months, but january is the first month he hasn't paid me. now it's not really expensive so i'm not out a ton of money but i'm still annoyed that he's decided to just not transfer me the money, with no warning. thankfully, due to the terms of the contract changing midway through the year, i've been given the option by the phone provider to leave the contract early. would i be the asshole if i just cancel it without telling him? in my mind that's exactly what the phone company would do if you don't pay - turn off your service. but i also know this might be a little petty because i'm annoyed that he already owed me a lot of money when we broke up, that i wrote off just to get him to leave.",0.12
"AITA for not staying at a job I hate for my step-daughter?   

I (F51) have 2 bio kids (M24 & F21) and one step-daughter (F17). I am not at all close to my step-daughter. My husband (M49) and I live several hundred miles away from F17. My husband visits her at least monthly but I do not typically go with him (she has voiced that she prefers to spend this time with her father alone and I respect that). She does come stay with us on some holidays and a couple of weeks during the summer. When we do spend time together we get along fine ‚Äì it‚Äôs not like we dislike each other or that there is any conflict.

I currently work at a rather prestigious private college. I got a new boss about 7 months ago and since that time I have really disliked my job. Last week I mentioned to my husband that I can‚Äôt wait for my daughter to graduate this coming spring so that I can change jobs. The college has a wonderful perk where the children of employees receive free tuition ‚Äì my daughter is currently attending and my son received his undergrad degree from there. 

My husband asked what about F17? Until that moment I hadn‚Äôt even realized that she was considering attending. My husband and I had discussed it briefly right after we were married 2 years ago but nothing was said since.  My husband said that neither he nor his ex-wife had been able to save much for her education and if she was not able to go to my college for free her only alternative would be to take a ton of debt.  I told him I would not be staying where I am for another 5 years. He said I was staying for almost a year for my daughter ‚Äì which is true. I feel that it is unfair to ask my daughter to pay close to 3 times what a state school would cost or to change schools for her senior year. 

My husband said that if it were my daughter I would stay. I have to admit that he is probably correct. While I would hate it I would probably do it. But I am not willing to stay in a job I hate for F17. I am just not close to her. That is no one‚Äôs fault. No one did anything wrong ‚Äì it‚Äôs just how things worked out. My husband is understandably upset ‚Äì but I am not willing to commit to staying in my job for F17‚Äôs sake

A lot of things of things can change before a decision can be made. My situation at work might change. F17 might not even be accepted into my school.  I‚Äôve told my husband that he needs to prepare a Plan B. We have tabled the discussion for now and I have promised to spend some time thinking about it.

"AITA for not being okay with my dad going for walks with me? Background:
I(m16) take my dog for a walk almost every weekday when the sun goes down. I do it throughout the year even if it‚Äôs hot or cold, my dog doesn‚Äôt care because we live in a very mild climate. I go on the walks alone with only me and my dog, and I don‚Äôt enjoy anybody but us going because I talk to myself and sing out loud.

A couple months ago my dad insisted he go with me on a walk and I was very hesitant but we still went. When we got back, I was quiet and was rushing to go get ready for homework. He noticed and stopped me and asked if everything was okay. I told him I preferred going on walks alone so I can be myself and relax without feeling judged. I also told him that it‚Äôs not just him, I don‚Äôt like when my sister, or brothers go either. He said that he felt hurt by it and I told him he shouldn‚Äôt because I feel that way about everyone. Anyway some time passed and he asked again if he could go, and I thought I politely declined, but I guess I didn‚Äôt because when I came back he was talking about how he was going to do several things alone directly at me in a sarcastic way. Like how he was going to get a glass of water alone and little things like that. Well today my dog was being fidgety and was struggling to get his bridal on, and my dad said he could with me since my dog wasn‚Äôt going to.

"AITA for being pissed at my mum for wanting a pie after I gave birth So 7 weeks ago today I gave birth to a beautiful baby boy, my first actually. My partner stayed in hospital with me the entire time (3 days) 

On the second day after giving birth we decided to let my partners parents and my mum visit to meet bub before we took him home. My mum lives about 40 minutes away from us and the hospital we stayed in, and my partner offered to meet my mum about half way and bring her to us as she isn't the best driver and gets lost easily and he knows her driving long distances stresses me out.

About an hour and a bit into the visit I started to get tired and politely asked my partner to take mum back to her car as I needed sleep and so did my other half.

A long time had passed and I realised my partner wasn't back yet, once he returned he told me that on their way to take mum back to her car she had asked if they could pull off from the route they're on so she can get some lunch (a pie) 

Now this drive thru pie shop is always extremely busy.. it's one of those places off the highway that everyone on long drives turns off to go to. 

When my partner told me, he was a bit annoyed like I was because we were both exhausted and he wanted to get back to me and bub ASAP... and she knew this.

Also to note, my mum was very absent during my pregnancy and also fell asleep at an important ultrasound that I invited her to, in the hopes of her and I to bond more, so I suppose the pie thing just pissed me off more.

"AITA for getting annoyed when my gf tells me she doesn't want me to buy photographic art with female nudity in it because she feels threatened by it? Tonight me and my gf were in a team's call. We just had our regular chat and at one point I shared my screen with her showing her some pictures that were sold at an auction from the photographer Jan Saudek. I'm very passionate about photography and it's something I often share with her over the years.

At the auction website we came across a picture of a naked woman that was for sale. I didn't really like the picture it's subject except the bordering and it's main style which I wanted to show. After a while she said she didn't appreciate me looking at a picture like that. Especially not if it would be hanging in the house because she would feel threatened having to compete with another female.
I told her that it's just a picture and that my interests doesn't really have anything to do with a certain attraction towards this particular woman or any feelings of love I have for her at all. I tried to explain to her that my love for her and my passion for photography are two different words that have nothing to do with eachoter, but she said it's a feeling and that I'm not understanding enough. 

I said it was silly to be threatened by something like a nude portrait since it's just art to me and had no link to our relationship whatsoever. I tried to explain my thoughts to her what I like about it but it ended up in a long argument that went nowhere.

He lives in his own room and hasn't worked since September. He recently got his new job which pays pretty decently and we were all excited as we need to fix loads of things like the car, the house, vet check-ups, etc.

For context, He wouldn't let any of the cats in his room but he got really attached to two of them. They sleep in the bed, they eat in his room, etc.

How, on his birthday, he complained about not getting a party when he knew we were almost broke and he didn't work. How when my mom and I left for the New Year (we are the main caretakers of the cats) he basically did nothing for them. Not feed them, not clean their litter, etc. And how this isn't uncommon from him, she should know as she was married to him.

&#x200B;

It kept me thinking and I mentioned it to my dad and how he had to improve his cat caring abilities. He kind of did, would feed them or open their catio for them to play, etc. And he added the cats to his budget, except he only added his two cats. I asked him why only care for his and he said those will be his responsibilities when he leaves. I told him we fed him and housed him for free and if he could help with the house and cats it would be great but he kept saying he will only pay for his cats' needs and his desires.

&#x200B;

Told my mom and she had an ""I told you so"" moment. Explained how he won't change and she would rather deny him the cats than wait for either of them to get sick or worse due to his negligence. It aches me to separate the cats from him like this, but his priorities are not in the right place, and when he leaves we won't be there to care for the cats.

So, Would we be assholes if we deny him the cats?

I don't want his entire life (or wallet) to revolve around them but he seems to take our effort and care for granted, i I don't want to worry until it's too late.

Any info needed will be given.

Edit: Sorry i missed a huge piece of context as i didn't think it was necessary (not cat related) My dad was abussive to my mom and i until she left and then took me out (long story) that is why she isn't 'nice' to him. He has changed a lot, and i mean a lot. Which is why we let him in the house but his selfish behaviors still shine through. Also, my mom told me he being jobless isn't uncommon so imma add that to the list- Thank you to the peeps who let me know this pas important",0.1
"AITA for telling my wife that I wasn't going to change my daughter's diapers. Me and my wife have been together for 6 yrs and have a 1 1/2 yr old daughter. 

My daughter drinks milk on the regular basis. 2 weeks ago, she started getting explosive diarrhea, the one where it soaks through her clothes and diaper. 

I told my wife that I felt that our daughter was lactose intolerant. My wife refused to listen and still gave her milk. Again she had explosive diarrhea and my wife was confused on what was going on. She was convinced she had a stomach virus. 

This went on for a few days with me constantly telling my wife not to give our daughter milk. She would ignore me and tell me I was wrong. 

Yesterday my daughter stayed with me instead of going to her nanny. I wanted to test my theory and gave her no dairy products and behold, she pooped normally. I told my wife and she didn't believe me. 

I went to go get dinner yesterday and when I came back, she gave our daughter a bottle of milk. I asked why she gave her a bottle. She said she asked for a bottle. I told her that I was not going to change her diaper once she poopped because she's lactose intolerant and doesn't believe me. 

She asked how she became lactose intolerant out of nowhere and that I was just trying to get out of changing diapers. I told her ""no, I'm telling you whats the problem and you're not listening. I'm always changing her diaper after she has explosive diarrhea and it isn't fair.""

She tells me to grow up and to do my dad responsibilities. I don't think it's fair.

AITA ???

Edit: I made an appointment and she's going to see a pediatrician on Friday

Another edit: this whole sub is biased as hell.

Update: she turned out to be lactose intolerant. Also the 2 weeks of diarrhea most likely had to do with getting a stomach bug from her cousin the week prior.",0.17

"AITA for refusing to pay student loans that my in-laws said that they would take care of? I (M27) and my wife (F26) have been married for 5 years. We have been together since early high school. 

When my wife was deciding where to go to college, her parents offered to pay for part of her schooling. They were making $250k/yr combined at the time, but they ended up getting loans to help pay for her college. They had apparently done something similar with her older brother. 

Her parents decided to leave their high paying jobs to start a small business. Her father putting up most of his large pension to get things going. Now it‚Äôs a few years later and the business is not doing all that great. We found out that they had have not been paying the loans and they have consolidated them with her brothers loans. Her parents have told my wife and her brother that they would need to take over the payments. 

Her brother is doing very well at a sales job, so he has agreed to pay his portion of this loan. My wife and I have average paying jobs and have worked really hard to get out of debt. It would be a big deal for us to take on an additional $50k in debt. My wife is torn because she doesn‚Äôt want to cause any drama with her family, and I certainly understand that. We have a good relationship with her family. But neither of us want to take on this debt. 

The loan is in her parents name so we are not legally on the hook for it at all.  IMO, her parents are the ones that made the risky decision to quit their high paying jobs to start a small business. Especially when knowing that they have a fair amount of ongoing financial responsibilities that they will need to keep up with. My wife likely would have made a different decision regarding college had her parents not offered to help pay for it. Her parents currently live in a 5 bedroom house with just the two of them, and her mom drives a brand new $35k SUV. 

I feel bad for them and the situation that they are in. They weren‚Äôt super happy with their high paying jobs, so they wanted to go a different route. My wife and I just find it hard to feel responsible for this debt.",0.37

"AITA for being angry about a promised college fund gift that wasn‚Äôt as expected? When my son was born almost 19 years ago, my (very wealthy) parents proudly announced that they were starting a college fund for him and talked about it constantly to anyone who would listen. At the end of every year we would get an update on the growing tens of thousands of dollars in the account, and I knew that it would amount to more than enough to cover every conceivable expense in our low cost of living/education state.

As my son is entering freaking high school, my dad announces that he‚Äôs decided only to cover tuition. Um ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a little late to tell us that because we‚Äôre not even remotely wealthy and haven‚Äôt saved a dime for college because we didn‚Äôt think we needed to, but okay. (My dad offers no explanation, and they‚Äôre still living the high life.) Then it became three years of tuition. I start to panic. Then my dad decides to do a tuition fund and transfers ownership to me. My son gets into a top state school and it turns out my dad had only purchased ‚Äúcredits‚Äù for a second tier school, so now we only have enough money to cover two-ish years of tuition only. Then today I get some kind of tax form on the fund disbursement, and it looks like we‚Äôre going to have to pay taxes on it.

At the time I was upset by this and nervous since I had never lived completely alone in my life but I‚Äôve gotten used to it and I like having my own space. 

For someone who wanted his own space, my husband asks me to come to his often. A few weeks ago, I made an offhanded comment about how sterile and cold his apartment was and how I liked mine better because it felt like a home. Now, he‚Äôs decided to get some renovations done and he wants to live with me while he gets them done.

I was the only granddaughter and my godfather thought of me as a daughter. Their deaths were and ARE still very difficult for me. I'm still grieving.

Anyway, I just got into a fight with them both about how I'm still grieving and they wouldn't understand (I've lost a lot of friends and family growing up) my parents berated me saying I need to get over it, that it happened years/months ago. I explained how they don't understand but my father yelled at me saying ""You think I don't understand? They were my father and my best friend. I miss them more than you.""

We got engaged last October and we've decided to do a courthouse wedding in April, so we don't overshadow my sister at all. When it comes to kids, we've decided to start trying soon, which means I would be 5.5 months pregnant at her wedding, should all go according to plan. 


I spoke to a longtime friend about this plan, and she labelled it as ""pretty selfish."" She stated that by having my wedding BEFORE my sister, AND coming to her wedding pregnant, it makes me look bad, and like I'm trying to beat my sister.

"AITA for getting mad at my husband celebrating the lunar new year ‚Äúhis way‚Äù? Info: Feb. 1st was the Lunar new year. Throw away for privacy.

In the past, my (f28) husband(m28) and I would not do much to celebrate traditional holidays and that was fine. I am Asian and he is not. Since I haven‚Äôt been able to see my family for 3 years (they live in Asia and going there is very difficult now), I started to have a little holiday blues. Living in a pretty white area where nobody celebrates the lunar new year also doesn't help,

I talked to my family and friends and they said, why don‚Äôt you do something instead of waiting for the holiday to (not) happen to you. So I told husband, this year I will follow the LNY routine and try to do it like a (cultual) adult.

So the LNY routine includes a lot of work. The week before you have to do a big cleanse‚Äîclean everything in the house and wrap up all unfinished business and then decorate the house with flowers and other festive decorations. It‚Äôs basically like a culturally enforced deadline, if you don‚Äôt clean, bad luck will follow you to the new year. So that‚Äôs a lot of work but it made me feel better.

Husband helped with the cleaning, saying he can understand and will benefit from it, but he will not join me on flower shopping and other aspects of the preparation, citing that this is my cultural holiday and not his.

I thought this is fine. So for the new year, I got a lot of flowers, and run to Ikea to get stuff for house improvement and bought tons of Asian snacks. I also made a lot of good food.

Fast forward to today, the third day of the year of the tiger. Husband left his computer screen on and I got curious by the bright colors on it. He then showed me, ‚Äúlook, I‚Äôve been celebrating LNY all along. ‚Äù He then showed me this shop game he has been playing, and the shop is fully decorated and the MOST festive place on earth with all types of LNY decorations!!! The shop was surrounded by rows of beautiful red lanterns, guarded by a pair of stone lions, paraded by lion dancers and dragon dancers. There was a table full of traditional food like baos, the red carpet was stunning and he even just got a beathtaking Tiger as a new pet (in the game)!

So he‚Äôs decorated his shop with the LNY decoration FULL ON. I got very mad and felt betrayed, and said he lied to me. He said he‚Äôs celebrating my culture in his way and this way it is environmentally friendly and doesn‚Äôt involve actual shopping.

So here is where I might have been an AH, in anger, I said, if I knew you were gonna be like this, I wish I married an Asian person who would understand and celebrate with me! He got very offended and said I was racist and an AH for belittling and shaming him for his efforts and appreciation of the LNY. Just because he doesn‚Äôt celebrate with me doesn‚Äôt mean he can‚Äôt do it online with his online friends in the game.

AITA?

Edit: Some say they don't understand why I got mad. I got mad because I felt ... I guess almost jealous that he has this virtual place where he appreciates and celebrates the LNY, but in our house, he doesn't and acts like he has nothing to do with it. ",0.32
"AITA FOR CHARGING MY ROOMMATE/FRIEND A LATE FEE ON RENT I 21F live with my 19 F roommate and friend. To give a little backstory my friend will call her sky had some family issues and was forced to move in with her abusive boyfriend for almost a year. I bought a house around 6 months ago, knowing her situation I had no problem allowing her to move in and they had even broke up before she moved in and started dating someone new. We signed a lease to protect us both, in this lease it listed her ex was not allowed at my house (for her safety), she was not allowed any pets without consent, no over night guest without consent, and also she has 5 days to pay rent and then there would be a late fee. She had payed her rent on time for two months and then when it came to December she told me she bought to many present in November so she couldn't pay it all to me on time, this was the first time it happened so I said it was no big deal and it was fine and did not say anything about the late fee. Well January comes around and she doesn't pay me on the first when its due  and said that she would pay when she had the money again I didn't press the issue. It was the same excuse of Christmas she also said she doesn't have money to pay it, and then her having to pay her phone bill, and one of her family members back because she had been sued before this had been an excuse back in January as well.    
Well I am writing this because it happened again in February and I honestly was tired of it and I invoked my right to charge her a late fee. She only pays the equivalent of have my mortgage no utilities not wifi. I primarily buy groceries and when I ask for the money back its a fight. Her late fee is 10% of her rent and she only has a $45 late fee so I will allow ya'll to do the math. I was tired of the rent money she owed me being the last thing she is worried about. When I advised the late fee would be included in this months payment she went off on me, told me that I was being a bad friend because I was charging her a late fee knowing she didn't have money her telling me her phone will get shut off and that it is going to her her more than me, she then told me she would make the late payment with the fees and that she was moving out the following month. She cussed at me, tried to manipulate me and then threatened to move out because I was charging her a late fee. One of her family members even told me that she would try to manipulate me and to stand my ground because if I give in she'll do it over again. I am no ones mom and I don't feel like I should have to express why I did what I did it is the real world and even in an apartment complex there would've been the late fee as well.

My sister and I have had several problems in the past due largely to conflicting personalities. Just as an example a couple months ago she said in complete seriousness ‚Äú I know that as the oldest I‚Äôve set a pretty high bar for you and that must be difficult‚Äù. 
Anyways the problems with my sister really came to a boiling point when we both went down to visit my parents who live a couple hours away from us both.

When my sister arrived with my niece, her husband,and her two dogs I had been wrapping a present I had gotten for my  niece so I ran to the back room when I heard their cars so I could finish wrapping the present.

My brother (28) got married approximately 8 months ago. I (32F) didn't know his wife (32) beforehand. They've since had a baby.

She and I went out last week (first time - we haven't had too much interaction). She asked why my brother and I don't have a good relationship and I told her what I felt the issue was (caveated at the beginning that the convo would stay between us).

Today I got a message from him, saying I had gone out to bash him and he would never forgive me. He forwarded a message from her, in which she said ""your sister was right about you"". I called to find out wth was going on but he refused my calls. I called her, no answer. Text her that I've received a message from my bro about our night out and though I don't know what has been said, I wanted to give her the chance to explain before I sent my text to my bro.

AITA? I don't feel like I ""bashed"" him. I answered the question i.e. said what I feel about my bro e.g. I think he's rude. I also said good things e.g. he's very friendly and can be extraordinarily kind.

He's the first of us siblings to get married so this is all new to me. Yes, I could've said something vague and moved on however I decided to be honest and trust that it would remain between us.

EDIT 1 - What I said e.g. I think he's rude (to me especially) and selfish. Gave examples of why I think that e.g. him taking one of the family cars for days without telling anyone and not coming home, but when you tell him you're taking the car, he will get irritated because he was planning on using it later. Things of that nature. I didn't say anything particularly heinous IMO e.g. reveal some deep, dark secret (I don't know any of his secrets). Oh and how he causes strife in our family by liaising with my mum on things he knows are controversial and will affect us all but won't say anything to anyone else so it ends up being annoyingly unexpected. Example was bringing SIL (when she was his gf) to my bday party last year without telling me. He asked my mum. I was irritated because I had purposefully not invited friends to be Covid safe. I mentioned that because I was explaining that it's not that I don't like SIL (bro mentioned a while back that she felt that way), it's about his behaviour. I'm struggling because those are three things I said, literally. That's the sort of information I gave.

EDIT 2: I'm kind of pissed because (1) we agreed the convo would be between us and (2) I don't like that she apparently used it as ammunition in an argument with my brother (I'm assuming that's what happened - I have no idea). However, I'm alive to the fact that maybe I should've kept it vague and moved on, so I'm in the wrong here.

EDIT 3- *update*. Thank you to all who took the time to respond. Still not heard from bro. SIL messaged. Said they were having an argument and he was being incredibly rude to her, hence her comment. She apologised for mentioning our conversation, especially since we'd agreed to keep it between ourselves. Also acknowledged that I may feel now that I can't trust her. I accepted the apology. Told her that I don't want to be involved in their issues, particularly because of my relationship with bro. 

As far as I'm concerned, I made a mistake. Not convinced it makes me the asshole, lol, but I can see where I erred. Lesson learned and will keep it moving.",0.05
"AITA for telling my uncle that my coworker was speaking about him So I (20) started working at a small company, only 5 of us at the time of the story. One of my coworkers D (30) is a person who is very showy. The thing is she isn't always truthful with her boasting. D is an avid weed smoker and my uncle is a weed dealer. The thing is at the time she didn't know that I was his niece and she started saying that he keeps hitting on her but she doesn't want him because she's basically too good for him. I didn't let her know that I'm his niece. 

When I went home I spoke to my mom about my day which included what she said about my uncle. I left it at just gossiping about my work day but then 2 days later D is mad at me. I found out from the other people in the office that D was talking about how much she didn't like me and that my uncle had told her be careful what she says because the message gets back.  She connected the dots and realised that I was the one who indirectly told him because nobody else in the office knew him. At first I was OK with her anger because I did it and I knew it. But then she started spreading different stories depending on who she was speaking to. To the other coworker who had heard her say it she said that I had betrayed her but to the others she said that I made it up. Still I ignored her because I didn't really care. As long as my work wasn't affected I wouldn't fuss. Since I was new I need to get certain files from more experienced workers. I asked for files and she refused to give them to me. In the end I just went straight to my boss to get the necessary files but that didn't mean that I wasn't irritated at the interruption of my work.

She refused to speak to me even if it was about work and threw words at me every chance she got. Since I was technically wrong I just took it but AITA for it?",0.21
"AITA for calling my sister pathetic after she called our parents to complain about our other sister not offering her a place to stay? Throwaway since I don't need Sandra discovering my main account.

My wife and I are temporarily living with my parents while our house is being renovated. 

I have two older sisters, Sandra and Tia (fake names of course). Sandra and Tia are polar opposites: Sandra is the laziest person I know while Tia is the most driven and ambitious person I know. 

Tia finished her undergrad in 2.5 years due to the sheer amount of AP and community college credit that she earned in high school. She completed her neurosurgery residency in 2020 and is married to an equally brilliant corporate lawyer. Tia and her husband just bought a beautiful 7,800 square foot house. In short, she's doing extremely well for herself right now.

Meanwhile, Sandra attended attended 3 different colleges (both community colleges and 4-year colleges) in the 6 years following high school and still doesn't have a degree. Our parents paid for all of it and they're not exactly happy about her lack of a degree. Since dropping out, Sandra hasn't been able to hold down a job for more than a year. She's been jobless since March 2020 yet still does nothing but watch TV and post on TikTok.

Last month, my BIL (he has the most stressful job on the planet right now: ICU nurse) finally came to his senses and asked Sandra for a divorce. Thankfully, they had no children. Sandra called Tia and asked if she could stay at her house temporarily. Tia of course refused. Then Sandra called our parents to complain about Tia's refusal. (""I don't understand, there's no way that they're using all 7 bedrooms."") 

When Sandra was done calling our parents, I texted her to tell her that ""it's honestly pathetic that a 36 year old woman feels the need to complain to her retired parents about a situation that was caused by years and years of her own laziness."" Well, Sandra must've told our parents what I said because later that evening my mom said that I went too far.",0.94
"AITA for eating all the vegan options and leaving none to my family ? Let me explain. I'm vegan, my family is not. They were no big issues with that. I even cook sometimes for them because I'm the only one who can cook my old grandma's recipes for special occasions. 
I started to notice that since my family doesn't really understand why I'm vegan they started to eat without me. That's also not a big deal because since we were kids, i don't even remember having my family at one table at the same time besides holidays and birthday parties. The thing that bothered me is that they specifically started to hang out without me when there is no special occasion. They might not even invite me to cook outs where they will prepare BBQ. Usually, at these small BBQ gatherings, there has been always salads and potatoes. So, obviously i can join them if they keep the same dishes. But recently, there were no options for me at all. It was weird but i accepted it. Also, i have to mention, other than these small gatherings, out relationship is no different than before. 
Not so long ago I accidentally came in when they were ready to eat, so they invited me. I sat down, but they were no options for me. I went back in my kitchen ( we have 2 kitchens) and brought something to eat, just to be with them. When desserts were out on the table, the only thing that I could eat was fruits. Basically, i ate them all (they weren't that many). 
My dad didn't notice, but my sister got upset that i ate all the fruits. She said that it's not fair since she also wanted some. I told her that she ate cake, and chocolate candies,   and other things i couldn't. But she insisted she wanted at least one banana and one orange and it's not fair she doesn't get to eat any fruit just because I don't eat the other things due to my veganism. 
Basically, she's upset. And I'm trying to consider her feelings, but can't wrapt my head around the fact that she wants it all, and doesn't even think that I had to feed myself and those fruits were the only things on their table that i could eat. Is it such a big deal that I ate the fruits?",0.6

She soon started yelling at me and cursing at me even trying to grab it to sit down , but my leg grabbed it and prevented her from running with it.

"AITA for not making time for my partner? Me and my partner used to work opposite schedules. Now I moved my entire schedule around so we both work at the same time so we can spend every night together.

I play three games of dnd a week Saturday, Sunday, and Monday. They have two days off on Sunday and Monday. As a way to do a fun activity together I invited them to join and they were happy too. We played together for a while but due to anxiety around people they stopped playing. We get done at 5 and the first thing I do is ask if there‚Äôs anything they want to do or if they want to hang out. Sometimes we do sometimes we don‚Äôt.

We were supposed to go to the museum tomorrow but due to my game we couldn‚Äôt go early. I asked if they want to go a different day or later in the day but they refused stating I never makes time for them because my dnd is on their off days.

"WIBTA for potentially getting my neighbor sent to jail I have a question of ethical dilemma
Its a ""would I be the asshole"" situation
So my wife and I live downtown with our 2 kids, we live in a house that has 4 units, 2 on main level, 2 upstairs. 

Now onto the issue, and I will preface this by saying I've been incredibly patient and asked a handful of times if loud chores could be done at a more reasonable time of day and nothing has been rectified. 

So last summer new people moved in above us, all was good until about 4 months in, they who work from home during regular day time hours (e-commerce) decided that they were going to go nocturnal on me, so at like 2 and 3 am they will do their vacuuming, Stomp around like a herd of wild Buffalo and essentially just be incredibly loud.
Now more issues had started a few weeks ago after first big snow fall, we share a driveway and I shoveled it for 6 hours because of how much snow we got, not the slightest offer of help was given but as soon as I finished he came down, drove off then parked more so in the middle of the driveway forcing me to park half on my walkway which makes it difficult to even get into my truck, at this point is the first time I brought anything up, I was ghosted. 

Last night however was the straw that broke this camels back.
He ordered delivery at 4am and delivery (not the first time this has happened). Driver knocked on my door. Causing my dog to bark. Waking me, wife and 2 kids in the process, Then didn't even attempt to apologize. Also car was even more in the middle of the driveway when I got back up. 

One of the other neighbors complained about him last summer for partying right next to their bedroom window¬† every other night and property manager said to ""deal with it on your own"". 

So at this point I'm considering being an incredibly petty fucker but figure its warranted for my families well being, some time ago, he mentioned to me that he is not supposed to drive as he has 3 DUI's on his record and license is suspended. But now because of increasing disturbances to my families well being, I am contemplating calling crime stoppers on him anonymously for impaired driving as he is stoned whenever he steps outside, and I know he would be driving high. So i would be providing then plate number make and model direction headed etc. 

Now here is the where I might be the ass hole, because this would be DUI number 4, he would likely end up serving 1 year in prison, so reddit WIBTA for trying to get my family some peace and quiet as property management has taken a hands off approach by getting a guy sent to jail?

"AITA for saying I don't like a song someone's blasting at a public space? I go to this outdoor park with calisthenics equipment,  I've been there for over over 3 years. There's this guy who comes with his speaker and plays his music sometimes.  Some of the music I don't personally like and the little speaker makes a lot of things sound awful. His songs are just random, so it goes through many styles without connection.  I sometimes small talk with the guy things were generally cordial, even though he speaks loudly and has strong opinions on many things.

Last Saturday I was with my little kid as there were some children doing parkour exercises. The guy had what sounded like a new playlist. It was bad. I just didn't like any of the songs and it was making me uncomfortable.  For reference, many people to bring their speakers, and I've never had a problem with the music they play.

I asked him if he had changed the playlist, kind of like nudging him to understand I didn't like it. He said it' s 'new stuff'. To top it off there was someone else a bit farther with their own speaker. I was getting really stressed out. After one song started playing I just can't take it anymore and blurbed to him, in a friendly/joking tone, smiling, : 'hey, this one's horrendous, like, can you play something else?'. I thought we were close enough for him to take it the right way.

He flipped out. Started talking loudly. Said I had disrespected him. That he could play whatever he wanted and that I should wear headphones. I said don't worry about it, sure, got it.  He did turn off the speaker and it was great though.

But, he continued to argue. People were  looking and another guy started telling him to calm down. But he said I had crossed a line,  that he would never say that. I had supposedly called his music horrible (I didn't, only that song). He said I should wear headphones if I didn't like it. I replied quietly that it's a public place, and he's playing public music, and that maybe the public can respond. Also that he can us headphones himself. He can play his music, but maybe someone will comment on it, like I did.

Things were heating up too much and made me really uncomfortable to have my kid around this aggressive man. Like a fight may break if it continued to escalate  (and he'd beat me to pulp).  I just left and said I'm sorry for the inconvenience, do whatever you want.

I know the comment was a bit harsh and I maybe there's no way around it.

"AITA for wanting the master bedroom? My wife and I (F34)live with my FIL and we have to vacate the property we are renting rather quickly. Instead of looking for another rental we decided to pool our resources and buy a house. We needed enough space for us, our kid, my FIL and several pets. We found a house and are otherwise super stoked about our new place- with 1 exception; our future room is too small for 2 people and FIL is insisting on the master.

&#x200B;

More background- the loan for the house will be in FIL's name but my wife will be on the deed and we are paying the closing costs and any gaps. My FIL agreed to pay the mortgage by himself for the equivalent amount of whatever my wife and I pay in closing costs and from there we will split the cost. 

&#x200B;

My FIL spends most of his time in FL and when he is home, he is here for a week or 2 max. He will be moving to FL full time in the future and has said the house will then be ours. He insists on keeping his king size bed but doesn't have much in the way of furniture/clothes/belongings, etc. My wife and I on the other hand have quite a bit more in the way of furniture and belongings and our room just doesn't have space for all of our stuff. We are downsizing and we did some measuring when we looked at the house but didn't fully account for the severe slant in the roof in our room. We have been to the house twice since the 1st viewing and realized that our room is just not built for 2 people no matter how we configure things despite getting rid of large furniture and extraneous things to fit the space.

&#x200B;

Because my FIL is almost never here and 1 person, we think that we should get the master bedroom because we will be living in the house full time and are a married couple with twice the amount of stuff. We have been considering expanding our room to give us more space but I don't want to spend money on a reno when we're already spending a good portion of our savings to buy this house. Especially because it would be much more cost effective and reasonable to have him take the smaller room and downsize his bed. The room is perfect for 1 person and a queen bed but not 2 people with 2 of everything. 

&#x200B;

I feel guilty because the loan is in his name and we wouldn't be able to buy the house without his help (and vice versa).I'm having a hard time with the logic of him keeping the larger room that he'll not be in the majority of the time and the 2 of us being squished into a small room or having to spend the money to expand the room right away. We love the house otherwise and would be out some serious cash in earnest money and time if we were to pull out and try and look for something else in this terrible market.

&#x200B;

So would we be the assholes for insisting that us having the master bedroom is more practical given the fact that we will be living in the house full time, are a married couple and are also financially responsible for the house even though the loan is in his name?",0.96

"AITA for changing the names of my fianc√©e's Bluetooth speakers? My (40F) fiancee (43F) has had two Bose speakers for many years. They're identical in every way, so any time you have disconnected or forgotten them on a device you have to go through the whole process of inevitably tapping the wrong one first, then waiting for the connection attempt to error out in order to tap the right one. 

Both of us find this marginally annoying, and we've both done our share of ""Yeah I'll connect to the Bose- Dammit! One sec..."" over the years. I've asked her several times if she would rename them. She responds that it's pointless to rename them because they'd still look the same and we wouldn't know which one was which. The last time this happened I said that I'd just make one a hat and call him Herman. She ignored me. Probably because she was doing things that were actually important and I was dickering about Bluetooth speakers.

Many months later the speaker in the kitchen wasn't playing. I downloaded the Bose app on my phone and found that the speakers were badly in need of a software update. After the update I saw I could rename them, so I did. 

I put them both back where they were supposed to be and forgot about it until today. She went to connect to the speaker and sounded a little freaked out that her phone ""couldn't see"" the speakers. I realized that she just didn't see the name she was used to, so I said ""Oh! I renamed that one Herman.""

She was annoyed that I renamed it, and brought up again that they look identical. I showed her the underside of the speaker where I'd drawn a tiny hat and the name Herman. Then she realized that I must have also renamed the other one. She looked at her Bluetooth list and yelped ""You called the other one B\*tch in the Kitchen?!""

I laughed because we're both women and I'm the one who does all the cooking so yeah, I did think it was pretty hilarious. She did not. She says I'm TA because *I* renamed *her* speakers, I drew on one ""like a child,"" and I named one ""something stupid"" and the other ""something sexist \[...\] that anyone with Bluetooth can see.""

When she puts it like that yes I do feel guilty...but I'm wondering if it really rises to the level of aholery. I thought I was finding a cute solution to a mildly annoying problem. It's a very small drawing on the underside where nobody sees. Herman seems like a perfectly fine name, and I really don't think that our neighbors or friends are going to be offended that I'm repeating a sexist trope in my same sex relationship.",0.2

"AITA for telling my professor that it was ""interesting"" and a ""new experience"" working in a group project where persons didn't collaborate till the last day, then are called out during class? Title says it all really.

TLDR: had group project where nobody talked and told the teacher it was interesting working with people who don't collaborate much. Week later the two people who worked that night with me to complete the assignment were called out in class.

So I was in a group project where we had to do this creative writing project. After class I brainstormed ideas and sent them to our group chat. They acknowledged my answer and were seemingly interested. Next day or two I suggest/produce an outline of what we can do our project on since nobody else had made any suggestions. I basically wrote the story and all persons had to do was write in a particular paragraph, they didn't even see the message. I admittedly became lax too, because I thought the due date was next week than the coming week. So nothing happened then we are told the project is due today. Class goes by and I tell my instructor that ""its an interesting experience working in a group, where not everyone talks"" (or something to that extent) I was honest about our situation and mentioned to them that we will not get it in by the end of class. Prof. said I figured and extended the due date till the days end. So after that we got to work, that night two persons left the class, two did nothing and there were only three left myself included working on the project. We submitted it. Week later in class teacher mentioned a group project, and called out the two persons who stayed up with me and worked. Prof. went on to say that ""there were issues in some groups where some didn't work/collaborate well, we need to get it together \*\*\*\*\* and \*\*\*\*\*\*"" (not including me to make it seem anonymous, she singled me out by clearing  making it obvious it was me)  mind you these two are known to do okay in class. Instructor said too ""they may do well in class but behind the scenes they might not work well with others"" (something along those lines) Really just saying those two weren't willing to work and hard to talk to. But the teacher seemingly forgetting our group went from 7 to 3 and just blamed them. 

I kinda expected the teacher to keep it to herself, and to be humbly understanding that I want to do well in her class but its difficult to work with people who don't talk or engage. (only because I like spreading my work out and don't like working under pressure)

I then apologised after class to the group, mentioning how she mixed up my words and I was referring to those who didn't want to work at all. 

I now can't focus on my studies and lost some motivation, because I need to know AITA?",0.82
"AITA for telling my roommate she should move to the smaller bedroom? I (21M) rent an apartment with two other college students, Becky (23F) and Cindy (25F). The landlord is super easy going, and we hope to stay here for a while, maybe even after graduation. There are three bedrooms: Becky's and mine are roughly the same size, and Cindy's is a master bedroom about twice the size. 

Officially, there's three of us renting, but Becky's partner Mia (24F) is here more often than not; she lives across the road but hasn't slept in her own room in over three months now. Cindy and I don't mind, we're all friends and Mia and Becky had to hide their relationship from abusive family for 7 years, so I completely understand they don't want to be apart. Plus Mia is a great cook so I'm not complaining. Mia's roommates are moving to a different city at the end of May, so we've talked to our landlord to see if Mia and Becky could occupy a room together - the landlord said yes, and we're all super excited. 

The issue is that Cindy doesn't want to give up the master bedroom for Mia and Becky. They are alright with staying in the smaller bedroom, but it'd be cramped, so they'd have to sell some of their clothes and set up a work area in the living room. They also don't want to split rent evenly if they stay in the small room, which is fair, but an even split would mean we all pay a lot less and I'd prefer that, since I already work two jobs to make rent and I don't want to do that on top of school if I don't have to. Cindy doesn't work and receives benefits. 

We were talking about this in our group chat, and Mia and Becky said repeatedly they'd be ok with a smaller room and that they don't mind. Cindy said she doesn't want to move her antique handmade bedframe without her dad present in case she damages it, and that she doesn't want to give up the big room. I said that while I get that, and I get that moving rooms can be a hassle, it's not fair for Mia and Becky to be cramped for the foreseeable future, especially since I wouldn't want them to sell their clothes, or to set up an office in the living room when they could have a bigger room. I also said I would prefer to pay less rent. Cindy's position doesn't seem fair to me, as someone who's had to live wherever I could afford all my life even if the place sucked. It would be the good and fair thing to do, so in my mind, I don't understand why she'd refuse to. She also spends most of the day in the living room anyway, watching TV. 

There was no big argument or anything but Cindy seemed upset when I came home from work today, and when I asked what was up, she told me she was just ""having a bad day"". I suspect she's upset at me, but I still don't think her position is fair, and even though Mia and Becky have said over and over that it's fine and they don't mind, I feel like they deserve a master bedroom, and when this comes up again I'm planning on sticking to my guns.

Reddit, AITA?

EDIT TO CLARIFY: this decision isn't sudden. It's been planned for Mia to move in when her roommates move out since at least November, because we knew they'd be moving out in April. We just didn't discuss specifics until now. We all decided she'd move in - Cindy was included in the decision. 

Right now the rent is 800 for me, 800 for Becky, 900 for Cindy. An even split 4 ways (with extra bills/tenants insurance) would be 650 each. Mia and Becky are proposing 550 each for them, 700 for me, and 800 for Cindy, if they stay in the smaller room.

UPDATE: thanks y'all. I def overreacted there. I talked to Cindy, Becky, and Mia, apologised for being pushy, and made banana bread. We also discussed ways to better make use of the space and looked at new bookshelves online. They're all my friends so I didn't want to hurt anyone's feelings, thanks for making me realise I wasn't being fair.",0.79
"AITA for making jokes about an old friend group? So basically, the story starts about 3 months ago, when I was in a very bad mental state and would often play on a Minecraft server with an old group of friends. We'd been friends for a while, but it seemed like they were trying to distance themselves from me. One night I had a really bad mental breakdown and got very angry at a group of them, leading the entire group to ostracise me and not talk to me anymore, which nearly lead me to doing something very extreme to myself

Fast forward about 2-3 months and I'm now much happier with a new friend group and I've basically turned my mental health around and feel much better. I'll often make jokes with my girlfriend about that old friend group and how unhealthy it was and how I feel they treated me really poorly, however I'll get dms from a few members of said group, complaining and getting upset that I keep making jokes with them claiming I refuse to move on, when I already have. I feel like it's my right to make jokes about the situation since it affected me so personally, but that might just be me",0.93
"AITA for letting my friend move in with me So I (27F) and my bf of one year (26M) recently decided to move in together. His lease ends in less than a month and he's moving in with me because I live in a penthouse downtown. Recently a college friend called me (25F) begging if she could stay with me and if I could help her move out from her toxic bf(30M). He's always been extremely toxic (can't get into too much detail or else reddit will take down the post, but he's the type of bf whose gf ""falls down the stairs a lot"") the last straw was when he threw out her birth control pills and she realized she didn't want to be trapped having a baby with him. I talked with my bf about the situation and he said he didn't want her to move in for a number of reasons. I got where he was coming from but my friend is in a extremely dangerous situation that she desperate needs help out of. I decided to move her in anyway. I rented a uhaul and asked him to accompany me at her house because I was scared of what her bf might do to us if he came home and found her packing. He refused saying that he wasn't going to support me on a descion he didn't support. Fair enough, so I had to buy a taser and pepper spray just in case. Everything went smoothly and now she's moved in. I told my bf he was still welcome to move in, but she would be staying a while. I was expecting him to come around eventually but he hasn't. Instead he's been telling friends how I ignored his boundaries and invalidated his feelings by moving her in. Just last night we talked on the phone and he told me he didn't think he could trust me anymore and I ended up feeling like crap. I understand his feelings and why he's hurt but at the end of the day my friends life was in danger, his wasn't, and I know that it took a lot of courage and trust for her to ask this of me. And I've seen first hand how hard it is to leave toxic relationships and that a little support can make all the difference. That's what I made my descion on. I need some other takes on this by people who don't know either of us, so AITA?
Edit: when I told him she was moving in and why I wasn't asking for his permission I was informing him of the situation. When I was informing him is when he told me he didn't want her to move in. And i was honestly very shocked because I expected him to agree with me. But I never gave the impression that this was his descion to make, I knew I had my mind made up when she called, and that this was a potential life or death descion.",0.23
"AITA for refusing to forgive my boyfriend after a skiing incident? Me (20f) and my boyfriend (22m) got a gift from my dad which came as a full paid ski trip in an expensive historical villa. My boyfriend was really excited about it, as was I. The next day after we arrived, he wanted to go skiing for a bit. I thought we should postpone it for a different day since it may be crowded and there was also a chance to have a blizzard. He convinced me to go. He doesn‚Äôt speak the language around here so I had to do all the talking everywhere (well people here do speak English as well and so does he, he just refused to). We rented the skis and we started at a beginner slope since we both hadn‚Äôt skied in a long time. He was a lot worse at it. So the first couple of times I had to wait for him for a while to finish. After we both got our game back on, we decided to try to go up on a bit more complicated slope. He assured me he was ready for it. We went to a rope lift kind of thing and we took it, but when I got to the top I discovered that my boyfriend wasn‚Äôt coming. I took my phone out and called him. He fell and said he got stuck in snow and lost one of his skis. There wasn‚Äôt anyone at the top who I could ask for help so I had to go all the way back down. Keep in mind there was also a bit of blizzard. I completed that slope so fast I was because I was scared for him. I managed to get down, bought another ticket and told the guy that was there that there was an accident and my boyfriend fell. He just said ‚ÄúWell tell him to come down‚Äù and when I told him that he‚Äôs stuck, he told me to go up to help him then. So I did that. I got up, stopped where he fell, took of the ski that was still on his leg, found the other one, got him out of the snow, and started walking back. When we got to the exit, the guy offered us another free go at the rope lift, but I refused it, since I thought he was obviously not ready (he didn‚Äôt even make it a quarter of the way on the rope lift), and because I was really tired. He got mad at me for refusing (even though I paid for absolutely everything and he didn‚Äôt spend any money on the trip whatsoever, and gave me the silent treatment all the way back. I was incredibly tired and my feet hurt from the hurry-skiing-to-save-his-butt, but he was walking fast and not waiting for me. I wanted to call a cab, and he just left me there. Once I got home, he was already there and I refused to talk to him for obvious reasons. Then he got mad at me for ignoring me and started texting me from the other room his ‚Äúapologies‚Äù. Now he doesn‚Äôt seem to understand why I‚Äôm mad at him and just expects me to blindly forgive him. He also texted me ‚ÄúI forgive you for how you treated me today‚Äù. I don‚Äôt understand what I even did wrong in the first place.

"AITA for closing my work early to go home after I waited 30 minutes for a patient who was supposed to show up, even though the sign on our door says we are supposed to be open? I had arranged for a patient to get fitted for a custom made orthotic last night (Monday) at 6pm (our clinic is open until 7 pm Mondays) However, as I was alone in the office from 5:30 onward (my boss had left as he was done appointments and didn‚Äôt need to be around) I waited until 630 for this patient to show up, and she didn't. I tried calling, but it went straight to a ‚Äúthis person is not taking any calls‚Äù message and then would hang up. I decided, well she was supposed to be here at 6, so I'm going home. 


When I got to work the next day, I told my boss I waited 30 minutes for this patient but she didn't show up so I left, which he was fine with since I tried to give a courtesy call, and he doesn't like me being alone at the clinic for too long when its dark. Well, I opened my email to a very angry message from said patient at 6:50pm saying she's here and no one is in the office, and that the office is closed even though it says we are open until 7 pm.

"AITA for telling my brother he's gay and doesn't know it yet? My brother is a bully. But only towards attractive guys, and especially to gay guys (or at least guys who come off as gay). And having witnessed some of the bullying, it does appear to have a bit of a s*xual undertone to it

My brother also had what were young crushes on guys and would compliment guys all the time and talk about how attractive guys were, until he realized that was gay and it all stopped.

I saw his Instagram for you page (which is personalized to your interests) and there were quite a few shirtless guys and edits of handsome male celebrities.

After an incident recently that he got in trouble for, I told him he was gay and in the closet. I told him that he has always been gay and he'll have to get over it.

"AITA for taking back a kid's birthday gift? Ok, I know how it sounds but hear me out.

My (28F) daughter S (7F) and I were invited to a birthday party for a friendly acquanitances kid, M (8F). I took my daughter toTarget where she picked out a gift.

When we got to the party, we put the gift on a table with others.. My daughter went to join the kids playing outside and I went to mingle with the parents. 

Thirty minutes in, S approached me in tears. She said that M and her older siblings were being mean and calling her names (i.e. dumb blonde and retard - my kid is in speech therapy for a slight lisp). M's mom heard what was said and told M and kids to be nice. They apologized and playtime continued.

20 minutes later my kid again comes in again upset. M's mom rolls her eyes and again goes and talks to the kids. When she returns she starts talking about how ""her kids are 'hard' (as in tough)"" and ""aren't used to sensitive kids that can't handle their sense of humor.""

This is where I start to lose it. I know this mom. She has a 9yo trans daughter that is constantly bullied at school and daycare, and my kid was invited partially because she isn't a bully.

I decide I'm done with my kid being bullied and we're leaving. I go to the back yard where the kids are, just in time to witness M PUTTING GUM IN MY DAUGHTER'S HAIR. 

I tell her she should be ashamed of herself for bullying one of the few kids at daycare that treat her and her siblings with nothing but kindness. I tell her that if she were my kid, I would cancel the party. M smugly says ""I'm daddy's princess and I'll do whatever I want."" 

Seeing red, I go back into the house and take the gift my kid selected for M. M sees me and begins screaming ""MOMMY STOP SHE'S TAKING MY GIFT!!!!"" Her mom asks me what I'm doing. I tell her Im taking back the gift due to the bullying. Mom then tells me I'm being dramatic, the comments were jokes and the gum was an accident. I tell her to stop excusing bullying, M is an entitled brat, and then leave with S.

Later that night the mom posted about this on SM and I was bombarded by messages from her family and friends saying how awful I was to ruin a bday, that M spent the rest of the day crying in her room.

"AITA for telling my roommate about license plans? Hello, throwaway (kind of first acct but I read posts a lot w/o an acct and see that word a lot so I‚Äôm using it here. Never had Reddit before so I‚Äôm sorry if I‚Äôm not using it properly) Please be nice I‚Äôm doing my best I swear. 

I (22) have struggled w/ getting my license for yrs. My family didn‚Äôt want to do the full hours required of driving with me, & I couldn‚Äôt  afford instructors bc I pay for ubers to work. 

I finally managed to move out bc an old internet friend actually offered to help me. Part of what convinced me was that they said that I could just ‚Äúwalk in and they‚Äôd give me a license over here‚Äù. 

I‚Äôm a pretty specific person, so I doubted that, but they insisted whenever I asked abt specifics. They got mad at me when I asked and said I just needed to walk in with documentation & I would get it. I still didn‚Äôt believe them but they dismissed me. They said that I have trouble trusting ppl so I just tried to listen to them and believe it. They said they‚Äôd drive me to the license center, but later got upset & refused, saying they weren‚Äôt going to babysit me anymore. 

Before this, they also said that they would drive me to+ fro work so I could save money, and all I need to do is pay for gas, which I was fine w/. Later they said they couldn‚Äôt take me to work bc they would be at work, and told me I‚Äôd have to pay for ubers. Now I‚Äôm spending abt half my paycheck/wk roughly, sometimes more if I have mandatory OT (which they won‚Äôt pick me up for) on just getting to work.

Since this is my 1st moving out experience & they said they‚Äôd help me, I asked abt adult stuff like how to officially own a car. They got mad at me. 

So I‚Äôve been trying to figure stuff out on my own. Finally managed to get everything in place & went to the center & they basically said I have to start all over again. 

My friend keeps saying I just treat them like a chauffeur/Uber, & it made me really uncomfortable bc I‚Äôm not trying to be selfish. I‚Äôve been trying to avoid conflict during rides. 

Their car started breaking down recently so they told me I need to pay for ubers. They lent me some money that wasn‚Äôt enough for the rides that I apparently need to repay. Now the car is struggling again apparently so I have to pay for double my rides basically, which I definitely can‚Äôt afford.

I informed them of the stuff the center said I had to do (bc I wanted to show I was still trying to get the license to ease their burden) while they talked about this stuff and they said they told me that would happen. I said I don‚Äôt recall you saying that and they said you never do and that they didn‚Äôt need to know my whole thought process on everything. We‚Äôve barely talked for months before this & I thought I was just communicating but maybe they‚Äôre right?

So Aita? I feel like I am but I want to know what AH thing I did that makes them so mad at me when we speak. I feel like it‚Äôs not having the license & being too wordy honestly..",0.71
"AITA for reacting badly to my former bff dating my separated husband I (35f) had 3 kids (15m,14f,13f) with my first husband. He had an affair with his friend and got her pregnant and she made him choose between me and my kids or her and her baby in front me and he chose her. That put me in a hard place because I‚Äôve been told I am strong and stubborn person but this really made want to break down. I stayed put for my kids who were 3, 2 and 1, but there wasn‚Äôt a moment where I didn‚Äôt want to give up. 
Things got better for because I reconnected with a friend from high school and he was going through a messy divorce with 2 daughters, we started dating, I got pregnant and we got married and have 2 kids. His daughters see me as their mom and I love them and my son sees him as his dad and he sees him as the son he‚Äôs always wanted. About a year ago we moved back to our hometown, we started to having problems and separated. We haven‚Äôt talked about divorce yet but have decided to see other people to kind of find a solution to whether we should divorce or not. We live in different houses and we only share custody of the kids we have together but still have a close bond with our stepkids. An ongoing problem is that he right now as we are separated he is giving me his unwanted opinion on how to raise my kids. I have a tough love parenting style but it‚Äôs not bad and it‚Äôs how I was raised. He doesn‚Äôt agree with it but my kids have turned out great and when they make stupid mistakes I want them to understand why they shouldn‚Äôt do it and that there are reasonable consequences. 
On to the problem like I said we started seeing other people and have both gone on dates. Recently I met up with one of my closest friends from high school, we distanced ourselves because went to colleges in states that were far apart from each other. I told her about all my problems from my first marriage to my current one. She acted very supportive. But right under my nose she started a friendship which turned into a relationship with my separated husband. I learned this through my step daughter. When I heard I was angry and I wanted to blow up. I felt the feelings I felt when my first husband left me, betrayal. She was wanting us to be best friends again but was seeing my husband of whom I am still legally married to. They finally decided to tell me but of course I dropped the bomb and blew up on them. She told me she still wanted us to be close friends but I told her I can never be friends with her because I trusted her and she broke it.

"AITA for leaving my girlfriend passed out on the floor? I share a house with two women and am in a relationship with a woman who is a good friend of my housemates from long before we moved in together.

My girlfriend suffers from anxiety and has severe panic attacks. She has a child from a previous relationship which didn't end well. She has a restraining order on her ex.

She was at my house the other day and received a call from her ex and went into the bathroom for some privacy. It was a short conversation and she raised her voice throughout. There was a short period of silence and then a loud thud.

I immediately went and knocked on the door, calling her name. When there was no answer I opened the door and saw her sprawled out on the floor. She had had a panic attack and fainted as a result. It was not the first time it had happened.

I have had first aid training so I checked her pulse, put her in the recovery position (legs raised on some towels) and opened a window to let in plenty of fresh air. There was nothing more I could do at that point so I left the bathroom and went into the kitchen to get some ice for a cold compress.

My housemates who had been in the yard walked into the house and saw her passed out on the floor and freaked out. They ran to her and started shaking her and splashed some water on her face. My girlfriend regained conciousness and was helped to her feet.

My housemates started yelling at me for just leaving her on the floor. I told them I had done all I could but it didn't matter. They say I should have stayed by her side until she recovered. She was passed out for only a few minutes.

They have managed to convince my girlfriend that I abandoned her in a time of need and it has put a serious strain on the relationship.  AITA?

UPDATE: There is a lot of focus on whether or not I followed correct medical procedure. Im not a medical professional and acted on the information I had received in a brief first aid training course. I suppose the bit that I object to is the assumption of people I live with and know me well is that I would just callously leave my girlfriend lying passed out on the floor due to indifference.

"WIBTA if I don't notify management about lack of coverage? Yes, this is for tonight, so this WIBTA will turn into an AITA in about 3 hours. 

My work has 3 departments. This only deals with two. We'll call them Information and The Floor. I work in the Floor as a supervisor. There are three supervisors scheduled on shift tonight. We'll call the other two Mandy and Kara.

When we call out, an employee on The Floor takes the message and e-mails it over to Information (and our supervisors) who update our master schedule.

Lately, they haven't been looking for coverage or communicating issues to the second shift Floor supervisors and just expecting us to adjust our schedule without complaint or notice. 

I am usually the midshift transition that comes in before the start of second shift to get everything settled. I leave my job at 10:30 PM. The other two come in slightly staggered at 3:00 pm and 3:30 PM respectively. Mandy comes in at 3:30 PM and she called off; Kara came in at 3:00 PM

She and I haven't mentioned it to Information or the supervisors that there is a gap in coverage from 11:30 to midnight. There will be people at work, just no supervisors.

It's becoming a chronic issue that we are expected to shift around our lives without inconveniencing management about it; Kara's ticked because they do this to her constantly and she needs to run to the grocery store before it closes at midnight. I'm tired of the scheduling team not doing their jobs and causing me issue after issue.

I'm feeling a little nervous about this because I'm one of those people that has a sense of responsibility even when it's not my job.

The dog was leashed so I initially had no problem walking in front of it get to the other swings. When my youngest crossed it's path though, it barked and lunged. Thankfully the man had a tight enough grip that the dog didn't get my son. The man said ""He just wants to play.""

My youngest wanted to use the other available ""baby"" swing but I wasn't comfortable with him getting that close again. Even if the dog wasn't intending to bite, it was as tall as my son and had definitely heavier so a jump or scratch could injure him. So I said ""We can't use that swing right now.""

"AITA for screaming at family for making me miss out on a big opportunity I work in the film industry in LA as a Production assistant on big budget shoots and as a cam-op/editor and many other roles on low budget productions.  

I‚Äôve been doing PA work, creating videos for up and coming artists, small companies and working on low budget films for about 2 years since I graduated from film school. 

Ive been waiting for a big break in my career and had my shot at that ruined by family members yesterday. I was at my family‚Äôs house where my moms side of the family was with us for dinner. My phone was snatched out of my hands so my 9 year old cousin could play games and not bug the people cooking.  I was told to deal with it and I reluctantly agreed to avoid an argument.  


10 minutes later I heard my phone blowing up with texts and a FaceTime started coming in but my cousin immediately declined the call. I told him to give it back but he refused and ran to the bathroom and locked the door.  

I knocked on the bathroom door and kept pounding harder as he refused to open it. My mom told me to relax but that only pissed me off because I literally had my property stolen from me to entertain a child while I was receiving calls.

I hoped to god that it wasn‚Äôt anyone important but Lo and behold when he came out and I snatched it back from him (not without him whining ‚ÄúhEeeEyYyyY‚Äù) it turned out to be the manager of a major artist I met and shown some of my work trying to reach out asking if I could shoot an impromptu video for this major artist that night. 

I tried to call him back but he texted me they found someone else. 

At this point I was so angry and confronted them. 

The conversation went like this 

Me: Hey remember how I told you I met (artists name) manager at a party last week? 

Mom: Yeah, and? 

Me: Well he was just trying to call me but I was denied access to my phone because it was stolen from me and locked away to entertain (cousin) 

Aunt: Oh come on I really doubt he was trying to reach out to you, there‚Äôs thousands of people who do your job in LA but he called you over all of them? 

Me: Actually he was and he did reach out to me over all of them. I‚Äôd show you the call log and texts but your inability to parent your child is making me wonder if you also have an inability to read

I was called disrespectful and told to apologize. I snapped and screamed ‚ÄúWHEN I TELL SOMEONE TO GIVE ME MY PHONE, THAT MEANS GIVE ME MY GODDAMN PHONE RIGHT NOW!!! I OWN IT, I PAY FOR IT, I USE IT TO COMMUNICATE WITH FRIENDS WITH AND FOR WORK. IT IS FOR ME, NOT FOR A CHILD TO USE SO HIS MOTHER AND AUNT DONT HAVE TO DEAL WITH HIM!! YOU JUST COST ME A BIG OPPORTUNITY THAT I HAVE BEEN WORKING AT FOR YEARS BECAUSE OF YOUR LAZINESS AND THIS KID‚ÄôS ENTITLEMENT. ‚Äù 

By the end of my rant my cousin was crying, my mom and aunt were looking at me wide eyed and jaws hanging. I was told by my mom to get out and not come back until I was ready to apologize to everyone 

Thing is I don‚Äôt plan on apologizing so I guess I won‚Äôt be going to see family at that house anymore.

"AITA for insisting that ""it's just a scratch""? I hit a parked car last weekend, in the parking lot of a restaurant. Obviously, it was my fault. It was a tight parking lot- cars in front of me, pedestrians behind me- and I misjudged the distance. This is the first time I've ever hit anything and I felt terrible. It left a scratch on the bumper of the car I hit and a matching one on the front of my car. I wrote my name and number on a neon orange post-it note and placed it under their windshield. I also parked next to them so they knew I hadn't left.

Ten minutes after I sit down, the owner of the restaurant comes in and announces that someone at the front was looking for the owner of a \[color and model of my car\] with the license plate \[my plate number\]. So I go the front and am met with an angry woman who tells me, ""you need to come outside with me, you hit my car."" I replied, ""I'm very sorry. I'm Tadwinked. I left a note with my full name and contact information.""

She explained that she hadn't seen one. I took the note from under her windshield and gave it to her. We exchanged insurance information. I apologized again she left.

Today, she called me and told me that she had her car appraised for damage and her mechanic told her they would have to remove her bumper to see if her parking sensors had been damaged. I was surprised. ""I mean, it's a scratch,"" I replied. Definitely not the best or most polite thing to say, but it was my honest reaction and I didn't say it in an attempt to be rude.

She was not happy with my response. ""It's not just a scratch! You damaged my paint!""

I didn't want to antagonize her, so I told her, ""I'm sorry for being short. You caught me on my way to class. I'll relay this information to my insurance when I get home.""

I understand that it is fully my fault for damaging her car, and what I said wasn't great. But I also feel like she's reacted disproportionately to this from the beginning. I'm not minimizing anything when I say it was minor cosmetic damage. (A single scratch, about four inches.)

AITA for insisting it was a scratch?

ETA: I'm going through the proper channels and handling this with insurance, that was never a question. I'm asking AITA for telling her it was a scratch, which it seems like I am it. Even if I hadn't meant to be rude, it was an unhelpful thing to say and I can understand that making her angry.

I do not know why she contacted me directly.

I was actually on my way to class so I was distracted and probably came off as so.

**UPDATE:** 

Talked to my insurance again. She never put in a claim. I'm just going to let my insurance deal with hers and not interact with her again. ",0.36
AITA for confronting my brother (27) and his GF about stolen slices of my bread? Grab some popcorn and buckle up. [deleted],0.89
"AITA for calling my disabled brother horrible things? Me again. 
Text translated from my native language to English by google translator. 
My brother was in a motorcycle accident almost 7 years ago. It was a very serious accident, 50 days in a coma in the ICU and 1 month in the normal hospital room. Sequels that will stay forever or take many years to get back to normal.
 It affected my life and my brother's in an absurd way. Due to my brother's medical expenses, they could not pay my psychologist (I have been diagnosed with severe depression by a specialist since the motorcycle accident). And my brother got really bad, his grades dropped a lot and he repeated the school year. 
My brother (the one who had the accident) was always an asshole, but at the time of the accident he was an asshole defended by my parents. He always thought he was better than me. He had better grades, he had a girlfriend, he was healthier, my parents' golden boy. And since the accident, I've stood out more. Even though I didn't study, I passed first in a contest for an internship and passed again in another contest, without studying at all (it wasn't luck, I have a great memory and I'm intelligent, but an extremely lazy intelligent person). I worked and went to college, so yes, I outshone him and became my parents' golden girl.
Past year, My brother had a huge improvement and went to a college in the city, but there was always someone to pick him up. It was my turn and I ended up being 10 minutes late because I went to buy my medicine before going and unfortunately I ended up late. I arrived at the appointed place and he and a few other people were there and, in a loud voice, he called me a retard, an imbecile and a bunch of mean things in front of all those people, who were clearly listening to our interaction. In the car, he kept yelling at me saying I was an unbearably crazy depressive. I let it go, even though my mother scolded him afterwards. The other day, I didn't want to do something he wanted to do at the time he wanted to, so we got into a fight and he said the following words, without changing anything ""you're just a fat depressive that nobody likes""
 I'm not one to respond much and use a physical characteristic of someone to offend. But I was extremely offended by what he said the day before and at this point I was very upset. So, hot-headed, I said ""I may be a fat depressive, but at least I'm not useless disabled like you"" 
My other brother intervened and stopped the fight there. My mom ended up knowing about the fight, just what I said to him and called me a heartless person and someone extremely bad 
I regret it but...

"AITA for not sharing a bonus? Hey howdy! So my job offers a great referral bonus.

After referring Brad, I told them I‚Äôm trying to get Chad on board, and asked them to encourage on their end as well; and specifically noted ‚ÄúUnless you want to pursue the referral bonus for him then by all means have at it‚Äù and I was given the go ahead to pursue the referral bonus for Chad.

"AITA for telling my BF he is a burden ? For context my BF(48M) and I(22F) met 2y ago in a psychiatric hospital. We were both there as a result of severe depression. When we saw each other there was an immediate attraction. We were not aware of our respective ages at that time. We only found out later.When we left the hospital we decided to give it a try. We had made a list of pros and cons including our age difference and of course our respective emotional baggage. We decided to be there for each other as best we could without losing ourselves along the way...

3 months later and following some very bad news, I shut down and decided to ask to be re-admitted.This was the 3rd time in less than 6 months for me. Realizing that,I decided that I was not fit to be with anyone right at the moment. I felt too fragile and emotionally numb.Over time this would hurt him. I explained it to him and put an end to the relationship, which he did not like.He began emotionally blackmailing me. Very worried I informed his ex-wife who refered me to his SIS (his brother's wife).She said : ""He is in need of attention, it's probably nothing but it's becoming painful to deal with. We are tired of him"". This reminded me of what my parents would tell me when I was a child. I decided not to tell him about it. My boyfriend has no real friends. He has his brother, his sister-in-law, his ex-wife and his kids. Knowing this i gave up the idea of breaking up. 

 Months went by & we took together bad habits(lack of communication, alcohol etc...). In the summer of 2021 I had ended up in the hospital again. I had crossed paths with people who were using alcohol. At one point I ran away from my parents (where I live) to ""party"" non stop for 3 days. During my stay (in the hospital) phone calls with my boyfriend often ended in arguments. One day when  things were going better between us, he told me about his worries during my runaway. He had contacted  everyone in my contacts (friends whose names I had mentioned here and there) to see if they had heard from me. He could have stopped there but no, he told me that among all the people he had contacted only my best friend had been worried too. I told him that there was no need to continue talking about it but he did, giving me the names of those who had not answered (""You see your friend Myriam she left me on read when you disappeared"".) It was like a cold shower. I hung up.

But my blood was boiling, I was in pain. I had told him not to go on with more details after he dropped that bomb on me and he did it anyway. I sent him a text message still boiling with rage: ""You know the trouble I'm in and you knowingly decided not to protect me when that's what I did for you"". 
He didn't apologize but asked me when exactly I had done that, it was too much and I told him: ""Your brother and sister-in-law are fed up with your crises, you are a burden for them"". 
He didn't say anything. 
Since then, even though we are still together, there is a heavy weight between the two of us. So AITA?

Edt : For the age difference we both look closer to 30. He really is nice and but I guess we bound other mutual trauma. We decided both to give it a shot after going points by points about why it was a bad Idea we didn't just fell into each other arms. The blackmail was him crying for help not a manipulative thing.",0.36

Friend: Idk what ur issue is with me but when I ask you to get me something you don‚Äôt.

I asked for $1.20 For milk and you said you had no money, same as yesterday. And you havent been talking to me. idk what the fuck your issue is but solve it.

Me: idk where this came from. I DIDNT have $1.20 for milk. I took money out of my savings so I could order myself food today. I never said I hated Sarah OR Emily. I don‚Äôt have any service to text you and ask if you want anything. I HAVE been talking to you, I was with you and Kira for most of lunch yesterday. As for today, no I didnt start a conversation but you didnt say anything either. You didn‚Äôt have a problem with me when I last saw you and now this?

F: you know my issues with Sarah. And I didnt say I hate her. You can take money out of ur fucking savings to get them food but not for me? Same with the drink you gave Sarah. You bring one to school everyday but never give it to me. Even when you get another drink from McDs or something you still won‚Äôt. But you can give it to her?

M: Me getting people food is a nice gesture. You shouldnt EXPECT me to pay for your shit then get pissy when I dont have the money for it. You never pay for your own food, either I buy it or you steal it. Youre my friend, I‚Äôll buy you lunch SOMETIMES. But dont get mad when I need to save money.

F: Yeah I steal it cause my so called best friend is getting shit for other people that don‚Äôt even talk to her. Im paying back kira tomorrow. I was supposed to pay you back but fuck that.

M:Me buying food for other people has nothing to do with you. I buy you food. Youre just ungrateful

F:Fuck off or I will block you on everything.

F: If i wasnt grateful I wouldnt say thank you or pay you back. I don‚Äôt get as many shifts as you

M: To pay him back for stuff that‚Äôs FOR YOU.

"AITA for telling my new boyfriend to fuck off? Clickbait title, I know but I didn‚Äôt want to make it too long. 

I(f26) have had a neighbor who loves to gossip with me and my mom. We‚Äôve lived across from each other for 13 years, and I love this man! 

Sparky (70s M, nickname, he‚Äôs an electrician and I honestly never learned his real name. We just called him that.) was an amazing person. We‚Äôd talk, wave hello, brought each other plates after thanksgiving, all the neighborly stuff. I‚Äôve known him a long time so I really considered him part of my family. Other neighbors came and went but he was always there. 


Sparky waved to me one morning while I was getting mail, and he was off to have a walk with his adult son. He never came back, suffered a fatal heart attack on the trail. I was devastated. 

Well it‚Äôs been about a year and I started dating a new guy (Nate fake name 35M) and somehow we got on the topic of neighbors. I brought up sparky. I started crying because well, I miss him. Boyfriend was ok at first but as I continued reminiscing he asked my why I was so emotional over a man who‚Äôs name I never really knew. 

I just looked at him and said ‚Äúfuck off asshole. I didn‚Äôt need to know his name to know I cared about him.‚Äù He left, texted me that I was irrationally upset. I‚Äôm starting to feel as though I overreacted so I just want to hear unbiased opinions before I respond to Nate.

Edit: to add, I did know my neighbor well. His kids called him dad, he had no other family and every single other person who I heard interact with him called him Sparky. I‚Äôve spent time with him but it just never seemed like a thing I needed to know, I didn‚Äôt even think twice. He was always just ‚Äúsparky‚Äù.

Also, I didn‚Äôt scream at him, I feel like I made it seem like I just completely freaked out.

EDIT2: it‚Äôs 10pm where I am (5ish hrs after the original post) and I just wanted to give a light update. I never responded to Nate first because I planned to sleep on it before I made any arguments. He ended up texting me, apologizing. He said he was genuinely confused about what the hell I could feel for someone who‚Äôs name I didn‚Äôt know. I let him know that not knowing his name didn‚Äôt make me love him less, and he seems to agree and has apologized many times, saying he realizes what I meant. 

I went on to tell him that I was sorry for calling him an asshole. I don‚Äôt want to be calling him names and I‚Äôd feel defensive if he called me names too. Everything seems to be fine as of now and I‚Äôm glad we were both able to admit our faults.",0.07

"AITA for not wanting to go to a dinner with friends? So about a year ago one if my (31F) coworkers (M) got his dream job and left our workplace. We were all a bit sad because M is honestly the nicest human alive and always so positive. We tried to organise a farewell dinner for him but where we lived kept going into lockdown so M said its ok he didn't need one.

A few of us have kept in contact with him, mainly myself and N as we were the two he was close with at work. I messaged M a few days ago asking if he wanted to have a catch-up dinner now restrictions have lifted and everyone is vaccinated and he was happy to as he missed people at our work. 

The next day I was talking to N about it and sorting out where and when,(we planned to only have at max 5 people go as M has social anxiety and we didn't want to overwhelm him after so long), well one of our co workers, S, overheard and invited herself to the dinner claiming that she was M's best friend and that we couldn't plan it without her. The thing about S is she thinks everyone loves her and is friends with everyone (except me i have made it clear we are not friends and I am professional at work with her but I dont like her). 

I found out later that day that S had taken upon herself to invite half of work (about 30 people) and change the venue. I messaged M asking if he was ok with the new details and he said he was. 

I told N that given the new changes I dont think I will go as I have bad social anxiety and would probably just sit there quietly all night. S is complaining I'm ruining her night on purpose and a few people at work have told me to just suck it up and go.

"AITA for not wanting my SO to get a job that would make him a hypocrite? My SO was hired in as a line worker at a factory, but within a couple months, has moved up to working as a hi-lo driver with a 4 dollar pay increase. He seems to like his job, and I am very proud of him for it. He's doing all of this, though, to pay off the college courses (electrical engineering) he's taking to eventually be a journeyman. 
The problem came when he texted me, telling me he was offered a job as a semi-truck driver for double the pay, but would still need to get his CDL. He's incredibly talented behind the wheel so I don't doubt the offer. I told him that getting a CDL would be a great idea as a journeyman, but I think it's messed up that a job I originally wanted, but didn't pursue due to his concerns for my safety, is now fine and dandy for him to get. 
I work strictly from home and run a business that doesn't allow me to be gone for longer than a day. I gave up my dream of being a truck driver to do this, so for him to then respond with ""Then get a CDL"". completely misses the point that it would be a waste of time and money since I no longer need a CDL. 
Due to the significant pay increase, I would bite the bullet, but given he has less than a year left in his classes before he graduates, this feels incredibly disrespectful. 
To clarify some things, we've been in a 12 year long relationship and met during high-school.

"AITA for calling my brother dirty and telling him what to do? Apologies for mobile formatting. Using a throwaway because my family might know my main account.

Before I explain the incident, some context.

Personal hygiene has never really been a personal priority for my brother (25m). It became extremely noticeable a few years ago when he would go a few days without showering, would forget to brush his teeth for a while or not put on deodorant, wouldn‚Äôt always change his clothes, etc. 

However, the past 2 months have been unbearable. Normally I (19f) just ignore his lack of hygiene because he spends most of his time in his room but it‚Äôs become impossible for me to do so lately.

As of now, he hasn‚Äôt showered in at least 7 days; he hasn‚Äôt brushed his teeth in over a month; I have seen him in the same clothes for 2 weeks; he has definitely not been using deodorant.

I‚Äôve been having to hold my breath when talking to him or be facing away lately. Today it was so bad that even though I was, no exaggeration, 6 feet away from him I could smell him.

Now for the incident: he was talking to me while i was writing an essay so I was already on edge from the stress of university homework. But his body odour was so nauseating it just made me snap. So I interrupted him and raised my voice at him and said ‚ÄúCan you PLEASE go wash yourself at least before you talk to me! You‚Äôre dirty and you fucking stink!‚Äù

I guess he got defensive because he started yelling back at me and calling me a cunt among other things but I just didn‚Äôt give a fuck in that moment. I just kept saying he was dirty and telling him to go wash himself, etc. (I was yelling at this point). 

We had continued fighting for about 5 minutes before my mother told me to back off (I used this as an excuse to leave since the smell was becoming too strong).

Later, my mom comes to tell me that I was out of line and that as the younger sibling I shouldn‚Äôt be telling my brother what to do. I told her that that was why I didn‚Äôt say anything at first but at some point enough is enough. She told me I was rude and combative and should never have yelled. She told me I should‚Äôve just given him a ‚Äúgentle reminder‚Äù. I defended myself by saying he is a grown ass man and should be capable of cleaning himself without being told to.

It‚Äôs been a few hours since the fight and my brother has not showered or anything and i refuse to speak to him until he does. My mom is telling me that I‚Äôm the asshole for picking the ‚Äúwrong hill to die on‚Äù.

So AITA?

Edit: I know it‚Äôs early for an edit but I see a lot of comments mentioning this so I will address this: my brother does NOT have a mental illness or anything else that would stop him from showering. He has seen a therapist before, but he does NOT have depression. He has anger issues.

Edit 2: I guess I wasn‚Äôt clear enough, but this has been an issue for a very long time. Yes, this is the first time I really said anything, but he has been regularly told by my dad that he needs to clean himself regularly and be more hygienic.",0.19

"AITA for reaching out about my mental health behind my parents' backs risking my dad to lose his job? tw: mention of s*lf h*rm
sorry for any mistakes this is my first time posting. I'm feeling very guilty and need to know whether I should. 

I (17F) have been struggling with my mental health for the last few years, due to various 'smaller' reasons combined. Then the pandemic hit, and everything went from bad to worse leaving me with frequent heavy anxiety attacks and some bad coping mechanisms. 

About a week ago I had a heavy anxiety attack at school. One of my teacher noticed something was off and asked my to stay after class. She asked me if everything was alright, I lied and said I was doing fine just a bit tired. She told me she didn't quite believe that, and that she had been worried for a while. She just needed me to be honest with her so she could help. And she said she hated to ask but if I could show her my wrists as apparently a weird bloodstain was showing.. At this point I pretty much broke down. 

When I calmed down I begged her to please not tell my parents, to which she agreed. This is a key point because my dad works at the school I go to so she knows him. I explained to her what was going on, carefully tip toeing around mentioning home. We had quite a good talk, she comforted me, said she would see if she could arrange counseling and we would talk again soon. 

Two days later I got home to my parents wanting to talk to me, clearly upset. My teacher ended up talking to teacher 2 who is responsible for student matters (very understandable seeing as I shared some heavy stuff) and voicing her concern about my home situation because of how badly I didn't want my parents to know and me avoiding the topic. Well teacher 2 told her I was being dramatic seeing as she has known my father for years (they worked together a lot) and he is not that type of person and informed my parents. (according to my dad) 

My parents are quite unhappy about everything. they're mostly mad that me going around saying stuff like this risked my dad to loose his job and I should learn to consider the consequences of my stories. I tried to tell them that I was just so scared of them finding out and that they couldn't deny home hasn't been great lately. But they weren't having any of it and told me that what I did isn't okay and unfair to our family, mostly my dad and I should think about the damage I have done. (honestly I don't recall the exact words, there was quite some screaming and crying) 

I feel so guilty, I didn't even think about what this could mean for my family. I was just so scared to disappoint them, to not be a good daughter, and I didn't want to worry them on top of plenty of their own problems. 

I feel like a mess and the guilt is really getting to me. I never meant to risk my dad's reputation and his job, I feel so selfish and guilty. but I have no one I could tell any of this, and I feel like I'm losing my mind. So AITA?",0.12
"AITA for having a loud sleep over on my roommates birthday and ruining his party by yelling at him? Please read the details before making your judgment

I (21m) have lived in a house with my roommate ""Kyle"" (24m) for 2 years now. Last Sunday was his birthday. He told me he was going to his parents house on Friday or Saturday and staying for his birthday. Friday morning I wished him an early happy birthday and he thanked me. By mid day Friday I text him asking ""hey are you leaving tonight or tomorrow?"" He never responded so I just think he had already taken the bus over.

Since I had received no communication and had not seen or heard him around the house at all I assumed I had the place to myself. Saturday I sent one more text saying ""hey man idk if you left yesterday or today but if you're still here just a heads up I'm having a friend over"". No response so I assumed he was busy at his parents house. It wasn't unusual for him to not respond to texts while he was visiting family.

So I invited my best friend ""Mae"" (21f) over, we decided to have an indulgent night since I was getting over a break up. So we get high (legal here) order in pizza and wings and play some music and talk and laugh all night. It was really nice and it made me feel a lot better, we stayed up til about 4am and then pass out on the couch.

At about 9am we're woken up by the doorbell ringing, before I can even think about getting up to see who it is kyle comes storming out of his room, me and mae look at eachother in surprise because neither of us thought he was home. He starts yelling at us about how we kept him up all night and how we trashed the place (there was pop cans and pizza boxes but it wasn't like I hadn't planned on cleaning that after mae went home). He said his parents were at the door with cake to have his birthday party here and that we ruined his special day.

As I was sitting there trying to process kyle says ""are you gonna get off your ass and clean up so my parents dont think I live like a pig?""

I'm not an aggressive person, I'm usually pretty scared of conflict but I snapped ""no, you are a grown man and you couldn't manage to tell me once in the past 3 days that your plan changed? And even after I texted you I was having someone over you spent the whole time just sulking in your room instead of coming outside and using your big boy words to tell us you were still here and that we were being too loud for you? I'm not cleaning shit for you, let's go mae"". And we left out the back door. We got in her car and went to her place.

I stayed at maes place for Monday and Tuesday, and then I came home, kyle has been making it clear that hes home but ignoring me, I did text him Wednesday that I was sorry for yelling, he never responded though I can see he read it.

I do feel bad about yelling at him on his birthday and leaving instead of cleaning.",0.09
"AITA for basically telling my sister to get her life together? **Background:** I (29M) have two older sisters (32F and 39F). My (32F) sister, ""Bella,"" has not been very responsible with her finances and her financial decisions are now affecting my eldest sister (""Lucy"") and her husband, because she owes them money. 10 years ago, Lucy and her husband co-signed for a 10k loan for Bella's college tuition. Bella dropped out after a year and now 10 years later, hasn't paid off any of the 10k, she just pays the interest every month.

Bella moved to Portland 5 years ago to start a new life. I don't blame her, life back here has not been the easiest for any of us.

Without going too deep into it, because there is a lot. Our family situation growing up was rough, and my dad was a real AH to us and our mom.

**Fast forward to today:**

Earlier this week, Lucy mentioned that her and her husband are starting to look for a house, but shopping for loans has proven really difficult because they have that $10k loan that hasn't been paid off. Now they just want to pay off the $10k so Bella can just pay them back without the interest. 

We see stories every day on Bella's instagram of her going out to eat, going to shows and getting tattoos. Whenever Bella comes to visit, we are always spotting her cash, or paying for her flights or her car rentals. It seems like she always has money to go out and do whatever the hell she wants, but depends on us to help her financially when it comes to things she would be able to pay for herself if she just budgeted better and got her priorities straight.

We have tried to talk to her about it in the past when she comes down to visit, but it always turns into an argument and she gets super defensive about it .

I called Bella to talk to her about this to try and see if I could get through to her. 

Her response was ""I live my life the way I want to because it's the only thing that keeps me from being depressed."" I didn't really know how to respond to this, because we really do just want the best for her. 

I told her I understand that this is a hard conversation and I'm all about doing what makes you happy but it has to be within your financial means. Her response to all of this was ""I'll do my best to pay off the loan"" and that was that. I offered to help her look at her finances and help her budget but I don't think she's going to take it. I know that it must feel shitty that her little brother has to have this conversation with her but I think she needs a reality check.

I'm now blocked from viewing her stories, and it feels like she's not acknowledging her actions and is just gonna continue living her life the way she wants to and ignore the situation all together. I feel pretty bad about the whole thing and have been back and forth on it, wondering if the way I approached her was too harsh.

AITA?

Edit: My eldest sister agreed that I should talk to her about this bc she knew she wouldn't be able to talk to her without getting angry so that's why I took it upon myself to initiate the conversation.",0.05
"AITA for telling a coworker they suck at their job? Working in the collision repair industry I have met a lot of interesting people. Some genuinely care about repairing the vehicle to pre loss condition and others are just there for a pay check. This coworker is the later.

Long story short, our boss was on vacation this week and gave instructions to the advisor in charge to not give this co worker any new work until he had finished the work he already had. Over the course of the week this co worker has made comments to other co workers about the work they have and complaining he‚Äôs not making any money. (We work flat rate, the more you get done the more you make) Just about every car he has repaired has had an issue, and he refuses to fix them. 

Today an Audi he repaired returned from the dealer (who was fixing another issue he refused to address) with a coolant leak. He let the car run and told the advisor it was fine. The advisor then asked me to look at the vehicle. I found quickly that an overflow line had not been attached properly. The line is a hard plastic line with a spring loaded clip that holds it to the radiator. 

Seeing me working on the car he came over and I showed him the issue. I told him it was loose and he said he was positive he installed it correctly. I said obviously not because it‚Äôs loose. I walked away but overheard him tell the advisor I broke the line. I turned around and told him to stop making excuses and stop complaining. I then told him not to worry, his Daddy will be back to fix his fuck ups next week. (Our boss is constantly having to step in and fix his mistakes and when he does everyone refers to him as Daddy.) I told him I‚Äôm tired of his fuck ups costing me a bonus for production if our numbers are within an allowed window. (Returns under 10%) I told him he‚Äôs a hack and he should go back to pretending to be good at his last occupation because clearly being a collision tech isn‚Äôt working out. 

So, I kinda feel like what I said needed to be said. Everyone else is tired of dealing with this jerk off.

Am I the asshole?",0.24
"AITA for reporting the delivery guy for making his child do the work for him? Throwaway acc

Ok so I recently ordered some food from this delivery app, I had always ordered from it and never had any issues really, but this time when the order arrived there was a little boy (maybe around 12 years old) at my door delivering my food. I was so confused at first, he gave me my order and then ran towards a motorcycle where a man was, and then they drove off. I was so shocked, I immediately contacted the app‚Äôs support to ask them how they can allow child labour, and I reported the delivery guy that was making the kid do the work for him. The app‚Äôs answer is that their drivers work autonomously and they have little control or whatever bs answer but that they were going to investigate. I told my boyfriend about it and he said I was exaggerating and being a ‚ÄúKaren‚Äù, he was genuinely mad that I reported the guy because ‚Äúmaybe he couldn‚Äôt leave his kid alone so he brought him along to work, its basically just driving around town in a motorcycle‚Äù. I completely disagree, it‚Äôs literally child labor, but it caused a huge fight because he thinks this guy might lose his job because of me and honestly maybe he should lose his job so he can learn not to make his child work, he‚Äôs a kid he shouldn‚Äôt be on the streets delivering food!  I even thought about reporting the company aswell for ‚Äúhaving little control‚Äù and basically allowing child labor to happen! AITA here?",0.76
"AITA for yelling at my mom? I(16) was with my older brother(25) at the table eating with the rest of my family. He has a tendency to keep his phone volume all the way up and always shows videos to my stepdad and family. 

As always, he was showing videos at full volume. I told him atleast 4 times to lower his volume. He ignored all times. I told him one last time and my mom started yelling at me that I‚Äôm in the pissy attitude all the time and that I never Shutup. She only acts this way when my older siblings are at the house.

I obviously got mad and started defending myself that I told him 4 times already and he didn‚Äôt listen a single time. She wasn‚Äôt letting me talk so I yelled at her. She yelled back to stop talking to her that way and told me if I keep yelling at her that way, I wouldn‚Äôt be able to go on my field trip tomorrow. So I shutup and I‚Äôm now here writing this. I feel frustrated because they always use the excuse that she is my mom, so I have to shutup and listen, but was it really necessary to say all of that?? Was I wrong to yell at her?

"AITAH for not letting my cousin ""play"" with my Legos? Ok so this happened last weekend and I'm just catching flack for it now. Last Saturday, I was asked to babysit my cousin (m 9) 'mark' we'll call him. Mark and I have never had much of a relationship (I'm a very reclusive person) but family is family.

So when he got here, I gave him the tour. While we were doing the tour, he saw inside my office. What he saw was a room lined wall to wall with shelving stacked with assembled lego sets. I love lego, been collecting it forever. I'm less creative so I just build the model, then if I really like it, I make room and display it. If I don't, it gets bagged, and tossed in storage. Some sets I keep unopened on display that I'm particularly proud of. One I have is an old lego star wars set that goes new for like, over 400 dollars. We didn't really talk about the Legos because I assumed a 9 year old knew enough to at minimum, ask before touching someone else's stuff. I was wrong...

So anyways, the evening progresses just fine. We put on a marvel movie (he was going to see the

new Spider-Man tomorrow so we watched the first two) then I let him play some games on my ps5 for a few hours. Ordered a pizza, went to bed at about midnight. Typical fun Saturday for a 9 year old. Kid was actually really fun to hang out with honestly. When it was time for bed, I sent him upstairs to do whatever bathroom stuff he had to take care of, got him settled in bed, turned out lights, went downstairs to sleep.

I woke up at about 10am to the very recognizable sound of lego bags being opened and dumped on the floor. Sealed lego bags... I was groggy so I didn't think much of it but when I got upstairs to check on mark, he was in my office on the floor with (thankfully) a smaller cheaper set I had recently bought, opened and he had started putting it together. He looked up at me and you could clearly tell he knew he fucked up. I asked him what he was going. He said ""I'm just playing with Legos. I didn't think you'd care"" I told him that he should have asked me first and that was incredibly rude. He's lucky that was an inexpensive set as I have several more expensive ones. I told him to box it up and put it back where he found it. The rest of the day was short as I had to take him home. I took him out to McDonalds to get lunch then dropped him off at his parents house.

Well today I got a call from my aunt screaming at me for chastising her son and ""how dare you not share your toys what are you 4? "". I tried to explain the situation but she wasn't having it. She called my mom and now my mom is also pissed. I didn't think I'd done anything wrong but I feel really bad now. I'm worried I scared mark. I found some of my disassembled sets that I didn't really have space to display and couldn't resell, and boxed them up and dropped them and the one he'd started (I bought a new one for myself) off at my aunts house with a message. But I feel like I didn't actually do anything wrong here. So I'm conflicted, AITAH reddit?

Edit: for clarity, i didn't tell him not to touch the lego, this is true.  However, i did leave the door open to my office because i have a cat who basically lives out of that room so it was impractical to lock it off. I never have guests haha my apartment is not designed to host people.  The only reason i babysat mark was because everyone else who could watch him was also going to the birthday party. 

I also didn't show him the room in the tour per say. You literally cannot go upstairs without seeing inside. My poor judgement had me forgetting he was just a kid and of course a lego room was going to be enticing.",0.12
"AITA for asking my dad to clean the washroom Hi, ok so I(f14) was sitting at the dinner table when my parents started complaining about how dirty the washroom was. They said I should clean it up, and because I kinda agree it‚Äôs completely gross I agreed and started cleaning up the bathroom. Now this bathroom is really really gross, (dirt on the walls, stained marble, something akin to fungus growing on the sink idfk like I wear a mask to clean this place up). Now later on I was talking to my dad about how I thought he should get me some white paint so I can repaint one of the walls. He refused (not because I‚Äôm unqualified but because he doesn‚Äôt want to go out and buy white paint) and said that it wasn‚Äôt a big deal and it shouldn‚Äôt bother me that the wall looks the way it does. I said that he wouldn‚Äôt understand because I was cleaning that room for hours and it was really bothering me. He said ‚ÄúI use it everyday (the bathroom) so of course I would know‚Äù. He then said something along the lines of how me and my sister should take turns cleaning it up. I said he should also be within the rotation for cleaning it up because he uses it everyday. He got really mad and said that no he shouldn‚Äôt be cleaning it because he was the reason we got to use that room in the first place (because he bring in money I guess) and that it was ridiculous for me to suggest that. We argued for a bit after that, and I sort of dropped it but I‚Äôm still fuming. 
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm the asshole. I also hope/ believe you guys will agree w me.

Edit: I guess cuz you guys wanted to know. I do the laundry as well as the dishes, clean the table (these are jobs that are normally singular to me) and help clean up rooms when asked. Idk how much housework my dad does, he also helps cleaning and fixes stuff around the house I suppose? So no this isn‚Äôt the only chore I‚Äôve ever been asked to do. I‚Äôm not sure whyd you assume it was but alright‚Ä¶

That being said I think you guys actually raise an interesting point. If he had said that it was only fair as a means to balance the chores I would‚Äôve been more receptive. It‚Äôs only because his response was essentially ‚ÄúI let you live in my house‚Äù that I didn‚Äôt understand his reasoning. It‚Äôs pretty refreshing to see the conflict from am objective perspective.",0.36
"AITA for getting offended when my roommates keep shooting me down? this is SUCH a non issue compared to other peoples problems here, but i genuinely can‚Äôt tell if my anger is valid or not.

so i‚Äôm a huge movie person. i love movies and shows, i have a letterboxd account, the whole shabang. my taste in movies is a lot of stuff like tarantino, coen brothers, oliver stone. very actiony type movies. i‚Äôm very passionate about movies.

my roommates are not as passionate (they didn‚Äôt even know who martin scorsese was and insisted he was not a household name lmfao) and tend to like movies such as chicago, legally blonde, national treasure, hitman‚Äôs bodyguard. nothing wrong with those movies, there‚Äôs a time and place for them, but they‚Äôre just kinda mainstream to me and they lack the exciting and complicated plotlines i usually seek out (except legally blonde, that movie fucks). additionally, my roommates NEVER step out of their comfort zone. they are very tame and vanilla people who hate anything that‚Äôs not squeaky clean and palatable. very close minded in terms of what they like.

normally we butt heads with picking a movie (and i‚Äôm usually outvoted bc it‚Äôs 3 against 1), but i don‚Äôt make it a big deal. but last night they really got on my fucking nerves. we were talking about movies and i suggested intolerable cruelty; without even letting me describe it, they literally had never heard of it before, one of my roommates laughed and was like ‚Äúthat sounds terrible‚Äù. i was kind of offended bc i didnt even get to explain it yet, and i said that it was kinda fucked for her to just shoot me down like that, and it was almost like she shot it down just because i suggested it. then she rolled her eyes and was like ‚Äúnot everything is a personal attack on you god‚Äù, then i got MORE hurt.

my other fucking bitch of a roommate jumped in after that and was like ‚Äúhey, remember when i watched the big lebowski with you? i HATED that movie. i didn‚Äôt wanna tell you, but i did not understand why anyone would like it. ask liz, i complained about it so much‚Äù

and i was just like‚Ä¶. bro? you just said that to hurt my feelings???? what the fuck??? and they continued being dismissive about how i was offended.

later that night, one of them did text me that i was right in saying that they did shoot down my ideas a lot, and they‚Äôd try to incorporate my ideas more, which i appreciated. but i‚Äôm still pissed. now i‚Äôm just overthinking it. i don‚Äôt want them to think they can just disrespect me like that. they don‚Äôt have to like what i like, but just don‚Äôt be a dick when you express that.

AITA for being offended by this? or is it not that big a deal?

EDIT: i am getting unreasonably mad at these comments so i‚Äôm gonna put these here as qualifiers ig

1. i never said or implied that i think my taste in movies is better. it is just different. i like legally blonde!!! i like chicago!!!! that doesn‚Äôt mean they are not mainstream movies!!! mainstream doesn‚Äôt equal bad. sometimes i just want a bit more of a darker movie a sit back and laugh type movie.

2. i have never bashed the movies my roomies suggest. some of u have and will contest that for some reason, but idk what to tell you. i literally have not bashed their movie tastes to them. i understand taste differs.

3. my roomies came home today, apologized, and said that i can pick a movie to watch tonight. they specifically acknowledged that they are always quick to shoot down my suggestions. they recognized they were being dismissive and hurtful towards my interests and apologized. 

4. i am shocked at the logic exhibited here. i literally challenge you to quote ANY part of my post where i am pretentious, i imply that i‚Äôm better, etc. i‚Äôm genuinely curious to see what passes as pretentious. i don‚Äôt see how saying that i like the big lebowski and oliver stone flicks makes me pretentious. it‚Äôs just. what. i like.

final edit: a lot of focus on the film intolerable cruelty. it is a rom com about lawyers starring catherine zeta jones and george clooney. oh my god. google is free",0.92

"AITA for yelling back... I (23 F) just got picked up by my boyfriend (33 M) from work (with McDonald's) and while driving home we were listenin' to my Pandora.

H: ""Just quickly look at it."" At this point he seemed annoyed but still amused by what he was talking about.
M: ""What do you mean?. Look at what""
H: ""Just quickly look at it."" 
I'm clearly confused at this point... and he's not explaining anything. And I hate repeating myself and I hate people repeating themselves. I don't know it's always just pissed me off.

"AITA For asking my cousin if he'd prefer for me to ""whip a tit out live""? Due to the local plague my family started weeking video chats on zoom. We used to have weekly get togethers so it makes sense. We eat together, have a chat, and then say goodnight. Pretty simple.

I have two kids. A 2.5 y/o and a four week old. Due to the baby my toddler has upped the amount he's nursing, so both kids are currently every two hours ish, but I generally go with the flow and occasionally its different. 

The past three family calls have been difficult. I have no intention of trying to nurse my baby with family watching, so I turn off my camera. One particular cousin gets really annoyed by it. You know, we're on video to see you and all that.

No one has offered to help direct conversation away from me. Every time I explain I'm just feeding my baby, but I guess that isnt enough for him?

Last night I did the same thing - turned off cam for the little one (and then toddler, because sharing is caring). He went on another rant about how they dont come here to stare at a blank screen, they want to see me, yada yada.

I then replied ""Would you rather me whip out my tits live for you all to see?""

He was shocked to silence I suppose. I turned my camera back on anyway. They all had the joys of witnessing a toddler and a baby nurse for twenty minutes before the call was eventually ended. 

People were upset, naturally - claiming I could of told him calmly and all that. I disagree. I've tried in the past and it doesnt work. At least this way he's hopefully quiet for good. 

Several people told me how uncomfortable I made the situation, but I told them to take it up with him not me.

Overall its caused some issues. My wife thinks its hilarious, which I have to agree a little, although I'm now not sure if I should of been kinder about it for everyone else present?

"AITA for asking partner for time alone even though we only see each other on weekends? My partner and I live 3 hours away from each other. We have recently gotten into arguments because I have asked for time alone once a month. Currently we only see each other on weekends because we live far away from each other. We spend weekends together and are in different cities during the week.

I work 50 hour weeks and wake up every weekday at 5 AM so I have very little energy to do much on weekdays after work. My partner is self employed with no set work schedule.

My partner says that I should be able to sacrifice a little and doesn't understand why I want this when we only spend weekends together.

I feel like they can't understand why I am asking this because our work schedules are very different. My partner works for himself so his schedule is much more flexible and he has energy to do things on weekdays and feels like I should be able to have my alone time after work.

"WIBTA if I ask my roommates to completely stop hosting parties I (F21) live in an on-campus apartment with 5 other girls (ages 19-21). I like going to parties but I'm not the type to party every single Friday and Saturday night and all my roommates are. There are usually a lot of parties in the senior housing section at my college so there are always a lot to go to and I usually go once or twice a month but I leave around 1am to go to sleep and my roommates stay until 3-4am. They're usually loud coming back home from the parties but I can deal with it bc they're not loud for long. In daily life I tend to go to bed around 10:30-11pm and be up by 6:30. I'm a morning person and I tend to be most productive doing my homework in the morning and most days I like to go to the gym right away when I wake up and generally I just really like being up early which means I go to bed early. Most of my roommates will sleep until early afternoon the day after their parties.

Last semester they hosted some parties in our apartment and it was annoying but infrequent enough that I could deal with it. This semester they have been having parties in the apartment every single weekend so far and sometimes they have parties both nights. It goes until I would say 3am on average and my noise canceling earplugs help but don't get it quiet enough for me to sleep. I literally will be about to drift off and people will start screaming right outside my door and sometimes I've had people I don't know bang on my door close to 3am. If I had to deal with this like once a month I could be ok but it's been happening at least once every weekend since early January. During this time I can barely leave my room without getting drinks spilled on me which sucks when I'm in my pajamas and I'm just trying to go to the bathroom.

I talked to them before about it and told them they need to end the parties earlier in the night and they always say yes and they're sorry but as soon as they get drunk they get extremely carried away and they forget.

I know they're having a good time and it's their college experience. And my early bedtime is pretty uncommon for a college student (but also if I had it my way I would be going to bed and waking up even earlier). I would definitely feel like an asshole if I  ask them to completely stop having parties for the rest of the semester but asking them to compromise just ends up in them getting carried away when they get drunk.

The gentleman behind the desk was clothed, of course, but he didn't call the police when he saw us, so I figured we were in the right place. He directed us to the pools out back where we met with the rest of our group. We hung out for a while, then sat down and ordered dinner.

One of our group was a first timer, like me, but he kept his clothes on. He asked me, ""This is your first time here?""

""Yes,"" I said.

""You're my hero!""

""Why?"" I said, confused.

""Because you're naked.""

""Oh, my God!"" I gasped in feigned horror, frantically trying to cover myself.

""Shouldn't have told him,"" the guy next to me said, shaking his head.

That was fun. After dinner, instead of going back to the pools, we all kind of went separate ways. I had never been here, so I wanted to look around. I saw a gym, worked out for a bit. Then I saw what looked like a dance club, so I went in.

And it was karaoke night. The DJ, dressed like a cowboy, walked up to me and offered me a catalogue so I could choose some songs to perform. I found a stool and picked two songs. I remember it was dark and hard to see anyone. There were only two people ahead of me in the queue, both were clothed.

Then it was my turn. It was the tallest karaoke stage I'd ever seen. Usually, it's just a raised platform about a foot off the floor. This one was at least four feet high, with steps. From my new vantage point on stage, and the lights on me, I could now see more people as couples came out onto the lighted dance floor and danced as I sang, which I thought was a nice compliment.

I also saw that everyone on the dance floor was clothed. But I didn't think anything was wrong. When the DJ spoke to me, he must have noticed I was naked. I saw no signs on the door telling me I had to dress.

I finished my song, got some applause and waited to perform my last one. As I waited, my friend found me. He explained that since the regulars live at this resort year round, they have little chance to dress up, so they like to dress up to go out.

As we rejoined the group, we talked about what we did. And one guy got irate with me, claiming I was disrespectful, and that I should have worn something like everyone else. I protested there were no signs on the door and no one said anything to me. But he said I should have done what everyone else was doing, especially since I performed.

"WIBTA if I, a queer person, ask my aunt if she's secretly also in the community? TL;DR I worry that my aunt is part of the LGBTQIA+ community but has never had the words to talk about it.

So my aunt is not particularly close with the rest of my family, including me. No bad blood, just not much contact. We speak at Christmas and that's about it. 

My family have always said she ""was never that interested in relationships"" and ""was never bothered by boys"". She's old enough that where we live there wouldn't have been the words to describe or general acceptance of wlw or anyone grey/demi/asexual. She's in her 60s, lives alone, always spends holidays at the same friend's house, and as far as I can tell has a very happy and fulfilled life, so I'm not worried about her wellbeing being at risk. Just that it's nice to have the words and space to talk about your life and relationships, and I'd like to give her the chance to do so. And potentially even give her the vocab, as the rest of the family certainly don't know about grey/demi/ace etc. What if she is part of the community but hasn't realised that's a thing? Or she's just never felt comfortable to tell us?

On the flip side, we're basically just strangers who share DNA and it'd be very invasive and awkward and presumptive. So..... Bad idea?",0.98
"AITA for taking part of a tip? So where I work we get tips sometimes and usually the person who does the bulk of the job gets the tip not necessarily the person doing the transaction. When I got to work i was told the person would be picking up at 730. At 730 they hadn't showed up so I closed everything and mopped and at 8 I called to see if they were coming still so I could leave. They said they were still coming so I waited another half hour and when he got there he thanked me and said he wanted to tip me for staying. Cool. He left an 8 dollar tip so I left 5  for the girl who actually did the work and I took 3 for waiting. Now she's all upset I took her tip. Aita?

Edit : spelling

Edit 2 : its laundry it can be pay at pickup or on drop off. We split tips if lets say I put the clothes in a washer and they put it in the dryer and fold it. But I do nt normally take part of the tip if im just finishing the transaction.",0.06
"WIBTA For prioritizing my pregnant sister over my pregnant friend? Ok, so I couldn‚Äôt think of a better title so here it goes. I(M29) used to live by myself when my sister Nat(23) and her bf got pregnant, however this guy turned out to be quite abusive, so long story short my sister moved in with me, we get along quite well so we don‚Äôt have much problems living together other than regular sibling stuff. 

Now when my sister was around 3 months pregnant, I very close friend of mine Ava (F28) found herself on a difficult position, she got pregnant a few months ago and baby daddy didn‚Äôt want anything to do with her or her kid, so she came to me. I talked with my sister, she was sympathetic obviously and agreed to let her move in for a few months.

Now living with two pregnant women isn‚Äôt as difficult as I tough, I own my home and both of them have been carrying their weight. I don‚Äôt charge them rent but they do pay for food and utilities so no complaints. The thing is that we¬¥ve been living together for three months now and friction is starting to appear, specifically because of food and smells. To put it vaguely my sisters tends to crave sour flavors that make Ava feel sick, on the other hand Ava works from home so she usually bathes once every two days, I personally don‚Äôt perceive a particularly bad body odor from her but my sister apparently does and hates it.

Yesterday things blew up when Ava got cold and borrowed one of my sister sweaters that she left in the living room, my sister saw and got very angry at her and a lot of hurtful things where said. I tried to mediate the situation but did a lousy job so now both want the other to leave I told that if anyone wanted to go they were free to do so but I wouldn‚Äôt be kicking anyone out. 

Later I talked to my gf about this and she told me family should go first and I should tell Ava to look somewhere else to live but obviously she isn‚Äôt a fan of me living with Ava, I don‚Äôt blame her but she might be biased.

Finally when I spoke to Ava bout the incident I told her I wont kick her out but if pushed to choose I would choose to house my sister, this didn‚Äôt go well with her and I made things worse.

The problem is Ava is a very close friend and at some point I hang out with her more than with my sister so I get why it feels like a betrayal but at the same time I just can‚Äôt kick my sister out so WIBTA if I choose to let my sister stay and tell Ava to move?",0.14
"AITA for keeping an inheritance from my ex husband's homophobic family? I (33f) married my childhood best friend John (33m) when we were 22. I knew he was gay, and we decided to get married for several reasons (taxes, convenience, to keep his family from finding out, etc.). I got along with his family, who loved me. John had med school paid for by his family. I didn't have a job, and instead became a full time caretaker for his maternal grandparents who, when we first got married, were 85 and 87 and were dealing with multiple health problems. John's family supported us both financially through John's medical training. Once John got his MD and finished residency 3  years ago, he decided to come out to his parents.

We got divorced (we decided against telling the family that I knew all along). John's parents cut him off completely when he moved in with his boyfriend, basically disowning him. His grandparents weren't told about him being gay (everyone was pretty much in agreement that it wasn't a good idea, as they were quite fragile physically and mentally at this point). But they knew we divorced. And whereas John used to come see his grandparents frequently, because his parents had disowned him, John decided to pretty much limit contact with his entire family and never really visited or called.

On the other hand, I had been his grandparents' main caretaker for so long that I 

1) didn't have any other career training to support myself 

2) figured it would make sense for me to continue being their caretaker, as they were rapidly declining, and didn't want them to adjust poorly to a lot of new changes.

I moved into his grandparents' home with them. While I was angry at John's parents for their treatment of him, I still loved his grandparents who had always been kind to me. When they passed (within a few weeks of each other), his grandfather ended up willing almost their entire estate to me, about 12 million in assets. John and his mom each received about 50k.

John and I discussed it, and I felt it was fair that he received a higher proportion, and we're both happy and comfortable with how we divided it. His parents on the other hand had expected to receive the bulk of the inheritance and accused me of abusing his grandparents and manipulating them into willing almost everything to me. Apparently the had made some business decisions, assuming they would receive the money. They also argued that they would have gone ballistic if they knew John was using their money to ""fund his lifestyle."" I honestly hadn't thought of their will at all when they passed. It had never come up, but I feel John deserves the money after the way his parents treated him, and John tells me I deserved to be taken care of after I spent more than a decade of my life caring for his grandparents. Are we the assholes for keeping the inheritance when his parents had made plans based on their assumptions of the inheritance?",0.18

"AITA for questioning my mom marrying a man after only knowing him for a month? my (24F) older sister had surgery & my mom had been acting as her caretaker. Mom told me that she‚Äôd been offered OT at work & could really use the money, & asked if I could take care of my sister‚Äôs wound care for the weekend. I said sure

Sunday comes around & mom texted the family group chat with a picture of she and her new man (we‚Äôll call him Bob) saying ‚Äúwe eloped last night at sunset‚Äù she lied about the OT gig. She was off eloping with Bob, whom she had only known for a month. 

I let her have her moment of happiness, said congrats, & a week later told her that things seemed to be moving extrmly fast with she & Bob. She said that was ‚Äúcompletely ridiculous‚Äù & from this point forward it was WWIII

Fast forward, mom told me she‚Äôd be moving in with Bob & asked for my husband & I‚Äôs help moving. I told her sorry but we weren‚Äôt available& just left it at that. She told us that she needed OUR support, because SHE had always supported us-& specifically referenced her helping us pay for our wedding. Mom had previously given us $3k to help pay for MY wedding. I held firm on the fact that we simply weren‚Äôt available. (Why was I going to go out of my way for someone who lied, &now was throwing in my face the fact that she helped pay for our wedding?)

Keep in mind, I was going through the process of planning my own wedding. I invited mom to florist appointments, dress appointments, but each time she attended, she acted upset & quite honestly, just a Debbie downer.

A bit later, my sister threw me a bridal shower. Mom got WASTED. She instigated fights with bridesmaids, everyone. Some guests at the shower were asking about my wedding dress, what style I went with, mom drunkenly interjected saying ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt even seen it‚Äù. She had. I sent her pictures, she had seen it in person. I pretty much just walked away humiliated & got through the end of the shower.

I told my sister that I was humiliated & that mom has a drinking problem. (This has been an ongoing issue for years, where she drinks like a functioning suburban mom alcoholic, but nobody calls her out on it) My sister said that was completely ridiculous & didn‚Äôt speak to me for over 6 mos- someone I had previously spoken to almost everyday.

My husband & I ended up postponing our wedding 3x due to Covid, & finally made the decision to elope in the canyons in Las Vegas. We shared this decision with both sides of our immediate family, & everyone understood. We had waited over 2 years to get married at this point. It was just my husband and I in Vegas, and created a Facebook live page for our families to watch.

No one in my family asked for pictures, asked how it went, said congratulations, nothing.

I‚Äôve been told since I was a kid that my dad is an asshole, which I‚Äôve seen for myself, but now I‚Äôm questioning everything. Mom is estranged from her whole family. I kind of think my mom is a narcissist & cuts off anyone that gets in her way.

I know this is petty but hear me out: context, I (16M) lie out of habit and I have since childhood, it won‚Äôt be anything serious just little lies at random times. For example, a grade I got on a quiz/test, what I ate earlier that day, how much money I have on me, if i texted someone that day, just dumb things like that. I try really hard not to and I regret it as soon as it comes out of my mouth but I can‚Äôt stop. If someone catches me lying I simply admit it and say I don‚Äôt know why I do it.

One of my bestfriends, S (17F) is with me constantly because we share almost all of our classes together, which is great, but she is also there when I lie infront of others. I‚Äôve told her that I can‚Äôt help it, but she doesn‚Äôt believe me. She got fed up when I told someone I didn‚Äôt get any candy from the store, even though I did. She got very upset and told me she was sick of my lies. She then opened up her phone and went to her notes app she then created a new folder called ‚ÄúOP‚Äôs Lies‚Äù. I thought it was a joke so for the first few lies or so, when she types them down I laugh as i think it‚Äôs some point she‚Äôs trying to prove. 

Recently, though it‚Äôs gotten very bad. A month or so after she created the list, she gathered 46 lies and it‚Äôs driving me insane. I cant talk to other people around her because she‚Äôll scream ‚ÄúAHA! Lie number 47!‚Äù and pause to type it on her phone. She watches me like a hawk and I hate it. I expressed to her that I don‚Äôt like the list but she says it‚Äôs to show me that my lies are out of control but I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything wrong with it. After I was talking to someone and slipped up that I was wearing cologne even though I wasn‚Äôt she SNIFFED me and spent a whole 5 minutes lecturing me and then writing down lie number 49. I was fed up and screamed at her that this lie list was getting out of hand and she was acting rediculous. She yelled back saying that she doesn‚Äôt feel comfortable and cant trust me because she never knows when I‚Äôm telling the truth. I said that I couldn‚Äôt help it and shestormed off and shown people the list. everyone now thinks i‚Äôm just a guy that tells lies for fun.

"AITA for not getting in a car that‚Äôs not 4/AWD when the roads are kind of icy? My friends and I were at a sports bar last night for the game and decided it was time to head out. When we were going to leave we were deciding who was gonna ride with who as we carpooled from the same meeting spot that my friend picked me up and brought me to. Two of the three vehicles that were 4/AWD were filled up and the only vehicle left was a FWD suv. I live in the north of the United States and while the main roads were mainly just slush, it was snowing during the game and there was still ice on some of the side and back roads. I told the driver no worries and that I‚Äôd get a ride. He was confused and kept asking me why and I told him I just rather my girlfriend (she hates football and wanted nothing to do with the super bowl) pick me up. After he continuously kept asking and was holding everyone up I pulled him over to the side and told him I just wanted to ride in a vehicle with a 4/AWD drivetrain because of the weather. I could tell he looked put off but he just basically said ‚Äòalright I guess‚Äô and left. My girlfriend picked me up in my AWD car and I thought that was that. 

The next day a friend told me that the driver of the FWD vehicle was apparently saying a bunch of stuff about how i was snooty and acted like I was ‚Äòtoo good‚Äô to ride in his car to my friends the rest of the night.

"AITA for being upset that my best friend rejected my Valentine's Day gift? Context: I (18M) have a best friend (18F) in college. We met on august of last year and have spent a lot of time together ever since. We know each other pretty well by now.
I'm originally from another country. The first gift I gave her was when I came back from my country after winter break, I bought her some candies and two small sculptures representative of my country because they were inspired in one of our most famous artists, but she didn't like one of them because it featured a woman's breasts painted in black. I apologized for that since I didn't know she wouldn't see it just as art. She liked the other stuff though and said thanks for it.


Problem: So I've heard it's ok to give gifts to your friends in Valentine's Day since it's a celebration for love in general. Being that the case I decided to go out for some hours to buy her a gift. I ended up buying her a stuffed animal, something related to her favorite show, and a candy. I don't like to mention money but since I should fill this with details it was not too expensive, about 20 dollars, but non-returnable. After that I wrote her a letter about how much I appreciated her friendship.
Skip to this moment, I was bringing the gift out and as soon as she saw the bag she left running and said ""See you tomorrow"". Some minutes after that she texted me ""Thanks! I j don‚Äôt do Valentine‚Äôs Day and the boob sculpture was good enough"". Right now even though I haven't said anything I feel upset and feel like crying.

in the past, my father told me not to touch his things, ie his computer, his pop, his cds, his boxes, etc because i'm prone to breaking everything i touch. he didn't say that last part but i assume that's why. i broke his car once and i wasn't even horsing around. actually i broke his car on multiple occasions by accident. i managed to split a DS in two pieces when i was 10 years old. idk why i break everything but i do. anyways he told me not to touch any of his things and he has this package next to the couch.

fast forward some hours. my father comes home from work and we tell him about the 'gift' thinking he'd laugh but he just looked at me and said that he told me not to touch his things. i said i didn't touch them, i only looked at them, and he said 'but still. i wouldn't look at your things without your permission so why would you look at mine?'

"AITA For Ratting Out My Co-Worker To Get Her Fired & Lying About It? TL;DR - I've been ratting out my coworkers in hopes they'll get their shit together, or more likely, get fired. When confronted about it, I quickly and easily lied. AITA?

I am a vet tech in an animal shelter - I am responsible for maintaining the health of about 200 animals. There is one other vet tech, and then there is a layman who has to do vet tech tasks on one day because we are just short staffed (let's call her Z). 

I hate Z. She doesn't give out meds the one day she is supposed to do it, and it hurts my patients. She is incredibly lazy, I can't even get her to do 'fun' work like play with some animals, let alone get her to do important shit I couldn't finish in my shift. She sits at my desk using my computer to print memes and tape them over my CPR drug posters, and I'm too much of a pussy to kick her and her shit out. At best I consider her to be dead weight, and at worst she is a detriment. She needs to get written up a certain number of times before the board will actually consider firing her.

So I have been combing through her work with a fined-tooth brush and bringing it up to the manager. Every missed med, every stolen donation, every time she is more than a couple minutes late, every ignored sick form, every incorrectly counted pill or miscalculated medication. I'm basically hoarding every mistake that she makes and bringing it straight to the manager to rat on her. Don't get me wrong, it's biting me in the ass too because I have to hold myself up to these standards when my manager is reviewing all of this, and as a result some of my fuck-ups have been uncovered too - but to me it was well worth it to get her fired.

I guess my manager actually confronted Z about it once - I don't know what was said. But after they had that talk, Z made her own secret meeting with vet techs and kennel techs to find out who ratted her out. When she asked me if I told the manager anything, lying just came to me as natural as breathing. Like telling the truth wasn't even a dialogue choice. One kennel tech knew I was lying though given the circumstances, and she was so pissed she didn't speak to me for 2 entire days.

It wasn't until that cold shoulder treatment that I even began to think maybe I am the asshole for putting animals' lives over the life of my coworker by trying to make her jobless? Or at the very least, for not telling her the truth and being upfront about it.",0.13

She means well and I have never witnessed her being malicious or anything of the kind! Sweet lady, we‚Äôre just very different. 

I don‚Äôt like temp. living with other people. It‚Äôs very draining for me, I get more anxious, my ASD gets worse, I get irritable/snappy and feel guilty for it, etc., and it snowballs. I def affect people around me negatively unfortunately and my partner really struggles w it. 

My MIL lives abroad and in Oct came to our country for work for 2-3 months. She stayed w us on‚Äôn‚Äôoff (max 1 week at a time) and by the end I was spent! Partner and I argued about it because he of course wants his mum to feel welcome and he thought I was being too rude, both to her and about her to him when venting about stuff triggering me. We ultimately agreed on 2 rules: no unsolicited help from her, which he wants me to tell her, and I need to be involved in planning of her staying with us which we set up a group chat for. 

She‚Äôs coming back next month which they discussed briefly last week and again today, on the phone without me. His answer to her is ‚Äúfine by me, but I need to check with [me]‚Äù. When he told me I said I‚Äôd really rather he says something along the lines of ‚Äúwe‚Äôll just need to check the calendar‚Äù, but at least not basically say that he‚Äôs all cool with it but she‚Äôll need to check w me. 

I feel pressured into saying yes that way, or I‚Äôll be the bad cop for not being able to just be more easy going. However, he doesn‚Äôt want to give her an answer that isn‚Äôt entirely his own and feels like he‚Äôs being asked to give an answer dictated by me to accommodate me and thus not be true to his feelings. He‚Äôs already caught between the conflicting wants of people he loves and I think feels guilty for how I feel about his family when they cross my (many) boundaries. 

I on the other hand feel cornered and I wish he‚Äôd be more supportive of the delicate nature of it. I‚Äôd love to be welcoming and enjoy having family stay whenever, but for me that‚Äôs unlikely to ever be the case. I will ofc welcome her to stay, but it triggers me to feel pressured.

So, AITA for asking him to give a different answer to my MIL than the one he‚Äôd give her himself?",0.96
"WIBTA if I didn‚Äôt tell my parents about a trip I‚Äôm going on? My boyfriend (19M) and I (18F) are going on a short trip to Las Vegas in a couple of weeks with my boyfriend‚Äôs family (his dad is paying for all parts of the trip). My parents are very religious, and I know they would strongly disapprove of my boyfriend and I being in a situation where we‚Äôd be sharing a bed. I do not share their views. I moved away from home several months ago to attend college, and I am paying for my tuition, rent, food, and all other expenses with scholarships and savings from working in middle and high school. I told my parents shortly after I moved out that I was not religious and would not be attending church now that I am an adult. They were saddened and slightly angered by this decision, and have tried several times to control my choices by threatening to transfer my money out of my bank account (it‚Äôs a joint account that they have access to). I‚Äôm worried that if I told them about this trip, they would forbid me from going. On the other hand, I know that it would really hurt them if something happened to me on the trip and they had no idea where I was. WIBTA if I didn‚Äôt tell them?

"AITA for telling my boyfriend that he makes me feel excluded? My (21F) boyfriend (20M) is a mechanic. His interest started when he was very little and became a passion. Now he's a mechanic for a living and also studies mechanics. He's not an extrovert, so his go-to topic is mechanics, cars, motorcycles, etc. Most of his friends are interesed in the topic, my FIL was a mechanic, and my boyfriend still gets together with some of his classmates. 
I had a rough childhood. I got bullied and was excluded of every group and got made fun of. I felt lonely and never had the feeling of belonging, so I take exclusion very harshly. 
My boyfriend is used to talk about mechanics with everyone and I get excluded from the conversation. I never say anything if I don't know the other person or if I know them and they don't talk more than 45 minutes, but when it's people I trust and whom I have a bond with, I usually ask for the conversation to change topics or try to tell a story. Usually I get interrupted and they go back to talking about cars. 
It's exhausting to always feel excluded by my own boyfriend and our friends. One of his classmates (also a friend of his) has recently become one of my best friends, because he understands how I feel and he's the only one who combines passion for mechanics and different topics/explanations to feel included. He tells me they're not doing the right thing.
I don't want my boyfriend to stop talking about cars, I just wish he'd include me by explaining little details (silly explanation: our friend saying ""I repainted it"", my boyfriend explaining ""it's to make it another color"") or change the topic for a while from time to time. I'm tired of checking if my phone has enough battery to last all the date and telling his friend to slow down when he goes 180km/h on a 120km/h max. 
My boyfriend took it the wrong way and told me that he doesn't think about what they'll talk about before getting together, and that I have to understand it's his passion. I do understand, but I need him to understand that I can't always be/feel excluded from the conversation because it makes me want to stay home. He said that if he doesn't invite me I get mad, which is not true. I got upset the other day because he went on a trip to a friend's town when I had been asking to go and he didn't want to (I don't have a license) and then went without me, but I'd never get mad for meeting his friends.

"AITA for calling my friend's new gf overly sensitive to my jokes? in my group of guy friends we horseplay a lot. we flirt with each as a joke. we're all straight but it's been a running joke since high school and no one has had a problem until this girl.

there was a party and one the friends brought his new girlfriend. we don't stop our jokes because of a new person. in my opinion I shouldn't change who I am because of someone else. if they can't handle our humor they don't need to  be here.

so when my friend walks in I greet him, and pat him on the back and invite him to come cuddle. all the other guys start joking for him to come sit on his lap. he does it for a second than goes back to his girlfriend.

everyone's laughing but her.

the party goes on. she doesn't' say anything.

so I go and sit on my friend's lap and to get her to the join the fun I look towards his girlfriend and say you know you should be intimidated of me, I could steal him from you in a second and everyone is laughing. even my friend. she gets up and hides in the bathroom. they leave soon after.

later I get a text from my friend saying his girlfriend almost ended things because of my behavior.

"AITA for telling my friend that how I care for my lizard is none of her business? I (14M) have a friend we will call Tessa, (15F). Tessa and I are both really interested in reptiles and both with to own many different kinds when we're older. We also both have our own pet leopard geckos. Hers is a boy that we'll call Corn and mine is a girl who we'll call Banana.

Tessa has had Corn about 6 months longer than I've had Banana, and she knows a lot about leopard geckos, while I only know the basics.

Every other night (per what the pet store employee told me), I feed Banana around 4-6 big crickets. Last night, I ran out of crickets before I was able to feed Banana, so I had to wait until today to feed her. This doesn't happen usually, but hey, life is life, sometimes inconvenient things happen. Banana is fine, and I even gave her an extra cricket as a ""sorry"" for her having to wait.

I was talking to Tessa when I realized that I had run out, and I expressed my annoyance about it, figuring she could relate, since both of our geckos have pretty similar diets.

Well, Tessa did NOT relate, and she started criticizing my care for Banana, saying that I'm not taking good care of her, and that I'm a bad ""reptile father"" (whatever that means), and also bringing up the fact that I used to use sand in Bananas tank instead of the flooring I use now (leopard geckos don't live in sandy environments, and if they have sand in their enclosures, they could potentially ingest it, or choke on it and die. I changed what I use for Bananas floor after I found that out).

I felt like she was blowing this way out of proportion, so I told her that the way I care for my gecko is none of her business, and hung up on her.

TLDR: Ran out of crickets the night I was meant to feed gecko, friend was a jerk to me about it, and I was rude right back to her.

I feel like I was rude to her, so thats's why I may be TA. But I want your guy's opinions, AITA?

EDIT: Bit of extra info.

When I initially got muffin, the tank we got for her at first (we have since gotten her a nicer one) was being sold with sand. I had heard somewhere that calcium sand was okay for leopard geckos, and it was being advertised for reptile habitats, so I didn't know it was bad for her until later on when Tessa told me otherwise.

I've read the comments under this post and have taken some of the things said into consideration, thanks. I've yet to talk to Tessa about it, but I will right after this.

I normally would have extra crickets on hand, but my 9yo brother was messing around and accidentally knocked over their container and let them all free (we found and got rid of them, thankfully).",0.46
"AITA for not paying for a girl's drinks who bailed on me? A girl who I recently met on Tinder and I went to a brewery for drinks for a second date. The date was going good (so I thought), great conversation, and we both ordered several beers.

I always get a little nervous on the first couple dates so I was drinking a lot of water, so I excused myself to use the restroom and said I'd be right back. I was gone a couple minutes and get back, and the girl is gone. I check my phone, nothing. I went to text her, thinking it must have been an emergency, but saw she had blocked me and unmatched me on the app. I couldn't think of anything I did or said that would make her walk out like that. This stung a little bit so I admit it put me in a generally bad mood and I might not have been thinking rationally. 

The thing is, on our first date she mentioned how she always splits the bill. So I went into this ordering kinda expense drinks (like $8 for a beer) expecting I would only have to pay for mine. Well the bartender brought the bill and it was $60 before tip which is a lot for me. I told the bartender what had happened and said I wanted to only pay for my drinks. The bartender seemed apologetic but said I had to pay the whole thing, it wasn't his problem. I said sorry, handed him two $20s (which covered my drinks and a generous tip) and walked out.

I realize I might be the asshole because it wasn't the bartender's or the brewery's fault. As I said, I was angry and maybe not thinking straight. But I genuinely don't feel bad about it. There was an understanding the girl would pay for her drinks, so why is that my fault? She pulled a scam, but since she was the one ordering her own drinks, I'm not responsible for the consequences of this scam. I figure businesses write this kind of loss into their budget somewhere, and I'd rather the business takes a hit instead of me. Technically I had enough money in my wallet to pay for the whole bill. I just didn't want to because it didn't seem fair, and $30 isn't nothing to me either. 

As I was walking home I realized I might have screwed the bartender, but I did leave a good tip on my drinks, and  they presumably have a way of dealing with walkouts since I'm sure it happens. And if nothing else, it was the girl that screwed them, not me. AITA?

Edit: I was not expected her to pay exactly half, just for the drinks she drank. We were both having expensive drinks so it would have been roughly half.

Edit #2: Upon some of your suggestions, I called the bar and gave them her full name and number (I knew her last name because we discussed how we both have Italian last names). They can pursue her if they want, and this will hopefully help the bartender out if the bar takes it out of his tips (which I doubt anyway). I did not dine and dash - she did.",0.25

"AITA for refusing to switch lunch tables I (f17) sit alone at a lunch table, a few weeks ago a bunch of boys (there are like 8 or 9) decided that their new lunch table was going to be my table, their solution was that since I was the only one sitting there I could just switch tables. I refused to as I had been sitting there my whole school year. One of the boys said fine you can sit here, now I'll admit that my response to that was very hostile, as I responded with something along the lines of ""I was going to f***ing sit there whether you allowed me to or not."", I felt very bad for saying it and did apologize to the boy. Also the other week I came down to find one of them in my seat and I demanded he moved because that's my seat and at that point I'm pretty sure we all had an unspoken agreement that it was my seat and nobody could sit in it (he did move down). Now I don't interact with these boys and they don't interact with me. I will also admit at this point I'm still sitting there out of pettiness, as I don't want them to seem like they ""won"" by me switching lunch tables, as I threw such a fit over my seat the first time. I asked my therapist and she's on my side saying that I'm setting boundaries with them. But at this point I can't decide if I'm just being a petty asshole and I should move, or if I'm allowed to be petty 'cause I was there first.

Edit: I would like to edit this and say why this specific lunch table is really important for me to sit at. I have a very bad back and I have multiple diagnoses to it. And this specific table is up against a wall and I can sit against the wall to help support my back as if I sit with no support it really hurts my back to support itself and I‚Äôve already checked the other tables that are by walls and all those specific seats where I would be able to rest my back are already taken.

Edit 2: I am very much aware that I do not own that lunch table or seat but my school is small enough that after a few days at school everybody already has ‚Äúestablished‚Äù  a lunch table and seat and it‚Äôs seen as very rude for somebody to just take it knowing somebody else already sits there. The boys original table was about 2 or 3 tables away from where I sit and so there was no way they didn‚Äôt know I sat there",0.31

"WIBTA for saying no to babysitting my brother's kids? Apologies for formatting as I am on mobile.

Kind of a backstory. I'm (23F) the youngest of a few siblings, and my only niece and nephews (6, 4, and 2, respectively) belong to the oldest, my brother, Greg (29M) and his wife, Janice (28F). When they started their family and their marriage, they still lived with us, and I kind of turned into their live-in babysitter. This, paired with just how kind of shitty they can be to other people at times, put a huge strain on my relationship with them as family, to the point I wanted to cut off all ties at the time. 

Anyway, it has been a good 4-5 years since we lived together. Every so often, they will ask me to babysit for them, either at their house or my own. I've been taking college classes and working freelance from home since I finished high-school years ago, so as long as I didn't have a class when I was asked, I would babysit. I wouldn't ask for payment but they would buy me a meal for my time, like McDonald's or something like it. My thing is- I really, strongly dislike babysitting. I will do it because I do love these kids but I'm very much not a maternal person. I admittedly have my own issues mentally and just cannot handle the stress most of the time. I'm also one of the only people in the family they ask because I'm 'always at home' and 'don't have anything else going on anyways'. I just simply do not like being responsible for other people, always have. (It shouldn't come as a surprise that I don't want children of my own.) They also would assure me that it would ""only be a couple of hours"" or would specifically say a number and would be hours late.

Recently I've just finished college, and I've been job hunting. I honestly wish I could get a job right now so people will get off my case about being their automatic sitter. I've been asked just the other day if I would be ""willing"" to ""spend a few hours every day"" to watch their kids in between their kids getting home from school and my brother getting off of work. Problem is, I do not drive. I don't have a car nor a license, meaning I would be stuck at their house babysitting for an unknown amount of hours for several hours a day, per week. So I told them a ""tentative yes"" but in all honestly I want to just say no.

"AITA for being mad at BF for turning our vacations into family time? Me(29F) and BF(30M) were supposed to travel last year but due to problems with his visa, we weren't able to and had to cancel (we lost some money due to nonrefund policies) but we could still use our theme park tickets on a later date. We were gonna re-plan those vacations for October. That'd give me enough time to save money, since I make less than him and I want to have enough for shopping and eating out.

In January, my ILs heard that a band they like is touring and wanted to go to a concert in April at the same location. They asked if we'd go but BF has already seen that band and I'm not a fan.
I spoke with BF and told him he could go if he wanted but I wouldn't. We both agreed that we weren't that eager and we'd tell my ILs we wouldn't be coming.

FIL kept insisting that it was an experience I couldn't pass and that I don't even know what a real concert is because concerts in our country are bad and it's all about ThE eXpErIeNcE. He kept pushing BF until he said ""ok it's up to you, honey"", putting all the responsibility for turning FIL down on me.  
I was getting anxious and kept telling him I don't have the money and FIL kept saying I had time to save (I didn't).
MIL, said she'd give me my ticket as a birthday present so I was left with no choice but to say yes, even when that means I'll have no time to save spending money for the trip.

BF asked ILs weeks ago if they were going to the theme parks and MIL said she didn't think so. 4 days ago, BF and I made reservations for the parks based on availability and crowd calendars so that we wouldn't have long wait times for the rides specially since it's my first visit (BF and ILs have gone before).

My ILs called last night to ask about the the parks, they wanted to tag along and got mad when we told them it was on their last day in that city and the next day. They bought their flights without checking with us if we could travel those same days (we can't due to work) we're arriving and leaving 1 day after they do. They were offended we didn't plan on going with them and asked us to cancel our reservations to make new ones on dates when they could go. But we saw they were unavailable or crowded and it was a risk because cancelling could mean not being able to reserve any other dates it being a busy month.

I told BF I wasn't thrilled about this turning into an family trip and that I wanted to spend time with him. He told ILs that we couldn't change our reservations but they said they'd reserve the day we're going to the first park. We'll only have the second park day to us.

He kept saying his parents would be mad and hurt if we didn't go with them and stop talking to us. So it's ok if I'm hurt but not them? We've been together for 4+ years and talked about getting married but I don't feel like part of his priorities.

"AITA for yelling at my exfriend for ruining my middle school years after calling me ""racist""? Okay, so I just recently met someone who I really hate. I am now 18. I will be using the ages that I was at the time, so you have some context.

I (12f) had a best friend since I was very young, we'll call her Joyce (12F). Joyce's older sister was friends with my older sister, and that's how we met.

Joyce had moved to Georgia for a while, and she recently had come back. We were both about to experience our first middle school years together. But it didn't go so well for me. I am mixed. (Half black, half white.) So I never really fit in anywhere at my school. I mainly hung out with my black ""friends"" but they too excluded me, so I kept to myself, but when Joyce came back, I felt a lot happier.

Here's where things took a turn. It was around the middle of the school year. Me and Joyce were talking to each other alone at empty lunch table, just me and her. I told her about my past experiences with the black group of girls I had hung out with before her, and even though they were better then the white kids (who would just stare at me instead of talking to me at all) the black kids were very loud. obnoxious and rude to everyone else. Think of them as the popular kids almost. Since I was a shy and bashful kid, I didn't really like that, and they bullied me for it.

Joyce was quiet, and after lunch, I wondered what the problem was. A day later I was immediately swarmed with those popular kids, they are berating me, calling me racist, and other names. Apparently, Joyce thought I was stereotyping them. Joyce was the only person who could have told them anything, I was livid, and she was nowhere to be found. After a while, they started becoming a bit more brutal, leading to my mother pulling me from school, into online homeschooling. I like that a lot better anyways, as I can be more introverted, and get my work done much quicker and not work at the pace of others. But I do wish that I could have still had some of those experiences that I missed out on, which I like to think is her fault.

Recently, I saw Joyce walking around, and she came up to me all nice and friendly. I was livid at her, and asked what the hell her problem was, she ruined my middle school experience, and she betrayed me as a friend, and made it seem like I was a racist. I never brought up race, as they were loud, obnoxious, and downright mean people, no matter the color of their skin. She ignored me, and kind of just shrugged it off saying it kind of was and we should be friends again. I told her absolutely not, and to never talk to me again. While walking away, she flipped me off calling me a racist. AITA?

Edit: Sorry, I didn't like scream at her super hard, and it wasn't in public either it was a more quiet place. I think you guys aren't getting the point. My middle and high school experiences were ruined, and were already kind of of messed up. I was a mixed kid in a school who really did not fit in. I'm in COLLEGE and still dealing with this BS. It's so difficult to make friends, so if you don't understand that struggle, you really don't have a right to be saying shit like. ""You're an adult, get over it."" People are still bugging me about the racist stuff to this day, which is also messing with my ability to make friends. I cannot move, me and my family are significantly poor. Once I save enough money, I plan to move away and start a new life, but now I cannot. ",0.3

"AITA for painting my nephew‚Äôs nails? This has been going on for a while and I used to think I wasn‚Äôt in the wrong, but I‚Äôm starting to second guess myself after tonight. On mobile, apologies for formatting, etc. 

I (20s f) still live with my parents and my nephew. My sister is currently detained and my mother has legal custody of my nephew (age 3).

Ever since my nephew could talk, he would ask me to paint his nails. I always do it because, to simply put it, nail polish isn‚Äôt gender based. It makes my family go crazy though. Saying that it‚Äôs for ‚Äúlittle girls‚Äù and will make him take it off. I don‚Äôt understand their point because my nephew plays with an Elsa doll and knows the lyrics to Barbie Girl (I didn‚Äôt introduce him to it) by heart. For whatever reason, nail polish is a tipping point for my mother. My sister hasn‚Äôt ever said anything, but to be fair, she hasn‚Äôt really been around. 

Anyways, tonight was the same occurrence. Nephew asked me to paint his nails, I painted them green and blue, he asked my mother if she liked them and my mother responded, ‚Äúif you were a little girl, then yes.‚Äù I‚Äôll admit, I got a tad annoyed and said to my nephew ‚Äúif you want your nails painted, they can be painted.‚Äù 

The argument pursues and I ask my mother something along the lines of, ‚Äúso if my sister had a daughter as well and they both wanted their nails done, you‚Äôd only take the daughter?‚Äù My mother said yes.  I told her that was messed up, and she responds, ‚Äúit doesn‚Äôt matter what you say! He‚Äôs not your son and you‚Äôre not raising him.‚Äù

Yesterday was my birthday, and I asked my kids and wife for a very simple request as a birthday present, for them to pray a long rosary with me after dinner, due to all that's going on in the world.

They immediately objected and moaned and complained about it, saying that they had ""better things to do"" and that rosaries are ""boring, stale, and annoying."" I was immediately disheartened and offended that such a simple request for my birthday was being met with contempt, I didn't say anything and just went upstairs to process things, it really did make me sad.

About a half hour later, my 15 year old son came in and apologised to me and invited me down to pray that rosary, and we did so without any further pushback. I thanked my kids and it really made my evening.

But now I'm thinking that I essentially guilt tripped them into such and feel quite bad about it. At the same time I think that it was a reasonable request with the only cost being their time, I didn't ask for anything further. I don't know.",0.29

"AITA for covering an offensive poster in school repost cuz i made an edit without knowing it would be deleted lol 

//TW offensive word, mentions of slurs

Note: anything in """" is a direct quote from the poster im talking about"" and I am diagnosed with several mental disabilities, so I took this poster personally

so recently my school put up a poster called ""Project Unity"" and its about how we should treat our ""mentally disabled"" the very first line on the poster is ""The R-word is the word 'retard(ed)' Why does it hurt? The r-word hurts because it is exclusive. It's offensive. It's derogatory."" and then proceeds to go on and say the word fully typed out another 4 times. The context in which the word is said on th poster is how we shouldn't say it (first time its said) the words origin (2nd time) and then gives not one, but TWO examples of the word in a sentence, then wraps it up by saying ""Please show respect to everybody""

I talked about how i felt about this poster to my favorite teacher, and she agreed, it should never have been put up. I asked her if i could cover it up and she shrugged, so i took a piece of paper and wrote ***Dear admin***

***This poster is very offensive. It goes on about how we shouldnt say the r-slur then you proceed to use it and give examples of how its used. It is very offensive, and we have special ed kids at this school. they can read. they will ask their parents what the word means. It's very offensive so please take it down. - a neurodivergent (my school name) student***

I did all this yesterday, and the teacher i talked about it to updated me and said it seems the poster and my note got removed. I've no clue if i was caught on camera putting it up, but i havent been called to the office about it. I just want to know if what i did was the right thing, because i feel it personally was. we have white kids who use the n slur and others who use the f slurs in rude ways, we dont need to give them any more ideas.",0.03
"AITA for selling the engagement ring? Me (M28) and Lauren (F27) have been together for 3 years. In October I bought an expensive ring and asked her to marry me. Things were going well, until there were some twists and turns in our professional lives and we postponed the wedding. This all caused a lot of fights. Two days before Christmas she gave me the ring back and we broke up.

A week passed and we got back together, but we decided not to be engaged anymore. All through January we were awkward with each other, we barely spoke and I felt like we wouldn't last long. I decided to sell the ring, I didn't see the need to keep it to remind me of something that didn't work out and I could use the money to buy something useful.

In February things settled between us and we are getting back on track. On the 14th, I planned a romantic dinner and we exchanged gifts. The next day, Lauren said she felt a little disappointed that she didn't get her engagement ring back. I said that I had already sold the ring 3 weeks ago and that caused a big fight.

Lauren says I'm an asshole for selling the ring without consulting her. I disagree because she gave me the ring back so it was mine and we weren't getting married in the near future. I vented about it to a few friends, most of them thought I was too insensitive and should have told them that I planned to sell the ring.

So the last couple of days my dads been going up to bed early and my mums just being saying he‚Äôs tired. We‚Äôll today my dad gave me a call about the tv (the one in their room doesn‚Äôt work when mines on) and he ended up saying that he and my mum had been arguing that‚Äôs why he was in bed so early. So whenever I‚Äôm not out we either watch a film or show together at the moment we‚Äôre watching ‚ÄòGames of thrones‚Äô and I wasn‚Äôt out tonight so I went to ask him when we‚Äôd be watching it and he said he wasn‚Äôt sure if he wanted to. Anyways I went down stairs and was watching random things with my mum and she said nothing about my dad being in bed. About 30 mins later my dad comes down and we all watch ‚ÄòGOT‚Äô. All is calm. Then I ask about getting a Sunday dinner tomorrow to my mum and she says ask ur dad so I do. He then goes of saying mum can get it so I ask why they‚Äôre arguing. Then sh*t hit the fan. My mum says it started this morning and my dad says it started months ago and I start getting upset and start crying. I don‚Äôt tell them the reasons why I‚Äôm so upset about this and I‚Äôll include why if asked for but not in this main bit. Then they both start getting angry with me not shouting but you know you can tell with you parents so I go up to my room really upset and can then hear my dad shout that I‚Äôm way to emotional and my mum hasn‚Äôt come to check if I‚Äôm alright so did I over react in getting upset. 
I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety when I was 14 and have been on medication ever since but I have have recently started to cut back on my tablets which ik my mum knows but I‚Äôm not sure if my dad does.

"WIBTA if I wrote my neighbors a note asking them to move their trash cans to the other side of their house? A few months ago, the house two doors from mine got sold. There's two car parking spots on the left side of the house, and a fire hydrant spot on the right. The car spots are for anyone in the neighborhood to use, they're not reserved. 

Since my household has too many cars (we each have one), I usually have to park away from the house. This means I take the second of the car spots, and that's fine.

The new neighbors have been putting their trash cans in the spot I'm usually in as soon as I leave on Saturday for work. This in itself isn't a problem, it's the fact that the trash doesn't come until Monday morning that seems a bit odd. But still, no big deal. I do have to park on the other side of the block though.

It's become an issue because they've lately been putting it out on Fridays (they did it yesterday, which is what got me to write this post) and haven't been bringing them back in until Tuesday or sometimes Wednesday.

Having their cans out for a while doesn't bother me. It's the fact that they bring their cans from the spot right behind the hydrant (that spot is where their neighbors out their trash cans too for pick up) to specifically spread them across the parking spots for days on end that's starting to get annoying.

I'm definitely not wanting to say anything mean about it, I just really don't like having to park around the block 4-5 days just because they refuse to pull in the cans. I also don't see what's wrong with having them next to the neighbor's cans, because there is plenty of space. 

WIBTA if I ask them to put the cans on the side where they store them? And is there a good way to go about it without sounding entitled or rude?",0.33

"AITA for not letting my SO stay for Christmas, and causing friction between him and his mother This is about something that happened this Christmas that I‚Äôm still thinking about so want a few random opinions

I (25f) have been with my SO (29m) now for 4 years. We live together, we‚Äôve met each other‚Äôs parents and we‚Äôre talking more seriously about our future. This Christmas was our 3rd together (got together early ‚Äô19). The first two we spent apart with our families due to Covid.

Christmas is my favourite time of year and we have lots of extended family traditions which are important to us. Christmas traditions aren‚Äôt massively important for my SO or his family and he said he‚Äôd rather spend it with me.

Normally I would have loved to have him, but the problem is my brother (35m). He lives with my parents (not bashing living with your folks but it‚Äôs relevant) and hates it. He and my parents don‚Äôt get along at all and they have frequent explosive arguments but he can‚Äôt leave/they won‚Äôt kick him out as he doesn‚Äôt have a full time job so can‚Äôt afford his own place. We are totally opposite in everything, our views, values, interests. He was physically aggressive to me when we were kids and when I‚Äôm with him it‚Äôs like there is a dementor in the room. My friends who have met him have described him as having a god complex and a bit misogynistic. When we come into contact I hate the person I become and how I have to walk on eggshells in my childhood home. We‚Äôre no contact for the rest of the time.

So this Christmas when my SO suggested coming and staying at our house for Christmas I really didn‚Äôt want him to. He knows what my brother is like (they‚Äôve never met) so he understands the relationship is difficult but I do not want him in that house. I do not want him to see an inevitable argument. I have no doubts that he‚Äôd love me either way but honestly it‚Äôs for my own sanity.

He suggested we get a hotel or airbnb for us near my parents which I was more than happy to do, but his booking cancelled last minute and we couldn‚Äôt get anything else. I ended up asking if he could please go to his family‚Äôs place (fine travel wise) as I couldn‚Äôt handle him staying at mine, especially when I had only 2 days to mentally prepare myself. We talked it through and mutually decided to spend Christmas apart.

Afterwards I heard through a mutual friend that his mother was angry that I‚Äôd not either let him stay or gone with him to theirs, and caused him disappointment on Christmas. Apparently this had caused friction between SO and his mother and that she thinks I was being childish/selfish and putting my family traditions first instead of him. She‚Äôs a lovely person and we get on so I‚Äôm thinking he must have been really down but hidden it from me on Christmas Day. He doesn‚Äôt know I know about this and I‚Äôm debating whether to bring it up in case it causes more conflict between them.

So I‚Äôm upset to have caused conflict on Christmas and wondering if IATA and should have just let him stay or gone with him, and WIBTA to bring it up with him, potentially causing more conflict",0.96
"AITA for leaving my husband stranded at the airport? Throwaway so he doesn‚Äôt find it.

My husband (37M) ‚ÄúJack‚Äù works at the same company as his brother ‚ÄúTom‚Äù (32M) & cousin ‚ÄúTrey‚Äù (33M). Brother & cousin are bachelors and room together. They live only 10 minutes away from us.

Jack and Tom both had to travel for work together. They had to drive trucks to an office in another state, and then fly back. They left Tuesday and got back today (Saturday). I (32F) am a work from home mom with 3 kids (5m, 3f, 1m) so it‚Äôs been a rough week without Jack.

Yesterday Jack texted and said he lands at 1030 am. I asked if I needed to pick him up and he replied ‚ÄúProbably‚Äù. I was annoyed because the airport is an hour away so I was trying to plan my Saturday. I FaceTimed him at about 8pm to say goodnight to the kids, but also to finalize plans and he gave the kids a quick goodnight and then said he and Tom were getting into an Uber and he couldn‚Äôt talk. He never called back.

I went to bed and my 1yo had a rough night and was up crying for over an hour. Then I couldn‚Äôt go back to sleep for another hour after that. When my alarm went off at 7am I had a text from Jack that he might need me to pick him and Tom up, but his Trey also might get him so I should call Trey and see. I was annoyed, but I also had a text from Trey saying he‚Äôd get Them. I was happy and went back to bed.

By 1030 I was up and just having a normal morning and hubby calls me to see where I am. When I told him at home he asked why I wasn‚Äôt there to get him. I told him trey is there and he said he‚Äôs not. I looked back and the text actually said ‚ÄúAm I getting the guys?‚Äù And in my sleepiness I thought he was telling me he was. I called Trey and he hurry and went to get them, but Jack and Tom had to wait an hour for their ride.

When Jack got home he greeted the kids warmly but gave me the cold shoulder. When we were alone he started in on me about how he works hard and had a long week and the least I could do was be there to get him on time. I said sorry and he kept going about how frustrating it is to have to be away from family and then wait for so long. I said sorry again. Then we went on some more and I cut him off and said ‚ÄúLook I‚Äôm sorry, but you realize this is your fault too, right?‚Äù He looked at me and said ‚Äú are you really turning this around on me?‚Äù I said ‚ÄúIm not trying to turn anything around, but you made last minute plans and that‚Äôs not my fault. I‚Äôm here by myself with 3 kids. ‚Äù He walked away. Now it‚Äôs been a few hours and he still won‚Äôt talk to me directly.

"AITA for telling a coworker that everyone has problems? I am a 22m who works at a grocery store to get through college.

I then went on to tell him everyone has problems in their life big and small. I kept names out but told him other employees who are homeless or have last loved ones. I ended up telling him stop acting like your the only one with problems and act like the adult you are. Well today he put in his two weeks and the reason he gave was because he said I was an a hole.

There was a headlight out and her brakes were really soft. I have a mechanic we‚Äôve used for over 20 years, so I took it by for the headlight and asked for a full inspection. Yep, you guessed it ‚Ä¶ needs brakes both front and rear, tires are bald, shocks and struts, rotors, alignment, and a few scheduled maintenance items. $8k estimate for everything or just $5,700 for the tires, wheels, and brakes.

"AITA for telling a dark secret after being bullied? So me a male was in a group chat in discord. We all had fun until they started bully me and calling me names. I asked them to stop but they kept going. Quick reminder I was his best friend (let‚Äôs call him Leo) who always stood up to him even tho he often was mean to me around other people. So a quick backstory: he and his best friend was playing and he invited a girl and a boy to the call and they became best friends and froze out Leo. So I was always there helping and often playing with him. So a while  ago me and Leo was at his house and we found a book in his moms room where it said ‚Äúhow to suck his d*ck‚Äù which was a book about sucking d*ck. He was pretty sensitive about it and didn‚Äôt want me to tell people about it. So after they kept bullying me and telling me stuff about my adhd and other things Leo muted me. I was completely fine with that since I was already playing with someone else‚Äôs in the call. But all of a sudden he just tells me (my name) and I answered ‚Äúyes?‚Äù And he just said ‚Äúf*ck you n-word) and kicked me. Usually I wouldn‚Äôt have been mad at him but this was it. I had enough of him always billing me after always helped him and stood up to him so I just wrote in a group chat and told them ‚Äúhey guys Leo‚Äôs mom has a book on how to s*ck d*ck) and left the group.I got a text from the girl telling me that I was sick and stupid and now afterwards I think  i overreacted and are afraid I might loose my friend.

"AITA for unintentionally hurting someone by not including them in a weekend trip I am a mature female, and I meet up with others at least once a week for a hike. Because of covid, I have been sticking with a small group of like-minded women over the past 3 months. One of these gals I would classify as a close friend; we hang out with each other several times a week, have each other over for dinner, celebrate birthdays, that sort of thing.   The others are certainly friends but we don't get together much outside of hiking and I have no idea when their birthdays or other special occasions are.
The problem arose when 2 of us together happened to score a cancellation for a reservation to hike in the Grand Canyon. There was room for only 4 people on this reservation, no more. The 4 spots filled immediately with the 2 of us who were searching for cancellations, my best friend who has been encouraging me for 2 years to do this (that makes 3) and finally one of our hiking buddies who happened to drop by at that very moment. That made 4.  
One other hiking friend has been talking about wanting to do this trip but could not be included due to the 4 person limit on the cancellation. About a week before the trip I told her about the upcoming trip. I apologized for not being able to take everyone and offered to go again any time. After all, the Grand Canyon isn't going anywhere;  we are all healthy & active and do not see this as an only-once-in a lifetime opportunity.  Well, it did not go over well. She was very upset, and told me that I had hurt her badly because (she said) I knew how badly she wanted to do this. She cried and was very quiet for the rest of the hike. It was certainly not my intention to hurt anyone and tried to console her. If we had some kind of prior undersranding, I wasn't aware of it. 
The trip was 3 weeks ago and she is still not speaking to me. I have reached out 3 times by email with no response. She has stopped hiking with our group. I stopped by her house today to see if we could talk. She said that she was still ""broken"" and had much she wanted to say to me, but the timing was not good at that moment.

"AITA for being upset that my friend didn't tell me she's moving out of state? I (22F) have a friend, Phoebe, (23F) who went to college with me. We both went to a short graduate program after college and grew pretty close then. She‚Äôs one of my only friends so I really like to hang out with her a lot but understand she has other friends and obligations. She‚Äôs 100% my best friend and I really don‚Äôt know what I would do without her.¬†

Because of my major in undergrad, I got to graduate earlier than her from our graduate program. Phoebe's just now finishing up and just told me this past weekend that she‚Äôs moving to out of state to a new city because she got a new job (it‚Äôs not across the country but probably like 5-7 hours away by car). She‚Äôs literally moving in only 3 weeks and can‚Äôt see me much before she leaves because she‚Äôs busy packing and making arrangements and graduating. I always thought we were closer than this and that she would want to do things together like move to a new city together and even work together since we‚Äôre in the same field. I had told her before she could apply to work for the place I work at because it‚Äôs in the field she wants to work in, pays well and they‚Äôre hiring and even then, she never told me she was applying to other jobs, let alone jobs that are out of state.¬†

I also ended up finding out through my girlfriend who knows some of Phoebe‚Äôs friends that Phoebe had mentioned wanting to move to this city and was making plans to. My girlfriend just kind of assumed I knew and we never talked about it. I‚Äôm upset that Phoebe never told me. She had occasionally mentioned the idea of maybe moving to a new city one day but never once told me that she was making serious plans to do this. Even though we haven‚Äôt been hanging out quite as often lately because our schedules are different and we‚Äôve both been busy, I still would‚Äôve expected her to tell me. My girlfriend made it sound like Phoebe had told everyone besides me and that‚Äôs the vibe I‚Äôve been getting too because Phoebe mentioned a few other random people she had already told. I also found out she visited this city like two months ago, which makes me think she‚Äôs known for a long time. I know she‚Äôs felt like she had to set some boundaries in the past with how often I want to hang out with her and at one point, I‚Äôll admit I did kind of rely on her as a crutch for my mental health but that was when I was really struggling and needed her. Since then, I have totally respected when she needs space from me.¬†

I‚Äôm really sad about her moving of course and she is too. We both teared up when she told me and are already making plans to see each other and visit each other.

"AITA for suggesting this idea for my and my GF's wedding? So my longtime girlfriend/soon-to-be fianc√© are pretty open when talking about our future. For example we went engagement ring shopping together, she knows i'll be proposing soon (about time), and we talk a lot about wedding etc. We are both really excited for it all. 

Anyways, so I had this idea that when I propose, I would also reveal to her that I want to go to the courthouse ASAP and get officially married. Like, next day type of thing. I know that she would be okay with this because we have said that we are both okay with getting married on paper asap regardless of when we actually plan our wedding. 

But here is where I may have gone wrong. When talking generally about this topic, I told her that I didn't want tell anyone that we went to the courthouse. My idea was to plan our wedding on our anniversary, and then on our wedding day break the news to everyone. My GF does not think this is a good idea because apparently both our parents (mainly mine) would be super offended that we didn't tell them we got officially married a year prior. To be honest I do think they would be slightly annoyed but its just that I dont really care. Its our life and I feel like if we don't want to share something we don't have to, especially when we have a plan lined up for a reveal AT our wedding. 

She also says that she thinks its important for our close relatives to be with us when we officially get married and says I'm being an asshole for not wanting anyone at the courthouse (paraphrasing to fit the sub, she didn't actually call me an asshole). I guess I just thought it was a cute idea but now maybe im an ass for even thinking of it? What do you all think?

Edit: just for clarity, I‚Äôm not insisting on this idea at all. She told me her opinion, and I‚Äôm fine with that. Not looking to start off a marriage with something we both don‚Äôt 100% agree on. I‚Äôm posting here mostly to gauge what you guys think about the idea in the first place.",0.67
"WIBTA for turning down money? I (19M) was born into a middle class family, I‚Äôm the middle child I have two sisters (20F and 17F) both who work for my Dads financial advising firm.

I worked for my dad briefly over the summer but left to go back to college (UK, so not university) and finish my course. I never told him how miserable I was working for him because of the pressure, if I fuck up it looks bad on him which was always on my mind.

Anyway, my Dad is thinking of selling his company for a lot of money (8 figures) and he wants to give money to me and my sisters.

This sounds really ungrateful but I don‚Äôt deserve that money. He has built this business for over 20 years and he has earned every penny, I have so much respect for what he‚Äôs done for himself and for me. 

Not only do I spend money quicker than I get it, I just don‚Äôt think that I deserve that money because I haven‚Äôt always been the best son, it‚Äôs almost as if I‚Äôm getting money for simply existing. If I was to earn it myself perhaps it would be different but if it‚Äôs given to me I‚Äôm not sure how I would manage it.

I don‚Äôt know how to feel whether I take the money or not because at the same time I don‚Äôt want my Dad to think I‚Äôm turning my nose up at it or being a dickhead I‚Äôm just not sure‚Ä¶

My (13f) little brother (4m) and I are extremely close. He‚Äôs basically my best friend. I‚Äôd choose to hang out with him over my friends any day. 

For some background, every night we eat dinner, watch a movie, then I get in the shower. After I shower me and him watch YouTube or play action figures until it‚Äôs time for him to go to bed. 

Last night, I walked from the bathroom to my room in a towel and he followed, I politely say ‚ÄúSha can you wait I have to get dressed‚Äù so he walks into the hallway and waits, however I‚Äôm currently on my period and forgot a pad, so I had to grab one from the closet. 

He was sitting right next to my door where my bedroom door and the closet door meet, I tell him to move and he walks into the bathroom and just stares. 

I say ‚Äúcan you turn around‚Äù as I was only in a towel and it‚Äôs just awk he does and I grab what I need. He then turns as I shut my door and giggles and I say, ‚Äúyour such a weirdo,‚Äù

"AITA For refusing to wash a moldy blender ?   

I (23F) have moved in with one of my best friend (23F) and her little sister (20F) couple of months ago. I have known them almost all of my life. Things were rough at home, so they invited me to come and stay in their spare room, which is also closer to my school. They already hab almost everything material wise, so I didn't have to bring much. For example, all the electric appliances have been bought by them, but they said I could use them anytime.

So a couple of weeks ago I wanted to make myself a smoothie, and found the blender in the fridge. It had a disgusting substance in it, it smelled horrible and mold was growing in it (it's not the first time I find moldy food in the fridge). I found it really repulsive, and went to ask them who made that. BFs Little Sister said she made a smoothie but didn't drink it all and put it in the fridge, that she must have forgot about it. I said I wanted to use the blender, and could she clean it ? She said that if I wanted to use it I should clean it, even though it was her mess it should be the person who wants to use it who cleans it. I replied that *because* it's her mess, she should do it. My vision is, if I make a mess in the microwave I am gonna clean in up, not let it there for the next person to find. She didn't budge, I lost my appetite so I went and put the blender back in the fridge without cleaning it.

A couple of days later, BFs Little Sister wanted to make a smoothie and found the blender still in the fridge and still moldy. She got really mad, came to my room with the blender saying I was petty, how come I hadn't cleaned it, it was disgusting. I told her it was her mess, if she wants to use the blender, then she gets to clean it but I sure was not gonna do it.

She went to tell my BF that I was petty and immature. My BF told her she didn't want to get involved, but she said to me in private that it would have been easier if I had just cleaned it the first time and had not let the situation escalate.

So, AITA because I refused to clean my best friend's little sister moldy blender ?",0.03
"AITA for yelling at my bf‚Äôs mom? I (f18) have been with my bf (m20) for two years.

backstory: My relationship with his mom has been okay as we were family friends growing up but I‚Äôve always tried to kind of keep space because she of how she can be. Like controlling, manipulative, mean to my bf, etc.  

My bf‚Äôs birthday was coming up and every year he has celebrated with his Mom on his actual birthday, so my family planned a dinner for him a few days later. We planned this over a month ago.

Well, she texts him 3 days before his birthday and says she planned a dinner for him on the same day as my family‚Äôs dinner and too keep the day free. He told her unfortunately he had already made plans with my family. She said he could do dinner with his fam on his actual birthday.

The day before his birthday, she texts him again saying his actual birthday doesn‚Äôt work for them and she needs him the day my family has planned and my family needs to change our day.

He says he won‚Äôt be cancelling his original plans, he will still go to her place for dinner on his actual birthday and doesn‚Äôt need anything crazy just wants to spend time with his family on his birthday.

She doesn‚Äôt respond until the next day (his birthday) and says how disappointed she is for choosing my family over his and that she thought she raised him better, but the choice is his because he is an adult.

She then texts my mom asking her to cancel our dinner because it‚Äôs her son and no other day works for her.

My mom said it was the only day that works for us as well, and says my bf is an adult and not obligated to come to my fam‚Äôs dinner and it‚Äôs totally up to him.

My bf and i go there that night to see his family and while we are eating i overhear his mom complaining to her husband that my parents won‚Äôt cancel dinner.

As we are leaving he tells his mom he will see her in a few days, he will be eating with my family but will come over after to have cake and spend time with everyone.

Then she exploded. She screamed that my mom was a disrespectful b**** and ruins everything. I yelled at her and said don‚Äôt you F‚Äôing dare talk about my mother like that and if she would have communicated with my bf none of this would have even happened. She screamed at me to get the F out of her house and never F‚Äôing come back.

So we left. She texted us and my Mom later and apologized (she blew up at my mom over text and screamed at her over the phone) but i will never be able to forgive her for speaking to my family and i like that when we have been nothing but respectful.

She‚Äôs exploded like that on my bf many times before and they‚Äôve always talked it out but he said this was the finale straw and he‚Äôs done.

We‚Äôve both denied her requests to talk and gone no contact until she decides to seek help.

I feel bad because it IS his mom, i didn‚Äôt want to overstep or for them to lose their relationship like this. I also feel like i ruined his birthday even though he says i didn‚Äôt do anything wrong.",0.07
"AITA for wanting my one roommate to maintain cleanliness in our apartment? A bit of a back story - we live downtown Toronto in a basement apartment. There‚Äôs 3 of us girls, we each have our own rooms and we share a kitchen and bathroom. We decided to divide up household chores - S is in charge of keeping kitchen clean, T takes out the kitchen garbage/recycling and I am in charge of cleaning the bathroom. I don‚Äôt use the kitchen much because I work often and I also spend a lot of time at my boyfriends place. 
To start off, S keeps to herself and hardly leaves her room. She is super tidy and always cleans up after herself. However, T is super messy in the shared spaces (but her room seems to be clean always which is weird). When she cooks, she spills crumbs and splashes whatever around on the floor and never cleans it up. She leaves her dishes in the sink for days at a time, and I‚Äôm sure S gets tired of cleaning up the kitchen after T, but S is super sweet and quiet and never complains. I generally stay out of the kitchen as a whole cause I get anxiety about it. 
When T takes out the garbage, she lets it pile in our kitchen for a few days before she decides to take it out. She always puts recycling in garbage bags, and I‚Äôve told her 2 different times that bags don‚Äôt go in recycling bins. She continues to do it. 
In the bathroom, T leaves her hair clumps in the shower drain (and she has some thick ass hair) and her unused/empty shampoo bottles have kinda collected over time in the shower and take up a lot of space. She has 12+ bottles piled up in there. Since I am in charge of cleaning the bathroom, I don‚Äôt mind pulling out the clumps from the drain here and there. When I do deep cleans, i take all her bottles and remove them from the shower and tell her to sort through them. This has been working, but it is repetitive and keeps happening. She doesn‚Äôt get the hint I guess. 
BUT the thing that gets on my nerves the most is the shower doors. We have a pretty marble shower with big beautiful glass doors. The water from the shower leaves those hard water stains on the doors if it‚Äôs not wiped right away. I‚Äôve bought a squeegee for us to use after we shower, and I‚Äôve sent them both a message about squeegee-ing the doors when they‚Äôre done and how hard it is for me to clean if we dont. But T just will not do it ever. I have been going nuts looking at the stains, then I spend an hour scrubbing and wiping the doors down for her to shower that night and fuck it up again. I don‚Äôt want to become the squeegee police üòí
Am I being unreasonable for getting frustrated? Am I being an asshole in this situation? I haven‚Äôt said anything too confrontational because I don‚Äôt want a hostile living environment, but it‚Äôs starting to get to me. My friends come over and complain that their socks are sticking to stuff on the kitchen floor. The clumps of hair in the shower floor are horrifying. It‚Äôs embarrassing. Yes I‚Äôm in charge of cleaning the bathroom, but no I am not her personal maid. It‚Äôs only ever her mess that I see in the house. What do I do?",0.27

"AITA for throwing a magnet? My roommate and I were sitting on the couch watching tv and she was opening an Amazon package. Whatever she ordered came with a free fridge magnet of the company logo. I set my laptop down between us on the couch to get something. She was fiddling with the magnet for a bit, before setting it down on my laptop. I reacted as quickly as I could swiping it off the laptop and onto the floor.

She burst into tears asking why I 'threw her magnet'. I pointed out she had set it down on top of my laptop and I didn't want the magnet to damage my laptop. She said I could have just asked her to pick it up, but I said I was just trying to get the magnet away from electronics as quickly as possible. She said I was unnecessarily dramatic and rude over a simple mistake and I could have broken her new magnet. The magnet was not her purchase (it was a shirt) and the magnet was as thin as a piece of paper. I could have dropped it from the roof and it couldn't have 'broken'. 

A day or so later we were eating lunch across a table from each other, when I reached across the table and knocked over an empty styrofoam cup. She batted the cup away back towards me and then was relieved it was empty. I said (in a joking tone but trying to make a point) 'And I don't think you were dramatic or rude at all'. When she looked confused I noted how when I had a gut reaction she had small breakdown, and when she had a gut reaction it was no big deal. 

She's now pouting and not talking to me, saying it was a totally different situation.

"WIBTA if I told my cousin she smells? My little cousin does not have the best hygiene. When she was younger, I would fault it with her parents for not monitoring it properly, but she was still a kid figuring it out. I let it go when she entered high school too, thinking that one of her friends would eventually tell her/ show her proper hygiene.  

Now she's about to turn 20 and I can't take it anymore. She doesn't wear any deodorant or perfume to cover it up. She doesn't wash her hair for what seems like weeks on end; grease galore. It's almost like no one taught her anything about cleaning herself past a middle school level.

I've thought about whether my personal intervention is needed at all, but after my family hosted a family party recently and I saw her for the first time since the beginning of the pandemic, I changed my mind. I feel like if I don't say something no one will. 

I have a rather large family (21 first cousins, only 4 of whom are boys) and she's one of the younger ones and the only one without a sister. Her mother is also a monster of a person so she hasn't really had a ton of good female influences in her life. We rarely see each other as everyone tries to avoid her mom, and in turn, her.  And since we don't see each other often, this has made her hygiene a topic to gossip about among the cousins at each family gathering. It makes me feel bad to judge her solely because her mom is crazy and because she smells. I just know if I was in her shoes, I would want someone to tell me. 

I feel like it is my duty as an older cousin to say something to her, but I'm kinda scared if I do, I'll just be labeled as an AH. So WIBTA if I told her?

(I did want to add that she is beginning to act in the same way that her mom does \[very arrogant and holier-than-thou sort of way\] so it's really draining to talk to her, let alone bring up a potential fault she could have... so is there a good way of telling her or should I just leave it to someone else?)",0.02

I apologize for formatting I‚Äôm on mobile, that being said ask me anything you need to clarify things. So there is a lot that happened today‚Ä¶ idk if I‚Äôm honestly an asshole or have done enough I can step back and say it‚Äôs not my problem anymore. 
So I‚Äôm a trainee with 4 other people in my team. Today I had a client that when she shut the door she locked the wrong lock. (Bottom handle rather than top deadbolt) I thought I had fixed it after the meeting but when I shut the door the handle was still locked. I ended up spending my whole day trying multiple ways of getting this stupid door unlocked. That being said I‚Äôm a team member for a community based group and do not have any control over the rooms we use nor the keys to get in. I literally spent my whole day trying to fix the problem. I have screen shoots if anyone wants to see how much effort I went into unlocking this door. Note to the part that I think I might be an asshole. Unknown to me while I was in the office (we have two rooms) in the room that is open I opened a file cabinet and (thought and double checked) locked it. My coworker texted me freaking out that said cabinet was unlocked and key to lock it was in said locked room. To the asshole part, answered yes and no and turned off my phone. They haven‚Äôt texted me back but at this point idk what I can do about the situation. I‚Äôm at a loss. I literally spent the ENTIRE day trying to fix my mess up. Nothing got fixed. I just want to keep my phone off and say Fuck it. Excuse my language. WIBTA if I had exhausted my ability to fix my mistake and just turned off my phone to anymore questions about fixing my mistake for the day? This being said I will probably look into the status of the door in the morning. Just can‚Äôt handle anything else today.

Edit: I am an intern and do not get paid. That being said I feel responsible but do not know how much of the responsibility actually lays on me. The doorknob in question has tape over it saying do not lock. My client obviously did not see that. It was scotch tape. The directors fix is to get it unlocked then put tape back over it for the future. Instead of Full out fixing the problem.",0.33

Around 4 months ago I was talking to N and other friends and she straight up called me a wh@re and a h@e after I asked a question. 

I didn‚Äôt want to forgive her so I completely ignored her, here is where I might be the A hole, she and my friend, K were calling me in a GC and I straight up ignored them, K asked if her calling me a wh@re was worse than me accidentally making fun of his dead dad.

"AITA for cutting a woman in line to check out at Target? Today I (F30) was at Target after work. I was in a rush to checkout as I had stopped there on my walk home from work and was having a little blood sugar crash.

Some background: The Target here (in a major city) is set up with a long aisle that leads to about 20 self-checkout stations and maybe 5 checkout cashiers. A Target employee oversees the self-checkout stations and encourages people to walk down to use the furthest ones, but there's no queue or assignment system for the self-checkout stations (like how some stores have an employee or screen direct you to a particular number checkout). There are enough self-checkout stations that I've never seen a line form to use them.

After grabbing some pretzels and a few other groceries, I walked down the aisle to checkout, and a slightly older woman and her 8ish-year-old child are walking in front of me. She walks to the end of the aisle and then stops right where the self-checkout stations begin. About 1/3 of the self-checkout stations are open. I've not paid much attention to her at this point, but her child seemed to be looking at some of the Easter toys and candy in the aisle so I figure she's letting them look before checking out. I walk past her towards one of the self-checkout stations, and she yells, ""I was waiting here too"". I'm a little confused, so I gesture to the two open stations nearest to me and say ""You can go ahead"". She then yells ""you went in front of me"", so I say that she can use whichever stations are open. 

She's clearly angry at this point, and another customer comes over and tells her that she doesn't have to wait. She responds that she thought someone would tell her when to go. To avoid any further confrontation, and because I'm concerned I'll pass out if I don't eat a few pretzels soon, I head further down the line to another open checkout and leave soon after.

Was I the a\*\*hole for passing the woman?

"AITA for not wanting my daughter to go to her cousins funeral? Using a throwaway as this is very personal and i'm not up to getting into a discussion with family and friends about it. 

My six year old niece recently passed away after a car crash where a drunk driver hit the car my sister and BIL were driving. My little niece was the only fatality in that accident, as you can imagine our entire family is devastated, especially than my four year old daughter.  The girls were best friends due to the fact my sister lives just down the street and they were more like sisters than cousins. 

It has been very hard helping her come to terms with this and understand that her cousin is gone and wont be coming back, i've tried to soften it by talking about the afterlife with her. I'm not very religious myself but our family is Catholic so that has helped her a little even if she doesn't understand fully and cries most days wanting to see her. 

The funeral is in three days and I do not want to take my daughter, she is already struggling with this and has bad dreams more often than not as she is so upset. I am currently looking into a child psychologist to help her come to term with this loss. My family are upset with me over my desire to keep her away from the funeral stating that she has a right to be there so she can say goodbye and get some closure, they have also brought up how it'll be a comfort for my Sister and BIL to have someone so close to there daughter there.

I worry though that being at a funeral is far too heavy for a young child especially one currently struggling...and i'm more than a little angry at the fact that she should be there just to offer comfort to them as she is too young to have that kind of burden put on her.

"AITA For telling my Aunt how I feel? Hey guys! I'm 19F to begin. My aunt is 25F.

So to preface this, my aunt took guardianship of a girl (14F) while her parents work towards getting her back. The girl has lots of immediate family (grandparents and aunts) that could've taken her in but my aunt decided to get her because she was her ex boyfriend's daughter. She also willingly adopted all the dogs and knew what responsibilities would entail. She also became guardian of the girl knowing everything she'd be dealing with.

My aunt has been ignoring my messages and I told her I love her and asked her how she was and she didn't respond until a few days later asking me about some money. I messaged her and asked what has been going on with her and she told me she went on a Christian women's retreat and left a dog babysitter to babysit her 4 adult dogs (5M, 2M, 6M, 1.5F) and 9 puppies. The person didn't do what they were supposed to.

She was complaining about raising a kid on her own and how hard it is. I asked her some questions about the situation because I didn't know information such as; ""why did you go on the retreat? Was it mandatory? Did you have a dog babysitter? You knew when taking in K that it would be hard and you were single before so how was that gonna change yknow? I feel like ever since you took K in you've barely messaged me or wanted to talk to me and messaging me only about the money made me feel like you only care about the money and not about seeing how i am or responding to me messaging asking you how you are. It feels like there's no space in your life for me and it make sme feel kinda like what moms been doing has. Idk maybe ive just been feeling some kinda way.""

She freaked out on me and told me I was rude and how I don't know how hard it is to raise a kid, how i must be feeling some kind of way because instead of being positive i just mase it worse. I told her i was just telling her how I felt and I apologized and acknowledged that I can see how she took it some kind of way but i have been pushing my feelings down and I wanted to communicate like an adult, let her know how Im feeling.

I pointed out I didn't take it personally when she snapped on me so I asked why she was taking it personally and she told me we can just talk about it later.

"AITAH-roomates girlfriend sleeping over My roomates girlfriend has been spending the night almost everynight. I finally told him she cannot live here considering it says it on the lease. After 2 weeks of her living here she finally moved all of her stuff out. However not 2 days after she had been gone I wake up to find her shoes out in the living room. A few things to keep in mind, they're both young and she is still living with her parents so I do understand that she doesn't have any place to go. Additionally our apartment is tiny, 2 bed one bath with a living room and half a kitchen, I think around 1000 square feet. Also it's not like I dislike her, she's a good person, she's helped cleaned up a bit every now and then nothing crazy serious. She does also feel entitled from what I can tell, for example we (my roomate and I) threw a party and she told everyone she ""basically lives here"" which I also think set me off.
 
I told him he cannot have her over more than 3 or 4 times a week, I have boundries and I agreed to live with one person not him and his significant other every night. The person I'm seeing says they want to spend a lot of time together, which I understand, not saying she can't be over, but shouldn't be sleeping here all days of the week. AITAH for dictating how often she can sleep here? We pay equal rent so maybe? But also our aparment is small and I feel like she's invading my space.

 Appreciate all your thoughts!

Edit 1) Some important details to add. I don't think I emphasize how small our apartment is, we share a living room and they typically watch movies together. Even if they are in their room, I hear them talking, or doing things typical partners do. It usually isn't as simple as well he keeps to his room and I to mine, it would probably be easier if we had a bigger place.",0.12
"AITA For Not Changing Myself For A Job? I, F(19) and my mother, F(60) were on the way back from her job. My mother owns her own cleaning company where she is the sole worker and has built up her clientele. I used to help out a lot as a kid and now on my breaks from school I help out around once or twice a week since she's older and can use the help. I had recently gotten a septum piercing (nose piercing) and it was the type that you can flip up to hide it. 
We take Covid very seriously but a couple of my mothers clients get Covid tested regularly so she decided to start cleaning their house without masks. They are one of the clients I help her clean for. She asked me to flip up my nose ring when working in their house, to which I fully understand. 
I had already decided I was willing to flip it up but I had just gotten off work and was very exhausted so I decided to ask her why. She told me it was unprofessional and I mentioned that the clients were young and likely wouldn't care and that if they did I would gladly flip it up.
I told her I could just keep wearing a mask in their house because the nose ring is uncomfortable to wear flipped up but I had apparently already done the damage. She proceeded to yell at me, said that ""sometimes you just need to think about other people"" and insinuated that I was selfish and inconsiderate. My mother has a tendency of saying those things to me so it definitely grinded my gears and brought back those memories so I told her I wouldn't change myself for her job. 
I probably shouldn't have pushed it and just done what she asked but I was too upset by what she said so I have to ask: Am I The Asshole? 

TLDR: My mother called me inconsiderate because I asked her why I should flip up my nose piercing for work. 

EDIT: I also want to mention that I was really calm when talking to her despite being a bit grumpy. I only ever got snippy with her when she yelled at me and called me inconsiderate. My response was less about the nose piercing and more so about her calling me selfish.",0.25

"AITA for wanting him to sell his vehicle? My husband (64M) and I (66F) are retired. He was diagnosed with Early Onset Alzheimer's a couple of years ago, so his judgement isn't always the best. About 15 years ago, when we were both working, I agreed to him buying a classic vehicle (a rare Land Rover Defender). I have never driven it (it's simply too big for me to drive. I'm 5'3"", he is 6'6"", and it is proportioned more for him.) He has always loved it, and taken pride in it. Now, it just sits in the garage. 

Today, I learned that this vehicle has become a very valuable collector's item worth six figures. We are both living okay on small pensions and Social Security. If we sold it (we both paid for it, and paid it off many years ago), we could use that money and pay off our house mortgage. That would be a huge relief, and enable us to indulge in a more pleasant lifestyle.

When I brought this up to him, he became very agitated and angry. He is still very capable in many ways, and I hate to deny him of anything that might make the next few years happy for him. However, I am starting to resent his stubborness and inability to see my perspective. His vehicle means a lot to him, but I must be responsible for both of our well being. 

AITA for being resentful, and pushing this any further? I need some reasonable guidance. Thanks.",0.32

"AITA for not wanting to go to my dad's birthday party? I (12F) have been looking forward to a bat mitzvah for a few months now. The problem is that the very same day at the same time is my dad's birthday celebration. I know it may sound like I'm the AH but I have a few reasons to think I might not be. My mom was the one who chose the time for my dad's party and she knew months before that I had the bat mitzvah that same day (I think she just forgot.) The second reason is that the day of his celebration isn't his actual birthday and I offered to do something with him on his actual birthday instead, but he didn't like that idea. Both my parents want me to go, but I think I'm leaning towards the idea of going to the bat mitzvah because all my friends will be there and everyone will be talking about it on Monday.

"AITA for telling my parents to get new patches for their dog‚Äôs vest? So, my parents recently purchased a vest for their dog (my childhood dog) that has big patches that say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Special‚Äù and ‚ÄúIn Training‚Äù. 

He is not a service dog whatsoever (or in training). Also, he‚Äôs a lab so he‚Äôs super happy and social around people, but he hates other dogs and will bark and snarl at them.

"WIBTA if I asked my MIL why she cropped me out of photos? Update: You all have spoken, I will do as I have always done and let it go. Also, thank you to those who were compassionate and offered condolences.  It‚Äôs impossible to deal with your emotions and thoughts when they change minute by minute.

My husband, her youngest son, passed away about two months ago. It was sudden and unexpected and we are all going through so many emotions. It was supposed to be my husbands birthday last week. I don‚Äôt have Facebook, so I heard it through other people but apparently I was cropped out of the photos she posted. A photo from a high school dance and a photo from our wedding. One of his good friends Jimmy had a picture with him and was mentioned in the post, and old high school friends he hasn‚Äôt seen in year were pictured and mentioned, I was not. My husband and I were having some issues and not seeing eye to eye which was leading toward the path to divorce, but I loved him, he was my best friend. I still love him we just weren‚Äôt good for each other. I‚Äôve always been nice to her and gone above and beyond when they visit. The old me would just let it go because it‚Äôs not really about me and people deal with grief differently. So I might be an asshole if I bring it up because it isn‚Äôt really about me, it‚Äôs about him. But I‚Äôm really fucking angry and it is bothering me a lot.

"AITA for telling my best friend that ""just because you lost your chance with the colleges you want, doesn't mean that I need to lose my optimism with the one I want"" So, I'm a senior in high school, and the FSU decisions literally just came out a week ago. I got deferred, meaning that they are just putting off making the decision until later on and I still have a chance of getting in. Recently, I found out that my weighted GPA is over a 4.0 (a huge accomplishment for me), and that my class rank also went up. That combined with my new ACT scores (which I haven't received yet) and additional awards on the sports teams I was on, makes me believe that I have a fair chance of getting in. So naturally, I told my friend about this. They told me that I need to be more realistic with my goals and that they were ""being honest"" when they said they doesn't think I would get in. I retaliated, saying that ""just because you lost your chance with the colleges you want, doesn't mean that I need to lose my optimism with the one I want"", (they originally wanted to apply to UChicago and Brown (which are reach schools for them, but they still stood a chance), and the only reason why they lost her chance was because they DIDNT APPLY, and STILL HASN'T APPLIED TO ANY SCHOOLS, which is frustrating because I know they would get in because they are such a better student than me, but they just DIDNT APPLY, which is THEIR fault, because it is THEIR responsibility, even though THEY blame ME for not reminding them about the deadlines or anything college-related, when, in reality, it seemed like I cared more than THEY did). They said that what I said was harsh and ""uncalled for"", and that what they said was out of ""good intentions"", and yeah it sucks that they missed their deadlines, but THEY are at least being realistic and applying to schools like UCF. I told them that the only reason why they are being ""realistic"" is because they missed the deadlines, and pointed out that I believe I have a fair chance at getting in, despite what they think, and that I still have the right to have hope because I am trying my best over here.

And this isn't the first time they have acted this way, whenever I tell them I got into a college or got awarded a scholarship, they always respond in a passive-aggressive way (I remember one time they said ""Wow! Congratulations! I didn't think you would get in), or they give me the silent treatment. And it hurts me, every time they do that, but I put up with it because they're my BEST FRIEND, who I love and care for so much.

We haven't talked since the fight and I feel so much guilt for what I said, but I'm afraid that they won't forgive me, and, if they do, that it will go back to the way it was before. And to be completely honest, I'm too stubborn to make the first move when it comes to apologies (because it's me who always has to) and I genuinely believe that what I said, while hurtful, was how I felt, and I'm done with having to apologize for my feelings with them.

Am I the asshole?

&#x200B;

edit: We have talked about jealousy before and we are both jealous of the way the other supposedly just does everything with ease when it comes to schoolwork and academic achievements, and I admit, we feed both off of that feeling (along with our anger towards ourselves) during arguments. I also tend to push them away a lot in fear that I will get abandoned, so I might have been doing that during this situation.",0.75
"WIBTA for stealing 800$ from my parents?  

I(17F) am getting ready to go to University next year. I want 800$ from the final child tax credit months I get from before turning 18 soon, so I'm thinking of asking my grandfather who has control because my parents don't deserve it

Important back story, I lived with my grandparents since I was 2, but my Nan died when I was 11 and my grandfather (F) had a stroke in May of my grade 11 year. I had a job at McDonald's since I was 15, and had been paying most of my own expenses by choice. I was a good worker and got employee of the month my 4th month there, and was apart of a drive thru team to help procedures after 1 year there(total 1 1/2 years). F always had my back financially if something happened. I tried living with my mother(C) and her step father(J) before after my Nan died, but they were unstable and caused a lot of psych. damage. Before I came up when I was 17 due to the stroke, my J and had been living off of EI ,while C was off of work for a bit, causing financial troubles, but F had a stroke and I had to come up in May

I lost my job and had bills I needed to pay since I was financially supporting myself and made my own choices. My parents said they would use the child tax credit (450$) to pay for the 150$ I need in total, but they used it to help pay off their own debts. I got a job soon after in June and was able to pay off my own debts, and I had to stay with my parents my grade 12 year. The summer was hell, worked almost everyday because I didn't want to be home with J who never cleaned the house and told me, ""since you'll be staying with us and don't cost us a lot of money, you being here will \*HELP US\* get out of our debt"". I was home only to sleep, I ate at work, paid my own furniture, clothes, and food since there was none in the house after 4 days due (relatives over 24/7). They didn't pay off their 800$ cable bill, and was getting cut off. I told C, I could give her the money, but she said she would just think about it. Two weeks later she asked me for the 800$ on the spot, no notice or any time to back out. I gave her it because she used her paycheck to pay off the cable bill since I was helping out, and needed the 800$ for her bills soon.

They barely treat me like a daughter despite my help (helped out on more occasions), C never spent any time with me. They still waste the child tax credit on weed, take out, own debts, inviting people over and the only things I use in the house are basic utilities when home and only one meal a day (25h work, 35h school). I got fed up so I'm going to ask my F to send me the last two sends of money since he finally got a job and they're going to make money by selling the house and moving into apartment that he gets 50% off. They're not happy as it is ""stealing"" and as my ""parents"" this is money their entitled to. Would I be TA if I asked my F to send the last two cheques to me to go towards my education fund, I don't think I cost as much as they say?",0.4

"AITA For Leaving the Dinner Table When my Dad Refused to Wear his Hearing Aids? Throwaway for privacy reasons

My (15F) father (64) has hearing problems and recently got hearing aids (a few months ago).

He almost never wears his hearing aids, including at work (he‚Äôs a pharmacist so he talks to customers a lot), outside of the house, or in the house.¬†

The other day my dad, me, and my mom (53) sat down together to eat a family dinner. My dad works the night shift so this doesn‚Äôt happen too often (a few times a month). My mom and I started having a conversation, but my dad seemed to be tuned out and staring in the distance, not hearing what we were saying. I then asked him a question directly, he didn‚Äôt respond immediately and then loudly asked ‚ÄúWHAT?‚Äù¬†

I was annoyed at this. I wanted to include him in the conversation, but he either just didn‚Äôt bother to listen or change the topic entirely and go on a monologue.¬†

This wasn‚Äôt the first time he‚Äôs done this. In fact, he has been this way for years and I hoped him finally getting hearing aids would fix the issue, but he refuses to wear them.

Then I asked him to put on his hearing aids. He refused, saying now he wasn‚Äôt going to out of principle because I was asking him.

I couldn‚Äôt help but get annoyed.

Here‚Äôs where I might be the AH: I told him, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to eat with you unless you can hear me. Could you¬†*please*¬†put on your hearing aids?‚Äù I was visibly annoyed at this point, and he again refused. So I left the dinner table. Didn‚Äôt take my half-eaten plate with me, just went to my room and didn‚Äôt leave the rest of the night.

My mom told me I shouldn‚Äôt force dad to put in his hearing aids and that trying to tell him to wear them will only make things worse. I feel like my reaction was uncalled for, but I really want to have a normal family conversation for once.

ALSO- I‚Äôve had a (mild) speech impediment my whole life so it‚Äôs already hard for my dad to understand me.

AITA?

EDIT: Thank you so much for everyone who responded! All of your comments gave me perspective (I was especially surprised to see a lot of comments from people who were HoH- hard of hearing) and a way to approach a conversation with my dad to resolve this conflict. 

Turns out there is a deeper reason behind him not wearing his hearing aids: he doesn‚Äôt like how it produces a sort of echo in his ear when he talks (he described it as someone is saying his words back to him directly in his ear). After talking about it for a bit, I told him he couldn‚Äôt get used to them if he didn‚Äôt wear them at all, and he agreed! We came to the agreement that he would start trying to get used to them by making an effort to wear them at the dinner table.

Again, thank you for giving me insight on how to resolve this conflict! This was my first ever post of AITA so I was pleasantly surprised with all of the advice and support you all gave! Have a great rest of your day/night!",0.06

"AITA for being upset that my parents and siblings are going to Europe without me To explain further, I‚Äôm (19f) traveling to Barcelona this spring for an academic conference, and will be there for about a week.

They scheduled it specifically during my younger brother‚Äôs spring break because they understandably didn‚Äôt want to pull him out of school or have him miss his swim meets, in March which is when my break falls.

"AITA when I keep rejecting a friend's request to hang out even though she is reaching out for support with mental health? I don't have the energy or patience right now. My friend has severe mental health issues often. It's nothing new, she's been struggling with it for  years. She's in intense therapy right now. 4 days a week for 1.5 hours a day which includes group and personal therapy, plus individual assessments/appointments which are supplemental. We've been friends for a year, and occasionally talk on discord but mostly message on telegram.

This friend is great and very supportive of me. She's compassionate and open minded and non-judgemental. She's been available for me to call when I'm sad or sometimes stressed. 

But she's hard to be friends with for a lot of reasons. She doesn't pick up on social cues, she tries to guilt me into staying with her longer all the time (eg, I'll be sad if you don't stay at least another 20 minutes! etc). She may have autism (her words, not mine). Another thing is that neither of us feels that our units can accommodate guests appropriately (very tiny spaces, I get it), so we don't invite each other over, and she is paranoid about eating at restaurants (it's some kind of phobia for her). Given we live in a cold winter climate, this severely limits the actual places we can go (often -10 C to -20 C, and both of us hate it). During the summer however, we would go on a lot of walks (free, outdoors, not cold), but in the winter she'll say she wants to meet, but can't even pick a venue for us to meet at since neither of us want to be outside or invite each other over.

I basically only see her when I have the patience mentally and to deal with the logistic challenges of meeting.

Lately I don't have that patience, and I am stressed with a lot of things!

I felt especially bad a couple weeks ago when she called me crying begging to see me in person because she hadn't seen anyone IRL in months. I told her I really couldn't because I can't afford the transportation (which is true, I'm really struggling financially, like... it's really bad), but the reason was I didn't want to waste 4+ hours at her place accommodating a melt down. Realistically, she's going to be mentally struggling whether I'm there or not, and she'll have a bad day whether I go there or not. Instead I stayed with her on the phone for several hours and she ended up feeling better.

Sounds harsh, I know. And I care about her, and I'd love to put more effort into a relationship with her, but my own life is burning me out, I just don't feel like I have the energy for anything but small talk with her, because she does take a lot of energy to deal with.

"AITA for leaving clothes in my boyfriend's work truck? My boyfriend (24m) and his family run a business together. The business is owned, run and operated by him, his dad, his sister, and their aunt (dads sister). They have 2 trucks that they call their ""work"" trucks that they all share (but his dad technically owns)- that they all use both for the business and personal reasons. Nothing super fancy, just a couple old trucks for running around. Well, my boyfriend and I (25f) ran a couple errands yesterday that were both work related for him and some that were personal. One of our personal errands was stopping by Sam's Club. While we were there we got groceries and we got a couple items of clothing- a few shirts for each of us and a pair of jeans for him. While carrying in the groceries, we pretty much forgot about these clothes and left them in the truck. Today, his aunt called and said she needed to use the truck to make a dump run. We said okay and thought nothing of it. When she returned the truck, we found our clothes sitting on the back floor with muddy footprints all over them. She had shoved them on the floor and let her 2 kids (ages 8 and 10) walk all over them. My boyfriend and I called his aunt and told her it upset us a lot that she couldn't have either taken the clothes out or put them in the front seat so they wouldn't be ruined.

I'm not a ""big"" guy but I do eat a lot bc I enjoy food and with my daily routine I need a lot of calories. I had finished my first helping and went for seconds after everyone had gotten their plates and I took a big bite bc that's just how I eat, my mom starts yelling at me saying I could choke which is a valid concern but my grandmother starts SCREAMING at me calling me a pig and saying ""have another f-ing bite"" over and over again and calling me a fatass and stuff like that.

I have asked my husband to say something to his dad but my hubby is not the type to be confrontational.

"AITA for asking my house mates/ex and close friend to be more discreet when having sex Brad (27M), Emma (26F) and I (23F) work and live together at a seasonal job. Last year I dated Brad. It was a bad idea so we kept it casual and tried to be private about it. Emma knew and didn't mind. We were all close friends. 

The seasonal job ended and we all went our own way. Since then I have entered another relationship. Brad and I still messaged so I let him know about the new relationship and he was fine with it. 

The seasonal job started up again and we all decided to come back to the same place. 

Brad was nice at first; even got along with my new boyfriend! Although he would sometimes get drunk and get angry at me about random stuff. Over time I stopped seeing him as a friend but I was still close to Emma. 

Brad started sleeping with another girl from work. I was unphased by this but less then a week after that girl left Brad started sleeping with Emma. Emma told me right away because she didn't want to do it behind my back. She shared intimate details about the sex with me. I didn't want to hear it all but we would laugh about the same moves he pulled on both of us. 

One morning I heard them having sex. We all start work at midday and this was 10:30am. It made me feel uncomfortable so I went for a run. When I got back I was still kind of tense. Emma asked what was wrong and I told her. I said that I heard them and I'm okay with them being together but I do regret dating Brad. I said I hated being ""the ex"" and I asked her that if they were going to sleep together could they please do it at night or when I'm away (I stay at my boyfriend's half the time anyway) so I wouldn't hear. She said if I am over Brad I shouldn't mind hearing them and it was normal but she would end things with him because she cared about our friendship more then casual sex. I told her that she definitely didn't need to end it with him on my account but Emma insisted on talking to Brad. 

The next day Brad was PISSED. I asked Emma what she said to make him so upset. She told him that she ""cares about our friendship more then sex"" and she ended things between them. She said he lost it- calling me a bitch and saying I'm controlling who he sleeps with. As far as I know Emma didn't defend me or explain that I just wanted to not hear them have sex and it was HER decision to end things. Later I find out that Emma wanted to end it anyway because Brad kept pressing her to sleep with him. Emma also mentioned that she might continue to sleep with him but only when she is drunk. 

That night I spoke to both Brad and Emma together to make sure there was no confusion. I explained that I heard them having sex, it made me uncomfortable and I only ask as a house mate to be more discreet. They said I should have used headphones and I shouldn't have made it an ""ex"" issue when it's a ""house mate"" issue. They thought it was weird I was uncomfortable hearing them have sex and that I made a huge drama about everything.¬†

"AITA for calling out my coworker for his immoral behavior? Long time reader first time poster.

I work for a small shop and we've recently hired on some new staff. When I first started working with one of the new guys he seemed nice enough. After a few days of working with him he asked me a personal question which I don't mind. He asked if I was gay as I kept referring to my boyfriend as partner. I said yes and then he asked if I get offended easily. I told him no as I don't really pay mind to what others think. 

Well everything was fine and he'd make jokes here and there that were not offensive and actually kind of funny. Well this past week he's started making very rude and offensive jokes about others and then told me about something he did recently that I found appalling.

Examples:
- While watching a YouTube video he started commenting on this womans appearance saying she was totally hot but her boobs looked fake. I told him they were indeed not real boobs as she is a Trans Woman. He then proceed to call her IT.  I told him she's not an it that she's a woman. If you don't agree that's fine but at least have some human deceny and to give people some respect.
- He has started to say jokes that contain slurs and I again told him he shouldn't be saying this especially at work. He then asked if he called me the F word( the gay slur ) if I'd be offended. I said no, but that doesn't mean he should call me that and we dropped it.
- He made fun of a man and said he looked like Shrek when he himself isn't a conventionally attractive man.

Well today after he was coming back from his break he asked me if I wouldn't judge him if he told me something that he did a few days ago that he thought was hilarious. I said it depends on what he tells me. He then proceeded to say that while out the other night he saw a homeless woman on the side of the street begging for money(His words). He told me that he decided he wanted to fuck with her to see if she was really homeless. He walked up to her and asked her hey if I gave you $50 could you blow me....

I was shocked and a bit speechless on what I just heard come from him. He then started talking about how if she was really homeless that she would've taken his offer even though he had no intention to follow through.

In the rant he also made some choice comments about women.

Well I looked at him and said that what he had did was completely evil and immature. I asked him if this is really how he thought of people and he said yeah. So I ripped into him a bit and asked him how he would feel if people called him names and treat him like crap just because he is a larger man. He just stood there and then walked out after I was done. 

I feel like I have done nothing wrong giving him shit for being an asshole, but I also want to make sure I didn't take it too far.

I freaked out and said I wanted to deep clean oven, behind and under it before we went any further, and instantly pulled out cleaner and started pulling racks out of the oven and storage drawer to clean. Friends stated I won't find a mouse in the oven and it's not a big deal, I don't have to go all ""OCD Rambo"" and ""every old home will get a mouse in it sooner or later"" when I insisted on cleaning everything before we started cooking I was told I was just trying to show off and they should have dumped the skillet contents out for me because they knew I would react this way. They 1. noticed the telltale evidence before me, and 2. Heating up the oven will drive it out anyway. 
Now here's my problem. 1. Seasoned cast iron isn't regularly cleaned with soap and water. 2.mice can carry disease and 3. Heating up the oven/skillet and baking/cooking can vaporizer the bacteria and disease in mouse poop. 4. I would try to have everything cleaned before the eggs and butter came to room temperature. And finally 5. I'm not wasting ingredients, gas (gas oven), or time on something I refuse to eat because it came from a oven with evidence of mouse poop. I'm not arguing that old homes are easier for mice to enter, I'm a little discouraged that my cats are to lazy to show interest in being mousers. I was again told my attitude was upsetting them and I was being ridiculous and overreacting. Enter OCD Rambo comment here, and I'm acting this way because I like cleaning, my house is way cleaner then theirs and want to show off, have I taken my meds for the day and I should talk to my therapist about my behavior or increasing my meds. This caused me to tune the remainder of their words out. I didn't touch the therapist or meds comment mainly because I was to shocked they went there, and I told them they're disgusting if they're planning on eating something that came out of the same oven as possible mouse poop and to get out of my house. I keep saying possible because no other evidence was found then the 2 pieces in the skillet.
Now I'm having mutual friends and family telling me that I over reacted, probably mistook what I saw and ruined the surprise cake that we were going to bake for a 50th b-day and I'm no longer invited to party. AITA?",0.01

"AITA for getting upset at my sister for eating the last piece of bread? Okay I know how petty the title sounds but hear me out. 

I have pretty severe digestive issues and i‚Äôm currently on a strict meal plan to try and figure out the cause. No lactose, low fructose, low gluten. I‚Äôm living with my parents and younger sister, no one else has these same issues and don‚Äôt have any dietary restrictions. My family know all about my meal plans and know what‚Äôs my food. It‚Äôs different to what is usually brought and it‚Äôs also separated from the rest of the food in the pantry. 

For the past week i‚Äôve been having sourdough bread for breakfast (dietitian says it‚Äôs okay due to the lower amount of fructans compared to normal sliced bread) but today my sister ate the last few pieces for breakfast and i got very upset and cried and yelled at her. She could eat anything in the house but she ate my bread and i had to go without breakfast which threw off my whole day. 

My parents say i‚Äôm overreacting and i‚Äôm being ridiculous over some bread. But I‚Äôm so upset at my sister just taking what she wants because she can and without thinking of anyone else. 

It‚Äôs also worth noting I‚Äôm autistic, so any change in my plans is extremely distressing and i find it hard to cope, which probably contributed to the outburst.

Edit: Just to clarity ages because a few people mentioned it. I‚Äôm 21, my sister is 17",0.27
"AITA for screaming at my mom? TLDR: my mom wouldnt let me speak at all when I was trying to talk to her, started accusing me of random things, and yelled at me for no reason. So I screamed and clapped in her face. 

My (15f) mom and I had made an agreement to wash dishes right after doing them. All my life the system for dishes was you wash what you need then put it in the sink for the next person. It's disgusting. It's gotten so bad that there's often maggots and mold in older dishes like pots and slow cookers. Every time I have talked to my mom about it she always spurts out ""I'm not the only one who can do dishes around here!!"" Which she's right. My step dad does NOT help clean unless it's extremely bad and he only does it with my mom. He never cooks. He doesn't work. He only plays video games all day in his room. It's so bad that when my sister peed herself in the bathroom, he let it sit there for hours until my mom got home to clean it. I can't clean dishes due to the smells and the left over food as I have texture issues.

I have made several suggestions. My first solution was to have everyone rinse their dishes. I brought it up to my mom and she told me ""just wash the ones that don't have food on them"" which wouldn't work as I need to dig around to find what I need and I told her that. Nothing changed, so I brought up another solution. I asked her if we could start washing the dishes right after we were done with them. She said that she had mentioned doing that a while ago, which means she's on board, right? 

Wrong. She never fully started doing it. Always picked and chose what she'd wash, but whatever it was something. Then after a week, it stopped entirely. I was fed up. I had to wash everyone else's stuff several times already and with the new system that shouldn't happen. I was visibly upset when she got home today. She asked what was wrong and rolled her eyes at me when I said it was the dishes. 

I brought it up later but before I could say a full sentence she interrupted me. She started yelling at me about an aditude. I tried to talk and she again, interrupted after the first word and started yelling about how I'm not gonna dismiss the hard work she does, brought up my trash in the living room (a box I use as a table with popcans and cups on it) told me I shouldn't be getting on her about the dishes when she asked me so many times (mentioned it once or twice) to do something with it. And then she threatened to cancel my piercing appointment for Monday if I was gonna keep giving her aditude and argue with her over the dishes. At this point I lost it. I started clapping in her face as hard and loud as I could. I screamed at her to let me talk. She hadn't made any effort to listen to me or what I was trying to say. I was just trying to figure out why she wasn't holding up our agreement . But instead she did all that.

I know I shouldn't have yelled and clapped, but giving how she was acting I feel it was kind of justified. So, AITA?",0.23
"AITA for refusing to go to dinner with my friends every time they go? Hello, I (22m) suffer from celiac disease meaning I cant ingest any form of gluten be it from wheat, barley, rye, malt, etc. My entire friend group knows this and we joke about it from occasion which is totally fine by me. We typically play D&D once a week and then typically we'll get our own food or they'll get little Caesars for how cheap it is and how strapped for cash early 20s people are. Sure it sucks not being able to have that option for myself but its never been any issue and I totally understand.

My issue starts whenever they want to go out and do something which has only been either going out to a nice ramen place where they typically have zero to offer me or even less common this nicer fried chicken place. The past few times they actually got me to go I couldn't even get a bowl of steamed rice. Even worse is the one time we actually did something different, going to a bar-cade, they decided pretty much without me to go to a ramen place even though I brought up the fact that Its more likely then not that I cant eat there.

Its gotten to the point where I will just ignore whenever they talk about going out to eat since chances are, I cant meaningfully join in.",0.08
"AITA for allowing my friend to have full access to my home computer? For context, I (27 m) am living with my GF (26 f) and we have been together for 3 years.  
Now, I love gaming, it's been my hobby for as long as I can remember and I've made quite a few friends through it. One of these friends is a guy I'll call Jack (30 m) for privacy's sake.   


Jack has been my friend for about 5 years now and I've recently given him access over Parsec to connect at any time, because we both game a lot after work. I've only known Jack online for these 5 years, but I can honestly say he's one of my closest friends at this point and I 100% trust him to be able to connect to my PC whenever he wants. What's he gonna do anyways? Connect while I'm at work while nobody's using it?  
Apparently this was a no go with my wife. She got super pissed after finding out I gave John access to my PC. She does a lot of banking and online shopping on my PC, she has one but it's pretty old and runs slow. Mine is much nicer. She's accusing Jack of trying to ""steal information"" from us or that it's ""a ticking time bomb before he sees something he shouldn't""  


I told her that Jack has been my friend longer than we've been dating and she's wrong to accuse him of these things. Now, I did get pretty heated, but it's because I really do trust Jack and I'm honestly super hurt that she doesn't trust me or him. I know she doesn't know him super well, they've only talked over a call once or twice, but that's no reason to not trust him. And it's my PC anyways. If she wants to do her banking, she can do it on her computer.  
After all this, well... to say she blew up, would be an understatement. She started yelling at me. Saying I need to take my, and her privacy more seriously. I get it, online privacy is a big deal these days, but you can't just accuse everything and everyone of having bad intentions.   


After the fight, she left for a few hours and while she is still speaking to me, I can tell she's still pissed and Jack was a bit upset hearing my GF didn't trust him once I told him what happened.  
So AITA?",0.9
"AITA for getting mad at my bf for not considering me for a promotion? My boyfriend (24m) and I (22f) work together in a company. We both enjoy our work very much, even though he doesn't want to stay there in the long term, while I definitely want to stay there, partly because of the good relationship with my colleagues. We got to know each other through this company, even though I had already worked there for a year longer. We started as good friends, then developed feelings for each other and finally started dating. 

So far it's been a really happy, healthy relationship and he's really a great person, but there's this one thing that's been extremely bothering me the past week. He got, definitely very deserved, a promotion and is now a step above me after another colleague unfortunately left the company for a new job offer. Even though he definitely has his faults regarding the position, sometimes speaking too harshly to coworkers, I am the complete opposite and we complement each other very well, even professionally. I have, even before his promotion, helped out in the organization outside of my position and am pretty good at it too, however I don't necessarily have to have the whole job. Don't get me wrong, I would love to have that job in that position, but it's not a must as there wouldn't be a huge salary difference and my duties wouldn't really change. 

Now another colleague has left our company and a management position is available that, even according to him, would actually fit my skill set very well. He really did not consider me once, even though I have been working there longer than him, for the reason that he thought I would not feel comfortable in the position. I admit here that I often didn't handle decisions well, but this job helped me a lot to become more confident there. 

Instead, he is now hiring someone who is asking for a much higher salary and hasn't worked at the company before. I have to say that it is not only his decision, but also that of his equal colleagues, but he said directly that he does not see me in this position for the above-mentioned reason. When he told me about it, I didn't say directly that I'm pissed, but still I am somehow, even if I know that I'm probably a complete asshole for it. I really try to separate work and private life, but this situation bothers me a lot. It doesn't really bother me that I didn't get the position, but rather the reason because it's just not right. 

I have brought this very thing up with him as well, but he doesn't set it right even if he could. He himself stays very much out of the whole process because we are just together and only gave this answer when asked about me through another manager.

So am I the asshole for being mad at him about it?",0.89
"AITA for not inviting my BIL to our baby‚Äôs first birthday? Title pretty much hits it on the nose. My brother in law (35) is incredibly selfish and we‚Äôve never really gotten along. He was an ass on my wedding day and now doesn‚Äôt have any interest in my baby. He and my husband work at the same place and when I would come visit he would always make an excuse to leave. Once when he didn‚Äôt know I was there we bumped into each other, he looked over my shoulder at my baby, said ‚Äúhuh‚Äù, then walked away. Safe to say I‚Äôm not trying very hard for them to get close. I know he‚Äôs family but I honestly have no interest in inviting him to her first birthday party. I know it would hurt my husbands feelings because they are close but at this point I don‚Äôt want people around my baby who don‚Äôt care about her.

ETA- wedding: 
The day before our wedding he complained that his wife wouldn‚Äôt be included in the wedding procession (in-laws were supposed to walk together, husband took my mom) so we had to change the line up the night before the wedding. 
He flipped off the photographer (one of our incredibly good friends) every time he would try to get a candid photo of the guys getting ready, drinking, ect. 
He changed out of the matching groomsmen outfits the second after the ceremony so he looks different than all of the guys and wouldn‚Äôt change back.",0.14
"AITA For not helping my partner's business?   Sorry in advance for the long preface to my potential assholery, I‚Äôve tried to keep it short but there‚Äôs a lot to dig into so, TLDR: I‚Äôve said from the start that I don‚Äôt want to own a business or help but my partner keeps asking for my help.

My partner, Q, started a business while working full-time as a web developer ‚Äì cool. About 6 months later, we moved from the city to my parents. There were several reasons but the relevant is that it was an excellent opportunity for Q to transition away from his job and grow his business. He goes part-time remote, I quit my job.

My parents very generously allow us to stay entirely expense-free *and* they provide a place for Q to set up an office in their workplace. Great starting point for the business, which is still in the development stage but he eventually gets more and more clients and is successful in that tumultuous first period of new business. 

Now, it took me about 4 months to find not just any job, but my old job. That I left a year ago, gobbling up as much experience as I could, to move back in with Q in the city. And then had to move back because he decided being a business owner was the ultimate way forward. But it‚Äôs fine because I like this job a lot. 

Now, after all that context, we come to my assholing. While jobless, of course I helped out here and there, but now I have a full-time job. When I‚Äôm home I wanna be home, not doing work I don‚Äôt want to do, which is why I didn‚Äôt just take a job with his business or even my parents. Don‚Äôt wanna work too close to home.

But we periodically have arguments, when he asks me to help him with work, I will either begrudgingly do it, or I will stand my ground and get guilted into doing the work. 

I just‚Ä¶ am I the AH for being a bit lazy and being clear about that from the get-go? This is a bit defensive, but it‚Äôs not just laziness, it‚Äôs insecurity and fear at being able to do things, avoidance stress and things that might swing me into a depression. But I feel like an asshole, especially now that he‚Äôs telling me he doesn‚Äôt see the point in trying so hard when I‚Äôm happy with my job that pays just above minimum wage. But that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve ever wanted ‚Äì to be happy at my job with minimal responsibility.

"AITA for not supporting my girlfriend going on an expensive trip with her friends My girlfriend (24) and I (also 24) have been together for almost 6 years. We recently graduated college and finally moved in together. We moved to a new city for jobs. With the higher cost of living in this new city, it has been hard on her financially. After rent, she hardly has any discretionary income (about 400 for the month) and does not have any money put away. Because of this, I‚Äôll pick up the tab on groceries, dinners, drinks, going to basketball games etc. 

Here recently, she has committed to going on a vacation overseas with her friends. They are planning on spending 2 weeks traveling throughout the UK. I would be completely supportive of this trip if she could afford it, however, it feels as though I am indirectly footing the bill on this one as I have been covering a lot of expenses. Further, being as frugal as I am, I wouldn‚Äôt take a trip like this for YEARS. That is until I am financially set enough to do something of that nature. This trip is also being set up by her friend who has over 100k in student loans as a celebration of her graduation. 

She has gotten mad at me for suggesting that she shouldn‚Äôt go on the trip. She will say things like, ‚Äúif I don‚Äôt go on this trip I will regret it for the rest of my life‚Äù and every time we talk about it we get into a pretty heated discussion. I feel really bad but I do not support this trip although I inadvertently am financially supporting it. 

I have offered alternatives like taking her on vacation instead. I wouldn‚Äôt mind paying for a vacation for the two of us if I was involved. She will just say, ‚Äúfine I just won‚Äôt go if that‚Äôs what you want.‚Äù And makes me feel like I‚Äôm being irresponsible for bringing up facts. And as the cherry on top, she is burning all of her PTO on this trip. That means we won‚Äôt be able to go anywhere together in the first year I can afford to take us on vacation together. 

Am I the asshole for not supporting this trip? Are there any other solutions that anyone can offer?",0.18
"AITA for not deleting all of the pictures I have ever posted of my daughter so she can stop being perceived? My daughter, 16, has asked me to completely delete all of the photos I have ever posted or shared of her from my FB. I've had my fb since 2010 so that would be 12 years worth of photos from when she was 4.

My daughter started using social media roughly 12-13 when she got her first smartphone. At first we tried to limit her, but after a few months we allowed her to have her own social media. She has used social media regularly since, but about 6 months ago she started using it less and less until eventually she deleted most of her social media and only uses some social media (tiktok and a few others) where she doesn't post her face.

She said it was because she started to feel like social media was having a negative impact on her overall image of herself and she hated the idea of being perceived by random people on the internet. She recently even requested me and my husband to stop posting photos of her on our fb pages and I agreed, but when she asked me to delete the pictures all together I said no.

They are treasured memories for me and I posted them mostly for family and close friends. I have around 200 fb friends which isn't much following by social media standards and all are at least acquaintances of mine so they aren't complete strangers, but my daughter says that because she doesn't know them and will most likely never meet them that she feels uncomfortable with them being able to see her and know aspects of her life and even ""perceiving"" her existence without her express say so.

My daughter says she feels like she has been deprived of ever being able to live a private life or privacy in general because I have posted photos of her online. I don't feel like I am doing anything wrong by having posted these photos of her from throughout her life. The only people to interact with posts with her in them are friends and family and the occasional distant acquaintance, and they have all only ever said kind things and genuinely celebrated those parts of her life.

Edit: There are very little photos posted of my daughter just by herself, and are mostly photos of us as a family which would be me, my husband, my daughter and my other children. I have never posted photos of her that would be seen as inappropriate- not that I don't understand the sentiment that posting pictures of children in general can be considered inappropriate. When I first had FB 10 years ago I only had 50 friends and family and I have acquired more over these 10 years. When I say the photos are treasured memories to me, I mean they include me, my husband, and all of my children from out past and those photos are also meant for our family like mine and my husbands parents who live far away and enjoy being able to see their grandchildren. I have agreed with my daughter not to post anymore photos of her on my FB, but she wants me to delete them off FB-yes I can save them to the computer-but she has denied them just being put in a private album on FB just for family. Like I said, most of the photos include all of us, not just her and I want our family to be able to enjoy them especially considering we have been living in a mostly online world for the past 2 years.",0.83
"AITA for not accepting a game my bf bought me? I‚Äôd like to know if I‚Äôm making this incident complicated or I should‚Äôve just sucked it up.

My (20f) boyfriend (20m) plays games basically everyday, while I occasionally play video games just not as often. I want to try a game that my friends play, though I didn‚Äôt want to buy it because it costs around $20. My bf owns the game so I borrowed his account.

When my bf came home after work he immediately went to play on his account which resulted in booting me out of the game. It‚Äôs alright because I didn‚Äôt like the game anyway but soon as he realizes that I got booted he sends me a code.

I asked him what the code is for but he just pressured me to redeem it. When I asked why did he buy me the game, he replied that it doesn‚Äôt matter.

I got upset he spent money on me when I didn‚Äôt even ask for it. He said it doesn‚Äôt matter because it‚Äôs his money.

He never asked me if I enjoyed the game.
He never asked me if I liked it either.
He just spent his money on me when I didn‚Äôt ask for it. I have an issue about people buying me things I never asked for and it seemed he didn‚Äôt care about what I felt so I got upset for what he did.

I said that I don‚Äôt want to be ungrateful but I want him to refund the game. If I accept it, it wouldn‚Äôt be worth it if I don‚Äôt play. After I told him I have issues about people buying me stuff, he didn‚Äôt reply until the next day acting like nothing happened. He never asked me why or ask me any more details of how I felt.

"AITA for telling my mom she's being too traditional and disrespecting her wishes? I am 18F and my boyfriend is 18M. My mom is 55F. We live in the U.S. 

2 years ago, I started dating my bf. I was VERY scared to tell my mom/dad about the relationship because they are traditional Indian immigrant parents and don't approve of dating before finishing education. However, they took it better than I expected, although my mom constantly complains that I  need to prioritize my education over him even though I am at a fairly prestigious college and have a good GPA. She also gives us a curfew of 8pm when we're out. 

One thing is that my mom finds physical intimacy very taboo. She's told me multiple times that if she found out I was having sex she would cut me off financially and beat me. 

My bf and I don't go to the same college but we both visit our hometown often and last weekend, we were in my house, in my room with the door closed and locked. I was on his lap, we were making out(both fully clothed) when my mom suddenly bursts in and goes feral. She screams at us and tells my bf to leave the house immediately.

To me, she says, ""If this was India, you'd be thrown out onto the streets and called a hooker and whore!"" I screamed back and said ""I DONT FUCKING CARE IM LITERALLY AN AMERICAN CITIZEN AND WE'RE NOT IN INDIA ANYMORE SO YOU NEED TO STOP BEING TRADITIONAL"" and she got so mad at me. She took away my car, my credit card, and banned me from seeing my bf. She says I need to be a ""good Indian daughter"" and stop the intimacy with my bf but like ??? I can't just do that.

"WIBTA for seeking legal advice regarding my dads will? My (27f) dad (49m) died very suddenly and unexpectedly in July last year, what made it more traumatic for me is that he passed just shy of three months before my wedding. 

I‚Äôve never gotten on with his wife, but tolerated her because well‚Ä¶ I loved my dad. When he died, she alienated myself and my family (including his own mother and brother) from funeral arrangements, which ended with a eulogy that was frankly all over the place and with incorrect information, and she cut off all ties with the family. 

Now, my dad was an accountant for the police for just over 20 years, and as such has a pretty sizeable pension that would be paid out, also my dad was very organised so I can‚Äôt imagine with the history my family has of not making it until 60 he wouldn‚Äôt have gotten life insurance. Because of my parents divorce, it‚Äôs a long story, but my mum has been able to freeze any money being given to the wife as she is entitled to up to 50% of it, something I wasn‚Äôt happy about, but as I learnt more about how the wife treated him, I encouraged my mum to get what she was owed. I never got contacted by anyone, so assumed that maybe I was wrong and he hadn‚Äôt got his affairs in order. 

Part of my grieving process has been sending pictures and messages to my dad as if he would respond, strange, I know. But suffering with mental health it‚Äôs managed to keep me from spiralling so far. On Valentines, I went to share an anecdote ‚Äòwith my dad‚Äô to find that I had been blocked - it didn‚Äôt take much to realise the wife had blocked me, knowing how much it had been helping me. 

My husband and I tried reaching out, but was met with hostility and being blocked by her. We eventually got fed up and went to her house to speak with her and she didn‚Äôt answer, instead she got a neighbour to come and threaten us, saying SHE has the will, and she is the executor. Bearing in mind, I went to ask to be unblocked from my dads profile, I‚Äôve never cared about getting any money from him. 

In short, even though we were agreeing to go if we could have a calm conversation with her, they still called the police on us, threatened us and intimidated us (my husband and I usually aren‚Äôt the confrontational type so doesn‚Äôt take much).

For a bit of necessary background information, I (23m) have this (undiagnosed) eating disorder, which at the surface may just appear as picky eating, but is actually a major source of anxiety for me in any social setting - I simply cannot eat unfamiliar foods or foods with some particular ingredients, and even putting it into my mouth could make me gag or even throw up, so I stopped even trying. A good example is I've never had and probably never will have pizza.

Now to the story. I live with my parents to save up for my own place. So my brother (26m) and his gf (23f) came to visit one day, and my dad (49m) was cooking lunch. He was cooking two meals - one which I do eat and one which I don't.

Since my brother took the other one, there was just one cooked portion of the meal I do eat left, and my mom (48f), offered my brothers gf to choose which meal she wanted. The gf was fine with whichever. After my mom basically forced her to choose, she finally chose the meal I eat. I said that I wanted to eat that, which resulted in the gf being OK with it, but my mom took her very much forced choice as final and indisputable. 

I then walked out of the room, my dad cooked the other portion of my meal and I ended up eating alone about 20 minutes later. 

Afterwards, I got yelled at by my mom for embarrassing her in front of a guest. I stood my ground, saying that literally everybody would have been better off if the gf just ate the other meal.

Before you call me an entitled brat, I'd like to argue my case a bit:

1. Because we had guests, lunch was almost 3h later than usual, so I was quite hungry.

2. The meal I don't eat is considered more delicious by most, so the gf wouldn't have been worse off by eating it.

3. I'm fairly certain that the only reason the gf chose that meal is because it was physically closer to her (literally next to her face while the other was on a counter).

4. We have a ""tradition"" to only cook enough to eat and leave leftovers uncooked, since cooking food right before eating makes it taste way better, so I would have cooked the other portion for myself the next day. Meanwhile the meal I don't eat ended up being cooked and uneaten. 

This situation could have been entirely avoided if my mom let me choose the meal first since she is perfectly aware that I wouldn't eat the other meal in a million years, but she always puts guests before family, so this probably didn't even cross her mind. 

I know I'm right in thinking that just letting me have the meal in the first place would be better for everybody, but AITA for asking for it after the guest already chose it? Should I not have done it, or apologized afterwards for embarrassing my mom?",0.47

"AITA for not helping someone out even though I can? Repost because people who commented at the 1st post thought of me as a straight male and all the responses were based on how a straight male threatens a woman, which is valid but not in this case:

We are two cisgender hetero females. I am East Asian older than her about 4 years and work full time. She is white Brazilian on a full-scholarship PHD.

WE met at our local climbing club and have a lot in common. She is shy and has an aloof personality. We met up frequently and climbed and also hung out outside of climbing. She had slept on my sofa many times. She had grown closer to some other climbers in the past months. I canceled a few times because I had to work late for weeks on end, our group has about 8-10 people who rotate as climbing partners if someone isn't available, but I only considered her as a friend in the group.

We went on a walk alone a few months ago, she made a comment about my weight, I was diagnosed with health issues and struggled to lose weight. I told her what she said was unkind and she apologised, but I kept snapping at her because at the time I thought her apology wasn't good enough. After I cooled down, I apologised and told her my situation, and the reason why I got mad. She didn't know beforehand and I thought that was unfair because she wouldn't have commented on it if she did know. Also, I was the driver, so she must've felt like she is trapped in that situation because she can't take public transit home.

She asked if she can store somethings for a month and I agreed. She showed up with a medium-sized suitcase, she said ""I hope to see you around the (climbing) gyms sometimes"" when she left. I felt it is what you say to an acquaintance not a friend, especially to someone who is doing you a semi-big favour.

Last week we were on a trip. Over the trip, she only focussed on her new friends and ignored me. I didn't put too much thought into it because I am quite social and was making friends with new people, many of them being their first time. When we were sitting together, she was making climbing plans right in front of me and did not include me, not within earshot, but right in front of my face. I didn't say anything.

We are about two hours roundtrip by public transit, she asked if I can bring her things to the office on Thursday so she can come and pick them up. My office and her are halfway. I take train to the office and I don‚Äôt want to drag a suitcase on a train. I could also drive but parking is super expensive. I said no since she stored stuff at my place already, she can come and pick. When she said that my office is halfway and it will be easier for her, I was annoyed at that point and said, what is easier for me is putting your stuff out on the sidewalk. And that message is now left on read‚Ä¶

It was snide, but I reacted to the realization that she never thought that we are friends but only using me as a resource.

AITA for not helping someone out even though I can?

Edit:

Thanks for everyone's response so far. Part of the evaluation for this AITA is that I am known for a sharp tongue can be cruel when I feel wronged, and I don't know if I was too much in the situation. 

Also the weight situation, she said that my face looks cuter because it had gotten rounder. In a previous convo we talked about where we gain the most weight, and I told her that it shows up first on my face. She said it in a jesty way, and we have that kind of sense of humor. So I didn't take it to offense, most of the time but that day I did. ",0.02
"AITA for asking my mom and sister to help me with my terminally ill father? I (22f) have been taking care of the house and my father (55) since he started chemo in October. I live alone with my dad because my parents are separated, but not legally divorced. They're still friends.

This is not my dad's first rodeo with cancer. He was diagnosed when I was 17. This took a huge emotional toll on me as I had no help. I was in school, applying for colleges, had a part time job. I never ended up finishing my college applications. My dad still blames himself for me not going to college.

October 2021. my dad got his second diagnosis. I told my parents that I needed help and could not handle doing everything myself again. Especially now, since I am still grieving a very recent traumatic death of my best friend, and I work in film where I can be on set for 12+ hours a day. They told me that we would band together ""as a family"" to help my father.

My mom is a hospice aid, taking care of people is her job. My sister (25) is an \*oncology\* nurse, so she has experience with cancer patients. After losing my best friend in 2021, I found it really hard keeping up with the house, the dogs, and even looking after my own health as I have OCD, anxiety/depression, and an autoimmune disorder.

All I needed was for each of them to pick one day a week to come by to do light cleaning, walk the dogs, and make a meal or a snack for my father. He can pretty much take care of himself, although he couldn't stand for more than 30 seconds. They both agreed that they'd help but needed to ""look over their schedules"". Months go by, no one has helped. At this point, the stress is causing me to miss periods, and my AI disease is flaring up.

I had a gig where I'd be on set for two weeks out of town. I notified my sister/mom weeks before, giving them the dates, asking them to stop by when they could. My first day on set my dad went to the hospital for a few days needing a blood transfusion. No one came to visit him the 4 days he was in the hospital.

when I finally came back from set, the house was a disaster. It reeked of dog piss/shit, trash overflowing, dirty dishes, no food in the fridge. My dad didn't shower. No one came to help while I was gone.

via groupchat, i told them I was disgusted with their lack of help. I got the same excuse from both of them ""I work 60 hours a week, we're all trying our best"" but neither of them worked those hours when my dad got sick again, they both have a say over the hours they work. The one time my sister adjusted her hours, it was so she could have time to take care of her new $2K puppy she got two months ago. after that, my mom and sister each came by different days to help clean the house. The entire time they were passive aggressive and it blew up into a fight. they never came back.

Now, my sister and my mom are mad at me. I get that I live with my father, and that they work crazy hours, but am I really the asshole for needing help? They're the ones who take care of people for a living, I'm not made for this",0.11

"AITAH for feeding my pet snake? Throw away, I'm on mobile.

I don't think anyone I'm talking about here uses Reddit but I'll still try to be vague 

I (22F) live with my parents. I got a pet snake (BP) and he is now almost 8 months old (got from a breeder). My dad is neutral about it, but he takes interest in my noodle boy. My mom is terrified of snakes, but over the past 7-ish months she's gotten used to him being in the house (in his enclosure, he doesn't free roam lol) and has even come up to touch/pet him while I'm handling him.

Today I went to get him food. I feed him live (I'm trying to get him on frozen thawed but he is a brat) and I normally tell and warn my parents when I'm about to feed him live or frozen (cause not everyone wants to see that). Today I warned her about feeding him. She was in the living room and his enclosure is behind the couch (across the way, not right up on it) she was on out of sight. It's always been there. She told me to just ""go ahead"" and that she would ""turn up the news"" 

So I did. I dropped in his rat and he got it very quick. The thing is, though, the rat did squeak a lot. It kind of surprised even me because normally they're just ""squeak"" and dead. I won't lie I've fed him live before but that one got to me a little. 

My mother got super upset. She's been upset ever since and has made comments like ""no more live feeding"" and ""it sounded like it was in pain"" 

I'm so confused. She knows he was going to eat live and he's done it before. She even worried over him when he kept rejecting frozen so I had no choice but to go get a live. 

I feel terrible for upsetting her but i can't control how quickly my noodle does his thing or what the rat does. But she's been upset and I know this won't go away soon.So, Reddit, AITAH?",0.17
"AITA for telling on a kid? Recently, I started to tutor kids(10-15 y.o.) as a part-time job. I have no experience working as a tutor but I get along with kids pretty well. 

Last Wednesday, was my first day and before I started a teacher warned me about a kid that needed to wear glasses while studying, and that the kid was really stubborn as did not want to wear the glasses at all. I said ok and that I'd manage. And I did.
 The kid refused to wear glasses but I talked him into wearing them. If felt bad for him as he said other kids made fun of him for wearing them, and as he started to wear glasses at a pretty young age. But all was OK he wore the glasses and I did not bother him for the rest of the afternoon. 

Today, he came again and there were about 4 kids in my class.
I spent some good 20 minutes trying to make him wear glasses, even trying to make deals with him such as if you wear the glasses properly, I will leave you alone for the rest of the afternoon. I proceeded to tell him that there other other people who needed my help and that I needed him to wear the glasses so that the others could work on their stuff.

The kid did everything but to wear the glasses on his face. Then I asked him if i needed to speak to his legal guardian(I have no clue who is responsible for the kids so I always say legal guardian)about it, and he said no. Yet he kept misbehaving and not wearing the glasses. After another long minutes he started to wear them.

During their break, I noticed he was wearing them. I was glad. But when i entered the classroom he took them off and started misbehaving and not wearing the glasses again. And even when I was trying to convince him he did not wore them and when I had to leave the classroom to get stuff from the printer he kept disturbing his other 4 colleagues. I had enough and I yelled at him, which made him more quiet, and even the rest of the kids. 


I allow them to talk with each other and even play with their damn toys, but I just want them to be quiet enough so that others can concentrate.
So, when the receptionist came to the classroom and told him that his mom was there to pick him up, I told him to get his things and left the classroom to speak with his mom. 

I told her how he did not want to wear the glasses and how lazy he acted(I did not even mention how he misbehaved the whole afternoon). I told her of course that despite the laziness he did his homework but kept refusing to wear the glasses and how his behavior was influenced by wanting to show off to others how cool he was. His mom told me in front of him that she would ground him, and how they have spoken about it before. I told her that grounding was not necessary just another talk with him as to wear the glasses. 

As they left, the kid was getting scolded and I felt awful because I don't want the kid to be grounded at all, I just want him to wear the glasses when I am tutoring him. 

So, AITA for telling his mother? I really don't want the kid to get in trouble but the glasses are for his own good...",0.16

"WIBTA for asking for money back? I work a slightly above minimum wage job, in late night hospitality. I can‚Äôt drive and a taxi home is about the same as having worked for an hour, and public bus route doesn‚Äôt run late enough for when I get off work. A guy who I work with, sometimes drives me home, and usually I give him some money for it, it works out cheaper than a taxi, but still more money than what it would cost in fuel, so everyone is happy. The guy didn‚Äôt have dinner today so I offered to get him a takeaway for driving me home instead, which he happily agreed to. 

The problem is another colleague heard I was ordering food and chimed in, I offered to order them a bag of fries, but they ordered a meal. When another colleague arrived, they also asked for a meal, and I was landed with a bill worth the same as having worked my entire shift that day. One of these colleagues also owes me money from something else, and we all make the same money for the same job, but I did offer to order food for one of the colleagues. I usually wouldn‚Äôt mind too much, but it was way out of my budget and am trying to save.

"AITA for getting upset over my coworkers' food preferences? I (M23) work with three other coworkers in a small office. Every so often our boss will treat us to lunch by having food delivered to our office. He usually picks the restaurant and specific dishes and we all share it family-style. 

Some of the restaurants my boss likes are a couple Chinese restaurants in the area. However, whenever he orders from those places my coworkers complain about the food. They say that certain dishes are disgusting and always make a big show about hating on the restaurant. They don't complain about any other restaurants, just the Chinese ones. 

I am Chinese-American and it bothers me when they say these things as a lot of the dishes they complain about are dishes that I grew up eating and still regularly enjoy. I understand that everyone has their own food preferences, but I feel like my coworkers' comments are overboard and rude.

In the past I have kept quiet whenever they complain but today I decided to speak up when I heard my them talking about it again. I told them how I personally like the dishes and that I don't think the food is as bad as they claim it is. My comments seemed to made my coworkers uncomfortable however, and now it feels very awkward around the office. Should I have not said anything and am I just being too sensitive?",0.5
"AITA for not forgiving my sibling for not coming to my wedding in October 2021 I(23F) have been planning my wedding to my high school sweet heart for 2 years. My relationship with my abusive family is non existant except for my sibling(18 Genderfluid). I basically raised my sibling my entire life, so when I finally cut ties with all my family I fought tooth and nail to maintain a close relationship with them, even though they still lived at home. Because of the close relationship we have, I wanted nothing more than for them to walk me down the aisle at my wedding ceremony. When I asked them a year and a half before the wedding they told me absolutely! And we began designing an outfit that would fit with their identity. The amount I spent and the time I spent putting this outfit together doesnt really matter, but we weren't able to fully assemble it until a month before the wedding. At the time they told me they were still ecstatic to walk me down the aisle. Fast forward to a week before my wedding, with everything finalized and complete, they send me a text message, telling me they dont want to come to my wedding anymore. I'm shocked and outraged, I ask why? I ask what's happening, what changed over the past month! They refuse to give me an answer, just saying they dont want to. I assume it's my father getting in the way so I break the promise I made to myself to never speak to him again and call him to convince him to let my sibling come to my wedding. He says it's fine with little resistance. I tell my sibling this and they tell me it doesnt matter, they aren't coming and they dont have to give me a reason. My heart is broken....my wedding day comes and I dont even recieve a text or call wishing me a happy wedding day from my sibling. I walk down the aisle alone, and it hurts so badly. Months later my sibling tries to reach out to me and talk to me, like nothing ever happened. They never apologize, they act as if my wedding didnt even happen.

"WIBTA If I refused to give one of my Cats Kittens to my Gfs Mother? I (19f) and my gf (18f) rescued a cat (which we named Tortilla) about a month ago, and found out she was Pregnant. She is due within the week, and we plan to ween the kittens properly, find them good homes (I'm hoping with people I can keep in contact with) and keep Tortilla because she is super sweet and lovey and Me and my GF have fallen in love with her.

Recently, my Gfs Mother (40 something f) has been talking excitedly about naming and adopting one of the male kittens. 

For some backstory, I've lived with my gf, her parents, and her sister since November 2020. The entirety of my life here has been spent watching her cheat on my FIL, emotionally damage My GF and SIL, and repeatedly break promises for therapy and better behavior. In January FIL finally started talking about divorce, and they are currently hashing out the details.

This has left an unremovable impression of her as a bad person, espeically since just about 8 months ago she brought home a Puppy named Bronx and while it's clear he loves her, she spends very little caring for him; emotionally and physically. She almost refuses to feed him, saying it's our job, and only loves on him for maybe half an hour a day on average. 

I hadn't been asked, and feel a little disrespected because while my gf was the one to bring her in, I buy all her supplies and she's my cat too. I brought this up to my GF and she says they talked about it while I was in the room and figured since I didn't object that It was okay to say she could have one.

After a semi heated discussion I told her that It makes me very uncomfortable given what I'VE seen of her mom and she countered with saying I've never seen her around cats, and she's much more a cat person than dog.

I finally said I hated the idea but I'd let it ride out and see how she handled the kittens once their born. 

But I'm pretty set on not giving a kitten to her because of how much pain she's caused as well as her emotional care being minimal, weather with her own daughters or the dog SHE brought home.

my GF and her Sister think I'm overreacting with how angry I was, and say it's not fair to refuse her a kitten, but I feel it's perfectly on my rights. I owe this women nothing.

WIBTA?

Edit- seems I should've given a bit more detail. The divorce papers are going to be signed in the coming weeks and my gf, her sister, and me are going to leave with my FIL wherever he goes because her sister is still under 18, and my gf has a numerous amount of physical conditions (CHRONIC conditions) we will be leaving within a week or so of the kittens will be weened for a whole different state. My GFs Mother works, goes to the gym, then comes home and sleeps. While she is the breadwinner, that is purely because my FIL has put everything he's had financially and emotionally into helping her and her career- she signed up for her PHD courses without even consulting him first after she promised he could get back into his career after her master's. I Wanted to be done with this whole thing months ago but I plan on staying to support my GF who begged me to stay for her sake. I plan on marrying this girl and we've been together for three years, so I couldn't just leave and convince her to come with me.",0.58
"AITA for getting upset with my girlfriend for getting her mom to stay with the kids instead of doing it herself? 

I (m37) have been dating my girlfriend (f33) for 9 months. I have 2 kids, (their mother is deceased) , they're both under 7 and used to have a babysitter,  but she quit unexpectedly and I had to go on an urgent business trip to meet up with a potential client - My girlfriend said I could go and she'd come stay with the kids in the apartment for 3 days max. I thanked her and left few days ago.

However, While I was talking to my son on tje phone, he told me that my girlfriend's mom was the one who has been taking care of them and not my girlfriend, I was confused I called her hut she didn't pick up. I got worried so I cut the trip short and went home as soon as I could.


Once I returned I discovered that my girlfriend had brought her mom to stay with the kids and take care of them, I asked why and she told me sge was feeling very sick from her period and was dealing with pain and headache, and felt like she couldn't take care of the kids so she asked her mom to come over and help. I couldn't help but get upset and lash out, I told her I did not agree to have her mom stay with the kids, and that she should've called me and let me know. She said it was no big deal and the kids had great time with her mother but I doubt the kids felt comfortable staying with someone they've only met a couple of times. My girlfriend acted offended and said I was being mean because her mom is trusted and is family, and that those are ""my"" kids therefor, they're my responsibility and I should be grateful her mom agreed to help to begin with. I told her that she in the position of a mother figure to them and should ""at least"" act like it or called me, that way I would've got home and stayed with the kids if she wasn't ""capable"". She began crying saying I was stressing her out and making her feel like she ""neglected"" the kids which, in a way, she did. She should've at least returned my phonecalls but she said she had headache and was trying to ""sleep it off"". I walked away to be able to calm down and she stayed in the bedroom for hours refusing to come out and speak to me.

She went home with her mom and has been giving me the ""silent treatment"" sort of speak and only been speaking to the kids. She's acting as if I had no rigjt to worry about who my kids are with and wether they were taken care of properly. I believe that I only agreed on her staying with them cause I don't trust nor agreed to have anyone else do it, otherwise I wouldn't have gone on that trip in the first place.",0.38

"AITA for asking the principal about why she was fired at her last job? My two sons go to elementary school. The old principal (Mr. G) was great. He has respected and liked. The kids were crazy about him. He took a promotion and left last year.

They brought in a new principal (Ms. K) and I personally got this unlikable vibe from her. She just wasn't personal with the parents or kids. The kids seemed indifferent or scared of her. I tried to talk to her and she blew me off. Things don't run as efficiently or effectively as before. Whatever. My kids are 3rd and 5th graders so they're not going to be there long.

Over the course of the year, I saw a lot of the old staff disappear and a new person like every other month. 

My eldest son has Asperger's and ADHD so he has an aide (Mr. F) who had been with him since kindergarten. He told me that he was going to be leaving next week. I assumed he must of found another job. He said he couldn't stand working with the new principal and that's explains the turnover and a lot of the teachers are jumping ship. It made sense. I was pretty pissed about his leaving though. 

I asked to speak to Ms K for 15-20 minutes today. Before meeting with her, I looked her up abd she had gotten fired from another school district. You really have to mess up to be fired. I told her that as a dad, as a member of the community, as someone who cares about the school, I was concerned about her leadership. Good people leaving left and right. I told her she does not seem like she's fitting in.

She told me she was doing the best job she could do. Then I asked her why was she fired for on her last job after less than a year? 

She was taken aback and told me that our district thought she was qualified. I countered that so did the one that fired her. I told her I wasn't trying to be a dick. As a stakeholder, I'm alarmed at what I'm seeing. As a principal, she should be able to deal with that. 

Oh and she made this poster of her favorite things (as a way to promote herself) and her favorite band was ""Arrowsmith."" I did ask her who that was and she said the band with Steven Tyler.",0.58

He insisted that it‚Äôs a fair, and equitable split, I‚Äôm just making excuses, and it‚Äôs only shared bills, not his personal bills, so its ‚Äúteamwork‚Äù.  I relented telling him that I was going to split everything REALLY 50/50 after bills and take his personal bills out of shared account. He enthusiastically agreed. 

Fast forward now I‚Äôm a ‚Äúspiteful bitch‚Äù who only thinks equitable is fair when I‚Äôm who benefits. His phone, chegg, YouTube, Xbox pass, car insurance all were shared, but now is solely his to pay.  I never charged him for anything outside of reg grocery run. Now he realizes the cost of TP and cat food. 

I still put $1100 so now we have a bill cushion.  AITA?  I do make more, but I think it‚Äôs unfair for him try and capitalize me working overtime when he can get a job.

Edit : I am sorry I am trash at explaining.  I think I did a better job multiple times in the comments If you care enough.",0.04

"AITA for giving my boyfriend a bedtime? I (23f) live with my boyfriend (27m). I study at uni full time as well as work part-time and on top of that I‚Äôm currently completing a placement for my studies which means I get one day off a week where I do most of my resting and where I run errands for the house. I also suffer from health issues which leaves me exhausted pretty much 24/7. He however doesn‚Äôt have job; he‚Äôs supposed to be studying but hasn‚Äôt gone to a lecture in months and instead plays hours and hours of games - often staying up stupidly late and waking up in the afternoon. He‚Äôs suffering pretty bad with his mental health atm so I try to give him slack as he does help out around the house and he‚Äôs really supportive of my health and I know how bad MH issues can be. 

Despite his MH issues he refuses to talk to any kind of therapist or counsellor and pretty much digs his heels in every time I try to bring up the subject of getting help. I finally explained how him not doing anything is negatively affecting our relationship, I expressed I know how hard it is to deal with MH problems and I just need him to show me he‚Äôs trying to get better and that I don‚Äôt expect it to happen over night - I just need him to show me some effort in dealing with everything going on. He eventually agreed to get his sleep schedule on track as a better/healthy sleep schedule can help in MH problems. However, now when I remind him that it‚Äôs time to go to bed he keeps pushing to stay up later and play games. He gets upset, tells me I‚Äôm being mean, ignores me and comes to bed in the early hours of the morning. It‚Äôs affecting my sleep now and it also makes me feel like his mum which is something I definitely didn‚Äôt sign up for.

I know it‚Äôs stupid but he won‚Äôt get help from a professional and I don‚Äôt really know how else to help? I don‚Äôt really care if he plays his games during the day, but what‚Äôs wrong with having a healthy sleep schedule and going to bed at a reasonable time? This is something that he agreed too as well when I first spoke about getting his sleep on track.",0.17
"AITA for giving my son my mother's necklace? I lost my parents when I was very young and have spent decades recovering from the trauma. One coping mechanism I had was holding onto all of their things. My parents were well off, and I inherited almost all of their possessions and assets. My therapist and I have talked about why I feel the need to cling to these things that have no use to me, and I've said that I might be open to giving some of their things to someone who would use and treasure them. I didn't have a concrete plan or timeline for doing so though.

My mother owned a pearl necklace that was passed down from mother to daughter for generations. My great-great-grandmother brought it with her to America when her family fled Germany, so obviously it has immense sentimental value. My mother didn't have a daughter, so the necklace, like everything else, has been sitting in my house for decades, unworn.

So, onto my son. He is very into style and fashion. He wears lots of different types of outfits. He'll wear a suit and tie to a work function and then a miniskirt and mesh shirt to go clubbing with his friends. He wears jewelry sometimes and owns a few elegant, classy pieces, no pearls though.

A few months ago my son was showing me an all white suit he bought to wear to a friend's party. It was a really nice suit. All of a sudden I was struck with the idea that my mother's pearls would look great with that suit. So I went and got them. My son became very emotional, and I decided that he should have the pearls to keep. I don't wear necklaces, but he does. I think my mother would want him to have the pearls.

When I talked to my therapist about this, she said I made a huge step forward in processing my grief. Now that I've made that first step, it feels a lot more doable to go through my parents' other things. I feel good about my decision.

My cousin (mom's niece) called me today, LIVID. She said I shouldn't have given the pearls to my son. She said if they went to anyone, they should go to her or her sister. She claims that they've now left the family.

I don't really understand her perspective. I get that the pearls are supposed to go from mother to daughter, not father to son. But that chain was already broken when my mom died without a daughter. I don't see how niece is better than grandson in this scenario. Still, my cousin is a really nice person, so there must be something I'm not getting. Is this like a woman thing? Can a woman explain why I might be the A?",0.18
"AITA/ Neigbour thinks we are not good enough We have always invited our neighbour to our home for meals and they have always accepted our hospitality and over years lost count of number of times, they have been to our place. Practically invited them over for our every occssion, kids birthday parties etc, Christmas meal etc. We always go overboard with the effort, we make. 
But they never take initiative to invite us over. They invited us only once and that was a half arsed effort.
Intrestingly they do invite others from the neighbourhood and it does always upsets me as they always ignore us. 
Our kids ho to school together and sometimes they invite my little boy for playdate. 
I have decided that now to maintain a distance and give them the space also stop my kid from going to their house. If they don't think, we are good enough for them then maybe I should accept that and maintain a distance.

"AITA for asking for less than half of rent? Deploying soon (April) and a friend is going to come house-sit & pet-sit my cat. She is coming from Michigan to Washington for the 6 months that I will be gone. We agreed in December that she would pay $500 a month while using my (furnished) place. That included streaming services, utilities and internet. My rent is $995 and the utilities plus streaming usually run about $200ish more. She is unsure if she wants to do it now because of paying some rent as she feels her staying there and caring for my (low maintenance, doesn‚Äôt even look at you) cat is an even trade. She will be finding a job once she arrives, so she won‚Äôt be living off savings. 

The reason she is coming to do this is because she‚Äôs been feeling stuck, hates her current job and wanted a change of pace. I feel this is a great way to do that without breaking the bank. We‚Äôre doing each other a favor, kind of? And, she knows people in this town, so she‚Äôs not going to be alone. But, nonetheless, it‚Äôs scary to move!

Am I the asshole for expecting her to help with rent while essentially living in my place for 6 months?

EDIT FOR UPDATE: I ended up telling her not to come after she said her finances were causing her worry and anxiety. I just told her that the trade off really isn‚Äôt worth the stress and anxiety that it was giving her. Honestly though, with proper planning, she would have been just fine.",0.11

"AITA for refusing to help my bf? I(25F) have been with my bf(28M) for a bit over a year, everything is pretty good overall.

A bit of context. When I was a kid around 4-5 I was visiting my uncle's farm and I was attacked by a chicken it scratched my face and arms it was pretty bad for a kid, since then I developed a pretty big fear of birds in general, also the fact they can fuck you up and fly away terrifies me, every person close to me knows this.

My bf's parents own a small farm, that's where they live, I've visited them, and they have animals but mostly birds, I know my biggest nightmare, they understand and always keep them locked when I've visited, the problem now is they left to visit their daughter that lives in another country, they asked my bf since we live an hour away from them in the city, to take care of the animals and feed them, get the eggs etc, he agreed and have actually stayed there since then since is easier.

I visited last week and he asked me if I could help him feed the animals, I said I could help with the dog and the iguanas but other than that no, he asked me to get in the place where they keep the chickens since he really needed me and it was a 2 man job, I told him no way in help I would get in there, the chickens were running around and would come to him, I could not let them touch me or I would have a panic attack, he said that I was acting like a child and that I needed to conquer my fears, I told him I wouldn't get in there and that was it.

He did it himself and have since then being mad at me for not helping, saying that it was very shitty of me, and that the chickens wouldn't hurt me, I told him he was being very inconsiderate of me and my trauma and we have been a bit distant since then, my friends said that I should have probably helped since I knew his chickens weren't agressive and wouldn't hurt me, but why does my phobia is not taken serious? Would you tell a person afraid of the water to get into the ocean? I think I'm right but now everyone is making me feel bad and that maybe I could try to ""conquer"" my fear and help him.

I have asked her multiple times to take it down and she agreed. I live 3 states away and I am here for one night. I took it until I leave. I didn't trash it, I took it down so I don't have to look at it.

"AITA for telling the hospital receptionist to not be ""fucking rude"" to me? So yesterday, my mom was admitted to the hospital for alcohol poisoning. I don't know how long she's gonna be there, but this is a usual thing that happens to her. Anyway she's over there by herself and I'm at home. What I usually do is sometimes I call the hospital and ask to speak to her/the ones in charge of her, just to check in on her condition, and have them give me any updates
 Yesterday, I was doing that. I called the hospital where she was staying at and I asked to speak to the nurse in charge of my mom. They said okay and transferred me, but I initially misunderstood where she was transferring me; I couldn't tell if it was directly to the nurse, or the receptionist of the department that she was in. Low and behold they transferred me to the receptionist and she said something like ""Hello this is the ER department how can I assist you"". Now I'm not completely sure what happened but the phone line/reception was kind of unclear, or maybe I just have hearing loss, so I just wanted to check and I said ""Hi, is this the nurse for (patient name). This receptionist bitch just suddenly snapped at me and goes ""Uh NO MA'M I TOLD you I am just the receptionist. What do you want"". I obviously can't demonstrate through text but she was super condescending, super rude, and just acted like she hated the fact that I was calling her, in her classic high pitched whiny annoying voice. Over a simple question! I then said ""Alright I was JUST ASKING, you don't need to be so fucking rude."" I then paused and said ""You know what? Forget it"". And I hung up the phone because I didn't want to have a conversation with this bitch. Anyway my dad heard this conversation and he confronted me, asking me why I would say that. I told him that she didn't have the right to be a total bitch to me over a question. He then told me that I should of just hung up th phone and not said anything. I called back today and thankfully it was a different receptionist that I spoke to (not rude at all) and I was able to check in with my mom's condition. However I can't help but wonder if my dad was right. Am I the AH?

Edit: Just to clarify, no I'm not overexaggerating my post. She was raising her voice.

Edit: Okay I should have made myself more clear when writing this. My mistake for not clarifying. The hospital receptionist is different than the ER receptionist that I had a problem with. The call didn't come back, the ER receptionist and I had never spoken at that point",0.5
AITA for telling a friend who almost always speaks her mind to shut up? [deleted],0.33
"AITA for refusing to talk to my brother after a fight? My brother= B

parents= p

mom= M

This happened during spring break. I (f23) and B (m25) were both at home while finishing college. When covid started he ended up just staying at home with p. I had recently started dating my bf (m24) end of 2020.

When my p found out about bf, we made rules to stay covid safe and respect B. My B has a condition which can make his behavior a little different than the average roommate, he does not like change and he is introverted and during covid he got used to no one coming into the house. He had free reign of over the house (his room, my sister's old room, my room, and the guest room too). He mainly used these rooms for diff gaming.

He had some negative attitudes towards my bf (said some racist and classist things about him, insinuated he didn't love me and was just using me and not to trust him) so to keep everyone safe we decided

we needed to tell him in advance when he was coming

couldn't hang out for too long¬†

needed to stay in a room and wear a mask if we came out and have an air purifier running in the room¬†

if we were in my room he would be downstairs in the guest room, if we were in the guest room he would be upstairs so we wouldn't hear him gaming (he tends to use very derogatory words and racial slurs).

\[I am in no way okay with his racism and we have had many talks with him but he refuses to change\]

Final fight: my bf and I were in the backyard doing homework and before we left I asked M if he could come up really quick to help me pick an outfit for dinner, during which my bf needed to pee. When he went out of my room B saw him which made him really upset. We were inside of the house for a total of \~ 15min.

The next day B demanded to talk about what had happened. He said it was completely unacceptable for bf to be upstairs where B could run into him and that I needed to stop acting like an entitled college student. He also said he‚Äôs introverted and can't handle people surprising him. I got annoyed and said ""you know you're kind of acting like an a\*\*hole"" and he said ""well you're acting like a f\*cking b\*tch!"" I said I think we were both too upset to talk and asked him to leave. He went to the room next door and started throwing things and screaming, at one point came out of the room to yell at my door that I was a f\*cking wh\*re a and that I ""wasn't his sister"" and to ""never talk to him again"".¬†

my p tried to sit us down to talk about it later, I said I was done with him and I would not talk to him anymore since that's what he wanted. He repeated that he didn't want to talk to me. So I haven't. And this has made him very upset. M has said because of his condition he can't understand how I feel so I owe him an explanation, and that he is hurt that I'm not talking to him. I feel bad but I am tired of him acting like this and me being the bigger person.¬†

"AITA for telling my local comic book store than Amazon is way cheaper? I‚Äôm a huge fan of the ‚ÄúSandman‚Äù series by Neil Gaiman. Lately I‚Äôve been looking around for the Absolute Editions, which are essentially the nicest, most expensive versions of certain graphic novels or comics.

My local comic shop had all five volumes in stock priced at $125 apiece, so, had I bought all of them, it would have been $600 plus tax.

While I was browsing I looked up the price on Amazon, and they‚Äôre going for $72 apiece, so, $360 plus tax for the entire lot.

Meanwhile the owner of the shop came over to me and asked if I needed help with anything. I said no but went on to explain my interest in the Sandman Absolute Editions.

Then he got kind of pushy and kept dropping hints that he wanted me to buy them (likely since they‚Äôre so expensive and so marked up). I‚Äôve bought more expensive comics from this store on numerous occasions and so the pushiness kind of got under my skin.

I told him that I love the books but that I can‚Äôt justify buying them from here, like a lot of other products of theirs, since they were nearly twice as expensive as Amazon.

He seemed pretty offended and went onto tell me, condescendingly, that ‚Äúyou know I‚Äôm running a local business right? What did you expect? We can‚Äôt sell things at the same price as Amazon.‚Äù and walked off in a huff.

It wasn‚Äôt that big of a deal but he clearly wasn‚Äôt happy that I brought up the price difference. I‚Äôm feeling weird about it because I‚Äôve been a regular at this place for years.

Edit: can already tell that this is going to get bombarded by people who simply hate Amazon. Try to respond to the merits, thanks.",0.83
"AITA for snapping at my grandmother when she forces me to eat? So, I'm a 15, almost 16 year old female who (I think) has an eating disorder that keeps me from being able to eat often. I tend to eat about one meal a day, then be perfectly fine for the rest of said day. However, my grandparents force me to eat more than I'm used to and get mad at me when I say that I can't, or when I don't eat until dinner.
A few hours ago, my grandmother told me to eat dinner. When I said I wasn't hungry, she just continued pressuring me to eat until I caved in and went to make myself a plate. I didn't put a lot onto it, since I wasn't hungry, and when she saw, she just said that she gave up trying to feed me and that when I was hungry, I could make my own food and feed myself. 
That just me ticked me off, so I yelled that she didn't ever listen when I said I wasn't hungry, and that when I do eat, I hardly end up eating a lot because I more than likely have some sort of eating disorder and that her just pressuring me to eat was making my appetite smaller. Now that I'm thinking back on it, I probably shouldn't have yelled at her like that, but it still made me angry.",0.63
"AITA for asking a bridesmaid to take the day off from work for my wedding day? Our wedding is on a Thursday and we asked those in the wedding party to take the day off from work. But if someone can't, totally cool, just join us later for the ceremony but don't agree to be in the wedding party. The wedding was originally on a Saturday but we had 50+ guests cancel due to the latest variant, so the wedding was moved to an upcoming Thursday. Thankfully, our venue was understanding here!

We had 11 of 12 take the day off, no issue. This is 6 on each side. I'm not expecting much from my bridesmaids - no uniform dresses, no makeup, no setup, etc. We just want everyone to get ready together and take a few photos before it gets hectic.

My friend ""Shelly"" agreed to be a bridesmaid but has been a PITA. Aside from having chose a ballgown ivory dress (same color as my dress), and an uncomfortable conversation ensued, she has flip-flopped every other day on being able to take the day off. The 1st time she said can't do it, we removed her from the early arrival list and the intros. Next day, she was back in again so we re-added her. Two days later, she backed out so we removed her again. Less than 24 hours later, she was back in again. I never added her back though... Her internal monologue was confusing and annoying, so I asked her to make a final decision by Friday, 3/4. She confirmed she can take the day off. Done deal? Nope.

Yesterday, she said she can't take the day off again. I gave her a call and said ""thank you for trying, see you later that day, etc."" She then started to go on about how she'll still try to take the day, but needs a few more days to be sure. I finally put my foot down and said, ""No need, when you texted me this morning, I asked someone else. I set a deadline and you confirmed. This morning, you backed out again and now, you're telling me you'll try again. I appreciate the effort, I really do, but I can't manage this level of confusion on a daily basis anymore."" I don't think I was rude about it.

This did not sit well with her. She tried to convince me to have a 7th bridesmaid and how she could do work at the venue, etc. I don't want a bridesmaid on a conference call in a corner while we're getting ready and taking photos. My bridesmaids took my side, as they were annoyed with Shelly for other reasons, but our mutual friends are saying that it's rude to ask someone to be your bridesmaid but then reverse the decision and that I'm being a ""bridezilla"" for asking the wedding party to take the day off. This was insulting because I don't think I should have to even ask people to take the day off from work to be in a wedding party. Also, I was a bridesmaid at Shelly's destination wedding and I just STFU and did what her mom said (her mom ran that show). Anyways, I hate wedding planning and wish we eloped.

This friend has talked about visiting and we have been open to all of our friends coming to stay with us and visit. This friend has started dating someone new in the two weeks since we moved. 

He is saying he wants to come stay with us and have his new girlfriend stay with us too. I‚Äôm feeling uncomfortable with this. We‚Äôve never met this person before and the thought of someone I‚Äôve never met staying with us for the weekend is giving me anxiety. I think also because they just started dating, I‚Äôm thinking he probably hasn‚Äôt known her very long either so it just adds to some of the anxiety. My husband is equating it to when kids have sleepover when they‚Äôre young, you never know what could happen but I‚Äôm just not feeling super comfortable. 

I wouldn‚Äôt mind if they came down to visit and stayed somewhere else and we all got to hang out for the weekend and got to know each other.

"AITA for wanting my girlfriend to stop singing songs she wrote about her exes? Throwaway account. My partner is a talented musician, and I love her ability to write music to express how she feels. She only really has songs about two different women she felt very strongly for (and still does). Her music is an important part of who she is.

We met when she was first getting over them, but we have been in a committed relationship for about 4 years since. She loves me and we are closer than she ever was with them, but she doesn't write songs about me. I want her to be able to perform and record her music, but she won't be able to if I'm not okay with her singing about her exes. They are not hateful getting over it songs, but longing heartbroken songs that make me feel like she is still in love with them and would rather be with them.

It hurts me when she sings these songs, but telling her not to would be cutting off a big part of who she is. I see it as a major red flag, she sees it as an inevitable consequence of dating a musician. I would be more inclined to agree if I didn't feel like she still feels the same way (singing about how she feels, not about how she felt and has since moved on from - her heart is very much in it). I want her to get good recordings of these songs, but beyond that I would rather she wrote and performed different material or made it clear she feels differently now than she did when she wrote them. She has expressed that she never felt as strongly for me as she did for them, and these songs are about just how in love with them she was.

"AITA for being resentful and causing conflict with my family?         I(15M) have a lot of resentment towards my mom for things that she did in the past. Most of it stems from how she showed favoritism towards my sister and treated me differently.I brought this up with her multiple times, but she never really gave me a straight answer at first. However she did later tell me that the reason for her showing favoritism was because she was concerned for my sister's mental health, which did turn out to be a valid concern. 

        While I can sympathize with her reasoning, she also admitted that she thought as a boy, I was emotionally tougher and could handle her showing favoritism to my sister. This only made me more upset, as I feel that that is a very stereotypical way of thinking. 

       Other things that I am resentful of are: She refused to let me grow my hair out for years when I was younger, and forced me to always have a buzzcut, saying that it was the ""norm"" for boys. She only recently let me grow it out.

       She made a very mean comment about my appearance when i was younger and quite overweight(though she said that she would have said things differently if it were my sister because she knows what it feels like to be a girl growing up and self concious of their appearance).

     She also makes things about herself sometimes, saying that it is unfair for me to still be mad at her when she has tried to change, or asking me to forgive her and stop bringing things up so that she won't have to listen to my dad calling her foolish for what she's done. However she did later admit that she was wrong for doing so.

     While she has apologized for everything many times and she has made an effort to change, I find it hard to forgive her and let go of my resentment. This has lead to a number of heated discussions/arguments in the past 6 months.

It‚Äôs been a year and a half  I have never received a thank you note or call from the bride though her mother says the bride loves it.  Supposedly she designed part of her home around it

I am the asshole to be annoyed/angry that I never even received acknowledgment?  I almost want to reclaim the outing

"AITA for asking my mom not to be aggressive towards me? I don‚Äôt want to say exact ages, but I‚Äôm an adult female living with my mother, who has no mental incapacities. In other words, we‚Äôre both grown adults and physically/mentally capable of living independently. I just moved in during the pandemic and have yet to find a new apartment.

Tonight, while my dad was out picking up dinner, my mom came into the den, saw me watching the news, and said ‚ÄúI do NOT want to watch THAT.‚Äù I figured fair enough, the news isn‚Äôt exactly sunshine and rainbows lately, but while I was changing the channel, I commented that she could have just asked me to change it and to please not speak aggressively towards me.

She got angrier, saying I shouldn‚Äôt police her tone, that her tone wasn‚Äôt directed at me, that I don‚Äôt get to know everything that‚Äôs going on in her head, things like that, as I asked her not to take her anger out on me and told her that her interspersed jabs were uncalled for.

We were both fighting tears when she stormed off, telling me as she went that I have no idea what‚Äôs going on. And I don‚Äôt, I‚Äôll admit to that, because she won‚Äôt tell me, and I wasn‚Äôt about to press after that ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt get to know everything that‚Äôs going on in her head‚Äù thing.

I‚Äôve always been called sensitive, and though I‚Äôve toughened up over the years, I‚Äôm still really upset, both at my mom‚Äôs behavior and the fact that I made her cry. On the other hand, I‚Äôm proud of myself for asking her not to take out whatever issue she was having out on me, especially when she clearly doesn‚Äôt want to talk to me about it, and that pride is in turn making me feel guilty and like an asshole for feeling good about myself after making my mom more upset.

"AITA for not bringing lunch to my friend's house after he said not to? Last Saturday my friend, Adam, invited me and my girlfriend over to his place to play video games with him and his girlfriend. We are all 22-23 years old. He asked us to come by around noon, so I offered to pick up pizza or burritos we could share for lunch. He said not to bring anything since he and his girlfriend wanted to eat their own home-cooked food.

On Saturday, my girlfriend and I had not eaten yet so we bought burritos for ourselves and showed up at Adam's apartment. Separate from this, my girlfriend brought a lemon poppyseed loaf she had baked as a gift for them since they were hosting us.

We asked if it was okay for us to eat our burritos before we started playing, and they agreed. We ended up playing for about 4 hours and I thought we were all having a great time. Everything seemed normal.

However, as soon as I got home, my friend sent me an angry text about how rude it was that I brought burritos only for myself and my girlfriend and not for everyone. I apologized and said I would have gladly brought enough for everyone and I did offer to, but I thought he had turned it down? He said it would have been fine if I had brought nothing, but it wasn't cool to bring something only for ourselves.

Am I the asshole? I'm now thinking that I should have bought more burritos just in case and offered them to Adam and his girlfriend, but I believed him when he said he didn't want any outside food and thought it would be weird to bring food someone said they didn't want? Maybe it is a faux pas that I brought food for myself to eat at his place without his permission?

Extra Information:

A few commenters asked if my friend meant that he wanted to serve us home-cooked food. He and his girlfriend put out chips for us to share, but they didn't serve any ""lunch food"". I assume they had already eaten whatever it was they cooked before we arrived. 

I agree with the comments that said we are awkward and should have clarified about our lunch plans beforehand. ",0.2
"AITA - Step siblings pay off my loan without telling me So I asked a family member to cosign a loan for me about 15 years ago. Since then, I have faithfully made payments until I ran into personal issues 6 months ago. 

6 months ago, I was hospitalized, I was an anxious mess, I was doing poorly at work, etc. I was hospitalized for a week, and then I didn't return to work for another three weeks to  attend additional intense therapy five days a week. Due to my thoughts being elsewhere, and being physically restricted from using any kind of phone or computer, I missed a payment. 

Next billing cycle I paid the outstanding amount plus the amount due. Next, my pay for the month I missed from work, I was paid 50% of my salary and subsequently missed a payment as I prioritized a car payment. Again, next billing cycle I paid the outstanding amount and the amount due. With a bonus from work, I had bought a computer earlier in the year, however sold it about 5 months ago for $1500 and put that on the loan. Finally I missed a third payment but again made up for it the next billing cycle. Since then, I have been making the monthly payment plus some. 

This family member talked to me at the beginning of this and I expressed how sorry I was this was putting unnecessary stress on them. They are already a caregiver for another family member, their finances are very tight, and this person deals with their own depression and anxiety. This person also used to get debt collector calls in a previous marriage and this was, I guess, really triggering for them. In addition, my cosigner thought that the loan would have been paid off by now (I was trying to pay off higher interest loans first).

I already know I'm part AH for missing payments, regardless of what was happening. My issue is that this cosigner was not communicating with me but instead talked to her children at length and those children decided to pay off the loan without my knowledge. I had every intent of paying off the loan with my IRS refund check in January. The children have also sent texts to the family at large to, I think, publicly shame me. I have since paid back everything, but I haven't heard from anyone or had a chance to talk and clear the air.

"AITA for wanting my fiance home for most of the week My fiance and I are home pretty often and don't get out much but we're pretty happy together. We've been living together for around 4 years and have been engaged for about the same amount of time.
A couple months ago his sister had broken up with her boyfriend and was scared to be home alone for awhile. This was completely fine at first, as it's nice to get some time apart once in awhile.
 But for about a month and a half he was over at her house almost every day, sometimes not even coming home at least once a week. 
                  This ruined me emotionally as I thought he didn't want to be with me anymore and I was having constant panic attacks.It got to a point where I decided to put my foot down and say he could go over there on weekends or when she needed him to babysit.He fully agreed with me that it was fair and that he wanted to be home more.
                    Tonight she was reminded of this rule after she wanted him to spend the night for no particular reason. Keep in mind it's a Tuesday, and he just came home on Sunday afternoon.  But when he told her this, she told him to grow a pair and do what he wants. Later on she started crying and saying that her feelings were hurt.
                       I really don't mind if he goes over there to hang out, and then come back here for the night, but she seems to think that I'm controlling him and he doesn't actually want to be here. But he came back tonight from his own free will without even talking to me first Am I being controlling If I just want my emotional needs to be met?

 (Update) she just told him that she doesn't even want him to babysit anymore which makes no sense at all to us. It's just seems petty and I dont appreciate that she can't respect our boundaries without blowing up",0.31
"AITA for not being positive about my pain? (edit: fixing formatting)

For context, I (17m) am in a school play - for a competition - ATM. The cast is fairly small, and one girl (17f), we‚Äôll call her Emily, is in the play and also the only other person in the high level theatre class. I was having a very bad pain day - my doctor and I are currently trying to figure out why, but I have really bad chronic joint pain - and the boots I was given for the show were way too small, causing my feet to bleed and hurt a lot. I was teary and frustrated from the pain for most of rehearsal, but made an effort to be polite anyways. During rehearsal, she yelled at our stage manager (17f) who is my closest friend to the point of tears. I didn‚Äôt know about this until later, but it was really frustrating to learn about. Later, in the group chat, we had a conversation.

K (another actress, 18f): how was rehearsal

Me: shit

G (techie); nah fr it was pretty good we got a lot done

Emily: Not the negativity

Me: girl i am having a bad pain day right now i feel like tearing my limbs off my body so they don‚Äôt hurt me anymore. my socks are bloodstained and i‚Äôm at a 7/10 on the pain scale.

Emily: Well I get that, but everyone is always going through something and i think it is better to lead with kindness

Me: it‚Äôs not like i went ‚Äúeveryone is terrible and also i hate you,‚Äù i just feel like hell.

Me: usually when someone cries through most of something they should be allowed to say something other than it‚Äôs fantastic and wonderful and lovely

Emily: Well‚Ä¶ Im sorry I upset you and I hope you feel better

she then left the gc and blocked my number. i have never personally texted her before.

K: even if you are in pain that‚Äôs no reason to be passive aggressive. we need to get through this together. 

K: we are here for you but no one is going through worse stuff than anyone else. 

K: so just be nice and decent for 22 more days then i do not care how angone reacts

Me: i know y‚Äôall hate me i‚Äôm not stupid, but i should be allowed to express my feelings

K: anyone reacts*  and this isn‚Äôt to anyone specific but take care of yourselves and if you don‚Äôt then i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair to say you‚Äôre feeling worse than others

Me: when did i say that?

Me: i said i was in pain

K then left the gc, so I did too - wanting to leave the people not involved in the drama alone so their friends don‚Äôt bandwagon me as well.

I‚Äôm starting to think I should‚Äôve just shut my mouth and apologized but Emily has been like this for years. She‚Äôll say genuinely awful shit to people and then turn around and act like an innocent little angel, and I guess I just got really frustrated, so. AITA?",0.25
"AITA for not being able to clean up dog vomit? I (25m) and my fiance (22m) have lived together for over 2 years. we were discussing the other day about eventually getting a dog. I've explained to him in the past several times that i am unable to handle, urine, vomit and poo (I've never been exposed to pets much growing up as we were a poor family etc). Previously this hasn't bothered him - we agreed the dog would be his in it's entirety, I'd happily help with insurance, vet bills, paying for it's needs etc but anything to do with those 3 things I just couldn't handle.

To add context I'm autistic and sensory issues are my main sort of thing, smells being one of my biggest experiences and focal points.

well last night we spoke about dogs again, as he's really getting broody and i wouldn't mind the extra company in our home either - however the topic about dealing with urine, vomit and poo came up. my fianc√© insisted I'd need to learn how to clean it all up and deal with its mess regardless of whether I'm the ""owner"" by law as we live together even though that's not what we really agreed. i responded saying i couldn't, maybe poo at a push with a scooper and urine if i have to because of an accident but i really couldn't handle vomit.

now this is where i think I MBTA my fianc√© told me ""well i guess we just won't get a dog then"" when i said i couldn't handle vomit at all. to which i said ""i guess not then"". and now he's in a huff and will barely respond to me at all saying I've ruined what he's always wanted. AITAH?",0.11

"AITA for telling off a guy in the gym? A little background: My university gym is nowhere near big enough to accommodate the number of students trying to workout, especially with separation rules, so there's always a queue for squat racks, benches, etc. 

I'm training when I notice a guy in the squat rack next to me resting for his next set. I get through 4 of my deadlift sets (2 minute rest in between) and he hasn't done a single rep in that time. Moreover, he's on the phone, just standing next to his rack. It's been awhile since I've seen him do a set, and I can see people waiting around for a rack to open up. I decide to do something about it, so I go up to him and ask him what he's doing. He says he's on the phone, so I reply that he hasn't done a rep in about 10 minutes and that people are waiting to go. ""What's it to you?"" he says, and I reply with ""Just don't be dick when people are trying to workout"". He says something colourful and I tell him to finish his sets soon. I just walked away after that to finish my workout.

I felt right at the time, but now I feel like I might've just scared some guy who is new to the gym and doesn't know what he's doing. Gym etiquette is important, but I don't think I acted my best in this situation.

For clarity, I saw him do a set when I walked in, but none after that. He still had weight on the bar so clearly he wasn't finished.

"AITA for my comment about my SIL‚Äôs divorce? So me (26M) and my girlfriend Rachel (27F) have been dating 2.5 years. We live together and have for the past year. So I don‚Äôt really fuck with her sister Ashley (31F) at all. Like I‚Äôll let her in the house whenever she comes over and give her a little wave. But that‚Äôs it is. The reason is that I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs a good person. When we met she was with her longtime BF and at that point husband. They had been married for 4 years. I liked her husband and he was one of the few guys my age at the family events. Well about 2 years ago Ashley left her husband for an older rich guy with two kids. Didn‚Äôt even talk to her husband. She left divorce papers on the bed. I was the one who had to show up to make sure he was okay. To make matters worse the guy was married. So she moved right in after the guy left his wife and kids. My girlfriend was irate. And didn‚Äôt speak to her sister for almost a year. But eventually they started having a relationship again. But my Gf knows I didn‚Äôt like her sister and never forced us to connect after. I didn‚Äôt attend the second wedding. 

Another reason I don‚Äôt like her sister is that she‚Äôs lazy and entitled. She‚Äôs attractive and has always gotten by on her looks. Even claiming that she only went to college for her ‚Äúmrs degree‚Äù. She has never had a job. So now to my comment. I came home yesterday to Rachel and her sister on the couch. Ashley was hysterical and hyperventilating. I asked what was wrong. Rachel walked over to me and told me what happened. Basically Ashley showed up to her house and she was locked out. Her husband sent her a text that he was in love with someone else. She had moved in. And all of Ashley things along with the divorce papers were at an apartment. That he would pay the lease for a year but they were done. I said ‚Äúoh well at least the kids won‚Äôt hate you anymore‚Äù. Ashley always complained about her step kids hating her. I then went back to our room to change. When I came back out to make food. Ashley asked me ‚Äúis that really all you have to say‚Äù‚Ä¶ I said ‚Äúyep‚Äù and went about making a sandwich. When I looked up Ashley was staring at me. And I said this exactly ‚Äúwhat do you want Ashley, do you want me to feel bad for you, it‚Äôs called karma. Just make sure the next one is single‚Äù. And I walked back to my room. Ever since my girlfriend has been upset with me. She said that she understands I don‚Äôt like her sister. But I could have faked it for a minute. I said that she knows I‚Äôm not good at faking. And her sister got what has been coming to her for a long time. She‚Äôs been doing shitty things to people since HS.

"AITA for not letting my sister borrow my pride flag? I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm the asshole, but my brother wanted me to post this story just for the shits and giggles. 

Today my (16 m) sister (22f) and I got into an argument over text. These will be direct quotes from the conversation since I can do that. For context, my sister is 22 and only works a part time job. She moved out for two years to be a nanny, but moved back in 6 months ago since her bosses moved. Since we only have a 3 bedroom house and my brother has the smaller room, my sister and I share a room where I have pride flags on the roof that I hung up while she was gone. She‚Äôs going to a harry styles concert soon.

S: Could I take your rainbow flag to the show? 

Me: I‚Äôd prefer not 

S: You‚Äôd get it back we‚Äôre just doing a fan project trying to light up the stadium rainbow 

Me: I‚Äôd still prefer not
Me: they‚Äôre $10 at hottopic tho

S: R u gonna take me to hot topic or get me one? cause I don‚Äôt drive or have the time to go

Me: I just don‚Äôt want you losing my flag. It‚Äôs not my problem if you don‚Äôt have a flag to bring. Please respect my boundaries

S: I‚Äôm not pushing bringing yours? I‚Äôm staying I don‚Äôt have a way to get to hottopic so your solution isn‚Äôt one. But whatever cause every time I open my mouth to u I fuck up

Me: I‚Äôm just saying you can‚Äôt bring my flag. Sorry that‚Äôs such an issue for you but figure out your own solution

S: Sometimes u need to learn when your snarky comments r necessary tooüôÑ

Me: I wasn‚Äôt being snarky I‚Äôm just asking you to respect my boundaries and find your own way to get a flag. You‚Äôre the one throwing a fit because you aren‚Äôt getting what you want. Grow up. 

S: Where dude? U gave me a dumb ass solution cause u don‚Äôt use your brain. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather u not please‚Äù is all what was needed. Don‚Äôt be obnoxious end it there. But knowing I don‚Äôt drive and work all the time. U sound dumb and u sound like you‚Äôre being a dick. 

Me: *sends Amazon link for pride flag*

S: Get the fuck out my shit smart ass the show is on Saturday. The conversation has ended leave me alone

I went back to my school work after that cause i was in the middle of class. I ranted to some of my friends about it, one of them even came up with the idea to just send the link and not respond after. All of the people I told this to agreed that she‚Äôs being a bitch about this. What do you guys think? And please, don‚Äôt be afraid to roast her I want something to laugh about

Edit: some of you are bringing up really good points so let me address some of them so I don‚Äôt have to keep typing it over again. 

1) why did I say they were at hottopic if I won‚Äôt drive her: there‚Äôs a few reasons why. First, I can‚Äôt legally drive her anywhere, and she has her permit and can easily drive to the mall during one of her lessons with our mom. 

2) why not let her borrow it if it‚Äôs only $10? This was the first flag I ever got after I came out and I‚Äôve had it for four years, so it holds sentimental value to me and who I am as a person. 

3) why was I being snarky and sending her links? At that time when I sent her a link I was pissed and trying to get my work done. I showed the conversation to my friend and she said to send her the link and just leave it. My sister is constantly being an ass so my temper with her is really short, especially after she moved back in.",0.4
"AITA For not wanting my niece to play the clarinet at my dad's funeral? &#x200B;

My (37M) father recently passed away, and we are in the process of planning for the funeral. Yesterday, my sister (41F) called me to ask if her daughter (11F) could play Amazing Grace on her clarinet at the funeral. She said it would be a great way for my niece to honor her grandfather. I told my sister that I didn't think that was a good idea. I recently went to my niece's recital and she completely froze during a small solo that she had due to nerves. She was very upset after, and I would hate for the same thing to happen again. She's only been playing the clarinet since the beginning of this school year, and I think it would be better to have someone who is more skilled play at my dad's funeral. Also, I worry that some people would find it disrespectful to have a child play a song at the funeral. 

I suggested that perhaps she could play something during the reception instead. Before my dad passed, he told us that he wanted his funeral reception to be a ""fun celebration"" of his life. I thought that this would be a more comfortable environment for my niece, and that she could chose a song that felt special to her. I thought this was a pretty good idea, but my sister told me that I was ""interfering with her daughters grieving process"" and that I don't get to make all of the decisions. I decided to reach out to my aunt (my dad's sister) to ask how she felt. She was my dad's only sibling, and I felt that her input was important. She liked my idea of having my niece play at the reception instead of the funeral. I called my sister back, and she accused me of ""talking about her behind her back"". Finally, I snapped and told her that this isn't a middle school band concert, it's our father's funeral. She got really quiet and hung up on me. 

I realize that I might have come off as a bit rude. Obviously we're both struggling with our dad's death, and I think our emotions got the best of both of us. I tried to reach out this morning, but she's not answering my calls or texts.",0.1

It's my private account! Only my friends follow. What I post shouldn't matter to her. 

John left some rude comments on my post. Because of that, I deleted his comments and removed him as a follower. He's pissed and told my mom that I removed him. I think it's justified to remove him because he ratted me out and left unnecessarily rude comments. AITA?

"AITA for demanding that my mother return the spare key to my car after she lost it? My mother occasionally watches my cats when I go on weekend trips. Because of this, she has a house key. About a year and a half ago she asked for the spare key to my car as well in case it needed to be moved. I didn't think much of it at the time and gave her the key.

Six months ago, my mom moved. She has a LOT of stuff, and she moved into a much smaller house. During the move, she lost my spare house and spare car key. I have other copies of my house key, that wasn't such a big deal. But the spare car key is my only spare.

She did not find it for six months.

Last weekend, she texted me saying that she had found the spare key set. I responded and said that was great and that I would be reclaiming my spare car key the next time that I see her. I feel as though someone who will not be responsible will a spare key should now have it.

"AITA for blowing up about they/them pronouns? Hey reddit, posting this from a throwaway account because my brother has reddit and I don't want him to find my real one. Anyway, my (18m) partner (17) and I have known each other for a year and have been dating for ~6 months. My partner has gone by they/them pronouns since before I met them, and that's all they've ever gone by when interacting with my family. They met family ~8 months ago, and my family assumed they went by she/her pronouns. Now, we live in a pretty small town where people arent very ""woke"" and don't get much practice using they/them pronouns, but my family has always been pretty liberal. My partner was very understanding and politely corrected them, and they were also cool about it and apologized and said theyd use the right ones. But they kind of haven't been? It's weird, they're all pretty good about using they/them when my partner isn't around, slipping up once in a while but quickly correcting themselves, but whenever my partner IS there it's like all of that goes out the window. They don't even try! No matter how much I correct them, they ALWAYS seem to call my partner ""she"". My partner is very kind about it and tries to correct them as politely as possible, but I can tell it hurts them. They were crying on the phone last night about their insecurities about gender, and how they feel like I want a more feminine partner (I don't) because I'm straight and I probably think of them as a woman(I don't) and how they wish they could be a woman for me because they think thats what I want (It's not). I reassured them that I know they aren't a woman and that's not how I think of them or what I expect them to be, and then my mom walks in. I told her I needed some privacy because my partner was having a rough night and I was trying to help, and my mom says ""Well tell [partner] she's beautiful and I hope she feels better!"". I mute and tell my mom ""Stop doing that! You've known their pronouns for months, its basic human decency to get them right at this point and they don't deserve to put up with this from you!"" My mom looked taken aback and told me that she was just trying to help, that she'd been doing her best and it's not her fault that my partner ""decides to act female."" She said something about how if my partner doesn't want to be called a girl maybe they shouldn't dress like one, which completely threw me off because my mom had never spoken like that and it totally untrue, my partner wears a lot of baggy clothes and no makeup so I don't see what about them is feminine. Anyway, mom said that I had no right to blow up at her considering she didn't know it was such a big deal and she'd been doing her best and my dad and brother agreed.

"AITA for buying my toiletries on my mom‚Äôs card to teach her a lesson? I would like to preface this story by saying that my mom claimed me as a dependent on her tax return in 2020, and claimed she and my dad had a hard year due to the pandemic. After a lengthy conversation, she apologized as she didn‚Äôt know how hard I struggled financially as well. Since I‚Äôm still in college, she says she can continue to claim me as a dependent until I‚Äôve graduated for my bachelor‚Äôs degree, but she promised me that she would not do it again as I need the money more than she and my dad do. 

Fast forward to now, I was filing my tax return the other night, and I noticed I was rejected on my claim for a return in exchange for my college expenses, such as my living fees, tuition, books, etc. I would‚Äôve gotten a few thousand back, which I planned on putting towards the emergency loan I had to apply for so I wouldn‚Äôt be in major debt after my graduation. 

I figured it couldn‚Äôt be that my mom claimed me as a dependent again because of our conversation we had about it in the previous year. Now, she and my dad are making well over 250k a year with commissions from their sales, so I didn‚Äôt think they needed it for financial reasons like they did during the start of Covid-19. I confronted my mom about it because I figured it doesn‚Äôt hurt to ask, and that‚Äôs when she told me that she did claim me as a dependent, and that she has a right to do so as my mom. I then explained to her what I planned on using it for and she basically told me ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not my problem. We needed that money more than you do.‚Äù
I asked my dad about this and he flat out denied them needing the money. He said that they‚Äôre not in any kind of debt, and that he doesn‚Äôt understand why she did this again.

I went on our family‚Äôs joint Amazon account, and I decided to purchase my deodorant and shaving cream on my mom‚Äôs card to teach her a lesson about the importance of money and why that return meant a lot to me.

When she saw the charge, she was fuming at me for putting it on her card when I knew better. I clapped back and told her that the $15 I charged to her card was nothing in comparison to the money I would‚Äôve received from the tax return. She bitterly told me not to do it again, and I refuse to talk to her now. 
So, AITA?

My parents are not helping me financially. Yes, this does include my living expenses as well. I‚Äôve been living on my own for a little while now. (Well over a year) I‚Äôve also been paying for all of my needs since I was in high school. I‚Äôm also paying my way through college on my own.
After reading the ESH responses, I decided to send my mom the money for the things I charged to her card as I felt guilty for using her money.
After talking with my mom and mentioning that I would file a complaint with the IRS, she agreed to transfer the money that she got from the return when she claimed me as a dependent. Thank you guys for all the help!",0.04

"AITA for being angry my mom went against my wishes and found out the gender of my baby? I (27F) am currently 33 weeks pregnant with my fianc√©‚Äôs (26M) baby. We have been together 6 years, and 2 months after deciding we wanted to start trying to expand our family were so lucky enough to find out I was pregnant. Not only did I find out I was pregnant that day, my fianc√© had planned to purpose before he even knew I was with child. The day was perfect. 

I knew that I didn‚Äôt want to know the gender of the baby, for a variety of reasons, but my fianc√© wanted to know.  We compromised on finding out the gender, but keeping it between just the two of us until the baby was born. 

This decision wasn‚Äôt really something either of our parents understood, but they didn‚Äôt press us too much after they realized that we were not going to budge‚Ä¶ That was until now.  

My mother, whom I have had a very rocky relationship with my whole life but even more so the last few years, decided to tell me that at her own appointment for a ultrasound, she showed the tech some of my ultrasound pictures and had her tell my mother the gender.  My mom told me so casually.  I was instantly shaking out of anger.  Several thoughts immediately crossed my mind. First, if we wanted people to know we would have told people. Secondly, I feel beyond disrespected in regards to our first real choice as parents. Third, how sneaky of her, I feel violated.  I told her all of this and immediately told her I no longer felt like talking. She had no remorse in her voice and was acting like I was over reacting. 

My mother is now upset that I am upset because I told her she deeply violated my trust, and ruined how I wanted to experience my first pregnancy.  So am I the asshole?

UPDATE: for some clarification, my mom is not pregnant but has several health issues and was having an ultrasound of sorts. She had a picture of my ultrasound on her phone and said she told the tech I wasn‚Äôt telling and asked her what the gender was. This was not the facility I have my ultrasounds done at, but I‚Äôm not certain where so I cannot call and file a complaint. 

Secondly, I asked my ultrasound tech to leave out the genitalia so we could share with our friends and family and leave it gender neutral for the time being.  When i mentioned that to my mom she said apparently there are other markers they can look for, and per my research that is 100% true. For example they can check the Sagittal sign.

Boundaries have always been an issue and I‚Äôve worked really hard there last 3 years to place boundaries. Recently she has shown huge improvement and I have hesitantly started letting her in, but still at a distance compared to prior.

"AITA for asking my ex-best friend to not mention much? this post is sort of in the same line as my other post. read it if you want extra context. 

i‚Äôll give a quick rundown anyway. basically, my former best friend and i are not on good terms anymore. we were fighting for a month, and i decided to end our friendship. 

background info: i‚Äôve known him (let‚Äôs call him jake) for around 2 years and a half. i have another best friend, who i‚Äôll call kelly (fake name), who i‚Äôve known for 4 years. our [kelly and i‚Äôs] bond is stronger than mine with jake, as kelly and i have known each other for longer. jake and kelly both moved to separate countries from each other, and mine. due to this, i used to call jake a lot (not kelly so much, i had nothing against her), maybe 1-3 times a week for 1-2 hours. recently, i‚Äôve had a life changing event happen to me, along as my general mental health declining, because of school. it got to a point where i was tired of calling anyone, especially jake, since he would dump his issues onto me. i stopped calling him for about 3 weeks before we had our first big fight. 

coming back to my final call with jake, my request for him was for him to not give kelly details about my fight with him. i have several reasons for this:

1) i didn‚Äôt want kelly to get involved. 
while jake and i were fighting. he told her my reasons for why i stopped calling him prior to cutting him off. she called those reasons ‚Äúinvalid‚Äù and this pissed me off, which caused a fight between kelly and i, our first fight in 4 years. 

2) i didn‚Äôt, and don‚Äôt, want kelly to pick sides. i dont want her relationship with jake or her relationship with me be tainted by what either of us said. 

3) to add onto 2, jake has a history of telling stories from a rather biased perspective. i didn‚Äôt tell him this but i didn‚Äôt want him to sort of ‚Äúpit‚Äù kelly against me, the way he did when him and i were fighting. i don‚Äôt trust him to tell a neutral point of view, seeing as during our final call, he thinks all of this is not happening because of his words and actions, but because i‚Äôm being over emotional.

4) the fights and the falling out do not concern her directly. i don‚Äôt want her to deal with jake and i‚Äôs fights because kelly already has a lot of shit going on in her life, and the last thing she needs is our shit. 

when i told my reasons to jake, he vehemently disagreed with me, and said that since kelly is our best friend, she is entitled to know the details of jake and i‚Äôs falling out. while i do think that kelly can be aware of it, i don‚Äôt want her to get all the details. 

jake told kelly anyway (i don‚Äôt know what he said, hopefully not much), but i was wondering what others think. i know it‚Äôs irrational of me to be pissed that he told, seeing as i cannot and will not control his actions. so, what do y‚Äôall think? AITA for making such a request?",0.1
"WIBTA If I Let My Neighbour's Cat Inside My Home? I'm a 21(F) and live with my 22(Fiancee). A little about the sort of people we are, we own a cat (2 y/o M) called Shadow together as well as a few other pets, we're huge animal lovers and we've even rescued animals over the years (not the fake kind where people record themselves, you know the ones)

For me, when it comes to cats, I'm a bit of a pushover, especially towards black cats because I've seen people treat them horribly due to the superstition behind them. Shadow is also a black cat.

A few months, Shadow started bringing home a friend. (Our cat gets to go outside for a few hours to have a run around, he's had all his shots, is neutered and microchipped, and he always comes home before dark - my partner and I aren't comfortable letting him stay out at night.) Shadow's friend warmed up to us immediately, we never let him inside the house because I didn't want Shadow to feel threatened sharing his home with another male cat, but we would give him a little food and then send him on his way. We assumed he was a stray. Whenever I'd leave the house, he'd follow me everywhere, even to the corner store.

It wasn't until recent that we found out he wasn't, and thankfully his owners didn't seem to have an issue. We also stopped feeding him. Anyway, recently their cat has been hanging on our doormat at night, to the point where I had to start leading him back to his owner, knocking on their door and telling them the situation until they let him inside to sleep or eat. As a note, their door doesn't have a cat flap so he literally has to meow at the door until he's let in.

It seems like they let him out really early and let him out well into the night. There's strays in the neighbourhood that occasionally fight and people get intoxicated and scary in certain parts, too.

I know he's not my cat so I don't have much of a say, but he's been staying out later and later each day and he's always sitting on our doormat curled up like he's trying to get warm. And it gets FREEZING at night, too.

I really want to let him in and at least let him sleep in the bathroom where I'd make a little bed just so he'll be warm, but I don't want to seem like a cat napper. I know my heart's in the right place, but my fiancee has also reminded that, while he sees my side of things, that this might look bad on me.

"AITA for kicking a friend out of my car for a comment she made about me? I've (25f) been told that I have a ""perpetually confused/startled face"" in several different occasions. I think it's just something about my face. People who saw my baby pictures would be like ""omg you look like this since day 1."" Anyways. It is just a small thing that my friends and family would sometimes tease me with. It is a little bit annoying sometimes but it doesn't bother me that much. 

Today, an old friend of mine from college was in my area before she leaves to the airport, and wanted to meet up. I picked her up during my lunch break and we went out for coffee. Then I needed to return to work, but she asked me if I could give her a ride to the airport after I'm off. I agreed, and even brought her back to my office so that she had a place to stay in the meantime (my place is rather far so I can't drop her off there). When I was working, she started chatting with my co-workers in the break room. After I was done with work, I asked her to wait for me in front of the building while I pull my car out. I was saying bye to my co-workers, and one of them looked at me and was like, ""You do have a perpetually confused/startled face huh, I guess I never noticed."" 

I immediately realized that my friend must have said something about my face to my co-workers. I was so embarrassed, but also really upset. It is one thing to joke around about that amongst friends, but it is another thing to do so in a professional environment. Who knows if her comment will find a way to my boss? I want my co-workers and my boss to take me seriously, and not as someone who looks ""confused."" After she got into my car, I asked her if she did make a comment on my look. She laughed. I tried to tell her that I really did not feel comfortable that she did that at my work. She shrugged it off and told me it was not that big of a deal, that I was overreacting. I eventually told her that I was not going to give her a ride anymore and asked her to get out of my car. 

She was really upset with me. Apparently she ended up paying a huge uber bill to get to the airport. She also said that she couldn't believe I put her in danger of missing her flight for such a harmless joke. One of our mutual friends told me that she didn't mean to embarrass me or anything, and as we used to joke around, she had no way of knowing that this time would be so different. I don't know.

"AITA For not buying my friend expensive gifts? Am I (21F) the asshole for net getting my bestfriend expensive gifts for her  and Christmas.

When my  birthday came around a month before she asked what I wanted as a gift. Then came my actual birthday, we had plans to just hang out at my apartment. She and her bf were an hour late because they decided to go to the city to get mary jane. When they finally arrived she handed me my birthday gift, it was a tin rolling tray from the dispensary she had just came from. Even though I was slightly disappointed with the fact she had bought it that day, I still got what I asked for and was grateful for the gift and used it for months.  Later she sent me a photo of a birthday gift for one of her other friends that she made and was proud of. It was a bouquet of roses with joint that she had rolled herself stuffed in. (There was probably 150 dollars worth of weed). That had hurt my feelings that I got a cheap tin tray that she had just bought a hour before when we had been friends for 4 years.

For Christmas I had gotten her a tote from a brand that we were both obsessed with, and planned on getting her the matching jumpsuit for her birthday but it ended up being too expensive. So I got her dried herbs to mix into joints (we had constantly talked about trying it) so I thought I would be a thoughtful gift. The entire night she was being distant and not keeping conversation.¬†

The next day I texted her asking if there was a problem, that she was distant and I thought that she was mad at me. She said she would call me later. Before I could even say hello she was screaming at me saying I didn't deserve her as a friend and that she didn't feel appreciated because her gifts weren't expensive enough and she spent so much money on my gifts when she made less money than me. She even said it wasn't about the money but the quality of her gifts too.

"WIBTA if I don't tell my husband and inlaws how my grandma died A bit of backstory.

11 years ago (2011) my grandma was diagnosed with advanced cancer of the lungs and throat, likely as a result of passive smoke from my grandpa who smoke heavily and died of lung cancer in 1996. My grandma never smoked but my grandpa smoked in the house, the car, everywhere. At the time the doctors said she had a good chance for recovery as although she was 78, she walked 5-10km every day, went to line dancing twice a week, was otherwise healthy and just 2 years earlier did a 3 month trip around the world visiting 4 different continents and we live on a 5th continent. We gave consent to commence treatment based on the above factors and the fact the doctors thought it would be okay. The first round of radiation/chemo (I can't remember which) was too much for her body and she died the very next day, 2 weeks after her initial diagnosis.

Now, my husband's grandma is 83 and lives a similarly active healthy lifestyle and has just been diagnosed with bowel cancer that has spread to her ovaries. My MIL is super worried that she won't make it. At the moment the doctors are just talking about removing the bowel and ovaries and hoping that will be enough but my MIL is worried that as it has already spread it will spread more.

Now I am torn as to whether I should tell her about my grandma as that will just worry her even more, even though it is in different organs and in organs that she can live without whereas my grandma's cancer being in both lungs and the throat is very different.

So reddit WIBTA if I told my MIL the cause of my grandma's death causing her to worry more, but give her better understanding of the risks or should I just not say anything",0.6
"AITA for not letting my sister visit after she flew across the country and let me know the day before she arrived? My (28m) sister (30f) and I live on opposite ends of the country and haven't been able to visit each other since early 2018, I had booked a flight in 2020 but the pandemic changed these plans and I haven't had a chance to reschedule. We message a few times a week to check in and FaceTime when possible due to both have demanding work schedules.

November last year, I was promoted after some restructuring at work and took on new responsibilities as a supervisor. It's been a hard transition, and I've been putting in extra hours to get up to speed and meet deadlines. She knows this and has been generally supportive. Since taking the job, I'd been working on the launch event for one of our new programs set to roll out last week, with the event scheduled for this weekend. 

This is the first big deliverable from my team this year and lots of planning, people, and resources have been poured into making this a success. My sister and I have talked about this a few times and understands the impact this will have on my future career, or so I thought..

Thursday my sister calls me to let me know that her friend is eloping, and she's going to be in town for the weekend to be the witness at their wedding and she touches down on early Friday morning. She asks to crash at my apartment cause it's ""just a weekend stay"" and close to the venue and we could finally spend some time togethe. I have roommates that aren't comfortable with people coming over ad  I reminded her that I'm knee deep in planning the launch and need to focus on getting through it this weekend and recommend a good hotel she could stay at instead. 

She yells saying I don't care about her and all I think about is work, which I feel guilty about, and we haven't seen each other for four years and the event shouldn't take up all of the weekend. Honestly, I feel like I could sleep for a week after this is over. 

I haven't heard from her all day, and have been feeling awful.

My roommates are uncomfortable with guests and I'm preoccupied with getting through the weekend leading to a fight with sister.

Unfortunately she has one friend, L, (21M, gay) who's been acting weird around me.

F's parents and L's parents ""joked"" that the 2 of them would end up getting married. L's behaviour toward me has reeked of jealousy. Whenever the 3 of us have hung out, he has basically ignored me.

The bridal shower, bachelorette party, and wedding are all in NY (where we're from and where all my friends are), but we've since moved to the DMV area. My sister wanted to do the bachelorette party and the shower in the same weekend so she wouldn't have to travel twice in one month. That didn't work, as two of my bridesmaids and I have chronic illnesses that make us fatigued. After that, she decided she was only going to go to the bridal shower but didn't tell us until the last minute after the reservations had been made.

When she told my bridesmaids that she wasn't coming to the party, they were upset at her and for me. She hadn't said anything about not being able to make it prior to this, and when we announced the date, her response was just ""who do I send the money to?"". So we all assumed she was coming. They were texting her in the group chat asking why she didn't say anything earlier and that they were upset that she, as the sister of the bride and the maid of honor, would not be there.

My sister got angry at them for disrespecting her--I didn't take it that way, but she did, and I can't tell her how to feel.

"AITA for telling my friend she can ""kinda fuck off"" after she made a comment on my laundry? I (28M) was doing my laundry when a friend (26F) wanted to come over and borrow something from my apartment. This is pretty common since we live close by, so I just told her to let herself in and grab what she needs. 

When she came in I was doing some laundry. Unfortunately, when I sleep I tend to sweat, so I wash my bedsheets every week or so because otherwise they can get stained pretty bad. A little gross, yeah, but I try and stay on top of it. When my friend was grabbing what she needed (containers) she saw a stain on my sheets and asked if I spilt something.

I explained that no, I just tend to sweat a lot when I sleep so I have to clean my sheets pretty often. She made a sort of disgusted face and said that it's ""kinda gross"". Normally I'd laugh it off, but I just had a *really* shit day at work, the type where nothing goes right. So, I told her she can ""kinda fuck off then"".

She looked at me as if trying to figure out if I was serious, so I asked if she had everything she needed and then said goodbye and kept on doing what I was doing. She left and I didn't hear anything for the rest of the day. But today I've had a couple of friends asking me why I told her to fuck off, and I feel a little bit bad about being so blunt.

This is a special year for me, yet my uncle(M 40) has decided to buy a cake for her and celebrate her birthday on MY birthday party, she‚Äôs over a decade older than me and has had enough birthdays that she got to celebrate on her own, but she threw a tantrum saying that no one would pay attention to her on her birthday( this year my birthday is on a Friday, I‚Äôm busy and the party will be the day after so in the 27th) , that‚Äôs why my uncle decided to celebrate her on my party.  My parents scolded me after I left as soon as the cake was cut last year, and although I overreacted last year(many things happened around that time so I was not in the mood to humor M‚Äôs decision to come to my house to celebrate her birthday on my birthday). For context I don‚Äôt get along with M because she herself has 2 children with different dad‚Äôs as a result of 2 failed marriages, she‚Äôs a lazy gold digger(only works 6h and not even for 5 days in a week) she doesn‚Äôt like her eldest son(M22) working and my uncle basically pays for anything she or her children need, her youngest(m10) has caused me many problems that I get blamed for even though he‚Äôs the one that causes and does things on his own. I have told my mother about how I don‚Äôt feel comfortable sharing MY birthday party with M simply because she‚Äôs a petty adult that has had enough birthday parties. My mother has told me not to stoop to her level and to not say anything because she doesn‚Äôt think her brother would actually make my party about M, but I don‚Äôt believe that, I have yet to bring it up, but would I be TA if I banned my uncle from having us celebrate her on my birthday party?

To clarify, when I say ‚Äúus‚Äù I mean my family, because since it‚Äôs my party only My family(mostly paternal) and some of my parents friends that live here will come to it, so her family that has nothing to do with me naturally won‚Äôt attend since they‚Äôre basically strangers. Apart from the obvious disgust I originally felt towards her for being a gold digger, it worsened because I overheard her talk bad about my family, like why tf would you expect them be familiar or kind to you when you are a stranger to them do you expect them to treat you like as if you were their sibling? They treated her as they would a stranger, polite and distant, because that‚Äôs what she is to them a stranger.

Edit: I didn‚Äôt always dislike her, at the beginning of her relationship with my uncle she was more of a stranger, and I actually began to accept her as my potential ‚Äúaunt‚Äù I even called her that once before. However, apart from what I‚Äôve said before about her being a gold digger, she‚Äôs also controlling and easily gets jealous, my uncle has built a friendship with my aunt(paternal) she‚Äôs married to my dad‚Äôs brother and since she particularly likes Italian food, whenever my uncle cooks he takes some to her. Same with my friend(F25) he often takes her food, especially when she‚Äôs working. But every time he does this and she finds out, in a fit of jealousy for she gets mad and starts making faces at him, she even went to my aunts store( where my friend works) and confronted both of them when she didn‚Äôt have a reason to, my aunt has been married for over 20 years and my friend is in a relationship. She even gets mad whenever she calls my uncle and he‚Äôs not answering because he is helping my mom with her work or running an errand for her because she can‚Äôt do it. He would obviously prioritize his younger sister and his only family member that he sees over her.",0.3
"AITA For Telling my Dad and Stepmom that they are delusional for thinking I would include them on senior recongnition? We recently had senior recognition for my team since our regular season is over. Each year, each senior is talked about (accomplishments on the team and academically) and then escorted by her parents and then given a gift of a framed uniform. They introduce the senior by going here is ""first name last name"" from X hometown escorted by her parents ""mom and dad first names and last name"" (I asked my coach not to use my mom's and stepdad's last name since its different from mine and it kind of brings up uncomfortable feelings)

I (22f) asked my mom and stepdad to escort me since they are the ones who were there almost every single day of my childhood and were there for the good/bad moments and when I was a nasty teenager, and my stepdad stuck around and loved me even when I was a little kid that hated him because he wasn't my dad and because I thought it was impossible that he could love me as much as he loves my (half)-siblings (they are real full 100% siblings to me!! don't like using the term half)

My dad and stepmom and half-siblings (I call them half because we were not raised together) lived in another state and I saw them some school breaks and every other holiday (until I had practice pretty much everyday in summer. My dad and stepmom flew to see me one weekend a month because my stepmom could apparently not handle my me having my dad all to myself for just 2 days out of a month.

My dad and stepmom came to this last competition of regular season a. I didn't tell my dad that it was senior recognition because I didn't know he was going to come.

My dad was sad and my stepmom got really snippy and I told them both that they are part time parents and that they are delusional for thinking I would give them any credit for raising me and my athletic career when they lived states over.

My dad called me  crying (He never cries) and was telling me how much he loves me and how hard it was to be away from me. My stepmom just lectured me about how they did the best they could by coming one weekend a month etc.

I kind of feel like an asshole now for not telling my dad about it now and yelling at him

edit 1: my stepmom not wanting me to have my dad all to myself is just a theory.",0.23

"AITA for choosing a new schedule without my partner I (22 male) recently got a new boss at my job and he wanted to have a meeting to go over the future of the job and new changes being implemented. My partner (26 female) and I had the day off together but it was mandatory I go. The meeting went well and overall not many changes were done except when I came to the schedule; I was asked what my preferred hours were and I said that I don't like morning shifts and am just not a morning person, this works for everyone else at the company because they all have kids and can pretty much only work opening shifts. I came home and told my partner about the meeting and the future of the schedule and she was quite upset saying that I should have texted or called and discussed it with her since she works 8-4, and that I'm choosing to sleep in over spending time with her. I didn't think about that but I feel I shouldn't have to call my partner anytime something like this comes up in my career.

"AITA for refusing to give my friend a ride? My coworker/friend (34F) refuses to get a driver's license and always asks people to give her rides. I (26F) offer to help her out sometimes and drive her places. We work together and there are times when I want to go home right after work but she says that getting home takes her too long on the bus and it's faster if I gave her a ride. I live the opposite direction and complain a lot, but feel obligated because she has small children that she has to get home to and her husband isn't home. Sometimes on the way to her house she'll ask me to go get her kids from daycare which is 4 blocks away. I explained how I don't want to and I'm already doing her a favor by taking her home, but she says her kids will stay there until much later when her husband gets off work. Afterwards I give in and pick up her kids and dri e them all home. This happens at least once a month. 
This past weekend we went out to a happy hour that we had scheduled and after 30 minutes of waiting for her i asked if she was coming and she said ""no, because you were my ride and you never told me when you were coming."" After I told her that I didn't want to give her rides anymore, she's trying to askfor rides from another girl who can't say no to anyone. I feel bad for her kids since she's going to be getting home late from now on, but I don't want to feel used anymore. And now that gas prices are rising, I don't want to be driving unnecessarily.

"AITA for stopping my roommate from eating my food? I feel super bad because they got all hurt, but I met them about two weeks ago and they haven't been in the apartment most of those times. We've discussed preferences pretty heavily, for hours on multiple occasions. I made it pretty clear that I don't like sharing because I can't guarantee that they'll treat my stuff with respect seeing as how they're a stranger. I did agree that we could have a communal pool of food that we both contribute money to and consume, like eggs and milk.

But the thing is, they just moved in, don't have most of their stuff, and hasn't contributed to anything in the apartment, never mind groceries. This morning, they're making eggs and I see that there are only four left, and I ask them if those are mine. They say yes, that they took it because we said we're sharing food. I am currently dead broke and I don't even have enough money for a crate of eggs. They don't know that because it's none of their business, but they get angry at me, saying they just wanted to eat eggs.

I hate confrontation and at this point I'm vibrating with anxiety, so I just give up and turn away. They put away the eggs in a huff and the mood gets really awkward. I think I was pretty neutral in what I said. I didn't say anything insulting, just asked them to not eat my food, especially without asking. Since they came, I have been letting them use a lot of things that I already told them I don't want them to touch because what's the harm? Now, they're acting like I'm unreasonable, even offering fifty cents for the eggs, which I found so condescending.

"AITA if i tell my fianc√© to kick out our roommate? my fiance J (23m) and i (21f) live with our baby (3monthsF) and our roommates K (25m) and N (23m). K is in the process of moving out, but finding a place right now is hard in our area so we‚Äôre being lenient on it. 

(Gonna preface this by saying no judgements on the state of the house because believe me, i know it‚Äôs bad to have a baby in it. we‚Äôre working on fixing it) 

we have been dealing with a roach problem for almost two years now, everything we‚Äôve done hasn‚Äôt been working. we‚Äôre getting another exterminator in to try that. i‚Äôve been wondering why nothing we‚Äôve been doing has been working. 

until i went into N‚Äôs room to get the cat out. 

his room is *filthy*. the huge closet is about halfway full with trash and fast food bags, there‚Äôs barely walk space, he has plates of old food, pop cans, pee bottles. you name it, it‚Äôs probably there. it‚Äôs like it‚Äôs own little eco system. 

i believe that‚Äôs the main reason the bugs are going away because i‚Äôve deep cleaned my kitchen, living room, bedroom, bathroom. and i obviously don‚Äôt want my baby to be living with bugs because it‚Äôs disgusting and can make her sick. 

would i be the asshole if i demand my fianc√© give N a move out date? because i feel sorry for N as he won‚Äôt have anywhere to go, but at this point, i feel like that‚Äôs on him.

EDIT: my fianc√© owns the house. there is no official lease set up-only J‚Äôs name is on the lease. N does pay ‚Äòrent‚Äô and utilities, which amount to about half of monthly expenses. 

we are actively trying to get rid of the bugs. we‚Äôve called an exterminator once before but they sucked and didn‚Äôt even enter the house. we‚Äôre gonna get another exterminator to come in.

"AITA for cursing at my(28F) partner(35M)? For context, I just got home from a week long hospital stay yesterday evening and today was my first time driving since my accident on December 10th. It also rained heavily today. I had been taking it VERY slow and driving extra defensively as a result. This is important. 

Today I was alone, but I had a ton to do. I had a doctors appointment at 1:45pm meaning I had to scramble to call around to get the grandparents to pick up our girls from school so that I wouldn‚Äôt have to miss my appointment. Then, I had to rush to go get the kids from their grandparents, then immediately stop by the mobile store so I could pick up his brand new phone; one that I was excited to gift him and had already paid for in full and in cash. This is where the problems began. 

At the store, I basically ended up wasting two extra hours with two hungry seven year old girls. The system was down so I couldn‚Äôt get the pickup order. My partner then called and asked for Chinese food. I decided that since he wanted to eat Chinese food then we would just make it our dinner. So I called and ordered enough food for all four of us. Then we went to the nearby  department store to wait. 

My partner started calling every ten minutes, asking me what I was doing and where I was and asking me to video chat with him while I waited. I agreed and said to let me just redownload Duo first He got mad two minutes after hanging up with me and called back to tell me that it was taking too long and he *heavily* implied that I was hiding something. I let it go. 

Finally, I get to the Chinese restaurant and the order still isn‚Äôt done yet, but was close. I wait and in between, I call my partner and let him know about the extra wait time. He said (and I quote) ‚ÄúIt don‚Äôt take that damn long to cook some sesame seed chicken. I‚Äôve ordered Chinese food PLENTY of times, Chapter.‚Äù And that was my last straw.

I told him that he was being incredibly RUDE to accuse me of lying for the trivial excuse of ‚ÄúI‚Äôve ordered Chinese food before,‚Äù because I ordered enough food for the whole family, which obviously would take longer to cook than his one lunch plate he usually orders! I also reminded him that it was literally the day after *leaving the hospital* and I was doing all of this extra stuff FOR HIM. He called me crazy and irrational. So I told him to piss off and get the absolute f**k out of my face with his insecure bulls***t and that he could get his own phone and his own dinner and leave me the F alone. He hung up in my face, then told me I was acting irrational and disrespectful when I got home.

"AITA for ""ignoring"" a customer? I work in the paint department at a Home Depot, and for those of you who don't know what that looks like: it's basically just a big desk where paint is mixed, as well as(in my store, at least) three aisles. It can get quite busy mixing paint orders for people, and with the way that the desk is set up, you don't really have a line....people just swarm around it. If someone is standing at the desk, that usually means that they are there specifically to get an order mixed. People rarely stand and wait at the desk solely to get a question answered.

After you enter all of the information about the order into the computer, you go get a bucket of the required base for the paint. I was quite busy with mixing paint orders for people this morning, and so that was the main priority of mine. There were three people standing by the desk (Which feels kind of like a rush, if they're all at the same time) and I had just finished putting in the information for the order for the second of the three. I went back to get the base for the second order, and apparently the third guy was upset that I didn't acknowledge him while doing so.

He came back to there I was getting the bucket and raised his voice somewhat, saying ""You know, it's not cool to ignore your customers!"" I told him I was busy with orders, and he said he knew, but he thought I should have said something like ""Hi, I'll be with you in just a second."" 

He wasn't even asking to get paint mixed, he just wanted to know where something was in the store, and I told him where it was. He kinda calmed down and just said ""Okay,"" leaving to go get it.

AITA for not acknowledging him first? I was quite busy, and I really don't see it as being anything rude to not immediately acknowledge someone while you're busy. I would have ended up helping him regardless.",0.21
"AITA for telling my nephew that his parent's religious beliefs are fake? My sister and I grew up somewhat religious. Our family went to church on major occasions but didn't really take the whole thing too seriously. After we grew up, I stopped going to church altogether but she married a hardcore Christian and she is now very religious herself.

A few weeks ago, my parents hosted a family gathering and I ended up talking to my 13 year old nephew for a while. During the conversation, he asked me if I knew why some people could wiggle their ears and some people can not. I then explained that this is because the muscles in most people's ears are atrophied to the point where they are no longer usable. Essentially, humanity's ancestors were able to use these muscles to control their ear movement. However, as humanity evolved, we lost this ability. My nephew then mentioned that he didn't believe in evolution. This blew my mind because I had no idea that my sister's family were unironic creationists. I explained more about evolution to my nephew and why it is considered a scientific fact. He seemed to be interested in the topic so I went on to explain a brief history of life on earth and how humans came to exist in their current form.

Anyways, earlier this week my sister phoned me to confront me about the conversation I had with her son. She told me that they don't ""believe in evolution"" and that she doesn't want me to ever talk to her son about evolution again. I then explained to her that evolution is scientific reality regardless of what she believes and that if her son wants to talk to me about evolution or any other scientific fact that she denies, that I will not hesitate to educate him on the truth. My sister then got really defensive and claimed that they have a ""right"" as parents to raise their child with their own religious beliefs. I then told her that her beliefs were scientifically illiterate and I do not respect their ""right"" to teach blatant disinformation to her child. The conversation ended shortly after.

Anyway, I'm very careful while driving. I always follow the speed limit because I'm terrified of getting pulled over.

There was one part of the drive where I was stuck behind someone going 60 and couldn't pass, so that's probably what contributed to me being late. I also stopped at the pizza place because I didn't feel too good.

"AITA for not going to my Step-Daughters wedding? I (50f) married my husband (64M) 20 years ago. When I married him I was well aware he had a daughter (Emma) who was 8 years old from his old marriage and once I married him and moved in with him, treated her as if she were mine. 

My husband had full custody of Emma because his ex-wife was dealing with mental issues. But when Emma turned 20 his ex-wife reached out to him and explained to him that she had gotten past her issues and from what I knew she‚Äôd changed herself for the better. Once my husband trusted his ex-wife enough he asked Emma if she felt comfortable having her mother in her life again and long story short Emma decided to rebuild her relationship with her mother. Me and my husband believed she was old enough to make her own decisions so we were okay with it. 

But after Emma rebuilt her relationship with her mother I noticed she was treating me more as a step-mother. She went from calling me mom to calling me Monica (my real name) and started becoming more distant towards me. At first I was a little hurt by this because I did consider her my daughter but I slowly got over it since technically I wasn‚Äôt her blood related mother and I learned to accept that. 

Fast forward a bit I have two kids with my husband and Emma was a big part of their lives since she still lived with us while they were growing up. She had a good relationship with them as well as my husband but things between me and her never really went back to normal so I started to see her more as my step-daughter and we tried keeping a relationship for the sake of my kids.

So yesterday she revealed to us that she was engaged to her boyfriend of 10 years and how she was already planning the wedding and of course we all congratulated her. But then she started talking about who she was going to invite for the wedding and she brought up Me, my husband, my two kids and her mom (husbands ex-wife). She then continued on saying how she was going to sit me, my husband, ex-wife and my kids and the same table. I felt a bit uncomfortable with this idea because I knew I was going to feel out of place at the wedding since the only people I would know would be her, my husband and my kids and my husbands would be distracted most of the time taking family pictures with his ex.(Only her fianc√©‚Äôs family and my husbands ex-wife‚Äôs parents would be at the wedding since my husbands family all live in a different country). I explained to Emma how I was uncomfortable with the whole thing and did not want to be apart of the wedding.

"AITA for being supposedly ‚Äúracist‚Äù even though my joke was taken out of context? 

Posting on a throwaway account bc I know other people know my other accounts. 

I(37 m) work at or should I say used to work at this private law firm for about 9 years. I‚Äôve loved it here and am sad that I had to leave. But here‚Äôs what happened: 

My wife and I took our twins to the park relatively close to my job and our home and we visit it relatively often about 3-4 times a week. Usually at most there aren‚Äôt most people there, a couple of families. But this particular day there were many people there with there families. 

To skip to the chase, there were a group of children taking turns on the monkey bars. This black girl was taking her turn like everyone else and lost her grip and fell, ultimately scraping her knee. And started crying. I thought it was kind of funny how she fell. And i chuckled and turned to my wife and said ‚Äú real life monkey isn‚Äôt she? ‚Äú she chuckled as well and I thought that was the end of it. 

The girls mother ran to her and helped her and turned and looked in my direction and my heart dropped into my stomach instantly. I thought she looked familiar but eventually I gathered my family and left.  

The next few days passed and I thought forgot about the whole situation. Suddenly I was called into a meeting with my supervisors and I thought nothing of it. Instantly I recognized one my superiors as the mother of the child from the park. She proceeded to tell me she heard what I said about her daughter and that she didn‚Äôt appreciate my comments about her. 

I sat there dumbfounded, trying to explain that she wasn‚Äôt supposed to hear what I said and that I was sorry for my comment. And she said that wasn‚Äôt enough. What I had said was apparently racist and I tried to tell her I didn‚Äôt see race and meant no harm and I didn‚Äôt mean anything. 

She didn‚Äôt believe me and eventually said ‚Äúyour employment with this company is terminated‚Äù in so many words. I couldn‚Äôt believe it. 9 years of hard work ruined over a comment that was taken out of context 

P.s. I don‚Äôt see myself as racist as my wife‚Äôs grandfather is of African American decent. My wife is half black. I just don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôm the sole provider for my family.

"AITA for contacting the school for what I thought was a random person putting trash on my car? I'm a junior in high school, and today I left my final class of the day and came across my car covered in trash: cups stuffed under the roof rack, (dry) food on the windshield, etc. My first reaction was to think that some jerk walking past my car decided to leave it there instead of throwing the trash on the ground - you can't bring outside food/drinks into the school, and the nearest trash can is a bit of a walk away. So I decide to contact the school and tell them someone had left trash on my car, and they said that they would try and pull footage from the cameras set up near the parking lot. I then had the thought that my friends may have done it (we usually joke around with each other and our vehicles), so I call one of my friends to ask. He tells me that they did, and he gets furious at me for calling the school over ""such a harmless little joke"", and that I can't take a joke, when:  


1. I initially did not know it was them - if I had, I wouldn't have reacted in the way I did
2. I had already called off the school looking at the cameras, so they weren't in any trouble

I first took offense to that comment and I was going to walk alway from that statement because I knew that if I was gonna say something, it‚Äôd be offensive back. But I continued to write my statement and I said ‚Äú that‚Äôs why your step dad had to take the role of your bio dad!‚Äù. She later texted me on insta saying ‚Äú Don‚Äôt you dare in your stupid life talk about my dad!, you completely crossed the line‚Äù. I was in shock because we went from joking stupidly to us no longer talking or being friends. The problem is that I NEVER knew her biological dad passed away, leading to her mom remarrying. My other friends have told me that I shouldn‚Äôt have let my pride swallow me up, and that I should‚Äôve been the bigger person and I totally agree with the fact I should‚Äôve ended it right there. Part of me feels really guilty but part of me doesn‚Äôt; she‚Äôs the one that decided to insult me, so I insulted her back leading to me losing a friend that never benefited me but I must not know what she had to go through mentally.

"AITA for telling my sister I‚Äôd call the cops on her? My mom was out of the country and she let me borrow her car. My sister asked to borrow her car to go on a mini road trip. I told her it wasn't a problem and That I would need the car on two separate days for a doctor's appointment and she told me we can switch then. 

Both my mom's and my sisters cars were in need of repairs but my moms was just body while my sisters was mechanical. So she told me ""I'll leave my car with you but you just have to drop it off at the mechanic"", I told her ""okay that's fine, you just have to drop mom's car off at the mechanic's too"". We had an agreement until.. 

I asked her if she would be paying for my uber back home from her house (we live roughly 40 minutes away from each other) and she said ""no.. why would I? how were you going to get back home after dropping off mom's car?"" and I told her I was guna uber, however my mom's mechanic was 10 minutes from me, thereby being a much cheaper ride. My sister got aggressive with me and in a condescending tone started saying ""it's not MY fault you don't have a car, I don't see why *I*have to pay for YOU to get home. You WFH doing barely anything just sitting on your ass getting paid you cheap bitch"" and I told her ""I don't understand how you ask someone a favor and then treat them like that"" and she said ""it's not a favor its not \*your\* car, I asked mom and she said I could"" and I told her that I had asked my mom before her and I was still using the car so I still needed it.

She proceeds to belittle me, calling me a stupid selfish bitch, a fucking child, a ""pathetic excuse of existence"" and said ""I'm **GOING**to come pick up the car today I don't give a fuck what you say. 

I told her that her arrogance and entitlement was insane, and that if she showed up to my house the best case scenario would be me calling the cops because if I handled her myself it would be far worse. 

Back story, I'm one year younger than her, and my whole life she has been extremely verbally abusive to me and sometimes breaking my belongings. And after almost 29 years I just had enough of staying quiet and snapped. 

My mom called me and begged me to just give her the car because she's mentally unstable right now but I told my mom that if she had spoken to me nicely instead of disrespecting me I would've absolutely helped her out, she is just so prideful to actually speak to me like an adult and explain the situation. I don't think I was in the wrong but my mom somehow thinks we're both in the wrong but I never told my sister ""no"" and that I wouldn't help her, I was simply trying to compromise and if she was really that tight on money I would've just paid (p.s. every time we go to drinks and dinner I pay for her and my mom since I have a career. I bought my sister a laptop when she was struggling at school without one, I also buy her random little gifts if I know she'll like it). AITA?

Edit: the agreement and argument happened during the same conversation. Maybe I was unclear- I never left to the mechanic, we never switched cars it was one entire conversation in the same moment",0.5

"AITA For wanting a summer job instead of vacation? For context, I (16NB) don‚Äôt want to go on summer vacation with my Mom (43F) Dad (46M) and sister (18F) because I have a boyfriend I‚Äôd like to spend time with, and I want to work at a summer camp just to make some cash, and gain experience in a job or two.

My dad, who I just had a conversation with, is telling me - and i quote - ‚ÄúYou will go on vacation wether you want to or not, it is not your f****** choice and the fact that you want to get a job is irrelevant to me.‚Äù

As a child, I physically can‚Äôt do anything to oppose him, in fear of what he‚Äôd do-

My mom hasn‚Äôt even approved of this vacation and my sister doesn‚Äôt know about it.

I was going to bring up the job thing to my mom this weekend, when my dad left back for his deployment, but it seems the choice is already made for me ._.

I have no idea if I‚Äôm the AH here because I‚Äôm ruining summer for my family, or if I‚Äôm in the right here for simply wanting a temporary summer job. (Pays 12-18 an hour depending on experience)

Some more restrictions my parents have put on me thus far:

1) Not allowed to drive until your grades are up (made earlier this year, I‚Äôve had good grades all year, still don‚Äôt even have my permit)

2) Not allowed to have a job until your grades are up (Same thing)

3) Not allowed to have a birthday until your grades are up (My birthday is in 7 days, same thing)

4) Not allowed to get a tattoo until your grades are up (same thing)

5) Not allowed to see my boyfriend until my grades are up (same thing)

6) Not allowed to do anything that makes you happy until your grades are up (same thing)

If that gives you any idea about how overbearing/strict my parents are. Oh and I also don‚Äôt have a door because I had an eating disorder a few years back. So. That‚Äôs fun.

Edit: I‚Äôm sorry if I sound like I‚Äôm arguing in the comments, I‚Äôm still a tad upset about this conversation i had with me dad‚Ä¶

"AITA for telling my boyfriend that his family is manipulative? I 24 female and my boyfriend 24 male come from very different backgrounds. 

My boyfriends family is very conservative and very religious. My boyfriend practices his religion when he goes home and visits with his family but he is not religious around me or our friends. I am what I like to call a ‚Äúchreester‚Äù (goes to church on Christmas and Easter). His family goes to church 3 times a week and are very conservative in their catholic beliefs. 

His family and I get along well but but I always get the vibe that I am not good enough for him to marry as I am progressive and not active in my faith. His mom has made comments in front of me before like ""how could someone not vote for the pro life president"" and ""it makes me sad that your family is not religious"".

I just got into Law school and will be moving to a big city soon to attend. My boyfriend and I have talked about moving in but he is afraid that his family will be devastated and that it will tarnish or break their relationship.

I decided where I am going he said that he will make it work and wants to live with me but that it will be a difficult conversation with his parents.  A few nights later he was over and I brought up living in a one or two bedroom apartment and he went silent and said that he can‚Äôt move with me out of fear of ruining his relationship with his family. He told me his parents wrote him a letter stating their beliefs on moving in together before marriage and their disapproval. I told him that was very manipulative  and I could tell I hurt his feelings. 

He decided he is moving but in separate apartment. Now I am wavering in what I want.

Well the day finally came and he proposed, in the excitement of the moment I FaceTimed my 23f SIL to tell her the news, after the obligatory congratulations she immediately stated asking why I haven‚Äôt asked her to be my bridesmaid yet. I brushed it of initially but now that the excitement of the engagement has died down a little and I can‚Äôt help but be bothered by it. Prior to our engagement SIL had occasionally made comments about being my bridesmaid and even once insisting I make her my maid of honor. At that moment in time it was easy to deflect the comments because there was no ring but now that there is I‚Äôm finding it hard. 
My soon to be SIL has a habit of using people only when it‚Äôs convenient for her and has this I‚Äôm never in the wrong kind of attitude. She has often made my fianc√© (her only brother and only sibling for that matter) and I feel unimportant and like a second option. After talking to my fianc√© about my feelings he is totally supportive of my want to not have her be in the wedding.

"AITA for being pissed about weed. My boyfriend(27M)and I(30F) smoked weed during the first 2 years of our relationship. I decided to quit after that after having a really bad panic attack from an edible and now I get anxious while smoking weed. We both agreed to stop smoking around that time because we hadn‚Äôt had a long break. We both didn‚Äôt smoke for about 3 years and I still don‚Äôt smoke. Well my boyfriend started hanging out with friends that get high and play much which was no big deal. However I told him that I didn‚Äôt want him to smoke in the house for a few different reasons. I also told him that I wasn‚Äôt comfortable with him smoking often because we have other priorities. Well I caught him smoking in the house one and asked him to stop, explaining that I wasn‚Äôt comfortable with him smoking in the house behind my back. He did it a second time and I told him that I was really uncomfortable with him hiding stuff from me and that it‚Äôs making me feel like he could be hiding other things.

"AITA for giving away a stray cat that the old lady across the street liked to feed? I moved into a quadplex (4 units, one building) in December of last year. It has a small 3 foot gate that you must unlock to pass through in order to get to our units. I noticed some water bowls and a food bowl right on the inside of the gate and I figured one of my neighbors was feeding a stray cat. I didn't think much of it. At some point I met all 3 of my neighbors and they all shook their head saying they were not sure who was feeding/watering the cat and always just assumed it was someone else in the quadplex. I worried it might have been the person who lived in my place prior, so I went out there and at least filled the water bowl (don't have any cat food on hand).

A week or so after living there I notice a middle aged woman, Sandy, leaned over the gate feeding the cat. I was in a hurry so I didn't really have time to stop. Sandy did stop me to ask if I mind that she fed the cat since she saw me leaving my unit, to which I said I didn't. I wanted to ask her who she was, if she lived in our building and if not, why was she feeding the cat in our gated area. But I did not have time to talk (had to get to work) so I figured I would just catch her another day. I don't dislike cats, I used to have one but now I have two dogs and the dogs can be kind of annoying when they smell that cat is near so the cat's presence was a minor inconvenience. I asked each of the other people in the building if they knew who the woman was (I described her looks) and none of them had a clue.

So about a week ago I order some Waitr and when I answer the door it's an older lady letting me know ""my cat is so sweet"" I tell her thanks but it's a stray. She then told me her cat just died and felt a bond with that one and wanted to know if she could take it and I was like sure! So this woman picks up the cat and sticks it in her car and leaves.

A few days later, I see Sandy outside hovering around our gate and mentions to me she is concerned because the food she put out wasn't eaten. I told her I gave the cat to a woman that just lost her cat. She got upset with me saying I should have asked her first, she really cared for that cat, has been feeding her for years but couldn't bring her inside because her husband was allergic. I asked her why she didn't feed the cat by her place and her only reason was ""Well I tried but she likes your place because it is fenced in and has a porch! No one else cared that I was feeding her there and if you did you should have said something not given her away!""I just kinda looked at her, told her the woman who took the cat was some Waitr driver, so I couldn't get the cat back and that I am sorry then just walked away (didn't know what else to do). Part of me wanted to dig into the semantics, bring up my dog, say it was honestly kind of weird that she does that and I didn't bring it up before because she caught me off guard on my way to work, but idk, I just felt bad and nervous so got away from her as fast as I could. 

I didn't realize it would be that big of a deal and now I kinda feel bad. My BF thinks I shouldn't and it's weird that some random woman is leaning over our property feeding a cat and he also brought up how in our lease it says not to feed stray cats and that we could get in trouble because this woman decided to feed the cat at our place. He said if the cat was hungry enough it would go eat the food at her place and the fact that this woman is making up reasons as to why the cat ""likes our place"" is weird. Idk, still feel kind of bad though...",0.06
"AITA for telling my ex that he can't have his new girlfriend on the microphone when we play online? I am a 22 (female) and my ex is a 23 (male). We were doing a long-distance relationship for about 2 years before he decided to cheat on me with a co-worker (20-year-old female) and broke up with me this past December. Now the way we kept in touch mostly was through playing games online (on PlayStation 4) and I had created a new group chat party after a whole drama feast had happened. Now people asked me to add him, and I did because what was done was done but I had one rule.

Not to add her to the group chat, nor was she to talk in the group chat whether that was through his account or on his mic.

I felt that it was a pretty fair rule considering I was still fairly hurt from the whole ordeal. Now one day while we were playing with some of our other friends, he let her talk on the mic and a reminded him nicely about my one and only rule. And he got mad at me telling me to shut up and deal with it. Now I was hurt by this because not only was he not respecting the rule but didn't seem to care that he was hurting me in the process. Later on, I had some health issues and had to go to the ER. When I came back to online after being in the ER, I was telling one of my other online friends what happened so that they knew because they asked, that was when my Ex accused me of seeking attention and saying it was too much of a coincidence that a month after he broke up with me, I get sick and end up going to ER. Now I was born with a very weak immune system, and he has known that since the day we met.

I snapped on him and told him he was being a selfish jerk since the breakup. This was followed by him removing me from PlayStation friends and I in turn kicked him out of the group chat. He ended up messaging me a few days later at 8 in the morning say ""FU"". I said ""Go ahead. Cuss me out. Call me names. Do whatever makes you feel better,"" and with that he blocked me.

Now one of my friends said I took it to fair and should apologies and let him have his girlfriend in the group with us. I really don't what to. AITA?

Edit: I realized I forgot to say this before, but I am mad at the girl because she had already been told he was in a relationship, and she still went after him. From what I was told she goes after every guy that us in a relationship. Also, I am mad at not just the girl. I am mad at both of them. I was just not wanting to hear her voice.

"AITA for not caring that I caused someone to have a panic attack? I know the title makes it sound bad but please listen.

I (16f) was recently involved in some drama. To shorten it down, my ex-friend A (nb) was causing everyone else in my friend group to feel uncomfortable so we unanimously decided to cut them off completely. Before we did, we talked to them about everything they did that bothered everyone. We wanted to go about it in a civil way but everything was blown out of proportion.

To be honest, we could have handled it better but the way we confronted them is what caused the problem. My friend J (nb) and I texted A that we needed to talk to them. After that however, due to our class, we left the conversation untouched for about an hour or more. During that period of time, A told us they had a panic attack due to the sheer stress of not knowing what was wrong and being left alone for a long period of time. J and I initially felt bad but still continued on with the conversation.

While A was still distraught, J and I started getting messages from other friends asking us what was wrong with A. We both then found out that A was basically going around telling our other friends that J, I, and a few others were mad at them and they were panicking. All of this new drama was causing distress in other people, even going as far as to someone else having a panic attack as well because A was continually freaking out and texting them. That became the final straw for J and I, as we were already upset about how A was telling everyone our personal business but now that it was negatively affecting other people who weren't involved, we went from irritated to angry. We ended up having a fight about all of this, during which A tried to use a multitude of guilt tripping tactics but it all ended in us no longer being friends with them.

Now that all of this is over, I have found myself and other people in my friend group showing no remorse for causing A to have a panic attack, especially when during said panic attack, they made our personal drama other people's problem and even caused severe emotional distress in others. So it makes me wonder, AITA for not caring?",0.67
"AITA for telling my friend it‚Äôs her fault she is struggling financially I (f17) grew up in a very poor lifestyle. My parents were constantly in and out of prison/jail. My family had to heavily rely on food stamps and public food pantry‚Äôs in order to have a meal on the table. I had to try a lot harder in school because of the lack of resources available to me, and I got myself into my dream college. My friend (f20) grew up very differently than I did.

While growing up she had access to all different kinds of tutors and extra resources. Today we were having a conversation over financial status and she tried to say she was more poor than I was. I thought she was just joking because it‚Äôs a fact that she and her family is very well off. I pointed at that I am definitely more poor than she is, and that she shouldn‚Äôt be comparing our situations. Amy then pointed out that I have more financial aid than she did, and therefore I am wealthier than her. I told her she would be at the same place as I was if she didn‚Äôt put herself in her situation. Amy told me to elaborate and I said it‚Äôs her fault for her financial situation because she lost her scholarship due to poor academic performance (she chose to party every night) and also constantly spends her money on alcohol and drugs.

"AITA for asking my ex to pay for my STD test? Tl,dr: my ex hid an STD from me and thinks I‚Äôm an asshole for asking them to pay for a test because they lent me their car.

I (33M) went through a breakup with my girlfriend (30F) after a year. She broke up with me for being emotionally distant and for not agreeing to move in with her soon. The reason for my emotional distance is this:

At first, we had sex every day and she insisted that I don‚Äôt need a condom ‚Äòcause she has an IUD. I never do that, but we dated seriously, she‚Äôs a nurse, and we have mutual friends, so I let my guard down and didn‚Äôt wear protection. After 3 months of dating (after having sex the night before/morning of) she revealed that she‚Äôs known for a year she has herpes. She didn‚Äôt tell me ‚Äòcause she was scared, and she justified the decision because she takes suppressors daily.

To be clear I AM NOT STIGMATIZING STDS! If she told me, I would‚Äôve worn a condom and thought nothing of it. But I never would‚Äôve consented to unprotected sex with her had she disclosed.

Now that we‚Äôre separated, I‚Äôm not comfortable having sex with anyone knowing how exposed I was, but I have no symptoms so I‚Äôm going to get a blood test soon. During the relationship she promised to pay for the test. 
The other day, she asked me to clear something out of her garage I forgot I left there. When I was done, I told her about the test and she asked what that has to do with her. I said I was expecting her to pay for it like she agreed. 

Immediately, she put on this shit-eating grin and said, ‚ÄúYeeeeaah I won‚Äôt be doing that!‚Äù She slammed her door in my face, yelled at me to get off her porch, and called me petty. 

Some context to be fair to her‚Äî‚Äîshe was very generous and let me use her car ‚Äòcause mine broke down. I never asked for it, but she offered and I accepted. She even insisted I don‚Äôt fill up the tank, although I‚Äôd refill what I used. The last time I borrowed her car I returned it empty because I planned to fill it up at a cheaper station near her place but she broke up with me before we got there (she used the empty tank against me during the breakup which I thought was needlessly cruel). she now says she doesn‚Äôt owe me anything.

I texted/emailed her a few hours after the confrontation and said that I don‚Äôt care about the money, but I would like her just to try and help in some way to help me feel closure from this mess, but she never responded. But not for nothing, I‚Äôm going to be seeing a therapist to heal my trust issues and anxiety I‚Äôve built up from this, and that cost far surpasses the highest estimate of what I saved by using her car. 

So, am I the asshole for asking her to pay for the test? 
Also, WIBTA for telling our mutual friend what happened? It feels petty and vengeful, but hypothetically let‚Äôs say my friend ‚ÄúDillon‚Äù was having unprotected sex with my friend ‚ÄúSarah‚Äù without disclosing that he has herpes, I‚Äôd want to know so that I don‚Äôt recommend Dillon to any of my friends ever again.

Edit: I will not be telling out mutual friend what happened, I would be the asshole for that.

Edit 2: a clarifications‚Äî‚Äîthe plan has always been to get tested no matter what, regardless of whether or not she pays for it.",0.17

"AITA for implying that my old classmate will never be loved? A few days ago, my old high school classmates and I had sort of a get together. It has been about 8 years since I've seen them and it was actually pretty great to catch up with them. We went to a restaurant and while we were eating, we started talking about romantic partners. There was this guy, let's call him John, in the group. We were classmates but we never really talked and I don't know him well other than his name. But he is good friends with a close friend of mine. When someone asked John about his dating life, he sort of scoffed and said something along the lines of, ""Women only date to get there boyfriend's money. They use guys who have worked hard and give nothing in return. I don't want to give them a second of my time"". I'm paraphrasing because I don't remember exactly what he said, but this was the essence. 

I heard this, did not like it and said something along the lines of, ""Most men who think that way have terrible personalities. Women who do not absolutely NEED rich men to survive will never give men like these a moment of their life. People like this will never have anyone love them if they don't stop thinking of their potential partner this way."" 

Some of my friends laughed. But John became really quite and left after some time later. Later that night I got a text my from friend, who is also John's friend. He said that I was way too unkind towards John. He told me that John was just sharing his personal experience and I made a personal attack. According to him, John believes that I said no one will ever love him. He was very hurt and angry because of it. My friend let me know of how John's parents pretty much abandoned him and how never being loved was one of his worst fears. Basically, I unknowingly threw his worst insecurity in his face in front of a bunch of people. My friend also told me that I should have calmly explained why I didnt agree with John, instead of insulting him. 

The more I think about it, the worse I feel about what I said. I think everyone deserves love and I do not like poking at people's insecurities. But my actions seem to oppose my beliefs. I'm thinking of texting John and apologizing. But I'm still very uncomfortable with what he said. I need an objective audience. What do you think? AITA?",0.02

"AITA for asking to use the washing machine I'm a university student who visited out of town for st Patrick's parties this week. My friend's sister (I'll call her FS, she's 23) drove my friend and me to her house so we had a place to sleep and get ready. Halfway through the day of street parties, we went back to her sister's house to get ready to go out again. Shoes and pants were caked in mud (not leaving footprints) so I asked if I could use FS's washing machine to which my friend replied yes. I also asked FS if I could use the washing machine (please and thanks you included) and she said yes. I didn't want to bother her so I asked where the washing machine was and she showed me. She noted how there was dirt that could be washed off so I asked to use the kitchen or bathroom sink to wash them, and she said yes ""I'll just bleach it after"". That's all the communication we had. I had also brought no change of pants or shoes and wasn't offered any to borrow (even though my friend and I are the same sizes.)

Fast forward to the next day and my friend tells me FS feels like I was disrespectful for washing my shoes in the kitchen sink even though when I asked she said yes. I told her I was confused and she told me that's just how FS acts. I wasn't warned about this before, and I'm the kind of person who's been known to not be able to ""read between the lines"". I've been raised to be very polite and I always show my gratefulness towards the host, so I'm really struggling to see where I may have gone wrong. 

The whole situation is sorta awkward. I wasn't even shown around the apartment or offered refreshments, shown where the bathroom is, etc. Even my conversations with FS seemed very surface level and one-sided, but overall I don't see where I could've gone wrong.",0.08

I am well aware of my voice tone, that's why I try to keep silent. But I still struggle to maintain the same tone for a long period of time.

Everyone on the bus proceeded to tell me to stop talking and let them sleep for 6 godforsaken minutes.

It just think that if you didn't sleep enough the night before because you're checking your phone until late you don't really have the right to tell me to shut up. Moreover, if you have an important exam such as mine coming later in the morning I am almost certain you'd be studying too, not sleeping.

All in all, everyone, including my parents, said I was a jerk for being somewhat loud, although the friend who was revising with me, whose voice is really soft and who didn't get insulted, said I wasn't at fault.

"AITA Upset housemates Earlier today I went outside for a smoke and left the door open for a bit, at some point the cat who belongs to our neighbour but comes round to say hi got in the house.
Once I was finished pottering about the house I locked the door and went upstairs. I haven't seen the cat come in.


My housemates had all gone out for a drink, when they returned they saw that the cat had been locked in the kitchen/living room. This incensed one of the housemates who banged around my door calling me every name under the sun. I had an argument with her and claimed to have not opened the door.

After the exchange I realized I was mistaken and probably did lock the cat in I owned up to it on the WhatsApp group and said I'll forget about our exchange but her behaviour was unacceptable.

I doubt the other housemates are quite as angry as her but still upset with me, have my actions been so abhorrent?",0.83
"AITA for stopping while taking my bf to the pharmacy? 
My (22f) boyfriend (24m) has been complaining about back pain for a week now, but hasn‚Äôt gotten it looked at. He‚Äôs in the Army, so he has the opportunity to go to sick call and get help with whatever he needs.

Today while we were getting lunch, he said his back felt worse, so I forced him to let me take him to the hospital. I drove him across town then waited an hour and a half or so for him to be seen.

While I waited, I started feeling a little upset that I had to force him to take care of something he should‚Äôve done already. This has been a recurring issue. He doesn‚Äôt do something he should, then I go out of my way to help him, or fix it myself. Just last weekend, he expected me to drop what I was doing (spending time with my mom, who had driven six hours to see me) to drive halfway across town because he didn‚Äôt do what he should‚Äôve.

Ultimately, though, I knew he couldn‚Äôt know his back would get worse, and I let it go. I didn‚Äôt want to start an argument and not enjoy the rest of my day.

When he did come back out, he said he‚Äôd been given muscle relaxer and a prescription for more muscle relaxers and painkillers. I offered to go get the car and pick him up at the entrance, because it was a bit of a far walk. He insisted he was fine, and he walked with me.

Since he seemed to be alright, I said I wanted to stop at the commissary that was across the street to grab something. I told him to relax in the car and lay back with the seat heater on, which he did. He didn‚Äôt mind, and even asked me to get him a drink. Then, on the way to the pharmacy, I said I wanted to stop in to a specialty shop that was on the way and see if they had restocked some buns I wanted. Altogether, the two stops probably added 15 minutes to the trek.

We went straight to the pharmacy after that. While we were waiting, he made some off-handed comment about how we could‚Äôve already been home if I hadn‚Äôt stopped to pick that stuff up. When I asked if he was joking or if he was seriously mad, he said it did irritate him that I stopped. I got a bit upset at that, because it made me feel like he didn‚Äôt appreciate that I‚Äôd driven him and waited without complaint. Not to mention that I‚Äôd bought him stuff he wanted, too.

He walked off while waiting for his meds. Instead of finding him, I texted him that I was going to sit in the car. After about 15 minutes, I sent another message to tell him that I‚Äôd pick him up at the door when he was ready. I heard his phone vibrate in the car, so I realized he hadn‚Äôt gotten my message.

I was grabbing his phone to go back into the pharmacy when he appeared at the car door, obviously pissed. I tried to explain that I hadn‚Äôt known his phone was in the car, and he cut me off. He said he didn‚Äôt want to hear it. When I tried apologizing, he interrupted, so I gave up.

AITA?

Edit! He was the one who mentioned going to the hospital first. I just didn‚Äôt let him back out of going.",0.04

"AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend for vaping? I'll try to keep this short and this is a throwaway account. My (25M) girlfriend (24F) is pregnant. She vapes a lot to which I think is bad but I don't say anything because she will get upset. I just care about her health. When she got pregnant I thought her vaping would stop for a bit. It wasn't until I came home and saw her vaping that I realized she never stopped. I exploded. I asked ""what the fuck are you dong?"" she looked at me and shrugged and basically said there's nothing wrong with it and that she doesn't vape with nicotine so it's fine. 

Instantly I went to google and I saw that vaping while pregnant is still bad because of the chemicals. I told her she needs to stop and she told me I can't tell her what to do. I was so upset that I just left and went to a friend's house. I feel bad because I just left her there suddenly, however I couldn't believe she would keep vaping while pregnant. who knows how that will affect the baby? 

Some of our friends told me I'm the asshole because I just left my pregnant girlfriend home alone, but my mom says I did the right thing to distance myself. If something is wrong with our child when they come out I don't know if i can forgive her. Of course I'll still love our child. 

I'm not sure. I know smoking cigarettes while pregnant is bad but maybe vaping is ok? I don't know. Everyone is telling me something different and I just don't know anymore. At this point i'm planning on going to ask a doctor. But even if I did and they said vaping is bad I don't think she'll  listen to me.

"AITA for hesitating to give my consent for my sister to publish a romance novel based on my parent's love story? My (21F) father died when I was a teenager and my mother died 2 years ago, they met in freshman year of high school but did not start dating until junior year because my dad was my mom's best friend's brother. I won't go into too much detail because this post would be a mile long but long story short they slept together at a party and everything after that is history, their love story reads like a romance book and for that reason, my sister (20F) decided to turn it into one. When my mother was dying in the hospital my sister asked for her blessing to write the biography, my mother, being who she was, said yes without any hesitation, she died a few weeks later. My sister never went into too much detail about what exactly she asked our mother for permission to write, I don't know if she ever disclosed the erotica or any of the very personal and private details in the book. 

It is important to note that my mother and father were both very popular people, my father inherited a large company from his father, and my mother was in her teens and early twenties. They weren't nobodys who would only be remembered by this book, people knew their names.

I didn't find out about it until pretty recently when my sister mentioned it in passing, I didn't think much of it at the time but when she gave me a copy of it to read after she got it back from the editor, it was probably the most beautiful piece of writing that I had ever seen. It captured their love from a narrator's perspective and it was all completely real, with no exaggeration or added events for dramatic effect, the only creative license my sister took was to add some minor inconsequential dialogue and to put what my mother described into a third-person perspective. Apparently, she interviewed some of their friends from high school, including my aunt (my dad's sister and my mother's best friend), and with my mother's permission she read what was in my mother's journals that she has kept religiously her entire life, she dug deep into their lives and pulled every skeleton out of their closets, yet somehow still portraying them both in a very positive light. So far you are probably wondering why I'm even here asking for advice, it all sounds pretty amazing, right? Well, the one thing that is making me hesitate to give her permission is the fact that, like most romance novels out there, the book contains some pretty graphic sex scenes, all based on real facts from my mother's journals.

She also wrote about a cocaine-induced miscarriage that my mother suffered in high school, she wasn't an addict and just used occasionally with my father, nor was she aware she was pregnant at the time. My parents were always very sex-positive people, so I have never been in some strange form of denial about the fact my parents had sex, but I also don't know if I want the entire world to know my parent's bedroom likes and dislikes, any specific encounters that happened between them, or the mistake that my mother made that caused her to lose a pregnancy. My sister wants my permission for her own peace of mind, she doesn't want to publish a book that mentions my parents, and briefly me without me giving the ok. 

Am I the asshole for hesitating to sign off?

&#x200B;

Edit: It has been made clear that I am in fact the asshole, and I am starting to agree with you guys, I have already sent my sister a message giving her my permission to go forward with the novel, I am now going to seek advice on another community on how to lose my personal reservations so I can support the novel wholeheartedly.

"AITA for drinking coke with my whisky? So my boyfriend bought me a beautiful bottle of whisky for our anniversary. It cost around ¬£70. 

I have been waiting to open it for a special occasion so I opened it tonight as we both had a free evening! We both had a measure each in a small glass and it was really nice. Really smooth in comparison to a lot of whiskies I have had. I had one drink so decided to pour some Diet Coke into it. 

My boyfriend feels insulted because he‚Äôs spent money on this whisky for me and it is very expensive. He thinks he could have got me whisky for cheap to put with coke. I understand but I also feel that whisky and coke is a common drink and I will do drink it without, it is a genuinely lovely whisky. 

I think I might be the asshole because I didn‚Äôt treat the whisky as an expensive one, however I can see why people would drink coke with it. 

Am I the asshole?


EDIT: thank you very much for all the comments! Should have made it clear that I absolutely agree that it‚Äôs like putting ketchup on a ¬£200 steak (great analogy from someone below).

"AITA for telling my neighbors to get f**ked? Been neighbors for 9 years. My wife and I are their adult children‚Äôs age, and they were retirement age at the time. They are now in their 70‚Äôs, and being retired, they have ALL DAY to focus on tons of little things while we live a normal life. 

The husband has always been a ‚ÄúMale Karen‚Äù and loves to provide unsolicited comments on what ‚ÄúI should be doing.‚Äù

I just rolled with it over the years and ignored him, but things started to change after our dog died about 2 years ago, and we had eventually got a new dog. His immediate comment when we put up a fence was ‚ÄúThat dog better not bark‚Äù, and this should‚Äôve been a sign that things were going to sour. 

I‚Äôd like to make it clear that our dog is never allowed outside alone and we have enough common decency to not allow our dog to be barking all day or night. 

One day after work, my wife said that male Karen had cornered her stating that our dog was barking profusely and bothering them. My wife was distressed saying he was aggressive with her, but I thought she was embellishing a little given my past interactions with him. 

A month passed and he approaches me aggressively one day stating that the dog is barking incessantly all day long and ‚Äúwaking up his wife‚Äù and that ‚Äúyou‚Äôre leaving her unattended outside for hours‚Äù. He even pointed his finger in my face.

I did not back down and called him out on his nonsense. I reminded him that we are home all day long and that anytime the dog is outside that someone is with her‚Ä¶.and that she is NEVER left outside late at night so he is outright lying to my face.

I got so mad that I just walked away back inside. From that moment, my family has basically done everything in our power to ignore them. I asked other neighbors if my dog was bothering them, and none said that they ever heard her bark at all.

Today I was in the backyard with my son. Both male Karen and his wife decided to approach me to talk to me about the situation across the fence. I made it 100% clear that I was not interested in talking due to the past interaction. I turned my back to them and just went back to my business. 

They continued pushing the subject as if suddenly nothing was wrong and they wanted to make amends. I don‚Äôt want to speak with them at all and was trying to take the high road them but they kept poking me in front of my son. 

I literally exploded! I was so frustrated between how he treated us before, along with years of random BS. I was yelling at the top of my lungs and left zero doubt that a line is drawn in the sand. I gave them aüñïand verbatim said ‚Äúget f**ked and don‚Äôt ever talk to my family again.‚Äù We immediately went inside to get away from the altercation. 

I acted this way because they had pushed me past the point of no return and started a confrontation in front of my child, & I wont pretend that everything is OK when it clearly isn‚Äôt.

"AITA for telling my sister I would want a raise or I am suing my employer? I know this title sounds confusing and completely entitled, so please hear me out. And if this story seems to crazy to be true, welcome to my life‚Ä¶

I‚Äôve been working for the same small retail place for the past 6 years while in high school and college. I made my way up to manager. My younger sister started working there a few years ago. She is now also a manager. A few months ago my sister broke up with her boyfriend (also a manager, gotta love it‚Ä¶) out of the blue and moved out of our house. We really didn‚Äôt know where she was. Turns out she‚Äôs been shacking up with our boss twice her age. This has caused so much tension it deserves a post on its own, but that‚Äôs another story. 

Basically every year the managers get a dollar raise to compensate for our state‚Äôs minimum wage going up every year (basically so the managers don‚Äôt make the same as the new kids). Well this year my raise was only $.50. I told my sister I was going to ask for the other half (obviously from her boyfriend, the owner). She then chuckled and said ‚Äúyou think he has the money to pay you that?‚Äù It was insulting, degrading, and quite frankly, a fucking lie. I told her that if I didn‚Äôt then I would have to try and retrieve the thousands they illegally (I‚Äôve checked with attorneys) underpaid me as per our union contract. She flipped out and basically said ‚Äúyou better not sue my boyfriend‚Äù.

"AITA For telling my brother to look into adoption? My \[23m\] younger brother ‚ÄòJim‚Äô and his girlfriend ‚ÄòLiz‚Äô had a baby in January. It was not a planned pregnancy and neither of them were properly prepared. Both sets of parents encouraged them to look into adoption throughout the pregnancy, but they were unwilling to. My parents, youngest siblings and stepsiblings are no longer in contact with them. 

Since the baby was born, everyone has been tired, stressed and miserable. Both are in school and my brother has a part-time job, so Liz‚Äôs stepmother, Jean,  spends most time with the baby, and she is clearly burnt-out, having to care for her own daughter as well. Jim and Liz do not seem well-equipped parents and are unwilling to accept advice and Jean seems concerned that the baby‚Äôs suffering because of it. 

According to Jim, Jean has been approaching the possibility of an open adoption with them. Jim and Liz have not responded well to the idea. Jim complained about her ‚Äòaudacity‚Äô every night he came home. After the ninth day of this, I told Jim maybe he should hear her out and that an open adoption would be best for everybody. I encouraged him to research it, even if just to get Jean to stop talking about it, but Jim blew up in my face. He told me I clearly hated him and my nephew and stormed out, not returning home since. He is now staying at a friend‚Äôs. My sister \[21f\] sided with him, saying I crossed a line, but she is away at university and has not seen the mental toll this has had on everyone.

"AITA for ignoring and not talking to my father-in-law when he came over for lunch? Don‚Äôt want to make this too long. I have been dating my fianc√© for about 4 years . We are an interracial couple and we‚Äôve had some issues dealing with family. My parents, because my fianc√© was not Nigerian, weren‚Äôt happy and they told me his family wouldn‚Äôt accept me because I wasn‚Äôt white. My parents finally came around and his parents seemed to like me throughout the relationship . When my fianc√© said he wanted to marry me , suddenly a huge list of issues came up. I was black and that would impact our children in the future, that I had student debt, and they were concerned that I could pass my depression onto a child. Once I found that out, I was shocked and furious as well as hurt. It took a toll on our relationship for a year and affected the time frame in which we were supposed to get engaged. I finally lost it under stress and seeing my fianc√© breakdown over the past month and I wrote them a pretty nasty letter. I called them out on their racism, on their coldness, and how they had no room to throw stones when they aren‚Äôt perfect.

"WIBTA for sell the belongings that have been gifted to me by my parents and giving the money back to them? Recently, I've come to a realization. I'm 19 and a half, a freshmen in college, and I've never once worked a job. Over the years, I've never done anything for my parents beyond some simple chores, and yet, I've never hesitated to ask my parents for things, even expensive things. My parents have never been very well off financially, but they both work their asses off and they've always provided for me not only the necessities, but also any requests I might've made, whether it be a stop at McDonalds or the latest video game console. I've finally realized that I'm nothing more than a mooch, a massive, lazy thief, and I owe my parents the world.

I've already lined up several jobs interviews and hope to be self sufficient and out of the house soon, but until then, I can't shake this relentless, gnawing feeling that I need to pay my parents back now, as quickly as possible. I just can't stand the thought of owing them anything. This feeling is the worst when I'm actively using the items they've purchased for me, and I don't even like the idea of eating food they've prepared for me. I don't care that they're my parents, I don't care that they want to provide for me, I don't care if it makes them happy to buy things for me. I know people the same age as me who have multiple jobs, own a home, are married, and don't receive a penny from their parents. I know people who have been providing for themselves since their early teens, people who haven't been swaddled and babied their entire life. I want to sell everything I ""own"" and give it all back to my parents, starting anew with the money I've truly earned myself, not stole from my hardworking parents.

Unfortunately, my parents won't even accept the small amount of money I've been saving. They won't take anything from me, and get furious if I even suggest selling something. They've even turned things around and said I'm doing this to make them mad and to hurt them. I have absolutely zero ulterior motives and making them mad is the exact opposite goal I have, but simply accepting what they've given me when I didn't work for any of it is not an option. The majority of things they've bought me are pointless, unproductive pieces of technology that have only contributed to how lazy I've been in the past. If they continue to refuse, I can easily sell it all behind their backs or save up money equal to what they've given to me and find a way to deliver it to them in a way they can't refuse. I can see how this all would make me an asshole, but if I have to be an asshole to pay back what I'm due, I can accept that.",0.6
"WIBTA if I told my siblings about our dad's life-theatening diagnosis? In December 2021, my dad reluctantly told all five of his children that there was a tumor found in/around his pancreas. His health had been declining for a couple years prior to him finally getting an ultrasound. 
He moved in with my husband and me in January to be closer to his doctors, and got a biopsy this last Monday. I took him to this appointment, so I was in the recovery room when the doctor came in and said the tumor was cancerous, and wrapped around [the duct? I kind of mentally checked out at ""cancer""].

My dad doesn't want anyone to worry about him, ever. He doesnt like being the center of attention. He's always been a shy, passive, wallflower. 
I'm sure he was upset that the doctor informed him about the cancer while I was there. I don't think he would ever tell a soul, otherwise. He told me he'd send an email to my aunts and uncles, but he hasn't yet. 

Would I be the asshole if I told my siblings? I don't want the truth to come out too late. I don't want them to resent me for keeping it from them.

"AITA for constantly asking my mom if my applications look okay? I'm really risking sounding like an idiot but here goes.

I, (19 FTM), have been thinking about getting a second job lately and recently filled out an application for a place nearby. Filling out applications kind of stresses me out and I constantly overthink everything I write down in fear I wrote something wrong. So whenever I finish one I ask my mom (F 50) to look it over to make sure everything is correct. 

Today when I finished the application up I asked her to check over it and she was clearly annoyed. She told me it's annoying having to answer the same questions I give her over and over when I've done this kind of thing before. I know it must get annoying, but I'm incredibly slow and it takes awhile for something to stick in my head, so I just want to make sure I didn't forget something and screw up. I'm still learning how to be an adult and I'm just scared of making a fool out of myself.

"AITA for getting upset with my parents for offering alternatives to my dream college? So ive wanted to go to ASU since i was really little. Now that im 18 and graduating high school in a couple months, ive started looking into colleges, mostly at ASU. 

Its not a college my familys unfamiliar with; my father went there, as did two of my older siblings. We call ourselves a Sun Devil Family and wear the label proudly. 

Today, my parents and i got to tour the Polytechnic campus, where i plan on going. We were shown classes, facilities, clubs, housing, etc. I was beyond excited on the drive home to finally send on my application. However my parents had to kill the mood with their counteroffers. 

My mum works part time at a trade school, and she tells me when she finishes her training and starts working fulltime id be able to attend for little to no cost. My dad told me i should attend a community college for the first few years, to get basic classes done and build credits then attend ASU. 

This made me upset for varying reasons. For 1, ASU is again my dream school. 2, the trade school would severely limit potential employment, as the school can teach me to become just a machinist, whereas ASU i can study engineering as a whole, choose a path i like, graduate and have a wider path for careers. Lastly, with the community college it would mean im either at home, or very close to home. I dont have the best relationship with my parents, and have gone to therapy to deal with mental issues theyve caused me. I cant stay home, i need to move out away from them. 

My parents werent happy with my attitude towards their offers, saying i should accept the chance for lower student debt as money is tight. I understand why they dont want me accumulating so much student debt and theyre trying to look out for me, but i cant help it comes at the cost of my future employment wise and mental health wise. 

So, AITA for being upset with my parents counters to me attending ASU?

AITA for getting mad at my friends for telling others my crush when I told them not to?

A few months ago I told my friend (we‚Äôll call them daisy) I found a boy cute. A few days later I asked daisy if they knew the persons snap, they said no. But then daisy found his snap out a few days later and gave it to me, it was obvious I liked him at this point, so I told daisy to keep quiet about it. 


A few weeks pass and whenever he passes the halls daisy would tease me about him, but then my other friend (we will call them rose) found out because of how loud the teasing was.

I thought, no big deal- it‚Äôs just 1 more person. And rose was someone I thought I could trust so I gave daisy a warning and let it slip.

Later that day I believe, my OTHER friend (we‚Äôll call jade) found out because of loud teasing and rose telling them. I thought again, fine. 1 more person. I think I can trust them, so I gave a warning and let it slip because I don‚Äôt like being mad at people.

A few weeks later, more friends starting finding out because of loud and obvious teasing and I reached my limit. I told them to stop and they where more quiet with it atleast.

A few weeks or months I believe, I found out that some people I didn‚Äôt tell found out about my crush. And then soon, one by one, my entire ‚Äúfriend group‚Äù found out. Then people out of my friend group, and it kept growing and growing and growing. I asked some of the people who knew where they heard it from and most said literally MY FRIENDS. who I trusted with this info.

The only actual person I did tell was my close friend ‚ÄúRuby‚Äù . So just imagine. Really only telling 1 person, to have everyone find out.

I was fucking angry. I told my friends who I heard where saying this, and they denied it. Even thought what‚Äôs crazy is that everyone is saying they heard it from them. Now my friend daisy, (do you remember them?) has a record for lying. So obviously I was really suspicious of them. 

I also found out my friend rose was telling people too, and another one of my friends. People who I didn‚Äôt even imagine finding out, and people who I didn‚Äôt even imagine telling others have been telling others. 

And these friends are mad at me.. they literally think I‚Äôm crazy. 

Fast forward now, (yes this is a recent situation) I‚Äôm still in that predicament. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I desperately need advice.

I was stunned and said so they lost their parents who named them and you are getting rid of their names, do they even know this is the plan? They aren't infants, they know their names, and you can't just rip someone's identity away like that.

PW was defensive and said that they'd allow them to keep their middle names and that they'd fit in better in America with those names. 

I was too pissed to say anything else and my mom broke the awkward silence by excusing us to the restroom. I was then chided for being rude and that what I said was uncalled for. A few days later I was spending time with my dad and he brings up that mom shared what had happened and that I shouldn't have said anything as they are saving the kids.

Adoption is wonderful and I get if you have a newborn choosing their names but to take three children who knew their parents, that they'd died, and then change the names they'd given to me is awful.

"AITAH for expecting my husband‚Äôs truck to be a shared resource This is a throwaway account

I (F31) have been with my husband (M31) for 10 years. We‚Äôve lived together for most of that time, and have a child and a dog together. 

This particular issue started a few months ago when he bought a new truck. The night before he had to pick it up (~1 hour drive) I asked him to take the dog out to go to the bathroom. He refused, saying the dog is *mine* and therefore my responsibility, not his. Technically the dog is an ESA for me, and when we got her we agreed that I would do the majority of the care for her. This has held true and this was the 1st time in over 2 weeks I had asked him to do ANY of the caretaking for her. I told him that if he couldn‚Äôt do something as simple as take the dog out to go potty ‚Äúfor me‚Äù I wouldn‚Äôt be spending my day off driving him up to get his truck. The next morning he asked me to drive him, and I told him no reminding him of our argument the night before. He ended up Ubering there, which cost $100+. 

A few weeks ago, I asked for his help picking up a mattress as ‚Äúmy‚Äù vehicle is a small car. He refused, unless I contribute $70 a month towards his truck payment. His reasoning was that A) since I‚Äôm ‚Äúbenefiting‚Äù from the truck I should be helping to pay for it and B) I didn‚Äôt drive him to pick up the truck so he doesn‚Äôt want to use it to ‚Äúhelp‚Äù me. We had a pretty big fight about this, and I argued that as his wife I should have access to his resources (obviously within reason) without having to contribute to that specific resource financially. I eventually apologized for not taking him to pick up the truck and he agreed that he would help me with things like this in the future. 

A few days later he helped me deliver a desk I was selling about 5 minutes away. After the fact, he asked for half of the money I had earned from selling the desk. I refused, because ~again~ I feel that his truck is a shared resource and he‚Äôs my husband, not a contracted delivery driver. He seemed annoyed by this but didn‚Äôt push it. 

Today, I asked for his help picking up a pullout couch for our guest room. He said no. When I asked him why he said ‚Äúbecause I don‚Äôt like to help you‚Äù. He then further explained, ‚Äúyou won‚Äôt pay for part of the truck payment and you didn‚Äôt give me some of the money from your desk, so I don‚Äôt really want to use MY truck to help YOU.‚Äù I just said, ‚ÄúOk‚Äù and walked away. 

I‚Äôm really confused and unsure here. I mean obviously I feel like it‚Äôs fair that he would use *his* truck to help me every once in a while, just like I use *my* resources to help him when I can. To me that‚Äôs part of being in a committed relationship with someone, and how our relationship has operated up until this ongoing issue with the truck. But AITAH for not paying part of the truck payment? For context he had planned to pay the whole payment himself until he, and I quote, ‚Äúrealized (I) would benefit from it so much‚Äù and that seemed ‚Äúunfair‚Äù to him.",0.8
"AITA for not letting my mom use my laptop? My mom just came home and asked to borrow my laptop to make a Google spreadsheet for her small business she started a few years ago (She has like 4 spreadsheets she can use, so why??). Anyways, i thought about it for a second and came up with the excuse ""I don't know where it is, you keep putting my stuff in my room in weird places and I can't find it."" If I leave, say a dog leash, on the table, she'll put it on the floor under my piano/keyboard, on top if one of my fish tanks, etc. I also actually can not find the charger and I bet it's dead.

Another thing is she's not that tech savvy and had ruined a past laptop of mine and didn't care. She's almost they type to believe that ""you're the millionth viewer, free phone!"", almost.

"AITA for keeping luxury items that my ex, who is still my friend, gifted me? My (24f) boyfriend (25m) of 1 year and I are moving into a place of our own. It‚Äôs been a great relationship and we‚Äôve maintained pretty open communication about a lot of things and great at talking things through when we disagree. 

While I was packing, he noticed a couple of my purses were luxury brands (Prada and Hermes) and he asked where I got those. I said that they were from ‚ÄúJake‚Äù when we used to date. My boyfriend knows Jake because we are friends and knows that he is my ex from 2 years ago and that we dated for 3 years. I didn‚Äôt think it was a big deal to keep the gifts because they‚Äôre just items and they‚Äôre pretty expensive. I can‚Äôt afford those things for myself so why not?

My boyfriend got pretty upset at this. He brought up that at first he thought it was ok that I still wear the Blundstone boots Jake gifted me years ago when we were still dating because they are nice boots, but seeing all the other gifts still in my possession made him feel ‚Äúiffy‚Äù about my friendship with my ex. He said that seeing the bags, shoes, and clothes that I still have from a previous relationship and knowing that I‚Äôm still good friends with Jake made him feel insecure. He also said he‚Äôd feel bad feeling that way because he felt like he‚Äôd be forcing me to lose a friend if he said something about it. 

I tried to reassure him that Jake is just my friend now and we respect each other‚Äôs boundaries. But personally, I don‚Äôt see what the big deal is with me keeping these items and staying good friends with my ex. Jake and I have lots of things in common like running and photography so we hang out to do those things, which my boyfriend said he was ok with. But now, it seems like seeing all the items that I still have brought up insecurities in my boyfriend. 

I told him that I don‚Äôt know what else I can do or say to him to make him believe that there‚Äôs nothing else going on between Jake and I, and that me keeping the luxury items doesn‚Äôt mean anything else other than having some nice things in my closet. I told my boyfriend that I felt like he was being pretty controlling and making me feel bad for having friends. AITA?

EDIT: just to clarify, my boyfriend has a steady high income and he did offer to replace the items, but I told him that he didn‚Äôt need to because they are expensive and that we should save money so we can go on vacations and stuff. He did not tell
Me to get rid of anything. His concern is the sentimental value of keeping gifts from a past relationship and staying close friends with exes.",0.02
"AITA for asking my friend‚Äôs friend for rent? During college, I (20F) lived in an apartment with an older friend (22F). My friend (Ivy) asked me my plans for the summer one night and I was planning on spending most of June at my parent‚Äôs. She told me that her friend (Amy) was looking for a place to stay over the summer because she was an RA. Ivy told me that it would only be during the time I was planning to be gone because Amy was going to move in with her boyfriend sometime in July. I had met Amy a few times when she was at the apt throughout the school year, but we weren‚Äôt close by any means. I asked Ivy if she thought Amy would cover the June rent or at least split it with me since we‚Äôre all broke college students, she said she would ask her, but she thought yes. I texted Amy to ask if we could chat about her staying in my room and lay down some rules/the terms of her staying. Amy said yes and that she was so thankful, and she would let me know when she had some time to meet up. Unfortunately, she was too busy to meet in person or even have a phone call. I told Ivy that I wasn‚Äôt sure if I wanted to let Amy stay there anymore, but she reassured me and told me to leave my keys with her and she would talk to Amy. I did and I left the next morning.

Over the next month Amy would send me messages about staying in my room or send me pictures of her in my room (one of the pictures had her boyfriend‚Äôs dog on my bed which grossed me out). Then July rolled around, and I was planning on coming back for a 4th of July party and I was going to need to get into my room, so I texted Amy to let her know and find out how much longer she was going to stay. Turns out she left July 1st and Ivy had the keys. I told her that we could figure out the rent for June later and she didn‚Äôt respond. A few days later, I was sitting with Ivy and asked for some advice on how to go about asking Amy for rent because it‚Äôs an awkward topic for me and her response was that Amy was having a hard time with money atm because her parents were going to cut her off for moving in with her boyfriend, so Ivy said I can ask Amy for rent, but she doesn‚Äôt know if she can pay me. I worked on a text asking for rent and told Amy that I would prefer to talk about this person. Next thing I know Ivy‚Äôs phone dings and she‚Äôs like ‚Äúoh Amy texted me‚Äù and then she got quiet and went to her room. A bit later I get a response from Amy saying that she was not aware of needing to pay any rent, that she thought I was doing this because I wasn‚Äôt going to be in town, and that she cannot give me any rent due to everything going on in her life right now which she thought I was aware of, but she does appreciate my kindness and will get me a gift. I tried to call her right after I got her text, and it went straight to voicemail. I decided to respond to the text message by bringing up everything prior to her moving into my room.

"AITA for ‚Äúabandoning‚Äù my sister at a family function, causing for her to be ‚Äúinsulted and harassed‚Äù by our extended family? My[26M] sister[24F] and I are fairly close and since we work in the same city we often meet once or twice a week. We both had to fly back to our hometown for a family function that happened over the past weekend. Over the last couple family functions, our extended family has commented on my sister being taller than me(she‚Äôs 5‚Äô10 and I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8). My sister usually is with me and stands next to me at these family functions since she doesn‚Äôt want to be approached by our extended family, and our parents are usually busy with setting up or cooking stuff, so she talks with me instead(I also dislike our extended family, they are really fucking fixated on appearances and other superficial shit). I wanted to avoid comments on my height so this time I asked my sister if she could not stand or be with me at the family function, and she said ‚Äúsure I guess‚Äù. 

For me, I had some fun at the family function since all I did really was shoot some hoops in our parents backyard. After the family function, and after everybody left, my sister came up to me, in fucking tears, and told me I abandoned her and left her to be ‚Äúinsulted and harassed ‚Äúby our aunt and cousin.

"AITA for saying we should share the new car? My husband and I Are having a lighthearted argument and he told me we should post here. Throwaway for the post!

Until recently my husband and I owned two similar cars (car A/ car B). He drove car A, a 2010 which was slightly nicer with heated seats, Xm radio, and more foot room. I had car B which was a 2014 but with less bells and whistles. We never had to pay for the cars because they were both gifts from my parents. 

This week Car A died and we are getting a new car together. It's our first car bought together and we don't know how to share it. We already own a home and have a kid so this is not high stakes. 

My argument: we should share the car. Because of the way our driveway is set up and our work schedules it would be very easy to just take whatever car is out front and we would each get New Car and Car B about the same amount of time. I think we should share it because we are both making cutbacks to make this monthly payment and should both enjoy it. Also, while we split most finances 50-50 (edit: in that we put our about-equal pay into a joint bank account, plus I add extra from bonus work), I have consistently and continue to work extra jobs for money so we can afford extra things like the down payment. For example we are both teachers but only I work a summer job. This is the first time we have bought a new car and I want to use it too.

His argument: this car is replacing the one my parents gave *him* and therefore he should get it for work every day. He says I am a worse driver (I bumped someone 5 years ago but I did hop a curb recently and scratched my wheel) so therefore he should get most use of the new car whenever possible.

Am I the asshole for saying we should share? 

TL;DR my hubby and I don't know how to share our new vehicle.

Edit: I want to reiterate that we are very in love and happy and just posted here for fun to settle a debate. 
We have agreed to share the car and whoever has the baby will take the nice one ‚ù§Ô∏è",0.12

"AITA for not wanting to be my sister's bridesmaid? I'm counting on you all to give me honest opinions, even if it may not be what I want to hear!

So my sister is getting married in Europe this fall. Everyone attending lives in the US.  
Many of the bridesmaid dresses generally have low cut fronts or backs, which I am not very comfortable with because I have bad skin on both my chest and back. She said ""It'll be fine because you won't see it in pictures"". But that still means me having to be uncomfortable in that dress the whole day. She also won't let me wear any jewelry other than gold, which I never wear. I would still like to wear jewelry though, and I offered to take it all off for pictures. She said no, she doesn't want anything other than gold jewelry in her pictures.

At this point I'm just kind of feeling uncomfortable in general. I likely will not be allowed to wear a shawl or anything to cover any parts I'm self conscious about.

I'm thinking of trying to find a way to gently be like ""hey, I love you, but I don't think this is for me."" Am I making a big deal out of this? I realize it's HER wedding so she should be able to make design choices, and I wouldn't go wearing jewelry I know she doesn't want me to be wearing. Should I just suck it up for a day?

"AITA for leaving my husband ‚Äòstranded‚Äô at our apartment after he left me locked out for 45 minutes playing Elden Ring Just happened today, little sister advised I post here. 

My husband and I currently live in an apartment that requires a key fob to get into the building, then a regular key for the apartment. Over the weekend my fob stopped working and for some reason the office is dragging their feet replacing it, office is closed weekends so I called Monday to ask for a replacement. My husband‚Äôs fob is fine so we‚Äôre using that in the meantime. I get off work 2 hours after he does so he keeps the fob and we agreed that he‚Äôll make sure he‚Äôs at the apartment when I get home so he can let me into the building. I call him when I‚Äôm leaving work to give him a heads up that I‚Äôll be at the apartment in 15 minutes. I leave work at the same time every day and have for the last 4 years: 5PM. 

Today I left work, called my husband, no answer. I send him a text message ‚Äòhey I‚Äôm on the way home‚Äô. I call him two more times on my drive home, no answer. I arrive at the apartment and his truck is in the lot so I know he‚Äôs home. I stand in the entrance lobby and call him over and over, no answer, but I ended up locked out for 45 minutes before another tenant was leaving and let me into the building. I get up to the apartment and my husband is playing Elden Ring on our PlayStation with his headphones on. Apparently he bought it today. I walk over, tap him on the shoulder, VISIBLY pissed. He gets that ‚Äòoh shit I fucked up‚Äô face and rips his headphones off. I calmly ask him ‚Äòwhat the fuck, dude?‚Äô He tells me he lost track of time, totally forgot, etc. his phone was on silent and across the room from him, thus why he didn‚Äôt answer the calls. I was pissed and I wanted to avoid raising my voice or causing a blowout so I just tell him ‚Äòthat was a dick move‚Äô, take the fob off his keychain and leave to go visit my little sister, which is where I am currently. My husband is texting me essentially saying I‚Äôm the AH for taking the fob which means he can‚Äôt leave the building without getting locked out. I pointed out to him that he left me locked out for 45 minutes and that he‚Äôs at home with his game, and that as far as I knew he had no plans to leave the apartment from what he had told me. My sister finds this all hilarious but does think maybe I was a little too harsh taking the fob when I left. Personally I feel I was NTA as I have no issue with him gaming, I game myself, I have issue that he left me locked out and standing in the lobby for 45 minutes bc he wasn‚Äôt paying attention. Aita?

Info: I didn‚Äôt take the fob to punish him. I took the fob as he was still gaming when I left for my sister‚Äôs so I took it in the event he became distracted and left me locked out again, or in case I stayed late hanging out with my sister and he fell asleep

Info 2: was advised add this. My sister is 5 minutes down the road from where we live. I took off the fob in front of him, told him when I‚Äôd be home, and texted him when I got to my sister‚Äôs. Im not an hour away. In the event of emergency I can be home ASAP.",0.2

We have been engaged for over two years, and they‚Äôve known they‚Äôre going to be bridesmaids for over 1 year. They just called at the same time to tell her that they cannot go to the bachelorette Party which is in two months citing fiscal problems. They‚Äôve already said they cannot go to the bridal shower, which is understandable being that we live several states away. She moved the shower close enough that they could drive to the shower. Neither A nor B has been involved at all during this wedding, planning or even the bachelorette party. 

A says that she is looking for a new job which my fianc√©e takes time out of our night to ask her questions, and help her with interviewing skills (my fianc√©e works in HR) and cannot afford it.

"AITA for getting mad at my friend for baking cookies? This needs a lot of context. I have a best friend, we‚Äôll call her Sarah. Sarah is popular, outgoing, charming etc while I‚Äôm more quiet, reserved, and awkward. I‚Äôve been trying to be more confident like her. She‚Äôs always complaining about how popular she is and stuff and keeps saying no one likes her when literally everyone likes her. She says something about how no one has ever had a crush on her then she proceeds to list 20 people who have liked her. Whenever I do something that makes me feel confident and good, she does the same thing and gets other people to agree with her and it kinda makes me feel like shit. Like I cant do one thing without her doing it better. So I came up with an idea. I decided to bake cookies for everyone I talked too. Egg free cookies because I‚Äôm allergic to eggs. People loved the cookies and I loved making cookies. I made them again and gave them to people. By this point I‚Äôm more confident and people talk to me, finally. But of course, Sarah decides to make cookies. And of course, everyone prefers her cookies. Worst part, she refuses to make them egg free so I can‚Äôt even eat them. And she constantly brags about how people love her. ‚ÄúAnd they all said they preferred my cookies! Like wtf, even {popular boy} liked them more!‚Äù 

Another example of something she‚Äôs done is when I was literally crying because people kept calling me fat and ugly when I was struggling with a borderline ED and body dysmorphia, is she showed me all the comments she gets on her Instagram posts about how much everyone loves her. And then she proceeds to complain about how she doesn‚Äôt like being popular and how nobody likes her.
Nice edition to add might be that she called a guy cool even though he called me the ugliest in our class (5 people agreed with him). Sarah called him cool because he called her pretty.

"AITA for leaving instead of listening to my boyfriend talk with his former FWB? [**Update posted here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/tn5qor/update_aita_for_leaving_instead_of_listening_to/)

Sunday morning we were cuddling in bed, and he was watching videos on his phone which I didn't mind. He asked if he could give my DND Beyond login to one of his friends, we'll call her M, since it has the full version of everything. I told him maybe, that I wanted to think about it, and we settled back into comfy silence...until he practically jumps out of bed, gets on his computer, and starts talking to M on discord.

Usually he's very good about asking before he does voice chats in our room since I'm typically also there either studying or resting, but this time I felt disrespected and ignored. I wanted to go out to breakfast with him but I didn't have time to ask before he started talking with M. He launched into a discussion about DND with her, and at that point I thought he had given her the login anyways. Later he told me he didn't, so I take responsibility for jumping to that conclusion.

He started their conversation with ""I haven't heard your voice in forever"", which made me feel worse, so I went downstairs and tried to refocus by playing Elden Ring. He was loud enough that I could still hear him (thanks thin walls), so after about thirty minutes I went to a friend's house. He didn't realize I had left until another half hour had passed.

I came back about an hour later and we talked about it. He apologized, but I'm still hurt and upset. AITA for leaving? Was I right to be upset about how he acted?

INFO: He used to be friends with benefits with M before he met me, ""out of convenience"". She is now in another town and in a committed (lesbian) relationship, but he knows the fact that they have remained friends makes me very uncomfortable. He's the first and only person I've slept with, and now I can't stop myself from wondering what he's done with me that he also did with her...nothing really feels like it's ""ours"" anymore. But on the other hand, I don't feel like it's my place to ask that he stop talking to her, especially since he only has a handful of friends.",0.41

"WIBTA For Thinking Washing Our Bird‚Äôs Bowls In The Sink Unsanitary? EDIT: included extra info at the bottom :)


My little sister has a small bird that she got as a Christmas gift a couple years ago. Her dad thinks it‚Äôs fine to wash her bowls, the ones she eats and drinks in, to be washed in her sink.

I wouldn‚Äôt have a problem if she didn‚Äôt poop on them. Sometimes her poop falls on the bowls, and she flicks it away. We clean her cage and bowls often, but we sometimes catch her eating her own poop. Given that some birds eat worms, i do not care and she‚Äôs still as healthy as the day we got her. 

My concern is that he insists on washing her bowls, the ones with and without poop in them, in the kitchen sink. The ones we use to wash dishes. With the sponge we use to clean dishes. He will not throw away the sponge smeared with poop and will not use a separate sponge for it either. His reasoning? Birds are cleaner than humans, just like dogs. I get that he‚Äôs adopted the American mindset (we are immigrants), but there‚Äôs no way an animal who eats their own poop or lick their butthole, cleaner than a human.


He doesn‚Äôt sanitize the area with bleach, instead he just cleans it with soap and water with the same sponge, and yells at anyone that gets caught replacing the sponge or sanitizing with bleach.",0.29

"WIBTA for reporting a student on my school trip for her comments about me? Sorry for formatting, on mobile.
I (17) went on a school sponsored trip to New York a few days ago with several arts students in our school, including a senior we‚Äôll call Mira (17). 

Mira‚Äôs in the school‚Äôs chamber choir with myself and a few other people on the trip. Mira is often in trouble in class for trying to correct our director, playing games on her phone, and being disrespectful to other members (i.e. mentioning groups sound flat or laughing at them mid performance), while also making comments about others when our director isn‚Äôt listening. This includes commenting on the eating habits of one of my close friends, telling her to slow down in reference to an empty sleeve of Oreos it took her three days to finish (this friend is eating more under medical advisory).

For context, I heavily struggled with an ED from 5th grade through most of 9th grade due to family and school bullies.

The first night of our trip, on a snack stop, I had grabbed my snacks of choice (small chips, peach rings, caramel corn, and KitKats since it‚Äôs shark week) with plans to share with my two roommates, and was seen by Mira, who said my name in a reprimanding sort of tone, like I shouldn‚Äôt have as much in my hands. That was enough to trigger me, as my relationship with food and eating is still rocky at times. I looked at her and said ‚ÄúMira, don‚Äôt.‚Äù then walked away. I didn‚Äôt touch them until the next day, and my appetite was gone during dinner prior due to cramps.

Then, three days later, I had gotten lunch and gotten ice cream, and dipped my fries into it. Mira, upon seeing this, gasped loudly and said my name the same way again. Again triggered, I said ‚ÄúMira, there‚Äôs no reason to comment on it, so don‚Äôt.‚Äù She just walked away. I gave the rest of my food to my friend since I wasn‚Äôt hungry anymore.

Finally, the last morning of our trip, she saw the full plate of food I had gotten myself for breakfast and her eyes blew wide. I once again said ‚ÄúMira, don‚Äôt‚Äù and she told me she wasn‚Äôt gonna say anything, me responding her look was enough. I then asked her not to make comments like she had on the trip to me again, because those comments are triggering to me. She apologized and the last day was silent in that respect. However, several people including her sister had major issues with her on the trip. 

After getting home and telling my mom, she said I should tell our head chaperone, and after expressing my hesitations with my boyfriend, he agreed with my mom.

Several people in choir say that Mira is most likely on the spectrum, which is what makes me hesitate to report what happened, since that could potentially tie into why she‚Äôs acting this way, especially since I hardly know her outside of chamber choir and she kept to her sister most of the trip, plus I feel like it‚Äôs done and over. At the same time, what Mira said was triggering to me, and my director has no clue it happened at all.

So, WIBTA if I reported Mira to my director for what she said on the trip?",0.04

"AITA for not wanting to spend time with my ‚Äúin-laws‚Äù? I (22f) have met my partner‚Äôs parents (60‚Äôs) about 3x. My partner has told me that they are not the biggest fans of mine because they would prefer if I was Muslim, and because I am ‚Äútoo quiet‚Äù. I am very introverted, and only speak when I have something to say. This goes with everybody I meet. I do not say much when I am around them, however I am always polite and use manners. I always say the usual ‚Äúhello, thank you, goodbye, it was nice seeing you‚Äù, etc. I feel that this is a very quick judgement to make of me, because the reality is that they still don‚Äôt know me.

"WIBTA if I don‚Äôt tell the truth about who the father of my nephew is? I really don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôve been dating my boyfriend for eight months. Things are going great. For context my sister has a three year old son. Her and her boyfriend at the time for growing through a break and were both ‚Äúsingle‚Äù but sleeping with each other and other people. My sister was sleeping with one guy and she claims it was just for a week and she thinks the baby is her boyfriends since she was sleeping with him way more. They ended up getting back together and she found out she was pregnant. Her doubt is something she‚Äôs only told me and our other sister.  She told us about her little fling and showed us his Tinder so his face was something I knew. 


When my nephew was two my sister got married. My sister always talks about how he‚Äôs ‚Äúdaddy‚Äôs twin‚Äù but me and my other sister have spoken privately and don‚Äôt think he looks anything like my now BIL and looks like the other guy. We don‚Äôt know what my sister has told him and it‚Äôs really not our business. 


Anyways I‚Äôm only mentioning my boyfriend because last weekend he invited me a family party and that‚Äôs where I saw the guy my sister showed me as being her fling. He‚Äôs my boyfriends cousin and they‚Äôre apparently close. It‚Äôs crazy. He has no idea that my sister was even pregnant let alone had a baby that looks a lot like him. 


Me and my boyfriend have been together for a while and I feel like if we were to keep being together and being around his family and I know I‚Äôm reaching  but get married, my nephew running into his cousin is possible or even my sister. What the hell should I do? I told my other sister and she thinks that if I really think my boyfriend is the one (we‚Äôre thinking of moving in together) then this is something I can‚Äôt avoid but also my sisters business isn‚Äôt something I should broadcast. She thinks I should do it if my boyfriend and I are together longer. WIBTA if I don‚Äôt? I‚Äôm kind of scared to start drama and maybe ruin my own relationship.",0.27

So I (25f) have 5 siblings my oldest brother (36m) who I used to idolise. he recently got engaged imo rather quickly after his divorce (6months)

Tonight was his engagement dinner I‚Äôm gonna honest as fuck here I hate his soon to be wife Amanda she‚Äôs a two faced fake bitch that‚Äôs obsessed with my brothers ex wife. I went tonight because I loved my brother and with all our families comments about putting them in their place I was gonna try to keep it civil for my nieces sake. 

Well shockingly it was going well because my brother kept our grandmother and siblings away from Amanda by sitting me and dad next to her

I tried to be nice I used all my years in retail to help me channel my best polite positive attitude even tho I wanted to tell this woman go fuck her self. We got talking about their wedding which is in July it started off civil enough till it got to the part my mom asked would my nieces (4,5,8) be flower girls 

They looked at eachother than my pos brother answered and said ‚Äúwell actually we thought of having a late wedding so we decided it would be best if it was child free‚Äù 

Me in shock and a little drunk‚Äùhow can you have a childfree wedding when you have kids‚Äù

Amanda ‚Äúwell they won‚Äôt be coming because it wouldn‚Äôt be fair to my friends or you guys‚Äù

Me ‚Äúbitch I wasn‚Äôt asking you I‚Äôm talking to my brother THEIR FATHER‚Äù 

Brother‚Äù op please don‚Äôt call Amanda out of her name and claim down. We both agreed it would be inappropriate because the ceremony starts at 7 and we plan on partying into the night please as my family respect and support my decisions if you can‚Äôt respect my relationship or my future wife I will ask you don‚Äôt attend the wedding nor speak to me till you‚Äôre ready to apologise‚Äù

Me ‚Äúhaving a childfree wedding is completely bullshit and guess what ether people came here to make fun of you or for your kids sake! You know what fuck you,fuck your wedding and your FuTuRe wIfE‚Äù

My grandmother than said ‚Äúthey always downgrade don‚Äôt they? He was running around with shit in a sack when he had a good woman at home‚Äù

We all started laughing than my brother and Amanda started yelling so everyone go in it than we got kicked out of the restaurant 

Now that I‚Äôm sobering up i think I‚Äôm an asshole

People have told me add my reasons for disliking Amanda and Why my brothers kids not being invited to his wedding tipped me over the edge 

Here‚Äôs the reasons

Amanda is my ex sister in laws friend

My brother has seen his kids a total of ten days in the last year and half

When his kids uncle got into a crash which he wouldn‚Äôt even let his kids stay with him when his ex needed to spend time with her 18 year old brother who passed away due to injuries. I had to step up for those kids when he should have

They talk shit on his ex 24/7 when the woman is just trying to live her life

Amanda told my niece she was fat and boys won‚Äôt like that


Also they both called my exes wife a bad mother when the girls stayed with us for a while after her brothers death",0.75
"AITA for going on live with my bsf and saying look at my ass ? Hello, me and my bf had been in a relationship for about 7 months. We have had quite some problems starting about two - 3 months ago.

He began to start changing and not acting on impulse w me and we were doing better for a little while. Things were going smoothly but then we go into a huge fight. I forgot how the fight even started but it ended up in us breaking up. I was so tired of everything but I still loved him a lot. I ended up hanging out with my childhood friend that day to get my mind off stuff. Me and her ended up going on Instagram live and were messing around, I saw that he had joined the live and I wanted to make him mad. So I stepped back and I was showing my outfit in live, keep in mind it was not a slutty outfit at all and I was completely covered.

"AITA for uninviting my girlfriend from mountain climbing? I [25m] am an active mountain climber. I've been climbing mountains since I was in elementary school, and I've summited a few fairly difficult ones both in the US and abroad. My girlfriend [21f] is not really in shape and we generally don't share this hobby, but I've taken her on a couple of small hikes and she legitimately seemed to enjoy them.

Earlier this year, I decided to make a trip a couple of states over to climb a mountain of about 4000 meters. I've done it before and technically it is an easy climb. When I announced this to my girlfriend, she said that she wanted to come too. At first I was hesitant because, again, she's far from being in decent shape. I told her that 4000 meters is pretty hard and she would have to start training for it immediately. She agreed, so I added her into the travel/hotel arrangements assuming she'd stick to the training plan.

Ten weeks have passed and she has done next to nothing in preparation. If anything she has gained weight in this time period and gotten into even worse shape. She said it's because she's working from home and can't really muster the energy to get out and train, but I've gotten increasingly anxious over it.

With the trip five weeks out, I called her last night to tell her that I was canceling her ticket. She first promised that she'd start getting ready ""right away,"" and practically hung up on me to ""go train."" I canceled all the accommodations I reserved for her in the meantime because five weeks of preparation is not enough. When she called me back an hour later I told her about this, and she was absolutely crushed.

Her sister called me later and shrieked at me until she was hoarse about how horrible it was for me to do that to her. I couldn't get a word in and eventually just hung up. My phone kept getting blown up from texts so I turned it off to go to the gym. I'm honestly afraid to turn it back on because I'm afraid of what will have been sent to me during the downtime, and I wonder if I owe her an apology or if I should stick to my guns here.

**Edit:** hi everyone. Thanks for the comments. Today I learned that I'm supposed to drive two hours a day to get someone who invited herself on my trip into shape. Also, since many people here have crippling body image issues, they're mad that I mentioned her weight. Next time just in mind that this is not your favorite Netflix romantic comedy and some people have jobs/have to pay for gasoline. If you got triggered by my comments, good.",0.48
"AITA for not wanting my son to believe Santa is a real person? I understand it's end of March but my wife and I budget for Christmas expenses out of every paycheck and this topic came up last night along with Secret Santa.

I am going to do my best to explain this correctly but sometimes I fail so please forgive me if I do and don't flame me.

I have never liked the thought of telling my child that Santa is real. It has always just seemed like a pointless thing to lie about and could possibly damage my child. I specifically remember the day I found out that Santa wasn't real. I was standing in line at a grocery store with my brother and his best friend, I was probably five or six at the time. I remember him saying something about Santa being fake and my brother chastising him for it. He looked at me and said ""come on, you still don't believe in Santa, right?"". It really was devastating to me. I wasn't upset that Santa wasn't real, I was upset that literally everyone around me was lying to me.

I know what you're probably thinking. I shouldn't let my childhood hang ups ruin things for my son and I completely agree. I told my wife that I am absolutely fine with him doing everything Santa related. He can sit on his lap, he can leave out milk and cookies, he can write a letter to him asking for gifts. I want my son to be able to do everything Santa related, I just want to be able to tell him that we do these things as tradition and in the spirit of Christmas and Santa instead of telling him that Santa is a real person. When he is a bit older, I would like to explain to him the origin of Santa and how it all started.

As we talked it out, I decided not to push it and just let him believe what all the other kids believe because we all know that you cannot trust a child to keep a secret and I don't want him ruining it for the other kids. I just wanted opinions on whether or not I was TA for feeling this way. I truly believe you can achieve the same outcome without lying to your child. Will there come a time as a parent where I will lie to my child about something? Probably. But as a parent, I will try my best to limit those instances and I don't believe that Santa is worthy.  


EDIT: I told you I would screw something up. I forgot one of the most important points. I explained to my wife that there are a lot of negatives that go along with Santa that people don't think about. How do you explain to a child why they got almost nothing for Christmas while others got thousands of dollars worth of toys? Santa is a magical being? What could possibly be the reason that not every child is getting an equal amount of presents? I was fortunate enough to grow up in a middle class home so Christmas wasn't crazy but it wasn't terrible. I remember going into school and kids bragging about what they got for Christmas only to ask one of the kids who only got a pair of sweatpants or a yo-yo. I cannot imagine how that kid felt and how anyone could possibly explain it to him or her in any way that would make sense. ",0.59

"AITA for asking my parents for a new car? I, (18NB) have always done everything my parents asked. I was in military cadets for five years, on honour roll at school and am accepted to my top choice university with a scholarship. I have two silblings, 16M and 20F who have both had less expectations put on them by my parents.

Since I am expected to pay for my own schooling, they have offered to help me with things like my phone, car bills, etc.

My brother just turned 16. He hasn't passed his drivers test yet, and they bought him a luxury car. My older sister has a newer car with all of the features like AC, sunroof, heated seats, etc.

When it came to me: I have a base model car with no AC, constant mechanical issues, manual windows and locks and is covered in rust and dents. Don't get me wrong, I didn't have to pay for it and I'm lucky enough I even get a car from them but the favouritism is so obvious when I look at my brothers brand new car, and then back at mine. 

I talked to them about this and said, it seems really unfair you splurged on both of my siblings for these really nice cars and mine was just the cheapest, first car they could get their hands on. 

My mom, told me that ""I'm an ungrateful
bitch,"" and that I was only using her for her money. 

She also says this because I spend a lot of time at my friends house (from the information above, I'm sure you can assume how great they treat me vs my siblings in other aspects of life as well.) My friends parents are super supportive of me and when I got into uni, my own parents didn't even celebrate with me. My friends parents took me out for dinner and have also given me their spare room, I have a house key, etc. 

I tried to explain to my mom that I know I am lucky just to have a car, but I genuinely don't understand how she doesn't see the favouritism.

"AITA for abandoning my grandmother? When I was 16, I ran away from home. My parents were extremely controlling and toxic, and I had a wealth of mental health issues. Because of this, I didn't get my driving license (this comes up, believe it or not). My extended family has always been very dismissive of my experience growing up, saying that I'm overreacting, or I should just get over it or ""I won't hear you speak that way about my family"" kinda thing. I've had some experiences with a few of them that were a harsh lesson in that I'll never be able to depend on them for anything real. I've maintained a lot of distance over the last few years, and I don't attend major family events because of this.

But I need to learn how to drive, lessons are $100s/h, and the majority of my friends don't have vehicles of their own. So, I have to depend on whatever practice I can scrounge up, including ones from family members when they come through town or when they have time. I recently declined an invite to my grandmother's 80th birthday, saying that I would take her out the day after if she wanted to see me. She recently came to town and said she wanted to see me and that she wanted me to drive her around. I said OK, and we met up.

The driving went well. Until my grandmother started to bring up her party. I said no again, and I cited my issue with some of my family members and that I didn't want to upset her there. She told me to get over it, that I was 24, and it was time to let go of things that had happened 5 years ago, and that I could ""hold myself together"" if I actually cared about her. I didn't want to get too worked up, so I pulled over. I said I was going to leave unless she stopped talking about this. We got about 2 k up the road before she started up again. I pulled into a gas station. I got an uber, and left. It was the middle of the day, my grandma is a fully capable driver as long as it's daytime, and she used to live in the neighborhood, so she knew her way around.

A few hours I got a call from my mom (who yes, I talk to, and yes, she's lucky I do) telling me that she couldn't believe I had done that and that I had completely abandoned her. I tried to explain what happened, but she wouldn't hear it. My family is now saying that they will no longer teach me how to drive unless I apologize and come to the party. I'm starting to feel guilty now. Like I can see their point; she is old, and it was bad of me to just leave her there. AITA?

edit: people are asking about this in the comments so I just want to say; my grandmother is an extremely independent person. She gets offended if we call too often, and she drives herself around all the time where she lives (she specifically moved to get away from her kids). If I thought that she couldn't handle herself or it was in a neighborhood she wasn't familiar with, of course I wouldn't have left her there. Honestly, if I had dared to turn the car around to drive her back to where she was staying, I'm pretty sure she would've shouted at me to get out. She was intending on driving herself around anyway. I was driving her car around on errands.",0.21
"AITA for only wanting to take one nephew but not the other on a bike ride So I have 2 nephews ""Henry"" (10) and ""Luis "" (12). Henry is really active and into sports and bike riding etc. Luis isn't,  he's more into video games and stuff.  Whenever he does anything active he complains the whole time.  He's never learned how to ride a 2 wheel bike either, his bike still has training wheels.  He's said ""he doesn't want to"" in the past so my brother and SIL just let it go and figured he'd do it when he wants to.  

They're on spring break next week so I I thought I'd take Henry for a day and go on a bike ride, since he'd probably have fun and I'll probably be going anyway. 

When I talked to my brother about it he said ""well what about Luis?"" I said ""Luis doesn't like stuff like that so he'll just complain all day and he still uses training wheels so it'll take twice as long if he comes"". 

My brother said if I take one I have to take both,  that I'm acting like those kids in school by basically saying ""you're not good enough to play"".

"WIBTA if I reported my coworkers to higher up management because they're in a relationship together which is against company policy. For a little background, I work for a large company that has hundreds of stores in hundreds of locations. It's company policy that couples can't work in the same store. In the last year or so 2 casual employees have gotten together and moved in together. The store manager is aware. I definitely don't love my job or the company I work for, I think a lot of their rules are bullshit. I'm just wondering if I could use this rule to help improve store moral which has plummeted since these issues began.

Basically it seems like the relationship is a little toxic and the man (call him T) is showing some controlling behaviour. They live together, demand to work the same shifts and have the same days off. Since they've moved in together the woman (call her D) has changed completely! She used to be very happy and talkative. She also used to do her hair and make-up everyday but it's rare to see her wearing make-up these days or have her done other than a messy bun. She used to text me and others randomly but doesn't talk to anyone any more, even at work. He also tells her what she can and can't eat, like no chocolate, I think they're on a diet? But on the days that D finishes later than T she'll buy and eat chocolate etc. As someone that's had a controlling ex in the past I'm just seeing a bunch of red flags.

The workplace has become really hostile and they seem to believe everyone is against them because they're asked to do a task alone, or to have lunch one at a time instead of together. T has threatened to go to hr because the assistant manager docked him half an hours pay because ha had 2 lunches (lunch is 30 mins), 1 by himself and 1 with D. He complained to the store manager and she caved and paid it to him so he wouldn't go to hr and claim he was being bullied by the assistant. He's also tried to file reports about other staff on D's behalf and will say what shifts she will and won't work and until what time. The workplace used to be fun and we could all joke around together but not any more. There's a bunch of other stuff but I don't want to put too much so it's identifiable. 

I've been thinking about reporting to a higher up manager that there's a couple that work together. Neither would lose their job, one of them would just be transferred to a different store, hopefully T. I'm hoping that it'll reduce the hostility in the workplace but also give D some time away from T (I know it's only 8 hours but they're pretty much together 24/7) so she might regain some of who she used to be. She just seems like a shell of who she used to be and I'm concerned for her, I've been there. I know it's not going to solve all the problems for D or the store but WIBTA if I reported them to a higher up so the T can be transferred elsewhere??",0.13

"AITA for giving Advice? My (32m) coworker Quan (36m),havent looked at each other. For context when I first moved to this town i had no friends, I had just transferred to an overnight position in the Grocery dept. which he is the Lead of, and we ended up becoming ""close friends"" at least that's I how I saw it I mean he invited me to Thanksgiving and Christmas at his place with his 3 kids and sister.We connected with games, movies and then we started to connect through personal stories, and both our heart breaks.

Brian (24m) started overnights in his dept. shortly after I switched, he is an introvert, like myself and suffers from depression, both Quan and I felt for him and shortly become friends. Brian had injured his hand at work, Quan told him if I remember right to talk to Laura, the Grocery manager, and she essentially put him on light work with no paperwork needed, which is not a normal process. Quan mentions that when he himself got hurt the store director told him not to come in until he was better, which made him lose out on two weeks of work, I cant remember if he got compensated honestly, and Quan tells me that he also told Brian to go the Store Director, and he even told the Store director that he told Brian to come talk to him. So being that I was worried that Brian ( being mentally depressed, barely just got his new place) was about to lose out on two weeks, possibly more, of work when Laura had essentially put him on light duty I came to Brian privately and said that ""Its up to him, but if you go to our Store Director there is a chance hes gonna tell you to not come to work and if I were him I would just keep to myself about it, and continue doing light work until a manager comes up to him about it. And that you didnt hear it from me."" Well a couple weeks go by and Quan came to me about Brian again talking about his hand situation, and that he hadn't gone to the Store Director about like he told him, and THIS IS WHERE I FUCKED UP, I TOLD HIM ABOUT THE ADVICE I GAVE BRIAN, and honestly at first hes reaction wasnt much. Come a week or 2 later, HE TELLS ME NOT TO TALK TO HIS CREW, taken a little back by this I say what does that mean? and he brings up the advice I gave to Brian, I then say that was HIS choice, all I did was give him some advice, and that his choice is not your responsibility. HE THEN THREATENED ME BY SAYING ""OK, WHAT IF I GO TO THE STORE DIRECTOR TO TELL HIM ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID TO BRIAN?"" ""if that's what you feel like you have to do, then so be it"" I also said ""I knew I fucked up by telling him and that I just wont tell him next time"" and that was when the arguement petered off.I honestly believed he was in a pissy mood, with work, his anxieties, and for some reason took it out on me but he hasn't talked to me let alone look me and Vice Versa, I mean for me I thought we were close friends, but he basically threatened my job at the store.

       Now, while my and my fam were eating dinner, he  just came at my house, mind you he's supposed to be working, and went straight to the bathroom. He threw up while we were eating, it wasn't really fun to hear, but I digress. Once he was done with his barfing he went up to my room to lay down. 
      Once I was finished eating, I went to the couch and started texting him and asking him if he was ok. He answered and explained what he was feeling, and it sounded like he had a virus, but he kept saying it was just stress, but he's been feeling down and out of it for a few days. Like he's been having headaches, throwing up, not eating, etc.
       My grand parents are ill, and my mom is the one that takes care of them. I live with my parents. So with this in mind, plus my injury, I told him that he couldn't stay because I couldn't risk both me and my grand parents getting sick.
        After I told him that, he came downstairs mad and left while almost slamming the door. Now I can't help but wonder if I was the a-hole in all of this... Like, was I wrong??? Cause he does keep saying it was just stress...",0.01
"AITA for rubbing in my acceptance to my dream university to my childhood best friend Hi, my friend (17f) and I (17m) both got our letters back from our dream university. We have known each other since the 6th grade and would talk non-stop about getting into this university. 

As the years went on we took different routes in highschool. In the 9th grade, she took IB while I did the regular-stream. We both had applied to IB but soon after a couple of months, I found out I was not cut out for the program and dropped to the regular highschool curriculum. 

For the next three years, she has always mentioned how hard her course load was compared to mine and belittled my achievements. I won an award in my chemistry class for being a top 5 student and she said that if she was in my shoes she would've easily been top 1 of the class. 

We stayed close friends but I had always played dumb around her so I didn't have to have confrontations about who was right or wrong in academics. Eventually, as applications for university rolled out we both had applied to two schools. One was our dream school and the other was the school known for always being second place in our province. 

During this whole wait time for our acceptance letters, she would constantly tell me about how IB put her in another pool of candidates and that they would accept her way before my application would even have the chance to be reviewed. Just over a week ago I was accepted into our dream school and on the same day, they had denied her application.

After that day she still has not congratulated me and believes that our applications were switched. Since then she has accepted her offer to the second-place University and is always bitter when I talk about my excitement for going to our dream school.

Her birthday was just this weekend and I planned a surprise from a while back where I got matching t-shirts with our faces and the university's logo. Trying to salvage this gift I put tape over the university logo on her shirt and wrote ""Second-Place University"" as a running joke we had going on. As soon as she saw it, she threw the shirt in the garbage and started to cry.

 She hasn't talked to me since, am I the asshole?",0.86

"WIBTA for not refunding the full amount of concert tickets I sold Me and my friends purchased 8 tickets to a concert in early 2020 before covid, the concert sold out and we decided not to go. We managed to sell the tickets for roughly double the cost and each made some profit. 

The concert has been delayed year after year due to the covid, meaning the tickets remained valid. Today, the concert was entirely cancelled and they are refunding the original card holder (me). The 8 different buyers are wanting their money back, which is double what the refund will be. There were also fees I paid when we sold the tickets on a resale site. 

I'm thinking of only refunding them the original ticket cost less the fees I incurred for selling everyones tickets, so they are gonna effectively get back just less than half their money... It seems horrible but I can't seem to find a situation where everyone wins.

Edit - some additional info. I only have the profit for 1 of the tickets, my friends have it for the other 7 and most have indicated they spent the money and won‚Äôt refund them the profit they made. They‚Äôre obviously happy for me to give the buyers back the original cost of the ticket.",0.93
"AITA for smoking weed despite the fact that my boyfriends hates it. We‚Äôve (F21 and M23) been together for 3 years now. For a year and a half I respected his boundaries, knowing it makes him upset and he needed time to work through it.

 I let him know from the very beginning that if the opportunity comes up and I decide I want to, I will smoke now and again. He didn‚Äôt say much about it but what he didn‚Äôt tell me is that when I would finally smoke again, that he would completely lose his mind. And he‚Äôs a pretty levelheaded guy most of time so it‚Äôs shocking when he starts yelling at me like that. 

Eventually, I got sick of having the exact same conversation with him every time I wanted to smoke and started hiding it. This is the part I feel really bad about. But I have been in the same situation with him and drinking, except it was much worse, and I still was able to recognize that it‚Äôs not my place to tell him what to do with his free time.

"AITA (34f) the asshole for calling my coworker (28m) insensitive for comparing the loss of his dog to the loss of my mother? Throwaway because people know my Reddit.

Recently my mother passed away. She was my best friend and it was absolutely devastating for me and my whole family. Everyone has been very supportive so far, especially my coworkers who have been supporting me through this time.

I took a few days off work as I was very depressed after my mother passed. When I finally came back, everyone was crowded around my coworker. I asked what was wrong, and I learned my coworker had lost his dog of 14 years due to cancer. I felt terrible and I paid my respects. My coworker responded by saying, ‚Äúit‚Äôs okay [my name], losing a loved one is hard, now I know how you feel‚Äù (referring to my late mother). I froze and just looked at him in disbelief. I couldn‚Äôt believe he‚Äôd compare the loss of his DOG to my MOM. I kind of blew up on him and called him an insensitive asshole. Now, the whole office is pissed at me. The coworker refuses to speak to me after I have tried to apologize.

I just felt its inappropriate to compare a dog passing away you‚Äôve only known for part of your life, to my mother who I‚Äôve known for all of my life.

"AITA for laughing at the absurdity of my wife taking pictures of herself cleaning? I (36m) work full time and my wife (27f) stays at home. We've been married for five years. I have a good job so I'm happy to support her. We do not have children.

My wife is something of a slob. I know this isn't the nicest thing to say about your partner, but she would happily step over a pile of clothes in our living room for a month before actually folding them. During the daytime, she doesn't really cook, clean, or do any housework at all. She loves browsing the internet and watching Netflix, but beyond her interests, she can rarely gather up the energy to do much at all. To be honest, before marriage when I lived alone, my house was much cleaner than it is now.

The bizarre thing about this situation is that she's *incredibly* sensitive about the fact that she doesn't really do much all day and denies it whenever it's brought up. I do my own laundry, prepare my own lunches, and often times cook dinner. She might do the dishes in the evening or she'll leave them for the next day.

A few days ago, I got really tired of it because a pile of her stuff that I didn't know where to put away had been sitting in our living room for over a week. I told her that she really needs to get it together and learn how to clean, even a little, every day. She fired back that she's not a maid, to which I responded was clear because if she went to someone's house, laid on their sofa, and watched Netflix for six hours, she would have been fired on her first day.

The next day after I got home from work, my wife and I were still kind of in a Cold War. She suddenly approached me and showed me pictures she took of herself cleaning during the day, repeating ""See? This is what I do during the day."" I couldn't help myself and began laughing at how ridiculous it was, then said having a fake photoshoot like an Instagrammer didn't mean she was doing a good job around the house.

She says I crossed the line. Now she's sulking in her room. I feel like she's trying to emotionally manipulate me, but I could have pushed it too far.",0.33
"AITA For Yelling At My Mother? A little bit of context, me (13M) my brother (19) my sister (1) and my mother (36) were recently evicted even though we had a verbal agreement with our landlord that we could stay until December, we didn't. We were supposed to rent out half a house but the owner never replied and me and my siblings had to stay at our grandma's for a couple of days. We eventually found a shelter (Mary's Place) that we could stay in, we were able to get the last room available. My mother found an organization that helped family's that needed housing that were apart of the LGBT+ community (my brother is gay and my mother bi) and my mom was told to start looking for places, she did but didn't call him back, for 2 weeks. I told her last week multiple times to call him (Hunter, the guy from the organization) and she did once, I told her multiple times to call h back, she didn't. So today I asked her ""Did you call Hunter?"" She got angry and told me to stop asking her, I got angry and raised my voice and told her that she needed to call Hunter ( Not loud enough for myself to consider it shouting or yelling) and she started ignoring me, by the end of the argument I called her irresponsible and told her I don't like her and this is why I don't talk to her or ask her for help with school, she told me to go to my room and I eventually did, and that's where I am now, so reddit, AITA?",0.88

"WIBTA if I got my housemates kicked out of uni? I (19f) have lived with some horrendous people this year. There are 5 of us in total and I am very close to one of them but the other 3 have been horrible. 2 of them are a couple and some examples of things they have done include: they have stolen my things then tried to claim it was theirs, the spent about 5 months in total ignoring us whenever we spoke and slamming doors in our faces, they have stacks of mouldy food (with blue fluff growing out of it) in their rooms which have brought flies and rats, they haven't taken the bins out once, they have spread rumours about us to mutual friends, when I put up a Facebook post looking for new people to live with next year they reported it 5 times out of pettiness, they smoke in the house even tho we have asked them not to many times, they constantly try to lock us out by locking the doors the second we leave (they only ever lock them if we are out) etc etc. And that's only the couple the other girl is much tidier and very subtle with everything she does but tbh she has made me feel the worst this year. All she does is talk behind people's backs and try to start fights. This went on for months of some really horrible things being said about whoever wasn't there, it was so unbelievably toxic. Anywho he and my friend have finally found an early way out by planning the next 4 months down to each individual day of getting out of here through staying at friends to camping to some nights sleeping in our cars unless we can afford a hotel just so we don't have to stay here so in 2 weeks we are gone and never have to see these people again. But the last year has had a huge effect on me and part of me wants revenge (although I'm not sure if I have the guts to go through with it). My first idea is to tell my uni mentor what's been going on. We are studying nursing so they take a person's character very seriously. With the combination of photos of how gross the house has been (which is a potential health hazard for patients), texts showing their behaviour, telling the uni to look at her attendance (which is pretty much 0%), and the fact smaller complaints have been made before I could definitely get one of them kicked off where as the other 2 I think would just get some kind of warning. Some people I've spoken to think I should definitely do this and others think it's taking it too far as it would literally ruin their careers so WIBTA for doing this? My other idea is more of the petty route which is to just screen shot all of the messages and telling any gossip I have heard from either side then just giving a copy to each person. The issue with that is that those 3 have no other friends and pretty bad mental health so if I did this and they all fell out I don't think they would cope very well at all. None of them seem to care about the course they just want to smoke weed and gossip to people so if I took that away from them I think they would actually break. WIBTA for either of these? Or should I just cut my losses and leave them behind?",0.12

"AITA for being tired of my depressed friend? So me and my friend have been bffs for about 4 years. We both deal with mental health problems and I understand going through a hard time, but lately for like the past month hanging out with her has been hard. She‚Äôs either very mad or super unmotivated when we talk or hangout. I personally find it draining and it makes me not want to hangout with her anymore because all she can talk about is how stressed she is (we are both in college) or how hard her life is. I work 5 days a week while being a full time student she just focuses on school. I don‚Äôt understand how one can complain so much when there is so many positives happening around her. Anyways I am just wondering if I‚Äôm the asshole for being tired of her.

Edit: thank you for all the advice, I do understand how shitty I sound when I say there is so much to be positive about, it‚Äôs just that every time I try to cheer her up or help her focus on the positives it‚Äôs instantly turned down and she says that she literally couldn‚Äôt care less. And the reason I am scared to say anything is because I don‚Äôt want to make it worse/ she will get upset with me for not being empathetic enough.

"AITA because I didn‚Äôt answer the door for a package that needed to be signed for? I just typed out the TL/DR first and honestly, this feels even more ridiculous. 

FedEx came today with Boyfriend‚Äôs (34M) new phone. Neither of us were aware it was being delivered today. Therefore I (29F) did not know to be prepared to meet the delivery person. When they came, I was also on a work call, I also thought our roommate was home (she had come home, but apparently left again), so I made no effort to go to the door. 

Boyfriend came home, and immediately started complaining about me not answering the door. I explained what happened and moved on with my life. Apparently I upset him by not apologizing and not taking it seriously. He kept complaining about it and I ignored him. He finally told me that it irritates him that I‚Äôm brushing it off. I just said, I don‚Äôt understand what you want. It happened and complaining about it is completely unproductive. What do you want, me to apologize a million times? Apparently me not apologizing at all is very upsetting. Now he‚Äôs not talking to me. 

I feel like this is so very very dumb. AITA? 

TL/DR: bf (34, M) is upset because I (29, F) missed FedEx trying to deliver his phone due to a work call. Neither of us were aware it was coming today. I also thought our roommate was home, so I wasn‚Äôt the only one home (or so I thought). Currently being asked for an apology and getting the silent treatment.

UPDATE: I apologized, but I also explained that I did not initially apologize because when someone immediately starts to berate me for something uncontrollable, that‚Äôs not the reaction you‚Äôre going to get back. I also pointed out that this is an ongoing issue, clinging to any fault or accident to berate me for. Beyond that, complaining and making someone feel bad for a mistake is unproductive.

"AITA for not wanting our out-of-town family to bring their dog when they stay? My husband's brother and his fiancee are coming to stay with us for just under a week. They live across the country and are only able to visit a few times a year. Last night, my husband asked if they could bring their dog along with them rather than have to pay to board him for an extended period. ETA: My husband is fine with them bringing the dog, I am not. 

I'm not really a dog person; I somewhat enjoy other people's dogs and have been a dog owner as a kid but beyond that don't have a huge desire for one. We have a 2 year old toddler which keeps me busy enough as it is and our house is mostly carpeted. The previous owners of our home had a St. Bernard and I still find dog hair everywhere regularly after two years of living here though we've had the carpets professionally cleaned (not a huge deal but it is a minor annoyance).

My BIL's dog is relatively new to them as of this year and is theoretically decently potty-trained and low-shed. That being said, I'm just not into the idea of having a dog here. Part of this comes from the hair issue, but I also get nervous about accidents as well as the interaction with my toddler. My husband's parents will also be coming to stay so it will be a full house, and I'm just not into the idea of having a new dog here as well. My parents-in-law have three dogs themselves and usually get a dog sitter when they come.

"AITA if I ask my cousins to share their inheritance? Its hard trying to keep it brief bc issa lotta layers. My 2 cousins (30F & 28F) and my sister (27F) and I (25F) are the only grandchildren of my maternal grandma. Her will *used* to be split equally btw us..

18 yrs ago my cousins mom (Aunt Gigi) went thru a divorce, was forced to stop being a SAHM, & asked Grandma to move in. Gma bought half of their home so that the tween girls didnt have to move amid their parents divorcing. This big house is in a RICH part of CT so b4 uncle cheated & stopped workn Aunt Gigis family had a bigger house, more toys, vacations etc than my fam. I was young so I dont remembr a big change. As far as ik my cousins have always had a narrative that theyre poor. Ive never heard them be grateful for growing up in a nice town w good schools & theyve always made digs at Sister & i for things we have (even looks, athletics & grades)

My dad workd on wall st so my sister & i were given immense privilege: Moms a SAHM, lived in a similar town, traveling, & no college-debt. Sis & I were never allowed material status items (Uggs Tiffany etc) bc Mom deemed them a waste but our cousins always had them. Im not sure y. maybe appearances? As a kid i didnt get why my juicy-wearin cuz said ‚Äòim poor‚Äô

SO Mom & Aunt Gigi r talking care for Gma (Alzheimers) Gigi pushes for Gma to stay living w her, Mom hates conflict so she just agrees w whateva Gigi says INCLUDING being removed frm Gmas will. Apparently she said ‚ÄúYou & ur fam dont need anything right?‚Äù Mom agreed & it snowballed into her regretting it & changing her mind. A Bad Move‚Ñ¢Ô∏è. This all couldve been avoided but Mom has apologized for going back on her word & took responsiblty‚Ä¶but the gag is Aunt Gigi wont let her back in the will!

Aunt Gigi controls Gmas money & homecare. This fight grew into a year-long feud thats tragically changed the family dynamic. Gigi declined the 90-10 split Mom suggested. Its more symbolic/about emotions than fairness or to take away from Gigi (she hasnt worked a steady job). She refuses to put Mom (by proxy: Sis & I) back into the will. Mom has gone low-contact w Gigi. No legal action bc Mom wants to be cordial w her sister & nieces. 

This leaves us granddaughters to sort out this sad situation but I can talk feelins w my therapist, would Sis & I be assholes if we asked our cousins to share their inheritance w us? 90% them 10% us. Sis & I would rather agree now & move on than have drama when Gma passes. It hurts being overlooked! Sis&I r nervous bc of our privilege & their debt/lowpaying jobs. 30F Cuz is an artist & 28F does temp jobs & fave hobby is riding horses. We support their dreams but its sticky. Sister is a software engineer & Im going into the medical field. Numbers may be a simple way to put all this behind us. R we being naive or petty? Diff povs are appreciated!

TLDR: My mom sis & I r written out of gmas will but my aunt & mom couldnt sort it out. AITA 2 try 2 resolve it by asking our cousins to share w us?",0.52
"AITA for being upset if my partner gets a cat? So I‚Äôve had my dog for 5+ years. She is 6yrs old and loves humans but has a known history of not liking other animals, esp cats (almost took off a cats tail from inside her crate since the cat was testing their luck‚Ä¶ bad stuff).

My partner and I have been together for 3+ years. We don‚Äôt live together but go to the same school. They frequently stay at my house, and my pup loves them and vice versa. My partner is well aware of her history, and has seen how she can react to other animals.

We finally have jobs this upcoming summer but will be moving to different places to finish out our training for the next 3-4 years. Since this is my partner's first time living on their own, they‚Äôd like to get a cat, even after knowing the history with my dog.

Though we are not living together, there will still be times that I will travel to them and vice versa. I wonder how well things will work when my dog hates cats. Though they have not purchased said animal yet, I‚Äôm distraught at the thought. Am I the asshole for being upset?

\*to clarify... We are big picture thinking here. I do not care what they do right now, in their own home. The issue is what happens in 3-4 years when we move in together. I wouldn't expect them to give up their cat after having them for 3-4 years (that's cruel). However, they understood that my dog is not a cat-loving animal.

\*further clarification....  The dog I adopted over 5 years ago was adopted under the conditions knowing she would not be able to live with other animals. This was known to me. I DO NOT bring her places like dog parks, out to eat at public places where there might be other dogs, or any other situations that would unnecessarily put her in a position to harm another animal. She has a fenced yard (8ft) and we go for walks almost every day. She wears a gentle leader, and she behaves. She doesn't lunge after other dogs, she is not outwardly aggressive, and has never growled. The times were she has been reactive to other animals, is when she was provoked (ie. another dog biting her, or a cat teasing her in her crate).  ",0.57
"AITA for being upset with family? Will try to keep this concise
3.5 years ago my spouse (34nb) and I (35f)moved in with their Grandma (93) when asked by family. Deal was companionship, and basic home maintenance from us, and free rent for us and our 2 kids, (2 bedrooms, all other space shared) with first right of refusal on the house and 3 months free rent when grandma passed or we could no longer provide care. It was said that I could be paid for care provided if needed, because I am a caregiver. At this time, we are well qualified to buy a house. Good income, Only student debt, really decent savings. We even put in an offer on a house and are outbid on same day as we are approached with this plan. 
April 2019: Grandma had pneumonia. Was v sick, went on hospice. Care required increased, but we were both still able to work full time and make it work.
July 2020: I am no longer able to go to work without direct covid exposure. I take an LOA because we don‚Äôt want grandma to die from covid. 
2020-Aug 2021: cares and dementia increase. I am professional caregiver with lots of experience. Care for grandma is not a problem, but they cannot be left alone, and I cannot work. 
Aug 2021: Speak to family and tell them we have been struggling. No income, and have used a chunk of savings and are now worrying about qualifying for a mortgage, and that we want to buy the house, and have been planning towards that as well as long term care for grandma. We present ideas (earn equity in house, or get paid for what I am an expert in) and equity is shot down, but they will look into paying us. 
Feb 2022: Family meets with lawyer with grandma and says they are looking into solutions. 
March 2022: they telegraph options: 15k gift or contract for services. 
We ask for 15k gift to cover last 6 mo of waiting, and a salary going forward,as well as some planned time for us to do activities with our kids over the summer. (Salary well below my market value) 

They come back with: Actually we don‚Äôt think the situation is healthy for your family. We don‚Äôt want to be employers. We are placing grandma in memory care immediately. We will give you 15k, and the 3 months free rent to decide about buying the house. 

We disagreed with placing grandma immediately, as her care is not a problem and we treat her as part of the family, but recognize it is their choice. We felt the way they just came up with a decision and didn‚Äôt really consult us with that big change and that we needed more time. 
We‚Äôve now been called greedy and manipulative by family and I am trying so hard to see their side. Am I missing something? They keep saying ‚Äúthis is the same thing that would happen if Grandma died‚Äù but our hang up is that this is an active decision on their part. Am I the Asshole for being upset about the timeline and what we feel is a lack of consideration about the sacrifices we‚Äôve made?",0.1

My family doesn't talk to me and  i feel like they ashmed. when hey do...it's not about important topics and they talk to me like I'm 9 
When they talk to my cousins they talk about  jobs and important topics that matter and they talk like adults 

Its so humiliating... i try to make them look stupid sometimes, like making fun of L because he doesn't know much stuff and pretends like he does, and M because  he doesn't know proper English but it's  usually just my family laughing at me 

M got job recently, i want to have job too, i was actually  looking for one but they laughed at me  "" you wouldn't  make it,  its hard ""  i dont know if they joking because  im fat or transphobic ( I'm trans guy but they refuse it :/ )  

Once my aunt said "" but **she** isn't  as **that** stupid"" she  was genuinely surprised.. that hurt me so much i wanted to cry 

I want to be like my cousins so badly i want to be taken seriously  i wish i was smart i really want that, im pathetic i never will be like them I'm  20 my life is waste .

"AITA for not defending my partner So my partner and I are at the mall buying underwear and I see this girl that works there and we don‚Äôt know each other but we hit it off and started talking for what went on to about 10/15 mins. So let‚Äôs call my partner Nathanial and the girl Taylor. Taylor could tell Nathanial was irritated, I felt the same way too but apparently Nathanial was cool and not mad. Taylor said directly to Nathaniel after saying something to me that she didn‚Äôt want to irritate Nathaniel and Nathaniel said ‚Äúgirl I‚Äôm not irritated. You both might as well exchange numbers with all the talking‚Äù. 

Now shortly after or before Taylor said something along the lines like ‚Äúwow mean‚Äù but she did call Nathaniel mean and he blew a huge fit about me not defending him when Taylor said that and said I should have told her that he was joking around and wasn‚Äôt being mean. But that‚Äôs not how I took it...? I really did think he came across rude and I‚Äôve told him countless of times that‚Äôs not cool and to be more aware of the things he says and how it sounds. He called Taylor that b-word as we were in the car heading home, and I said no I‚Äôm not ok with you calling a woman that. Of course he got even angrier saying I put everyone‚Äôs feelings above his and respect everyone but him. I said totally not true. If Taylor had called him a b-word, I would have been on her as well. I would have kept that same exact energy for anyone else whether you‚Äôre my family or not.

"WIBTA for refusing to use a prefered pronoun I have multiple non-binary friends and have no problems using they/them. Well now one of my friends wants to be known as it/itself. They do not mean as an object. Normally I would be fine with any pronoun but with the racist history of using that to dehumanize people it makes me extremely uncomfortable. Just to be clear my idea is to only use the person's name or that person over there, not to use different pronouns. I just feeling like I'm TA if I use it or not.

"AITA for asking why my friend is texting my girlfriend? Me and my friend have been friends since the first grade but I‚Äôve been feeling like he‚Äôs trying to slide in my lane. He has a girlfriend too and he made a comment yesterday about the soup she had. I don‚Äôt know how he even found out this info she only mentioned that the soup she had was really good. What I got from that is that he‚Äôs been talking to my girlfriend, but wait it gets worse. A bit ago me and him were at Batman, it was a really good movie but we both checked our messages a few times. So I look over at him and offer him one of my gummies and he‚Äôs texting my girlfriend, like wtf man. I would understand texting your own girlfriend but mine? It didn‚Äôt make sense too me. But wait, it gets worse. I ask him why he‚Äôs texting my girlfriend and he said ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to be dating her to be a ladies man‚Äù what the fuck man. You don‚Äôt have to be dating her to flirt with her? I think you do. This pisses me off even more because he has a girlfriend, he has one, but he talks to mine all the time. Haha, but wait it gets worse. Another time he brought up what house she was at, at the time she was at her dads house which is in the city. I was saying I wish I could go see her but her dad doesn‚Äôt like me, for her mom likes me but she lives in the country. My buddy preaches up and says ‚ÄúYeah she‚Äôs at her dads house this week‚Äù once again what the fuck. Why would you ask that? How do you know that? And today was the final damn straw. The teacher asked why she wasn‚Äôt here and he said ‚ÄúOh yeah she has covid‚Äù and had mentioned it before like I was oblivious to it happening. AITA for interrogating him because of this? I think I might be the asshole because they might just be friends, or it just came up in conversation. Thanks for listening.

EDIT: thanks for all the words, I‚Äôm talking to him and her about it and I‚Äôm gonna get to the bottom of it. I don‚Äôt feel so crazy or obsessive anymore.

EDIT 2: he‚Äôs saying it‚Äôs just what he does and he does it with everyone. Not to be a child but bro code states that you can‚Äôt be funnier than your homie around his girlfriend. It makes me think if when she sends me photos laughing if it‚Äôs because of him and not me.",0.1

"AITA for letting my 18-month-old son play with my husband‚Äôs watch that was given to him by his late grandfather and saying it wasn‚Äôt a big deal when he dropped it? My husband almost always wears a watch much to the delight of our son who loves playing/chewing them. Usually, if my husband is holding him and wearing a watch and he gets fussy for the watch my husband will just take it off and let him play with it. Our son has damaged two of his watches in the past and my husband wasn‚Äôt fazed by it.

So, my husband left his watch on the table which is somewhere our son could grab it from, which he did the minute he noticed the watch. He was playing with it and my husband‚Äôs cousin told me I shouldn‚Äôt let him since he could damage it and my husband‚Äôs late grandfather had given him that watch. I told her it was fine but my husband‚Äôs cousin kept trying to convince me to take the watch from him. Eventually my son dropped the watch and my husband‚Äôs cousin freaked out which made my son cry. I got upset with her and told her it wasn‚Äôt a big deal and to calm down since she was scaring him. 

She got angry with me and told me I should have more respect for my husband‚Äôs things and his family. My husband ended up coming back in the room because he heard our son crying and had to deescalate the situation but his cousin was still clearly mad at me by the time she left.

"AITA for leaving a note asking to move their car? So, I live in an apartment complex and I commute 80 miles ground trip a day. My parents are letting me borrow their full electric car since my fianc√© and I only have one car plus their car. 

We noticed one of our neighbors has a Tesla (another electric only car). Recently two new electric cars have shown up in the complex. One is a hybrid with capability of using gas and electric, the other I‚Äôm not sure.

Anyways, knowing there‚Äôs other people that need the charge we move our car when it‚Äôs done charging so other people can charge. But we noticed the owners of the new cars will leave their cars for hours in end after it‚Äôs done charging. 

We don‚Äôt know the owners and every time we contact to the complex about cars in the spots, nothing ever happens. 

I haven‚Äôt left a note or anything, but I am tempted to since we never see the owners and the office does nothing. I would say ‚Äúhello! When you‚Äôre done charging, can you please move your car so others can use the chargers? Thank you!‚Äù

I don‚Äôt want to be rude or aggressive but I feel like the asshole even when I am trying not to. If I saw the drivers I would ask them face to face but I think our schedules just don‚Äôt line up.

"AITA for walking out of a restaurant because my girlfriend ordered spaghetti? I [25m] am dating a woman [24] named Ally. We moved in together 5 months ago and I really love her a lot.

Ally just doesn't have great table manners. She eats noisily and sloppily. In a restaurant environment, usually this isn't too bad because of the natural ambient sound. In a quiet room, it's much more noticeable. I don't exactly like it, but usually I can tolerate it.

However, when Ally eats pasta, she slurps her noodles so loudly that people from other tables look. It's completely mortifying to hear people murmur about her loud slurping all the time. I know this might be normal in some cultures, but from where I'm from in the US, it looks really uncultured and bothers some people who are more sensitive to sounds. I've tried to teach her how to use a spoon to spin the pasta into a ball. Nope, she doesn't want to. I've tried to ask her to take smaller bites. Nope! That's how she eats pasta and that's how she'll always eat pasta. We've been to a local Italian restaurant half a dozen times, and each time but one (in a basically empty restaurant) she humiliated me with her loud slurpy eating. 

I know I shouldn't care what other people think, but I agree with the patrons. It's disgusting. People are trying to enjoy a meal. 

I finally got frustrated one day and told her that I wouldn't eat noodles with her in public anymore. She can eat alone, or she can go with friends. I'll happily drive her to the restaurant, but I will not sit down with her. She kind of blew off my message with a ""oh yeah you're perfect so I get it,"" and I thought that was that.

Last night, Ally really wanted to go to our local Italian place again. I asked her if she would be ordering spaghetti. She rolled her eyes and said she'd get the lasagna. I agreed that was fine and we went out for the first time in a while. When the waitress came to take our order, Ally completely went back on her promise and ordered spaghetti. I told the waitress I wouldn't be needing anything, stood up, and walked to our car. I relaxed in the car listening to a podcast until Ally came out a while later. She sat down and started giving me the silent treatment.

When we got home she yelled at me about embarrassing her, would not let me say a single word without shrieking over me, and said that she's only interested in an apology. I refused and she went to another room to loudly talk shit about me to herself (intentionally so I could hear).

"AITA if I don‚Äôt want to share my referral bonus with my sister? My (19F) sister (15F) wants to work at the same supermarket I'm working at, so I told my boss and now she has a job interview planned for tomorrow. However there is a referral bonus of ‚Ç¨250 for everyone who manages to get someone new to work at the company. My sister wants half of my bonus. I told her I wasn't going to share it with her, as it is my bonus. I offered her 25% but she only wanted half of it. If I didn't give her half, she wouldn't put my name in the application file and we would both get nothing. 

My parents are on her side and are saying that I should give her half of it because it's the norm and that's what everyone does with a referral bonus. When I said to my mom that my sister is blackmailing me she told me that she would have done the same. 

My parents told my they are disappointed in me and that if I wouldn't share it with her they would give my others siblings (3 total) all ‚Ç¨250. They also told me that I was greedy for keeping the money to myself and that it hurts them to see what kind of person I've become. 

But I think it is my bonus, I'm offering my sister a job that pays ‚Ç¨2 more per hour than her current job. And if she wants the bonus she should refer someone herself. Personally I don't think it's my parents business and they should stay out of it.",0.19
"AITA for being upset that my bf wasn‚Äôt honest about $20? My (F27) boyfriend (M26) moved in with me back in November when his roommate went crazy and he needed somewhere to go. He mentioned his budget during arguments with his roommate, and I told him I had no issue with his budget. He never really replied to this comment which I found strange. Fast forward to the end of the first month he lived with me. He didn‚Äôt pay rent, but did pay for some odds and ends. I didn‚Äôt really mention this since it wasn‚Äôt a huge problem financially at the time but I was rather thrown off by it. 

Last month my car broke down, $850 later it was road worthy but we were in a bad place. I asked him to find a job that could help him pay half of our rent. He found a job that is 3 days per 2 week span‚Ä¶ so he works once or twice per week and as you could imagine definitely cannot cover half of rent with that. He kept commenting that he was happy as long as his funds covered odds and ends.. I reinforced that he needed to pay half of rent. I guess that didn‚Äôt stick though. 
Months end came and he pitched in with what I couldn‚Äôt afford on rent. I was appreciative because I figured it may not have been much, but it was all he had and that still meant a lot to me. But the. I found out that he wasn‚Äôt being honest about how much he had been making through one of his side cash jobs. He had been telling me $160 but I found out it‚Äôs actually $180. It doesn‚Äôt seem huge for him to want to hold onto some cash by any means‚Ä¶ but when he‚Äôs watching me struggle it seems a bit unfair to lie. We had to borrow money from my mom (who is also struggling and losing her job soon) just so we could afford groceries. 

When I found out he had been dishonest about his side job money, he told
Me they had just bumped him up to $180 from $160 but didn‚Äôt specify when. That‚Äôs when I finally asked him why he had been swerving the conversation about paying rent back before he even moved in. That‚Äôs when he claimed he had told me from the start that he was broke and couldn‚Äôt afford rent. But he never did that at all, he would simply not respond whenever the topic of his rent budget came up between him and myself. 

I‚Äôm starting to feel like an idiot who is being strung along and used. At the same time I understand wanting to have SOME money for yourself, so I feel guilty for being upset. If he had been honest, it‚Äôs not like I would‚Äôve refused him spending money. I just want help when I‚Äôm desperately struggling. I just want it to be more equal. As it stands, he covers about $300-$400 of our expenses each month ($200 of that being bi monthly when he receives free grocery coupons which we use on food). I contribute just under $2k. I pay all the rent, gas, insurance, and even for coffees when we go out to Tim hortons. 

Am I being unreasonable for being upset? He‚Äôs been locked up in our bedroom on his phone for over an hour since we talked. My feelings are valid but I don‚Äôt want to be an AH.


UPDATE

We had a conversation about it and it didn‚Äôt feel very promising. He just kept telling me that ‚Äúhe didn‚Äôt mean to lie‚Äù even though I kept repeating that he did‚Ä¶ I told him I want it to be equal by months end and he said that makes him feel like he‚Äôs ‚Äúa failure already‚Äù and tried turning it into past trauma stuff. I held my ground and told him the past is past and this is now, and now I need things to be equal.

"AITA for telling my fiance's sister to pay rent or get out? I(29F) live with my fiance(28M). We moved into a very spacious¬†two-bedroom apartment.  We share one room and there is an empty room downstairs. We recently adopted a tuxedo cat"" Max"" that prefers to be the only animal.  The complex does have a fee for animals which is about $40 a month. My fiance does not like any kind of conflict. There has been conflict in the past when his sister(26F) stayed in our apartment, and the experience was terrible. She decided to move back home and last I heard she was living with her boyfriend. 

My fiance and I work different shifts during the week. Everything is split between the two of us and we do not share finances. The lease is under my name, not my fiances. I came home one evening and saw sister watching TV. A German shepherd was laying on the floor, chewing on a bone. I go into the kitchen to grab dinner and asked his sister what she was doing here. She turns around and tells me that she and her boyfriend split. Fiance came home and told me that sister was going to be staying with us until she finds a place. This happened in February, it's now April and she is still living with us. 

She does work and won't spend a dime unless it's on herself. My fiance pays for everything for her, vet bills, extra money towards rent, her food, car payments, gas, credit cards. She and the dog were not allowed upstairs as respect for privacy. I come home one evening and see her dog chasing Max around. I yell at her to get her dog under control and start pitching in or get the heck out. I even mentioned small claims court. She started crying and left the apartment. My fiance got home and started yelling at me that I was out of line and should have been more understanding of the situation.

"AITA Grilling at community grills in an apartment complex I live in an apartment complex that has charcoal grills at various community areas. I use them about once or twice a week.

"AITA for telling my s/o to take care of her puppy better? My s/o has a dog that has *just* reached about 1 year old, a brutal and highly energetic mix between a German Shepard, Rottweiler, and Labrador named Pua, which is a very stark contrast to my s/o's more, ""sleepy girl"" energy. She rarely plays with the dog, and the pup is always either in a cage, or hooked up to a run outside where no one comes out to play with her. No fetch, no runs, no puppy soccer, not really much of anything. Her parents come from Mexico where from she tells me that the accepted methods for raising puppies include leaving them outside all the time and feeding them whatever leftover food comes from the dinner table, so in other words, very little need to house train. 

I have always had a hand in or been directly involved in the house training of my pups, and so this sort of rearing my s/o's parents engage in is pretty alien to me and I always feel sorry for the pup. Here where we live it happens to get very cold during winters and so Pua can't remain outside for long periods of time, obviously. So their solution? Build a little house outside where it has a hinged screen door covered by a tarp.

I have *had* a problem with this, so earlier tonight (EST), I snapped when she brought up adoption and said, ""Yeah she goes outside. For hours, with no one to play with her. You put her in the cage at night, sleep, take her out in the morning when she whines, hook her up, leave her until you go to school, bring her in and lock her up again, come back from school when *you know* no one has taken her out, put her outside, don't play with her, don't run with her, you just leave her, for another so many hours, then you bring her inside because it's too cold, where you lock her in the cage *again* and maybe you take her out right before you go to bed, but half the time you don't then she goes to sleep and the process repeats. You cannot raise a dog like that, she needs attention, and love and time. I know you love her, but come on now.""

(This whole exchange happened less than an hour ago so it is still pretty fresh in my mind). I feel bad if only because maybe I should have just let her give Pua up as maybe she isn't ready for a dog yet, and her parents don't help, but I want my s/o to have some enrichment in her life besides the two times a week we get to see each other, so I don't want her to give up. It is *her* dog that *she* asked for, I had no hand in it, now I just feel like I pushed a little too much.

TL;DR: My s/o wasn't taking very good care of her dog by repeatedly caging and hooking her up outside for protracted periods of time. I found issue with this and spoke my mind telling her to take care of her dog better and give it more attention, and I feel like I might have overstepped and just allowed her to put the dog up for adoption and dealt with the ensuing depression she would have entered despite my intention being to keep her from not having anything to focus on.",0.39

"AITA for suggesting that my (step) kids‚Äô mother should give up custody?

My husband and I have 2 kids (4F, 2M) as a married couple, I love my husband‚Äôs kids so much to the point that I don‚Äôt like to call them my step kids but my kids.

Lizzy struggled financially in the past so she gave up custody partially, from 50/50 to 80/20 in our favour.

Two years ago, Lizzy couldn‚Äôt afford her rent anymore and had no place to go so we let her move in until she settled down, her time here was stressful to me and I hated it, she made clear that she hates me and, complains about how my husband comes from a family with money and it wasn‚Äôt fair for his kids‚Äô mother to struggle. She was here for 5 months (a dark era for me) my husband and I weren‚Äôt comfortable but did it for the kids. 

She is struggling again (financially) and wants us to let her stay here but I don‚Äôt feel like it, thus she says that not letting her it wouldn‚Äôt be fair for the kids because They won‚Äôt see her since she doesn‚Äôt have a safe place to stay and her parents live so far away, it means she won‚Äôt see the kids in a while.

So, I told her: ‚ÄúIf you can‚Äôt afford a safe place and the kids a better with us, you should give up custody and let the kids be with us full time‚Äù 

She got mad at me and at my husband (‚Äúfor doing nothing‚Äù on this) and said that it was out of the question.

Her friends are accusing me of ‚Äúkeeping her away from her children‚Äù and said that the suggestion ‚ÄúYou should give up custody‚Äù is absolutely out of the question. She made a post on how we use money as ‚Äúa weapon‚Äù to cast her aside, she told the kids and now they are mad at me too.

"AITA for finding a wedding dress without my mom? **I DO NOT GIVE PERMISSION FOR THIS TO BE SHARED ON ANY OTHER SITE**
I'm on mobile, so forgive formatting and autocorrect.

Background: I'm getting married in a little over year and my mom offered to buy my dress. She gave me a budget for what she would pay for and I said that I would cover the rest. My mom lives about 4 hours from me but wants to help with the wedding since I'm her only daughter.

Cut to today: I decided last minute this week to go look at some preliminary dress ideas because I wanted to start looking soon because I was told at another boutique (where my mother was with me) that the dress could take 6 to 8 months to get in, plus another 2 months for alterations. Because of CORVID, I still had to make an appointment with any boutique. I had no intentions of buying a dress today, just trying to see what I liked on me. So the only people who got to go were one of my bridesmaids and a friend. 

It happened that I found a dress I fell in love with and absolutely knew it was ""the dress"". It was about twice what my mom had said she would give me, but i was okay with that. I excitedly called my matron of honor (my step sister) on my friend's phone and she was happy for me, so was my step mom. However when I video chatted with my mom while still on the phone with my sister, mom didn't seem excited. I asked what was wrong and she said she was upset that she wasn't there to see it in person and help me and she wanted me to look at another dress she liked at the other boutique. I asked her if I should wait to buy anything and I can make another appointment and we can look at dresses together. She said that there was no point and that if I found the dress, I might as well get it. She told me, ""I don't know what to say. Do what makes you (me) happy. Anything else is wrong and stupid of me (her), as usual"". So I made arrangements to buy it so I could get the process started of getting it made. But I was crushed, I was so excited, but now I feel guilty for looking without my mom. Now my mom is saying she will pay for the whole dress, but she doesn't seem excited, and she's been really quiet. My step sister and friends say I'm not TA because it's my wedding and the dress should be about me, not her.

"AITA? My husband pulled a minor prank and it upset me. My husband just got an awesome new job, we'll be moving a couple of hours away into a really beautiful home roughly 3x the size of our current home, so we went out looking for furniture and stuff. We applied for credit which I assumed we'd automatically be approved for and just had to wait half an hour for their credit team to get back to us. I took his daughter to get some stuff for her new room and when I came out he told me the finance had been denied and we'd need to cut the bill in half. I was really disappointed, mainly for him because I'm fine with our current furniture and the most costly item was a massage chair because he works a physical job and it just seemed like a small reward for how hard he works. About 10 minutes later while I'm sitting there trying to figure out how not to make him sad he says it was just a joke of course we've been approved. I know this seems stupid and I own that I have pretty decent anxiety so I know my reaction of getting strung out when he said it was a joke is on me but it hurts that he knows my one big tic is my anxiety (I do everything I can to manage it, I don't drink coffee or eat sugar anymore, do yoga, take supplements, see a therapist, actually do the homework the therapist sets). My reaction was to get out of the car and have a cigarette, when I got back in the car I told I was sorry but I just don't think purposefully stressing me out is funny.

He just keeps saying its a prank and I need to learn to take a joke but I feel this is akin to me putting a little bit of hair removal cream on his head every night so he thinks his hair line is receding way faster and then when he's stressed out just telling him it was a prank. Am I being oversensitive and being an AH or should partners not stab at each others weak spots?

Edit: I would mot actually use hair removal cream on my husband and I understand its a lot more extreme and long terms with physical consequences. It was less of a comparison of severity as his only anxiety is his receding hairline and I'd be purposefully be exploiting his vulnerable bits. Maybe I should've compared it to telling him I was checking out dating sites.",0.08

She tried to lecture me about it not being ok but this is the second time ever I had the cat away from the house (not counting vet). The first time was because I went to africa to meet my spouses family and couldn‚Äôt bring him with me so I asked the same friend and she watched him for two weeks, no issues. 

She always tries to judge me, like if I have some dirty dishes in the sink when she‚Äôs over she makes a big deal and her and her boyfriend cleans it. If there‚Äôs recycling left out cause I didn‚Äôt bring them to the box downstairs she makes a big deal. It‚Äôs to the point where I don‚Äôt invite her over because I go to school and work so I don‚Äôt have time to clean the house from top to bottom every time she comes over. 

Today She ended up bringing the cat back before the landlord arrived because she had other plans and didn‚Äôt think the cat would take this long (I asked her to watch the cat days ago).

"AITA for not going to my friends dinner party? For context: I would say I‚Äôm a pretty chill person and I feel like I don‚Äôt care that much about dumb drama but this really got to me. 

I (19m) am at college, and there was some big party going on that night and my friends and I wanted to go. One of my friends (20f), we‚Äôll call her C, want to go out to dinner with everyone before the party so she invited everyone, except my two best friends, K (19f) and M (19f). I didn‚Äôt think I could go because of a speech and debate tournament so I didn‚Äôt pay to much attention to the group chat and I didn‚Äôt notice they were left out. All of the  other friends (6 of them) did notice and asked if M and K could be invited, C said no.  One of them even asked if M, K, and a third boy could be invited, C only invited the boy. 

I thought the whole thing was just stupid drama and I went to the tournament without thinking about it. Long story short, I did not do very well at the tournament and came home early. I didn‚Äôt want to invade the dinner plan since I came home pretty close to dinner, so I went to dinner with M and K. 

We got to the party and C walks right over to me and says, ‚ÄúI look at Snapchat and I could see you hanging out with M and K instead of out dinner, care to explain?‚Äù I did, and C didn‚Äôt believe me and didn‚Äôt speak to me the rest of the night.

The next day rolls around and I see C walking in our dorm and I look pissed at her because of last night and she asks me if anything was wrong. This is where I may be the AH, I burst out and say ‚ÄúYou were being so rude to K and M and your just acting like nothing happened last night when you didn‚Äôt say a word to me?!?‚Äù (pretty paraphrased) She said ‚ÄúI did invite them! (I later found out she invited them 30 minutes before the dinner started) You ditched me just to go with them and then you lied about it!!!‚Äù I just walked away because the whole thing was like Keeping up with the Kardashians and it was stupid.

Two months later and C still hasn‚Äôt spoken to me even if I try to talk to her. No else cares or even remembers except her and she won‚Äôt let it go.

"AITA for storming out of the house on my dad? So I (18F) was sitting at the dinner table last night with my family and my bf, Connor (18M). We were talking about some recent drama in the friend group
and I mentioned a guy I used to talk to (20M). Then my dad (50M) randomly interrupts me and sarcastically says,
""Connor, don't you love it when she talks about her exes?""

I was really pissed and started defending myself bc 1) I only have 1 ex and 2) it was unnecessary, Connor isn't bothered when I share things from my past with him. He's been the only romantic partner
in my life for a year now and the drama we were talking about was about the guy I used to talk to and my friend anyways. 

So anyways, today I tried to tell my dad very calmly that it frustrated me and embarrassed me when he called me out for something like that. I asked if he could try to refrain. He started
yelling at me for ""coming at him"" and professed that he's a ‚Äúfifty-year old man"" and ""can't promise"" he won't say something like that again. He also
maintained he's my dad and will do and say what he wants and I can't control that.

"AITA for going tit-for-tat with my penny pinching partner? For context; I M20 living with partner of 5y F20, unmarried, joint mortgage, otherwise no commitments

My partner and I have a vastly different income (in the order of 2/3 times larger in my favour), but we have always been (at least we have tried to be) 50/50 on everything, this includes mortgage, bills, savings, emergencies etc etc. 

Recently my partner has decided that a loan that I had taken out for home improvements (low 5 figures) was not her responsibility to pay back, since she claims she did not agree at the time and did bot agree to the purpose of the loan (interestingly she remarked she would have been quite happy to save towards the remodelling work and then do it instead of the loan) although has been quite happy to have a say in how it was spent (every single penny has went into home improvements - we also went slightly over-budget on the kitchen and bathroom remodel, so I have probably paid another few thousand out of my own pocket to help make that even). I do not disagree with her feeling upset/angry that she has realised that she had perhaps not fully understood the commitment, or if she feels that what we agreed at the time was something different, but at the end of the day we are where we are and I obviously cannot undo that financial commitment 18 months down the line.

I remarked that if she did not want to have responsibility for the loan then i would b happy to pay it back in full from my own money on the condition that we re-visit the agreement we made when we purchased the house that said everything would be jointly owned to value to take into account the money that I have spent (through the loan and also the out of pocket expenses) and this really set her off and she accused me of emotional/financial abuse and gaslighting(?)

In response to that I have backed down on amending anything to do with the valuation of the house and have instead decided that I will only be contributing the bare minimums towards the upkeep of the house (mortgage, bills, food, insurance etc) but will not be contributing towards any other discretionary spending unless it has been discussed and agreed in writing (nothing formal but somewhere we have a record e.g. text message)

I‚Äôve also made it clear that I do not plan on having any holidays this year together and will be cutting down on eating out/days out/going out for meals - since I am conscious of the difference in disposable incomes this has always something that I have broken our 50/50 rule for, we have been on several holidays over the last 3/4 years which I‚Äôve not asked my partner to contribute towards at all, I also will always pay the bills etc in full for meals etc. Its my view that she perhaps doesn‚Äôt realise how much of our spending is not in fact 50/50 so if she really doesn‚Äôt want to pay towards the loan then I shouldn‚Äôt continue with this

"AITA for telling my mom to stop embarrassing me? Me (14) and my mom have been fighting since this morning.

I didn‚Äôt know her all to well and didn‚Äôt think much about it but i was just trying to keep my cool as any other kid my age would. We start ordering and as my classmate takes our order I notice my mom ask my older brother to ‚Äústretch her out‚Äù, she does this often and what she really means is she wants us to pull on her back when it hurts. My brother begins to do so in front of other people in the store. My mom starts making some questionable noises and basically moaning.

I have told my boss I would be willing to pick up occasional Friday nights since my husband works from home and I can get to work at a reasonable time. My boss usually asks before scheduling, but scheduled me to work this Friday without asking. I am fine with this since I like working, but my husband was really annoyed and doesn‚Äôt want me to work.

So my best friend, let‚Äôs call them Lex, who lives pretty far away, is visiting for a week

Some of mine and my partner, C‚Äôs, friends were at C‚Äôs place and Lex was there too. We all played mario because C found their old wii and myself and the rest of our mates went out for a bit to go for a pint, leaving Lex and C at their place as Lex didn‚Äôt want to come out.

"AITA For telling my mom she doesn't deserve a car, but my dad does? I'll try to make this as clear as possible.

So my dad's car got totaled maybe 3 or 4 years ago? He loved his car a lot, it was a unique color and had a lot of features he really liked. Since my mom had her own car and worked mostly from home, they decided my dad would take her car to work because we were paying for college and not really in a position to purchase another car (they got both their cars used, at the same time).

Anyways, this system worked for whenever my mom needed to travel since she used my car (which I didn't need in college), but since I moved back home it was getting increasingly difficult for me and her to share the car. I started a job recently, which is when my mom decided she needed her own car for travel.

The problem is this: I told my mom that I think my dad should get a ""new"" car, and my mom can take hers again. My dad has looked at cars every night ever since the accident hoping that he can get his own car instead of driving my mom's. She and I both know how much he misses his car, because he talks about it all the time. My mom told me that that car wasn't ""safe"" for her to drive, even though my dad drives it to and from work every day. I told her that makes no sense and it's unfair that she's getting a second car and my dad is still going to want for a few more years.

I know that what they do with their money is their business, but my mom doesn't think that my dad is deserving of a car at all. Her argument is that he can never keep his car clean, which is true. He has some hoarding tendencies and I've seen how many boxes he packed into his old car and in my mom's car (that he drives). She says that she will not buy a car that he can't take care of, which is also a fair point.

I'm a bit confused about all this and would love some objective advice on who's the AH here.

EDIT: I will gladly be the AH here and apologize to my mom, the last thing I want is to cause a rift. Additional info is that my dad did not total his OWN car, he was hit by a drunk driver and my mom took the check to pay for other stuff. My mom still calls the car my dad drives her car. My mom discusses finances with me (23), not my dad, which is why I felt I should weigh in. All that said, it wasn't my place. Thank you all for the advice",0.98
"WIBTA if I confront an acquaintance about a pet sitting fee? Okay, small stakes here. Two weeks ago a neighbor and his wife asked me to pet sit their two cats. It is less than a 1/4 mile from my house and it is literally on my way to work. The wife said that they would pay me $30 to check in twice in 1 week (that's not enough times IMO). All I had to do was keep their food topped off and scoop their litter box. They have a water dispenser so I wouldn't have to worry about that. Easy peasy. Of course, I said yes. 
  When I went to pick up the key and get specifics, the husband said that it was going to be almost too easy to have to pay $30 and that his wife told him to offer the money, but I would probably volunteer to do it for free. I replied that the $30 would come in really handy. He reiterated that his wife told him to offer me the money but that I would most likely do it for free. 
 Since I absolutely HATE confrontation, felt like I was blind sided and he was correct in a way because it was very easy to do, I just folded and said, ""Fine, I will do it for free.""  
I took care of the cats (three times) and it really didn't take me long at all.

"AITA for not wanting to spend time with my wife's friends and family My wife and I have been together for 12 years. We both have similar tight knit friend groups. 

The thing is, her friends are sort of insufferable. If ""This is Us"" was a real family, it would be them. Their entire family has a ""thing"" and some of it is genuine and some of it seems like straight bullshit. 

My wife just today was complaining about how she felt her friendship with this person has become one sided. I agreed with her and told her that her friend has always been attention seeking and had sprinkles of Munchausen's (an exaggeration but not off target)

Also, the past 2 weekends we have spent time with her dad. Her dad is her only living parent and lives out of state. So whenever he's in town (which is usually for doctor's appointments, not specifically to see my wife) we end up seeing a lot of him in a short period of time. 

My wife had asked me a few weeks ago if I wanted to attend her friend's birthday party for her kids this upcoming Sunday. I guess I said yes. I genuinely don't remember the conversation. I really don't like her friends and most likely said yes because this has been a topic of contention between us in the past. So to mitigate any bad feelings I likely agreed to it even though I didn't want to.

Then today my wife asked if I'd want to spend time with her dad again on Saturday. I was apprehensive and didn't reply at first. A little while later my wife recommended going to a restaurant that I do enjoy with her family and I figured that would make it more tolerable so I agreed. 

Then she reminded me of the birthday party. It felt like she sprung a trap on me. I mentioned offhandedly that my whole weekend was shot now. She started getting upset about it when I said I didn't want to do both things. She said I ""always do this"". I got pissed and mentioned that we never argue about my friends and family, and we only somehow argue about hers.

I just saw her dad 2 weekends in a row for several hours each. I made no complaints about it. I really don't feel like wasting a third weekend seeing the same people again. I'm not stopping my wife from seeing him

Then the issue with her friends. I don't like them. I've mentioned that before. We've argued about it before. I've never once told her not to hang out with her friends. But I constantly get dragged into it. I always feel guilted into agreeing in the moment because of our previous history of arguments.

My wife said she would prefer me to say no off the bat than to say yes and then take it back. But if I do say no she still gives me a hard time. I get put into impossible positions where it feels like I lose either way. If I don't go then she ""has to make another excuse for why I didn't go"" but if I do go then she gets pissed that I'm in a shitty mood the whole time.

I absolutely love my Emily, she is smart, gorgeous, independent and supportive. But this is this one time I‚Äôve been frustrated and needed a verdict. So we are planning out our guest list and it is becoming an issue. Emily comes from a small scattered family. A dad, a mom and a step sibling, 1 grandparent, 1 uncle/aunt, 1 cousin and a few other relatives. She isn‚Äôt that close to a lot of her HS friends anymore. So her entire guest list is less than 15 people. She only had 3 girls she wanted as bridesmaids. 

Well I come from an American-Italian family. My immediate family (grandparents, uncles/aunts, cousins) is over 100 people. I also played sports competitively in Hs and was in a frat in college. I also play golf and softball now. I have a large network of friends, frat brothers, Hs friends, teammates and family friends that I want to invite. My guest list (after trimming some) was over 175 people. Emily has been complaining about this. Not about the cost (my parents/family are helping a ton) but that ‚Äúher‚Äù side is way out numbered. I told her that was ridiculous because everyone was there for both of us. But she kept saying how self conscious this made her. 

So I tried compromising. We said no kids under 16 in order to eliminate some of my family. I also said no plus ones for anyone not married. I also had to cut my groomsman way down after she could only find 3 bridesmaids. I had to make like 6 ushers so I could include them in the wedding party. I also had the idea of some of my family/friends wearing a button that said ‚Äúteam bride‚Äù on them to show support for Emily. But she keeps complaining and saying I need to cut down the list. She won‚Äôt even give a number that I need to trim too. Just too where it ‚Äúisn‚Äôt as noticeable‚Äù. I finally snapped last night and told her to get over it.

Context: I (22F) migrated into the Netherlands 4.5 years ago and my life has been a shitshow. was promised all the support and to go to college by my family. That was the sole reason that they wanted me to migrate here. From housing to my education  everything. Their words not mine.I was literally left to fend for myself .Despite their so called ""help"", I was mostly alone.I got kicked out from my aunts house after suffering from ptsd and depression after being vi****ed by 2 men just 3 months after moving here.They hated me cause i wasnt able to keep up the Golden Child spiel that they imagined me to be and even blamed me for being (R-word)ed.I kissed their asses nonstop just so they would ""undisown"" me.

I have been recently blessed with my own house a month ago after living as a homeless human doormat for years .I actually only really got help from 1 cousin of mine during the whole move that lasted 2 weeks. I understood it was because my aunts were busy preparing for their establishment so whatever right? I asked if I could apply and they just laughed it off saying it was ""too expensive "" to pay me and that ""they cant afford someone who wont show up"". 

A month passes and they do some tasting of the upcoming drinks that they have and my cousins (ages 17 to 23 )are all excited.. They're talking about which days they're gonna be working.They try on shirts that they'll be using for the opening event and I was actually getting all hot and teary but i held it in cause my son actually did receive a shirt in his size for the opening and i felt bad for feeling bad lol so i just kept quiet. I had questions in my head and it felt like my stomach and my brain were on this fierce battle lmao . I have told my aunt months ago that i am in search of a job just until i get back on track for school around sept.

My goal is actually to just get 2-3 half days of work so I can get  rights to Daycare(the govt pays 90% of daycare if you work or go to school) I really want my son (1) to attend daycare so he socialize more and my aunt is very well aware of this.She questioned me many times if i have sent him to daycare yet. I have asked several times if i can apply for the shop but they would either just laugh or brush it off but now im just too embarrased to ask. The final straw is when my cousin asked me which days i would be working and i just jokingly replied ""I dont know yet, our aunt is quite indecisive so im still figuring that out""
I couldnt possibly tell them that I was never offered a job there nor was i even invited or asked out to help for the opening. My heart literally was in pieces after being asked that question.I wanna know for sure if im wrong or not before i confront them once more. Im not sure if im angry cause im denied a job or because im spiteful that i have been left in the dark for so long.
 I truly believe that THEY OWE ME A LOT after all ive been through.

WIBTA if i tell them that they owe me atleast the chance of working there after neglecting me for years?

WIBTA if i cut off ties with my family if they deny me?",0.82
"AITA: I yelled at a neighbor whose dog ran at me I was biking with my little kids who just got off training wheels. We went past a house where a guy was sitting on his front porch with his dog. As I was right in front of him, the dog bolted at me, fast. I saw a dark brown blur with teeth headed for me.

I had an instant adrenaline rush. All those things they teach you are true. Tunnel vision, I saw red, I was ready to fight this dog. So I did kind of fall over off my bike, but not all the way down. 

The guy showed no reaction, and I yelled ‚Äúwhat the fuck!?‚Äù He still did t say anything or move. I at least expected an apology, but he didn‚Äôt even call his dog back. I had tunnel vision so I didn‚Äôt even know where the dog was at this point. ‚ÄúControl your fucking dog!‚Äù I yelled in my meanest voice. He still just sat there smirking so I said, ‚ÄúIf your dog comes near me again, I‚Äôm calling animal control.‚Äù

My kids had kept riding and didn‚Äôt really seem to care. When I got home I texted some friends in the neighborhood and asked if they knew any bald men with big, mean shaggy dogs and told them my version of the story. They couldn‚Äôt think of who it might be.

Then my wife got home. My kid told her ‚ÄúCowboy scared Daddy.‚Äù The kid knew the dogs name? I told my wife the story and she laughed. Cowboy is an Australian Shepard, and she and the kid are on friendly terms with the owner and I‚Äôve met him a couple times. Apparently it‚Äôs the sweetest, most playful dog ever. Deep in the recesses of my memory, I recall having chatted with the guy while he walked Cowboy. All the neighborhood moms are now texting me to make fun of me for getting scared by this dog. 

So does the shock and adrenaline rush excuse me from screaming at a guy I kind of know whose dog is actually friendly? AITA? Do I owe the guy an apology?

Edit: one thing I should add is that although I‚Äôm not afraid of dogs at all, this scared the absolute shit out of me. I was still shaking when my wife got home a half hour later.",0.79

"AITA for yelling at my parents for taking away my phone I paid for? Formatting issues because on mobile, sorry.

Me (16M) Got my phone taken away for having ‚Äúbad grades‚Äù by my parents. For context, i‚Äôm a pretty sporty/athletic kid who well lets just say isn‚Äôt going to Harvard anytime soon. I get roughly Bs and As but not many As. I think my grades are fine and i don‚Äôt see a reason on why it would be token away. Also, my phone is a iPhone 12, that i had saved years for which i got earlier this year.

So the day report cards came home, I went to my room and heard a knock on the door then my parents barging in. They said ‚ÄúYour grades haven‚Äôt met our standards, We will be taking your phone in-till they improve.‚Äù Now obviously I wasn‚Äôt happy about this and said why, but they just didn‚Äôt respond.

"AITA for being so stubborn about how to help my friend get down off a mountain? **Me:** 45, cis male, experienced hiker, lives in West Coast

**Linda:** 38, cis female, less experienced hiker, had surgery to repair a torn knee ligament about 6 months ago, lives in East Coast

Recent camping & hiking trip at Yosemite National Park. Linda wanted to use this opportunity to test out her newly rehabilitated knee. Our very first hike: Lower Yosemite Falls Trail (1.2mi-loop, 59ft of elevation gain). No problems. Next day we tackle Upper Yosemite Falls Trail (7.6mi roundtrip, 3,218ft!). Linda wore a knee brace on the impacted knee. We made it to the top & had lunch. She mentioned that her knee not operated on was experiencing twinges of pain, but she was not concerned.

We then started back. Linda was cautiously making her way down the steep descent. She was going at a very slow pace, around 0.5 miles/hour. She insisted I go ahead. I would hike a few feet, wait for her & then repeat. At one point, I lost track of her & waited a very long time at one of the switchbacks. I asked some of the hikers coming down & they mentioned that she was sitting & appeared to be resting. I tried calling her, but her phone wasn‚Äôt on. She finally caught up & mentioned that she fell backward, her bad knee extended! But no major pain.

I decided to follow Linda more closely behind her. She became quite irritated & asked that I instead continue to hike ahead of her, down the trail a few feet & then wait for her to catch up & then hike further down, etc. I very strongly disagreed & said it would be better for me to be behind her, as I can more quickly come to her aid going downhill rather than uphill. But she demanded that I go ahead. I then suggested that I stay 15 feet or more behind her, if she was so uncomfortable with me being close behind her. She then became more irritated & even suggested that I go ahead & hike all the way down & just wait for her at the trailhead. Absolutely not an option. She asked me if I had ever felt uncomfortable with a stranger following me before. I said yes, but I was not a stranger to her, I thought we were friends! I got so mad that I did hike back up the trail to show her how far I would be, so that she wouldn‚Äôt even know I was there. This made her even more indignant. She sat down & refused to start hiking until I go ahead of her! Very annoyed at this point, I said that I would wait until she started hiking. So, we sat 10 ft away from each other on the trail waiting for the other. I called two of my hiker friends to ask them for advice. One said that I should just go ahead & stay close. The other said I should stay with or behind her. While I was talking to one friend, she started calling out to me demanding that I go ahead of her. Quite pissed, I finally relented, and after 4 hours of me hiking ahead, waiting, etc, we made it off the mountain. We processed what happened. But she felt resolute that I was supposed to respect her wishes around her boundary & her autonomy. We both apologized. But I don‚Äôt really feel sorry. AITA?",0.5
"AITA for taking my fianc√©e's name even though my dad is upset about it? My name is one single first name followed by a long string of last names. It goes:

Michael GrandmothersMaidenName MothersMaidenName FathersSurname 

My mom later got divorced and dropped my dad‚Äôs name. Then when she got remarried she took my stepdad‚Äôs name. But I kept and still have my dad‚Äôs last name. On an emotional level I didn‚Äôt really care if you called me ‚ÄúMike MothersMaidenName‚Äù or ‚Äúthat StepfathersSurname kid‚Äù but on a practical level it did get confusing at times. On an aesthetic level I preferred how FirstName FathersSurname sounded.

My dad is one of those people that deeply cares about the family name being carried on, he's an only child and I'm his only child. I‚Äôve known for years that I wanted kids so I said yep don‚Äôt worry it will happen I‚Äôll carry on your legacy. Plus his last name is one of those names that works with a lot of first names and just rolls off the tongue really nicely. Most of my past serious partners were very open to taking it and/or passing it on to hypothetical kids.

Then I met my fianc√©e. In a strange coincidence, her name is the same as my stepdad‚Äôs (they‚Äôre not related, we checked lol). Obviously the most logical solution is to kill two birds with one stone here. If I take her name then I can share a name with my partner and future kids as well as with my mom, stepfather, and younger half-siblings on my mom‚Äôs side. But of course it feels like a huge betrayal to my dad.

My fianc√©e would be open to using my last name instead if I really pushed for it, but I don‚Äôt want to. I feel badly for my dad but it just feels like the obvious choice, and a lifetime of growing up with a string of last names means I don‚Äôt want to tack more names onto my future‚Äô kids names like hyphenate or come up with some brand new combined name. He‚Äôs upset at me for going back on my word.

Even now people sometimes think I‚Äôm my stepdad‚Äôs bio son because we both have very blonde hair and blue eyes, and this will only make things worse. I get why my dad would feel like this is me abandoning him/his side of the family or choosing my stepdad over him.

**TL;DR: I‚Äôve always promised my dad I would pass his name to my children. Then I met my fianc√©e who shares the same surname as my stepdad, and it makes more logical sense for our future family to adopt her/his name instead.**",0.47

"AITA for not wanting to go on my mom's wedding? *I'm sorry for the english mistakes, it's not my first language*

Me (17F) have been living with my mom and my stepdad since I was 6, (before that used to be just me and my mom). They're getting married on November and by then I will be 18. 
I understand that this is her special day and I never want to ruin it,  but I've been feeling left out of this because she has been literally putting me aside of all of it. First, she told me I would be a maid of honor. I decided a dress, a gift for our new house and I had ready started saving money for it. But today, making the bridesmaid and groomsmen gifts I notice my name wasn't on it. When I asked why she said ""You are not one of them"", and asked why once again and she said ""You're going to be the flower girl with your sister (7F) and your cousin (6F)""
(I undestand that in other countries it's normal to have older flower girls, but here in Brazil, it's usually kids, around the ages of my sister and my cousin.)
For a second I was alright about it, at least I'm participating of the ceremony, but then the reality came. I will have to wear the same dress as them (I would by fine with it if the dress wasn't HIDEOUS), I won't be in any ceremony photos, I won't be on my parents side, I won't be able to be on the maids dance (witch I helped my mom to prepare), I will not be allowed to wear make-up just like my sis and cousin and, the worst of all, I won't be able to give them the gift and make the speech I already wrote.
I don't know if I'm beeing selfish or spoiled but I've been with them, alone for 12 years, more than half of the bridesmaid, so yeah, I am really sad about it, and I told her I don't want to join something too special for me and my loved ones and don't be so close to them like I have been in the last 12 years, and she said she was ok with the idea of my not going to the wedding because she would be saving ""money for more food""
So am I the asshole for telling her I am not going?

"AITA for saying I don't like ""Turning Reds""s style? This is super minor but now I feel like an idiot and I'm wondering if I accidentally said something shitty, which wasn't my intention.

I'm (24F) a film student, so of course a bunch of us were talking about different shows and movies that have come out and what we thought about them. This girl mentioned ""Turning Red"" and how she loves it even though a bunch of people on the Internet were complaining that it was cringy and that the animation ""isn't realistic"". I haven't seen Turning Red cause I don't have Disney+, but I have seen clips and trailers and I agreed that I find the style off putting, and although I wasn't planning on watching it originally, I've heard some good things so now I'm curious.

I'm trying to stay word for word cause I honestly don't know what happened, but the girl started defending stylized CGI  and I agreed that and used ""Wish Dragon"" as an example of a movie with stylized Chinese characters that I liked better, I just don't like what they did with Turning Red.

Then I said that at least it was different cause for a while there were at least three movies coming out, ""Abominable"", ""Over the Moon"" and ""The guardian Brothers"", who all have a Chinese girl protagonist, but they all look like they used the same model, and they all look a bit like an alien, I think, so it's cool that Turning Red is at least trying something different.

Well the girl just turned to her computer and said ""That's fine! Just don't watch it then!"" Like she was mad at me and kept working in silence.

I replied ""No, I do wanna watch it, I just don't like the style"" but no one said anything else after that.

Now I'm sitting here wondering if I accidentally said something racist, or if she perceived something I said as racist? Or what the hell was that?

I'm aware it's super minor, I'm just worried I might have said something racist without realizing and if so I'd definitely like to know what it was and change my thinking around it, I thought we were just having a chat about movies.",0.85

"AITA for wanting a customer to remove a photo of me they‚Äôve taken off FB? So I know this sounds bad, but honestly I‚Äôm torn here. I originally started a new job with friends who own their own restaurant/cafe. I‚Äôm helping them create dinners and bringing vegan items as well since I‚Äôm a vegan chef (not super relevant but I‚Äôll get to the point here) Monday was our first dinner opening and it went well, but something I wasn‚Äôt comfortable with happened.

"WIBTA for calling out my manager who is leaving? I, F19, have just started a new job in the hospitality industry. It is only my third week at the company, but as soon as I got hired I immediately got the feeling the 2IC manager did not like me. I‚Äôve heard she is frequently like this with other new employees, but with me she is directly rude.

First, a bit of background context. I am one of those people who prefers to be called by my middle name; ‚ÄúGrace‚Äù. (Names changed for privacy). I have always been called this by everyone in my life, even though my first and legal name is ‚ÄúElizabeth‚Äù. I am very understanding when entering a new environment that there can be some confusion, and always do my best to explain that while I am legally Elizabeth, to please call me Grace as that is my preferred name.

Now, onto this manager. My actual boss at first called me Elizabeth, I corrected him the first time and he quickly apologised and quickly adapted to calling me Grace. There have been a couple slip-ups, but no big deal, it happens. I understand it‚Äôs not easy when my paperwork likely says Elizabeth all over it, but when someone makes the effort I appreciate it.

The same cannot be said for the 2IC of my work. Upon meeting her she addressed me as Elizabeth, I politely corrected her that I like to be called Grace, and she completely ignored me and continued calling me Elizabeth regardless. For the first few times it happened, I did try to correct her, but she ignored my requests and I simply gave up, just answering to Elizabeth when she addressed me. She recently gave me my name badge and, as expected, it says Elizabeth on it. This really upset me because even when I signed my contract for the company they had a preferred name field, which I obviously entered Grace into, but this was omitted. It just really upset me that I wasn‚Äôt being listened to. 

This particular manager is leaving in a few weeks, but until then I have to put up with her calling me what I don‚Äôt want to be called. It‚Äôs not the fact that she calls me it, it‚Äôs the fact that she blatantly disregards my requests. WIBTA for calling her out? Should I speak to my boss? What should I do?

Edit: hey everyone, thanks for the honest replies! This post has only been up a short while but I get a general feeling that calling her out would not be the best thing to do, however, I am going to ask my boss for a new name badge.

"AITA if I don't give silver and a truck to my dad's friend? My (30f) father died from hiv in feb. We haven't talked verbally since 2015 and only texted a few times before his death. He wasn't the greatest dad, often talking about my body, sex, etc.  

In Jan, we texted a few times until he went into the hospital. Days later he was in a coma and it got worse from there. I chose to pull him off the ventilator after 20 days when there were no signs of getting better. Before he went to the hospital, he texted me everything he wanted me and others to have, and apologized in his own way.

He wanted me to have 700lbs of silver, 150 to his friend ""Kate""and another 50 pounds to Kate's friend ""Jane."" He also wanted Jane to have his truck and $1k for new tires. 

I met Kate following the death. My dad lived with her. She is in her 70s and gay so it was just friends. The silver was supposedly all in the safe and Kate didn't have access. I found the code going through my dad's things and only saw about 700-900 ounces. Closed the safe, looked through more of things, then flew back home. 

Out of nowhere Kate texted me accusing me of stealing the code and going in her room. Both never happened. She has not been so pleasant to deal with at this point and is demanding I magically get all his things asap.

"AITA for asking for personal space? A few weeks ago, I started a new job. My grandparents‚Äô friends live in the area where my job is, and since I don‚Äôt have a housing arrangement until the end of the month, I asked if I wouldn‚Äôt be able to stay with them for a little while. I offered to pay them rent. 

During the past week, I‚Äôve noticed that they tend to not understand personal space. If I walk downstairs, the grandmother (let‚Äôs call her A) likes to follow sometimes. She looks over my shoulder when I‚Äôm making meals. She has also walked into my bedroom three times without permission. I like her a lot but I just want my space. 

This morning I found A in my bedroom rummaging around for kitchen supplies. She ended up taking my spatula (I keep them in my room since I don‚Äôt have space for them in the kitchen). I asked her if she wouldn‚Äôt mind telling me that she was trying to find something instead of just going into my room and looking around. It‚Äôs possible that I could‚Äôve had something in there that I didn‚Äôt want her to know about. I told her that I would love if we could focus on giving each other space. She said that it was her house and she had the right to do what she wanted. I found out that she lied to my grandmother and said that I was the one snooping around the house. 

A‚Äôs husband ended up taking my side, saying that there‚Äôs no excuse for impeding on others personal space. His wife has some memory issues but that‚Äôs not justification. I told my grandma the truth and she said that while I should be entitled to my own personal space, it‚Äôs not something you can necessarily insist with older people. My dad says that I should just deal with it for the next few weeks because she‚Äôs doing me a favor. I just don‚Äôt know if I could deal with it for another three weeks. At the same time, she is doing me a favor by saving me money in rent. I‚Äôm wondering if I should have just sucked it up.

Edit: I mentioned this in my explanation of why I think I could be TA, but I should mention it here. My next housing arrangement is going to be $900 a month and I am currently paying $400. The house is relatively large and there are a lot of amenities, including a game room, pool, hot tub and trampoline. They are former foster parents and sometimes their grandchildren come to stay.

"AITA for refusing to be on time to work until my boss talks to me about it? I work in fast food. I've had this job 6 years, and I've always struggled to be on time. A few months in, I was made a manager. There always needs to be a manager in the building, but at that location, it made no difference if I was late- there were always multiple managers there. 

And then I was transferred to my current location. It's smaller, and has a lot less managers. If I was late, someone would be waiting for me to show up so they could leave. After about a week, I sat down with my manager, Eliza, and we made a deal. My schedule was changed so that all of my shifts started an hour earlier. So I had 9 hour shifts, instead of 8, and there was a guaranteed one hour overlap between me and the person before me. And it worked wonderfully. Even being regularly late, I still had the smoothest transitions because of that overlap, and nobody was inconvenienced. The manager before me would also sometimes be able to leave early, which everyone (in particular, Eliza, who was salaried) enjoyed. Eliza even tried to convince the others working my shift to do that as well, but they refused. So it's still an 8 hour shift, with only me working 9 hours. 

2 months ago, Eliza got transferred. We got a new manager, John. I don't know how the transition goes, but I assumed that even if he was made aware of it, he would not be willing to continue my deal from before. I've had a second job now for 3 months, and easily worked through my lateness issues there (tardiness isn't punished there, but makes the job much more difficult- the work starts on time, whether you're there or not), and felt like I could do fine with that at my main job as well, as long as we could go back to the 8 hour shifts. But when we got our first schedule made by John, I was still given a longer shift, with an hour earlier start time. I honestly prefer it this way- mostly because it allows me to stress a lot less about when I get there. John seems to like it that way too- he regularly leaves early on my days. So I see no need to bring it up with him. But I'm being told by the other managers (and even some crew) that John complains constantly to them about my lateness. 

Am I the asshole for not being on time until my manager addresses it with me?",0.67
"WIBTA for not going to my dad's oncologist appointment? Backstory: I was raised by my grandparents from the time I was 13 months old, and I saw my dad on Sundays. When I was 12, my grandpa was diagnosed with lung cancer. He had major surgery and had complications that caused extreme physical deformities for a week or so, and when I told my dad about it, he blamed me for the cancer.

My (F22) dad (M73) got diagnosed with prostate cancer when I was 14. He told me it was stage one, and said he didn‚Äôt expect an apology from me because I was ‚Äútoo selfish‚Äù. He went into remission when I was 19. After telling me his diagnosis, he only mentioned it one other time until I turned 18, when he started asking me for rides to his appointments. I live 45 minutes from him, and the round trip for appointments would have been around 125 miles (200km). I didn‚Äôt have a job to pay for gas, and he wanted me to miss classes to go to his appointments, so I always said that I couldn‚Äôt. 

When I was around 15, I started calling him out on his behavior and the things he said to me, and he would gaslight me, saying ‚Äúyou‚Äôre imagining things‚Äù. He would try to tell me that I said I wanted him to die (I didn‚Äôt), and say ‚Äúeither you‚Äôre pretending you didn‚Äôt or you have a horrible memory‚Äù if I tried to defend myself, so yeah not the best experience.

He wants me to go to an oncologist appointment with him this month, and he started saying that he was his doctor‚Äôs ‚Äúposter child‚Äù because he had stage 4 cancer and a 2% chance of survival, even though in high school he said it was stage one. I know he either lied back then or he‚Äôs lying now, but I do think he only had stage 1 because he never did chemo, radiation, or surgery. He just went in once a month to get a shot and that was it.

I haven‚Äôt called him on the inconsistencies of his stories because I just don‚Äôt have the energy to argue with him about it, but I really don‚Äôt want to go to the appointment. I‚Äôd be setting aside an entire day to go, he‚Äôs stood me up for plans already this year, and I really don‚Äôt have the energy to hear him brag about how good he is. I know what I‚Äôm about to say is horrible, but I honestly have a feeling that he knows his cancer has come back and wants me at the appointment, because when he asked me to come, he said he wanted me to be ""emotional support‚Äù.

Youngest DD (7yo) is disabled and has many support needs including disrupted sleep and recently is undoing locks and eloping. 
  
DH has been playing magic for 5 or so years. It was twice a week for 4-8 hours each time and while working full-time it was similar to him having a part time job on top of it. He chose to drop the Saturday games and is only doing Wednesdays. 
  
DH gets home after 5 from work outside of the home and leaves for MTG before 6. I work full-time from home and I'm the one who has to pick up our DD from school if she is too tired to attend.
  
I always wake up when he opens the garage and pulls his loud muffler car in anywhere between 11:30pm and 1am. I believe our DD is also waking up then but doesn't make noise or leave her room until an hour or 2 afterwards. Our DS is even being woken up by all the commotion and seriously needs the sleep. I need the sleep as well. I think I had 3 disrupted hours of sleep last night. 

It's so hard to fall asleep when I have no idea what time DH will be home and I'm also on edge worried my DD is going to runaway. I have asked DH to come home by 10 or only go out once a month. I have asked him to stop using the garage. I have asked for him to hire someone to help for a few hours at night (10pm-1am or whenever he gets home) so I don't feel so overwhelmed and have some security. He could even just do the Saturday games. He refuses any compromise. AITA for setting a curfew for an adult?",0.22

"AITA for telling my ex‚Äôs fianc√©e he has a son and letting her meet him? Not many people knew that my ex and I have a son together, especially not people who knew both of us before. The reason being is that I left my old life behind after I found out I was pregnant. I moved to a different country and only kept in touch with one other person who wasn‚Äôt family. My ex is also extremely private so wasn‚Äôt exactly advertising the fact that we have a son together and both of our families have kept it quiet for their own reasons.

Despite that, my ex visits our son frequently. He‚Äôs engaged to someone who we both used to be friends with. I assumed he would tell her about our son but he never did. She found out he kept visiting and came all this way to confront me. She wanted to know what was going on between us. I told her I thought it was best if she spoke to my ex but she started crying and I think she was having some sort of panic attack because she was in a really bad state. It was obvious what she was assuming was going on and I felt bad for her so I blurted out the truth; that he comes to visit his son.

At first, she didn‚Äôt believe me but when I showed her a picture of them together, she asked if she could meet him. I did agree and briefly let her meet him.

When my ex found out he was furious with me for interfering in his life. He said I had no right to tell her and that he was going to tell her himself eventually. He also said it wasn't up to me to introduce them and he seemed angrier over that than anything else. She also told others even though I asked her not to and the gossip is spreading like wildfire, so much so that my sister called me to tell me everyone was talking about it which I know both of our families are upset about.

"AITA for asking my man to clean up after his dog and come home for dinner? I (18F) met my man (24M), Jackson, 2 months ago. He moved in a month ago and I‚Äôve gotten him set up with a job, diploma, government assistance, and food bank. I‚Äôve been paying for some of his gas and set up an entire room for his daughter. Jackson has a dog, Thor, who is normally a good dog. 2 weeks ago Thor started destroying things. A week ago Jackson left a box of my things in the room. His dog destroyed a lot of it. I didn‚Äôt discover it until Jackson went to his mom‚Äôs house. He ended up staying there all weekend and I decided to clean, and discovered the mess. I got extremely upset because he told me his dog had gotten into a bag of screws, but not the rest. He had also left 3 dirty diapers on the dresser. I messaged him and didn‚Äôt get a response until the next day claiming he had no idea. I explained that he needs to help me clean. I also explained that if I‚Äôm unable to sell my bed because of missing screws he will have to pay me back. This was the first argument we had last weekend. The next was when he told me he would be home on Sunday for dinner, so I planned a dinner. By dinner time he informed me he would be later than expected. No big deal I‚Äôll make dinner later. Then ‚Äúlater‚Äù became the next day. I sent him many messages telling him how rude it is to tell someone you will arrive at a certain time then show up late, or not at all (he has shown up late every time we‚Äôve had plans). I became even more upset the later it became, and told him how it makes me feel when I do so much for a person and they can‚Äôt respect me back by showing up for dinner. Now some needed background. About 2 weeks into him living with me a girl (23F) from his high school added him on snap and instantly began talking about sexual things. I told him it made me uncomfortable and that she is trying to flirt with him, and he ignored my feelings. She continued to snap him and they quickly became each other‚Äôs number 1 best friend on snap which used to be me and him. I again tried to explain to him this made me uncomfortable and he again ignored my feelings. He tells me she has helped him out of 4 toxic relationships in the past. Fast forward to the day after our argument, she texts me a paragraph saying I‚Äôm a shitty person and that I‚Äôm toxic and abusive. I explain the situation to her and she sticks in her ways. I then tell her I don‚Äôt want someone who is trying to fuck my man to tell me what to do, and she tells me she wasn‚Äôt flirting. I tell her that asking about his sex life is inappropriate. We argue back and forth, then she tells me she is going to send Jackson nudes. I screenshot the entire conversation and send it to him, and my best friend messages him as well. He tells my best friend he only ranted to her about our argument and didn‚Äôt tell her to message me. He came home later that night and had dinner with me and made up sort of, but it‚Äôs been bothering me all week. AITA?",0.19
"AITA for telling my girlfriend she's not doing a good job  I (18m) am dating a girl (18m). We've been together for almost a year now and recently I've noticed that our relationship seems one sided. For example: I always find a unique way to give her compliments, make the first move, plan movie night, plan game night or fun games we both can enjoy, find ways to show my love for her in wtv way, and whenever I find some cute TikTok wtv ik she might like I'll send it.The issue is not that she doesn't do these things to but I'll always have to bring it up for her to do it. I tried to talk to her about it but I felt so guilty about it cause it felt like I was calling her a terrible girlfriend when she told me herself that she struggles with stuff like that. Sometimes when I ask her to pick a movie or an activity she doesn't seem to want to pick anything or even try. She'd say ""idk"" and just leave it at that. I mean it did take her a while to open up to me sexually but lately it seems like she's barely trying. I can understand her being tired, hormonal or on her period but we had this conversation twice before. She would be doing great and I feel like she's giving me the same amount of attention, love and affection as I'm giving her but then it just stops while I'm here trying to figure out our next plans. I tried talking to her about it yesterday but it was honestly hard to explain to her how I feel cause I feel so weird asking her to do these things and I can't get mad at her since I choice to be here. I really love her cause in other areas she's the best but her lack of trying really hurts me. 

I confided in a friend about this issue but they told me that maybe I'm being to controlling and that I seem obsessed with having all of her attention. Honestly those words hurt me because here I thought I was just being a good boyfriend to her. My friend said I'm an asshole cause I'm not taking to consideration that maybe she's just not in the mood or doesn't have the time to always be planing these things or she simply just doesn't know what she wants to do. Now I feel like a huge asshole but I also feel like my feelings are valid to. So AITA?

"WIBTA for wanting to get rid of my cat? **THREAD CLOSED:** Thank you for the advice. I must say though, a lot of you didn't understand my question. The question was **whether or not giving up my cat would make me an AH after I could no longer provide for it.** Not if adopting a cat with a friend makes me an AH. It makes me *stupid* to trust my best friend would move out with me after pushing me to do so that year. The cat was a mark of our new free life together. I was an *idiot* for believing her. For the record, it wasn't just a random idea, it was months of planning, security deposit was already saved and ready, and a n apartment complex was already chosen. She backed out, and ditched the cat onto me. So I accept that I'm an AH for not getting the cat *after* we secured an apartment. There's nothing I can do about that now. My boyfriend called me a bad person and wrong for wanting to give up the cat after everything went to shit with the cat's other legal owner. I just wanted to know if he was right.

Thank you to those who answered the question. And hey! If any of you are in the South FL region and looking for a grey, one year old cat whose kinda chunky and has zero thoughts behind his head, let me know \^\^!

&#x200B;

**Context / Background Details**

Me(22F) and my best friend/Alex (24F) adopted a cat together, we don't live together and we both have stable jobs that pays enough (and can pay for the cat separately if needed). She lives with her aunt and her aunt's three kids, and I live in a room with my Boyfriend/Leo in his parent's house. **EDIT**: I should mention that all three of us intended to move out together within the year, but she backed out of it last minute. We never intended to keep the cat bouncing between homes for it's lifespan) She pays a huge chunk of rent despite being one person, and for all the groceries despite barely eating. I pay my bills and insurance for my car, but not rent, in return I am not allowed to use the kitchen unsupervised or speak to any of other family members.

One day, me and Alex went to the shelter and legally adopted a kitten and we agreed to take care of him together. We would take turns buying the cat food, I would do it and then when it ran out she would do it, we agreed that she would take him for the weekends since those were her days off and I usually worked weekends anyways.

After a few weekends, her aunt decided to ban the cat from visiting (despite all her daughters loving it). So now she has no choice to leave him with me seven days a week. I figured I could do her this favor, however ever since then, she's stopped providing him her half of the food, and she's never paid for litter either. When she comes to visit she hardly acknowledges him.

Yes, I have told her about my feelings and called her out on skipping out on her responsibility to him. All she does is laugh it off though.

**End of Context/Main Point**

So now I'm stuck with a cat I don't want and never had the finances to fully support alone (technically I can/have but at the cost of other things so I don't want to do it anymore). So I want to give him up to the shelter. However, Leo has grown attached to the cat got mad and told me I wasn't a good person for wanting to give him up, and that he would break up with me if I did. I told him that the cat will then be his responsibility and he would be the sole provider of it and I refuse to help him take care of it.

After a few weeks, Leo's proven to be either too busy or too broke to provide for the cat properly (the water bowl was FILLED with mold, and after I nagged him to clean it so the cat doesn't get sick, he proceeded not too care so I finally did it myself after a week had passed when I saw that it was still dirty. He also can't afford the litter on his own and has used my card to split it) so now I plan to give up the cat to the shelter anyways.

Would I be the asshole if I did so?

PS. I did like and want the cat in the beginning when he would have TWO parents to take care of it. But I've grown to resent it after being forced to be the sole provider/caretaker of it.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Some people are confused so lemme just say it here instead of replying to everyone. Leo convinced me that he could take care of the cat properly and *wanted* to keep it as his own, even going as far as to ask me to give him legal rights (which i had planned to do once our schedules aligned. But because we happen to live together, I saw what his idea of taking care of the cat meant and I don't agree with it, thus leading me to wanting to surrender it anyways as he is also unfit to care for the cat in my opinion.) I didn't force or dump the cat onto him.",0.9
"AITA for getting a new employee fired? (I live in Asia and I work in an office with other expats and locals) I walk into the office one morning to see this woman (who we'll call, Tina) sitting at my desk, I go up to her and introduce myself, I smiled and was nice, we spoke for about two minutes until I told her that she's actually sitting at my desk, she then asks me if it's okay that she sits here because she likes The view from the window, at this point I laughed because I thought she was joking, but then I said no, she'll have to sit on the couch at reception until they tell her where she's going to be, she gets annoyed but does it anyway.

It's a small office and I consider everyone working here to be my friend, we have a good working dynamic and there's no office politics (this doesn't include management). I have a friend that works here (we'll call him Bob), now Bob is one of those people who are annoyingly friendly and he's genuine, he's one of those people that could make friends with a wall. Bob comes over and talks about how ""strange"" Tina is, apparently she already has demands on her first day and she feels as if though she's here to change the company for the better. If you can manage to annoy Bob, then you're The issue.

It's tradition to take the new person out for drinks especially if they're an expat because we know how it feels to be so far away from everyone and everything you're familiar with, but we try to make all New employees feel comfortable regardless if you're expat or local.

We go to the bar after work and then we all see how entitled Tina is, she expects The guys to buy her drinks and she's rude to the bartender and the bartender is our friend. During the night Tina finds out that I'm gay because Bob asks me where my boyfriend is. She comes and sits next to me and asks me if I'm really gay, I said yes, then she proceeds to tell me that I don't ""act and look gay"" and then tells me how she has so many gay best friends back in New York and she can't wait for her and I to go shopping and get our nails done, I then tell her that I don't like shopping or getting my nails done. (What happens next is the most fucked up thing) Tina then stood up,  squat a little then proceeds to basically dry hump my knee, in the bar in front of my friends, asking me if I like it and I'm sure I'm gay, one of my female friends pull her back and asks what she's doing, Tina then says she's just joking around. At this point it's obvious that nobody likes her but for some reason she didn't seem to pick up on that fact, she keeps acting like she's the universes gift to humanity...

The Next day I go into the office the office, speak to my regional manager (RM) and Tell her that Tina wouldn't be a good fit and that nobody in the office likes her (The regional manager and I are friends), I asked the RM to talk to the other employees and find out what they think before making a decision to keep Tina here full-time.

Before lunch, Tina was let go

"WIBTA for not letting him use my tech? *privacy* (Major details changed for privacy (lol))

He‚Äôs from Vietnam, a quiet unassuming guy who loves Apple products and does stocks, soccer, IT and that kinda thing. Has a passion for tech and holds a couple of conspiracy cards close to his chest. I‚Äôm from Australia, I‚Äôve got ADHD and can be a pest, but it‚Äôs hard for me to realise this sometimes - so to the AITA sub I went. 

We‚Äôve been together for 3 years and engaged for a few months, had our (very minor) ups and downs, and are now in a bit of a precarious patch with visa discussions and payments. Now, recently, I asked him to log into his visa account so I could upload some documents (I do have access, I‚Äôm supposed to as I‚Äôm the sponsor, but my phone didn‚Äôt remember the password). 

I asked him for the password. He was in a crabby mood and said ‚ÄúI dunno‚Äù. Me being me, and pulling a lot of the legal and admin work in this relationship, reached for his phone on the nightstand to log in on his instead.

What happened next was a surprise to me, as we have total transparency and trust each other enough to have an open phone and nothing to hide‚Ä¶ yada yada. He snapped and got mad, telling me about privacy and all that, and I genuinely was so taken aback. It had never been an issue. I never peruse his phone as it is. Now I‚Äôm thinking,,, is he hiding something? Has he always felt this way? 

He then tells me he reckons all couples should never touch each other‚Äôs phones. Apparently one of his fav youtube couples does this. A new notion, one I can respect, but where did it come from? Just the youtube channel? It seems to be building up from somewhere and he‚Äôs just let it out. I think back on any time I‚Äôve used his phone and yes, I think it has made him uncomfortable before. This is not so fun to think about, as I think I‚Äôve caused him this anxiety for a while. 

So, to the crux. WIBTA if I then followed suit and stopped him from using my (expensive, bought for my digital art) iPad that he loves to watch his youtube on? I don‚Äôt intend for it to be a revenge move, but if I agree to his couple privacy ideas, I want to be able to understand it and to have it fair. He‚Äôs always on it, it‚Äôs logged into EVERYTHING I have, and now I‚ÄôM actually starting to get a bit uncomfortable with the prospect. I guess now he‚Äôs introduced the idea of privacy, I‚Äôm starting to think of my own as well. (I‚Äôd also like to use it more often too).

I‚Äôm not asking if I‚Äôm the asshole for yoinking his phone off the nightstand, I‚Äôm aware that this is crappy behaviour, and has periodically made him uncomfortable. I‚Äôm asking if I‚Äôd be the asshole by following his example  - not out of malice, but out of both curiosity and a bit of my own anxiety too.",0.11

"AITA for not being more understanding and sensitive of my BOYFRIEND‚ÄôS emotions due to his divorce?? I (34f) have been with my bf (34m) for a little over a year, moved in 8 months ago. When we met he was in the process of getting divorced, but the actual divorce took 2 years (but mentally he‚Äôs been done with that relationship for at least 4 years.) As of 3 weeks ago he is finally divorced. 

We both really want a family, and we do want to be together for our future. Given the fact that we‚Äôre both not young, I thought that things would move faster. Now that he‚Äôs divorced officially, I thought he‚Äôd be ready to move forward and get engaged soon so that we would have time (due to female clock) to have the family we‚Äôve both always wanted. 

But tonight we got into a huge fight. I brought up the topic of just what is he thinking time wise on things, and he got insanely mad that I don‚Äôt understand that he got divorced ‚Äúonly a few weeks ago‚Äù and the fact that I‚Äôm not sensitive to that is making him question things. He said obviously he wants to be with me, but he needs some time after getting divorced. 

But in my mind, the divorce was almost a formality on paper and I thought he was fully done mentally with the relationship. He is very clear that he is and has been done with the relationship for a long time, but still just the act of getting divorced was mentally hard, and he‚Äôs not ready to get engaged and all that just yet. He thinks I‚Äôm being extremely selfish for wanting that and being disappointed that he‚Äôs not ready. I almost feel like I was lied to a bit because I thought he‚Äôd be ready as soon as he was officially divorced.

"AITA for not reimbursing my roommate for a cancelled meet and greet? I won tickets for a meet and greet with a YouTuber I really liked a few years ago. I had just moved in so we had only just become roommates and had talked
about going out together and have girls nights to bond.

When I told her I won she was so excited so I asked her if she wanted to come with me and we could make a day out of it. She was super happy ""and honored"" I asked her and for weeks we talked about
it looking forward to it. The day comes, we wake up early, take the train and
as soon as we arrive in the city of the meet and greet I get a call that the meet and greet was cancelled due to a family emergency. I was sad ofc, but I  completely understood . She told me: hey they will move it to another date! Let's go shopping and have dinner later. And that's what we did. A fun girls day
right?

A week later I get a text while I was away and with family that she apparently was waiting for an apology that I wasted her day and never apologized for the cancellation. Also she wants me to reimburse her train ticket costs because she now bought the tickets and travelled for nothing. 

I told her: I dont understand why I owe you and apology or why I should
""imburse""you? we've been
planning to go on a girlsday for a
while now and i thought we we're
spending the day as friends.
How am I to blame that the meet
and greet got cancelled? I

say it was a pointless trip?

She replied she only came to the m&g for me and she doesn‚Äôt really likes the guy anyway which pissed me off even more because I could‚Äôve asked my actual friends instead.

"WIBTA if I stopped paying my MIL to babysit my baby 5 days per week? My husband (33 M) and I (29 F) have a 1yo son and both work full time. My MIL (68 F) has volunteered to watch him while we work. She lives with SIL (35 F) about 5 mi from us. Sometimes our son goes over to their house so SIL can help. (They smoke in the house, and SIL swears & yells at her kids constantly.) MIL is not in good shape. She is often in pain, can‚Äôt go up and down stairs while holding my son, and can't sit on the floor to play with him. The TV is always on. She isn‚Äôt able to take him outside to play or go anywhere. I help when they're here (I work from home). He is a pretty easygoing baby and sleeps 2-2.5 hrs during the day. She LOVES watching him and is always asking about him and saying how much she misses him when not together. She and SIL do say it takes a toll on her, though, combined with watching our crazy nephew (5) at night.

My husband‚Äôs family recently lived in a house that was literally falling apart because they didn‚Äôt treat it right and squandered all their money (much/most of which came from the govt). SIL's fiance inherited thousands of dollars and a house from his gma passing. They spent all of the money on Christmas and didn‚Äôt save a dime. Bf works full time, SIL gets govt assistance and stays home to help MIL and care for her 5yo before/after school, and both pay child support. SIL claims she can‚Äôt get a job because of these duties (but just got some part time work). MIL receives SS and is still trying to pay bills her late husband and mother left behind. SIL demands some of MIL‚Äôs SS money to help pay bills, though it is all she has. Every time some big expense comes up they beg us for money. They already owe my husband a tens of thousand dollars for how much he has helped them in recent years.

We are a young, growing family. We really want to buy a house. (We have some savings but need more because houses are getting so expensive, but our bank account just won‚Äôt go up. We are frugal, but some big expenses have come up.) We make okay money. I‚Äôm a teacher (7 yrs) and my husband‚Äôs salary is less than mine. Decent childcare would cost about 1/4 of our weekly take home pay (combined).

MIL agreed to babysit for free as payment for what they owe my husband, but he would occasionally give her money out of the kindness of his heart. She has continued to ask for more. She expects her ‚Äúpay‚Äù (about $150) weekly and bugs us for it until he gives it to her. We don‚Äôt think we should have to ‚Äúpay‚Äù her weekly as an expectation because (1) it‚Äôs her grandson (2) whom she loves spending time with, (3) they owe my husband tens of thousands, and (4) they squander money. Rather than continue to pay her we'd rather put our son in childcare for higher quality care to better aid his development. MIL doesn‚Äôt want us to do that, and we want to save up money for a house and more kids.

He wanted to make a sort of ""cultural"" food that we don't get to eat often because it usually takes 6+ hours to make. The problem I have is that he's not going to do any of the work.

"AITA for commenting on a post on my father‚Äôs Facebook profile reminding him of his affair?

My dad had an affair with a close family friend (35M), we didn‚Äôt know in the beginning because when they separated they told us that ‚Äútheir marriage wasn‚Äôt working like it used to do‚Äù so for around one and a half year we would go to our dad‚Äôs house one week and one week with my mom, we stopped going when he introduced him to us and we found out that he was his affair partner and also a family friend, so we didn‚Äôt feel comfortable being around the man who helped my dad to destroy our lives.

We haven‚Äôt gone to my dad‚Äôs house for the last three months because we don‚Äôt just feel comfortable, he comes to our mom‚Äôs house to bring us gifts, he wants us to go to his house to accept his partner but I just don‚Äôt like him. 

So, this incident happened around 8 days ago, my dad posted a picture of him, his BF, and his stepson on Facebook, I got angry because they try to look like the perfect family and even tried to force us to be part of that family. 

So, I commented: ‚ÄúRemember that you two had to destroy our lives to get there‚Äù my dad deleted the photo immediately and didn‚Äôt tell me anything, the one who sent me a message was his bf, telling me that my father was hurt and told me to move on since it‚Äôs being two years. 

My sister (14) found out what I did and called me TA for exposing and reminding my dad of the mistakes he did, now I feel bad because my dad has really tried to make amends and fix what he did but I just can‚Äôt stand it, this makes me feel sad and depressed because of what my father did.

My sister got mad and made her feel bad by saying things like ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just walk home and get kidnapped‚Äù jsut really horrible things like that. My mom caved in and drove her home, even though I offered to pay for an Uber. 

My sister has been like this for months now, demanding things from people. Especially my mom. I have a huge soft spot in my heart for my mom. I told my sister this: ‚ÄúAva, I‚Äôm just trying to help here, I know your dealing with a lot of stress but mom only has 2  hours a day to herself. I don‚Äôt think you should take your frustration out on her, she‚Äôs dealing with so much, I offered to pay for a ride so why did you need to do that not mom?‚Äù She said that I should‚Äôve kept my mouth shut and to stay out of it. I‚Äôm not gonna lie, I lost my cool. I told her to stop being such a narcissist and to get help for her issues. 

After ignoring me , she called me privileged for being where I‚Äôm at in life and that I don‚Äôt deserve it, because if I deserved it then so should she.",0.19
"AITA for wanting my fianc√© to have a relationship with his son? AITA for wanting my fianc√© to have a relationship with his son?

Backstory: I (26F) met Dan (36M) in January 2021. On Valentine‚Äôs Day (this year) he proposed to me. 

We had plans to cook together at his place last night. I got off work early so I headed to his house before he would be home (he knew I was on my way and was ok with it). I took a shower and he still wasn‚Äôt home by the time I finished. I was sitting on the couch watching TV and I caught a glimpse of some mail on his coffee table. I want to make it clear - I was NOT snooping. The mail just caught my eye, especially since the letterhead said something like ‚Äúpaternity test summons‚Äù in big bold letters! I looked through the papers and basically some woman was trying to establish paternity for her child. 

Dan came home and I immediately asked what this was about. To make a long story short, he told me he was dating a girl casually for a few months, she got pregnant, she did not want to terminate, and he firmly and clearly told her that if she kept the baby he would not be involved. I was livid because he had a kid and didn‚Äôt tell me about this. I told him he lied to me when we first started dating, saying he didn‚Äôt have any kids, but he kept being pedantic saying he *doesn‚Äôt* have a kid because he wants no claim to the child and didn‚Äôt sign a birth certificate. I was particularly shocked because he always told me he is excited to be a dad one day and would even want to be a stay at home dad if finances permitted. Dan did not strike me as the kind of guy to do something like this. 

We had a big fight. He answered all my questions honestly (I guess?) but I ended up giving him an ultimatum. That he needs to have a relationship with his son or WE will not have a relationship. I told him I do not want to be involved with someone who abandons their own flesh and blood. He said I was being completely unreasonable and that he should not be punished for not being involved in this kid‚Äôs life when he did not consent to becoming a father.

"AITA for being upset when my morals are called into question? So I'll start this off by saying this is nothing big, just a petty argument I think.

For reference B!Father and B!Mother are both my bio parents, while A!Father and A!Mother are my adoptive parents. Datemate is used to refer to my partner.  


I'm a neurodivergent 20yr M, and my initials spell out COMB. I thought this was pretty cool, which is why I chose it. This is the name I chose after speaking to my B!Father and B!Mother about getting a name change. I never liked my name, it never suited me, but my A!Father told me he wouldn't help me get the name change unless my B!Father agreed to it (old friend from highschool).   


I got him to agree, but only if I kept B!Father's last name. That being the 'B' in COMB. I promised that I would. To me, a promise is just that: A promise, my absolute word. I was raised to believe that the word 'promise' isn't something you just toss around. I believe that if I make a promise I'm obligated to complete it come Hell or high water.  


So when my Datemate brought up the fact that I'm not bound to my word, I was a little upset about it. Not because they told me they believed differently, but rather that I was wrong for believing in a rule where my promise is my word. Because B!Father was rather abusive to me as a child (I'll spare you the details, but let's just say it was ugly.) my Datemate told me that me keeping my promise to my Father was letting my abusers have control over me. I told them that I didn't believe that, and the only reason I kept my promise was because I believe if you can break a promise once, you can do it again. They once again told me that was dumb and that isn't how you go about having moral obligations, I told them I didn't feel comfortable talking about this anymore. They replied ""Well just think about it"" and out of frustration I snapped back ""No"". They said ""Whatever, I don't care."" At that point I decided to take some time to myself to cool off. 

Maybe it's a small petty thing to be upset about ( and maybe I went about it rather childishly) but it just felt rude to tell me how I should 1.) Deal with my chosen name & 2.) How I go about my business. But I'll leave it up to you.

"AITA for not letting my ex have the computer tower?  I was with my spouse for three years and I supported him because he wouldn‚Äôt keep a job. He wouldn‚Äôt watch the kids and played games all day long ignoring us most days.

He didn‚Äôt want to watch the kids while I worked so I stayed home and gave up the job I loved.He was throwing fits about a new gaming tower be used my card to buy one spending the rest of my taxes. We agreed he paid half and I pay half but it was suppose to be $1700, instead he spent $2200. He is not on my card.

"AITA for moving our son into the room adjoined to ours even though my husband didn‚Äôt want me to? We moved a month and a half ago and my son is having a hard time adjusting. He‚Äôs only 4 so I originally wanted him in the adjoined room next to ours but my husband said no since it would mean less privacy for us. My son has never had issues sleeping so I thought it would be fine to put him in a different room but since moving here, he constantly wakes up scared in the middle of the night and doesn‚Äôt like sleeping in his room. 

I‚Äôve mentioned wanting to move him into the adjoined room to my husband a few times but he kept insisting our son would get used to his room eventually.

My husband was away for a week so I decided to see if our son slept better in the adjoined room, which he did. I ended up moving him into there officially and he‚Äôs been much happier sleeping there than in his old room since I usually leave the door that connects our rooms open so he doesn‚Äôt feel scared.

When my husband came home, he was upset I had moved him and that I would keep the door open at night. He said there was no point in us discussing it if I was just going to do whatever I wanted the minute he was gone.

"AITA for not taking care of my dad's pets? Some background, I (18f) live with my dad(41m) and my parents are separated (not divorced). I also have a younger brother but he lives with my mom. I won't be mentioning my mom or my brother in this because they don't really contribute that much to the story. I am also from the Philippines, so pardon my grammar.

To be clear, I have a dog of my own in the house as well but I take really good care of her since she was gifted to me by my boyfriend. But I am not a responsible type of person and my dad knows that. I don't really take good care of things if it isn't mine, that's how my mind works. I do feed me and my dad's dogs everyday but I don't do the same for his other pets, although I do feed them sometimes, just not everyday.

Before Covid hit we didn't really have any pets cause I have school the whole day and my dad has work and no one was gonna feed them when we were gone the whole day. But when Covid struck, dad has since bought about 20+ Koi fish, 20+ Goldfish, 10+ Flowerhorns, 3 dogs and 2 rabbits. Some of them died due to neglect and some were sold. For example, all that's left of what he bought are 10 Koi fish, 15 goldfish, 2 Flowerhorns, 1 dog and 2 rabbits. The rabbits were just recently bought and it was the starting topic of me and my dad's argument.

These past few days his rabbits keep getting out of their cage because they keep searching for more food to eat. And I'm the one that needs to run after them when they do get out but since I still have school I can't run after them immediately. When my dad found out that the rabbits keep getting out, he scolded me saying ""You don't take care of my pets and that's why they all keep dying."" I screamed back at him saying ""You knows I'm not a responsible person but you keep bringing home more and more pets to feed and that I'm not the one responsible for feeding them since it's your pets."" He screamed back at me saying ""You're the one that's in the house all day, so YOU need to feed my pets and I'm tired from working all day that's why I can't take care of them."" Me getting annoyed at this point said ""Then stop buying pets! Sell some of these cause I can't take care of them!""

After the back and forth screaming match I had with my dad, he told me to go back to my mom and never come back. So I did, I went back to my mom and stayed for a couple of days, I brought my dog of course. Now, my dad is calling me non stop yelling at me to come back cause his pets will die if no one feeds them. I am currently at my mom's house and thinking over if I should go back to my dad's house. If I am the asshole then, I'll go back but If I'm not, then I might be staying at my mom's for a little bit longer. I do feel bad for the animals but I just can't shake off my bad habits. And I guess, I know where I got being irresponsible.",0.08
"WIBTA if I asked my friend to stop discussing her excising in front of/to me I (18 NB) suffer from an eating disorder, I‚Äôve had it for roughly four years now, and have been getting treated for two. It‚Äôs safe to say I‚Äôm further along in my recovery journey, but I‚Äôm not all the way there yet. 

I still struggle, and I can‚Äôt do many of the things I used to when I was deeper into my disorder. I used to over exercise a ton, but since having began my recovery journey, my doctors put almost all exercises on halt. 

Now, I am at a healthy weight to exercise, and I do make a point to get out at least for a walk, but I can‚Äôt do miles and miles of walking anymore, I can‚Äôt burn 1000 calories in a day anymore. 

Now, I have a friend(F18), who we‚Äôll call Leah. Leah also struggles with an eating disorder, but we don‚Äôt discuss that often. She is, however, very vocal about her workouts, asking people to go to the gym and all, and that‚Äôs fine, if she wants to do that, she can, but my issue comes from her talking in extensive detail about her goals, she‚Äôll talk about how many miles she wants to run, in how many minutes, how she‚Äôs going to be doing all these full body workouts, just talking about it, and its extremely triggering. She knows that I have an ED as well, and knows that I shouldn‚Äôt go to a gym (because I‚Äôve expressed it), yet still had asked me to go with her.

Now, when she‚Äôs mainly talking about her gym adventures in our friend group‚Äôs groupchat, and I‚Äôve been trying to ignore it, but its been increasingly triggering, and hard to ignore. 

I want to ask her to please stop talking about it in front of me/to me, because although I support her, its triggering to listen to.

Now here‚Äôs where I‚Äôm concerned about being the asshole: I know that other people aren‚Äôt responsible for my triggers, and I‚Äôm not sure if asking her is too needy or rude?

I feel like its inconsiderate (since she knows my issues, I‚Äôve been open), and that if she wanted to talk about it, she could do it in a groupchat that I‚Äôm not in. But is that selfish? Or too much to ask?


Extra info: she claims she‚Äôs going to the gym to body build, not to lose weight, so where that lines up with her ED I‚Äôm not sure, but I don‚Äôt want to discuss that with her. She has a therapist.

Quick edit: I want to make it clear, Leah and I do hang out a lot, with and without our friend group, and overall she is a good friend, and we have quality time together, it‚Äôs just this one thing with not understanding triggering content. 
(TW: mentions of self harm, suicide, etc)


She has openly talked about a lot of generally triggering things, most of which I can handle, but has stopped when she was asked. She‚Äôs talked about SH and suicidal thoughts, which I was okay with a couple times, and told her the third time she brought up it up when my thoughts changed about it, in that current time. She reacted generally well, and did stop, but she is a little guilt trippy, saying things afterwards like (I can‚Äôt do anything right) and such, and she‚Äôll get laidback with the boundaries after a little, making jokes here and there. 

I think she struggles with understanding where the line is, and how to maintain that after a while, I don‚Äôt think she is purposefully manipulative, or getting lax on boundaries to be harmful, it‚Äôs just something that she does without realizing, and having to remind her is hard for not only just me, but also the other friends in our group. 

I think that she is a good person, who‚Äôs struggling, and I feel like I‚Äôd be hinted at to be an asshole, solely by the guilting. (Something I should‚Äôve said in my original post, but words are hard to articulate). It makes me feel bad, but I still think it‚Äôs important to tell her and approach (in reference to my boundaries with exercise). Perhaps, if anybody can shed some advice on how to do that in a way which doesn‚Äôt come off a rude, or making her out to be the bad guy, that‚Äôd be much appreciated. Thank you.",0.15

"AITA for saying i wont be heling with the street party? \*Title is ment to say Helping\*

Context for this story- (Im F18) ever since the first lockdown in the uk a few residents on the street i live in have wanted to do a street party as a post lockdown celebration. The dates before didnt match up and its new date is set for the queens jubilee. Its being mainly organised by P (M63) every now and again we get update letters through the post about thr street party. If im honest since the beggining ive not been intrested in this street party.

I asked my parents if they had messaged P about me doing a face paint stall and they said no. When i was getting the bin in later in the day i saw P so decided to ask him why he put me down for that. He said that because im an art student id be fine with paiting the kids faces and i do drag so i have the makeup to do it, he assumed he didnt need to ask me. I politley said that i dont have face paint i have expensive,high quality makeup that i use on me for my drag and ive never done face paint like spider man or fairies and i dont really know where to start or what to buy and that id rather not do face paint as i never even agreeded to have a stall and 2 days after the planned date i have an exam and id rather not have to be setting up a stall etc if i could be revising. He responed saying that i shouldnt mind about using my makeup on kids as its just makeup and he assumed id be fine with face paint as an art sudent. We went ba k and forward with this conversation a few times until he fiannled angrly said that it dosent matter what i think oe what pointless makeup i use im doing face paint and that im a sour ass for not wanting a stall in the first place and im ruinign the community spirit. I shot back saying i dont care as in a few months im going to be gone for uni and my exam is more important than some stupid kids face paint stall.

"AITA: for making a corporate Facebook post? So I work at a job with a Facebook presence. It‚Äôs my job, and one of my coworkers jobs, to post 5 Facebook posts a week relating to our business. It‚Äôs really a pain and we dread doing it. But we actually got a pretty engaging picture recently, and needed a fifth post, so I was stoked. Took the pictures, posted them to Facebook, job well done.

Well, one of my other coworkers (not the one who does the posts with me) sees the post, and sees they‚Äôre included in the picture. They say they don‚Äôt like the picture, because it‚Äôs not flattering to them. They have a double chin because they were looking down. The picture was not focused on them, they just happened to be holding what the picture was of. I laughed it off, thinking they were just dramatic. A couple days later, another coworker comes up to me and asks what happened to the post. I panic, realizing it‚Äôs gone, and think I‚Äôm going to get in trouble now because it appears to corporate like we didn‚Äôt make our Facebook post goal.

A couple days later I find out, one of the leaders of the office I work at took down the post because of the coworkers complaints about how they look. Apparently they had a ‚Äúfull breakdown‚Äù including tears, saying I was refusing to take it down. (They never asked me to take it down, they just complained. Which they do a lot, so I took it as a joke.) I‚Äôm still upset because no one told me they‚Äôd removed the post, so I couldn‚Äôt replace it in time. I also in general like to know when something I‚Äôm in charge of are being changed, just for communications sake. If they‚Äôd just told me they were taking down the post, I would‚Äôve rolled my eyes but at least I would‚Äôve known.

So I text the coworker and ask why it was such a problem. They EXPLODE on me about it, saying I have an attitude problem, and that no one in the office actually likes me, and that she didn‚Äôt want to ask me because she knew I wouldn‚Äôt understand. I repeatedly told her to stop, that this conversation was inappropriate and unnecessarily personal with how she was attacking my character. She continued for several more paragraphs.

Ten minutes later that same superior who took down the post takes me into her office and yells at me, saying this coworker had just contacted her to report that I was bullying her. That it was inappropriate to reach out to her on her day off (we have texted personally before, previous to this we were friends.) and that I was having an attitude with her when I responded to her long tirade about how much she hates me with ‚ÄúWhatever.‚Äù That I owe her an apology, I shouldn‚Äôt question what she decides to do with the Facebook, and that I was wrong. I refuse to apologize, especially after the deeply rude and hurtful things she said about me when all I did was inquire about the post. I also said nothing in response about her character or appearance.

"WIBTA for reporting my math teacher I am an IEP student, and part of my accommodations is that I'm allowed to get a ""time-and-a-half"" test time. Meaning if the test was 1 hour, I would get 1 hour + 30 minutes extra time.

On the first math test of this year, my teacher came up to me and asked me for my paper. I told her that I get extra time, and she said something that I couldn't quite make out. I didn't want to argue, so I gave back my test. I told my parents about what happened, and they said that they'd talk to her.

For the second test, she gave me the extra time, so I thought that it was probably because she wasn't aware of my IEP. Then the rest of the year, she didn't give me any extra time. She'd say that she gives everyone the extra time so my test time accommodations are embedded in it. I couldn't tell if this was allowed or not.

I had insights about this from different people, wondering if it's illegal or not. My peers think that what she's doing is illegal and I should report her. I remember asking my learning support teacher about my situation as a hypothetical during one of my extra time test writing sessions (somewhere along the lines of ""would my extra time be embedded if everyone gets extra time""), although I couldn't really understand what my learning support teacher said. This evening, I decided to talk to my parents about it on the topic of a math test. My dad said that he talked to her and he is on her side and my mom said that there's nothing we can do about it and this is on me for getting bad grades.

The thing that frustrates me the most is that all my other teachers give me extra time with tests and assignments if I need them. I'm also really frustrated since I'm not doing well in math despite doing my best and I desperately need a good grade in my math credit for where I want to go and my parents refuse to let me retake the course for summer school. I also feel conflicted cause my math teacher is rlly nice as a person and I wouldn't want her to get into trouble. Besides, it's only been a year since I got my IEP. Maybe I'm just wrong about all this and I'm making a big deal out of nothing and it's rlly my fault that I'm not doing well in math tests.",0.3

"WIBTA for asking my roommate to move out because her dog has peed in the house multiple time a week for over 2 years? 
I (F29) have been living in my house (renting) since January 2019 My roommate (F27) moved in in March of 2020, our household has a total of five people. She has a Jack russel that she adopted from a shelter as an adult. He has not been house trained and has a ‚Äúmarking‚Äù problem, which isn‚Äôt her fault since she got him that way, but she has put zero effort into training him. 

Every couple of weeks the carpets in the living and dining room become so saturated with pee that it‚Äôs the first thing we smell when we walk in the door. She‚Äôll only clean it if someone brings it up or if she happens to see a wet spot. I steam clean the carpets once a month (because she won‚Äôt do it often enough) because the stench is so unpleasant, and then weeks later it‚Äôs back to being covered in pee again. I can‚Äôt even sit in my living room and enjoy coffee without stepping in or smelling pee. 

He also jumps up on the dining room table and pees on anything that‚Äôs on there, mail, napkins, anything. It happens multiple times a month where we‚Äôll be eating and notice dried crystallized piss on the table. This has happened upwards of 30+ times now.

"AITA for not wanting to loan money to my brother? My brother (23m) is a senior in college, majoring in education. I (20f) am working an entry level job.
My brother and I both live at home with our single mother, who covers every bill in the household, cuz she wants her kids to be able to spend their money as they please.
 My brother is in no college debt, because it is all paid off by scholarships. He's had on/off teaching jobs through the past few years he's been in school, & has made decent money.
He's never had a savings account. He spends all of his money on luxuries (diamond earrings, Apple devices, real leather, etc). We do not come from wealth, but he likes to act like we do.
He is currently working a full time unpaid internship that's a requirement for his graduation in a few weeks. So he is currently making $0. 
I have been working entry level jobs for 3 years now, and have managed to save $10k by myself, and stay out of bad credit card debt.
I had an Xbox in my room that was not being used. He decided that he wanted to utilize it, but the games he wanted to play required a membership that would take about $16 out of his bank account every month.
The controller broke a few months ago, so he's not been gaming recently; but he never canceled his membership. Last week, his debit card got overdrawn cuz the membership charged him for the monthly fee again.
Since he doesn't have any savings to fall back on, he wanted me to pay off his small debt. I wasn't optimistic about it, but I was willing.
I was not able to make the transfer over my bank app as the transfer would've taken 2-3 business days, and this all happened on a Sunday anyway, so the bank was not physically open for me to do the transfer in person. 
I told him that I can cashapp him the money, but he didn't want to make an account, so he just said, ""Nevermind.""
After every 24 hrs, his bank charges an overdraft fee. As a few days passed, he eventually got himself in $150 debt!!
Him and my mother both are begging me to transfer money out of my savings account, because *she* promises that he will pay me back.
She is insisting that if he does not pay me back, then she will for him; which is a whole other problem, because she also borrowed some hundred that she still owes me. (EDIT: she insists on paying me back. I did not ask of this from her. She knows that I do not expect repayment.)
I do not want to pay off debt he put himself in, whether I was ""promised"" money back or not. He and my mother both think it is justified because I am actively employed and making money + have a lot of savings being unused. 
While he is working unpaid (not by choice), with no savings to fall back on.
My savings are important to me bc idk what life is going to look like long term.
Idk if I'm being selfish with my money by letting him be charged overdraft fee after overdraft fee when I do have enough to help, especially because he has no time to earn money between college and his internship.

"AITA for not wanting someone at my shared party? Hi Reddit. I (26F) am turning 27 very soon. My friend ‚ÄúBecky‚Äù (26F) and I were born only a couple days apart, so this year she asked if we could have a shared birthday party at my house. (We've never done this before and I didn't really want a big party, but I said yes because my hubby and I recently moved into our own spacious house and property while Becky lives with her husband's parents.)

So Becky and her spouse have this friend ‚ÄúKyle‚Äù. Total scumbag IMO. Among other things he's a big time anti-vaxxer / C\*VID hoaxer AND had the nerve to bring up these conspiracy theories around Becky (who just lost a close family member to you-know-what) and their other friend whose mom had been sick. I just don't interact with him, my partner called him a moron on Facebook once but nothing ever came of it.

Anyway, Becky knows we don't like Kyle and told me and hubby she would ‚Äúrespect our wishes‚Äù because it was our house, and we got to decide whether Kyle was invited or not. However we never got to make that decision because roughly 14 hours later Becky declared she was going to tell Kyle he couldn't come because he doesn't have his shot. Okay, whatever, didn't really affect me. We were going to say yes. Except then it came out that Kyle has had it this whole time (he had to for work) and lied to them for over a year because he didn't want them to know he was a hypocrite.

Becky was EXTREMELY upset by this so I figured the matter was settled, but a couple days ago she showed me an apology Kyle sent her. She's completely forgiven him and expects us to have him at the party. I made it clear in no uncertain terms I was not okay with this, because she told me in the first place it was my decision, and it was never about Kyle's status it was about his behaviour. A day later she said she's going to have her own party now, and tried to tell me it was for a bunch of other reasons but when I asked she admitted she doesn't feel comfortable excluding Kyle since she was only willing to not invite him when she thought he didn't have the shot (which she obvs didn't tell us at the time). Plus they recently had this whole other juvenile situation unrelated to us where they excluded a different friend from playing games with them bcuz she was ‚Äúannoying‚Äù and they ‚Äúwant to avoid a repeat of that‚Äù.

When my partner tried to get clarification from her what was going on she ignored him and told me we were ‚Äúganging up on her,‚Äù this doesn't involve him and she ‚Äúdoesn't give a fuck about his feelings.‚Äù I told her he's planning this party too and it's also his house so yes it involves him. Things got pretty heated and we aren't really speaking now.

So who's TA here? She says I am for getting upset about this, I say she is for telling me it's up to me, when actually she was only willing to respect my choice as long as she felt the same, and is now backing out a week before the party to avoid an uncomfortable situation she created.",0.18
"AITA for bringing up the fact my friend got ‚Äúrejected‚Äù to him? I recently found out that one of my good friends got rejected by his crush. I found out as she told me herself, and she kinda laughed it off. At first I was kinda shocked, and I noticed that this all affected him.

One day when we were in a free class I sort of brought it up. I wanted to let him know that I knew, and that I was there for him. I also found it odd that he was so heartbroken while she was telling most people almost like she was making fun of him. As soon as I wanted to comfort him he immediately stopped smiling and looked angry. He told me that his problems were none of my business. I wanted to apologize for bringing it up but a friend approached us so I kept quiet.

He‚Äôs been dry and cold to me recently. I tried to crack a joke recently over text and he seemed so uninterested in what I had to say and just left me on opened. He‚Äôs also been off in general. AITA?",0.08

"WIBTA for not wishing my mom a happy birthday Never posted and on my phone, sorry about the format.

Back story, I (36F) moved Japan with my soon to be ex (stbx). We decided at the end of 2020 to divorce. Because of covid/logistics we agreed I'd stay until Feb 2021. I told my mom about the divorce and asked her not to tell my grandma as she is in bad health and stress/worries about anything and everything also very religious. Fast forward and I decided to get a job and stay in Japan. The beginning of March I discovered I'm pregnant. My stbx and I are good friends and he's excited for me (he's not the father) I told my mom and once again said don't say anything. She said because I'm having a baby I should tell my grandparents. I agreed and said I'd tell them one thing at a time and in the next week or two. 

Now the drama.
My mom and I use a video messaging app. I had some free time at work and decided to listen to her message. She tells me my younger cousin who's not married is pregnant as well and just told my grandma and grandma didn't have a problem with it. So my mom proceeded to tell my grandma everything! I was so hurt and felt disrespected and told my mom that wasn't her information to share and how she took away the reaction to my pregnancy from my grandma to me. She then messaged  ""sorry, I guess I can't do anything right"" which is not an apology just her claiming to be the victim.  I later message her that I'm setting boundaries and I'll tell her about my work, about the dog and how I am in general but she is no longer getting personal information from me about me or anything to do with the baby. I also told her because I'm having genetic testing done if there's anything wrong with the baby I'm not keeping it and that's why I didn't want to say anything about the pregnancy. Also that I won't be talking to her for awhile as I need my space.

My mom's birthday is the 18th and I'm not ready to talk to her and I don't want to even text her. 

So WIBTA if I don't wish her a happy birthday?",0.17

"AITA for not doing what I said I would do? My ex has been sending me long text and email messages. In them, they ask for closure, discuss their current living situation, employment status, educational endeavors, etc. I have not been replying to the messages. 

My SO and I agree that my ex cannot keep sending me messages. We discussed that the only way that they might stop sending messages is if I send my own (email, text) message and tell them clearly to stop. I told my SO that I would send a message to my ex telling them to stop. 

Since that conversation, I have not received another message from my ex. I have not sent my ex the message that I told my SO I would send. Nor did I tell my SO that I did not send the message I agreed to send. 

I feel that because I haven‚Äôt gotten another message from my ex that the message didn‚Äôt need to be sent and that I didn‚Äôt need to inform my SO that it wasn‚Äôt sent. There was no discussion that I would send the message immediately or that I would wait to send the message when I received another communication - that was left open ended. 

My SO is upset that I didn‚Äôt send the message I agreed to send. I also didn‚Äôt tell my SO that I didn‚Äôt send it. My SO feels that I betrayed them by not following through with what I said and that I lied to them by saying I was going to do something that I didn‚Äôt do. They feel that I intentionally misled them.

"AITAH for telling my mom‚Ä¶ I (29) female recently found out that I‚Äôm going blind in one eye. At the same time I also found out I have a rare brain disorder and learned that my quality of life may change if the medication im placed on doesn‚Äôt work. I told my family and many of them weren‚Äôt very sympathetic to what was happening aside from my mother. I want to preface this with that some of my family members are not at all emotional or very empathetic people. 

The other day when I went to work, I got a text message from my sister who decided to tell me that my father had been making fun of me and joking about my condition. My mother ended up snapping at him and called him out on his lack of sympathy and blamed him for many things unrelated to my issue. My sister tried defending my father telling my mother he was simply joking however I don‚Äôt find jokes about my condition funny. My sister explained this to me via text while I was at work, and I found this to be upsetting because number one she didn‚Äôt stick up for me, and number two my family, specifically father were talking about me behind my back about a very serious topic. My sister told me an argument ensued between her and my mother and I told her regardless of what was said, I would have rather not known what was said; as they say ignorance is bliss. 

I called my mother asking her for clarification about what my father said about me but she refused to share it with me, stating that he was just being stupid and insensitive as usual, but I told her I didn‚Äôt find it funny and didn‚Äôt appreciate my sister telling me this. My mother then reached out to my sister angrily asking her why she told me and ask why she just didn‚Äôt keep it to herself. My sister then texts me in an angry flurry of texts blaming me stating I was at fault for everything. She stated I was the dramatic one and said she was confiding in me not to say anything. I told her I thought what she told me was unnecessary and that information didn‚Äôt benefit me in any way, and in fact made me feel worse about what‚Äôs happening to me. She then proceeded to call me names and told me to never speak to her again because I cant be trusted with anything. She deleted me off social media and blocked me all together from everything. I told her that it‚Äôs not my fault that she can‚Äôt take accountability for any wrongdoing she does, and then blaming me for something she simply could have kept to herself.

"AITA for giving gifts? So when I met my partner his family would give everyone $30 for their birthday. After a year or two his mum basically said that it had gotten to be too much. They'd get gifts for the kids from now on but not for adults. I was okay with this as $30 a person was getting to be quite expensive. 

We moved for a while to be closer to my family but  recently moved back. In the time we were away I spent a lot of time baking and I'm actually pretty good at it now. I used to give my family and friends home made baked goods for Christmas, Easter etc. I loved doing it and everyone appreciated it. 

Now we are back living near his family I want to do the same for them. I love giving people little treats and gifts and I don't care about getting anything in return. With Easter approaching I've pulled out my Easter themed cookie cutters and started planning some Easter themed sugar cookies with cute decorations. 

His mum caught wind of this and has demanded I put a stop to it, she said it will make people feel bad if I give them gifts and they have nothing for me, I told her I don't care about getting something in return. It's just something little and I like doing it. 

She is adamant that if I go through with it, then I'm an asshole and putting people in a shitty situation.",0.08

"AITA for taking away a present that my son was given? I would like to start off that my husband (40M) and I (34F) do not spoil our kids. We are very well off but both of us started off from a very poor background, so we really want our kids to earn things and them not being given to them. We have three kids, Sara(11F), Ben (9M) and, Keith (7M). The only time we spoil them is at holidays and their birthdays. We like to go out for those time. The rest of the time we will only buy necessities, like new clothes, schools supplies and what not when needed.

So our kids have one chore to do everyday, We have a chore chart that rotates between, vacuuming, fill dishwasher and empty dishwasher. Now we have a another chores chart that they can pick a chore from and if they do it earn 50 cents. There have to be over thirty different chores on that chart can be done everyday (things like sweep the steps, clean kitchen counters, dust). So if you do three extra chores that day you earn 1.50. At the end of the week we pay our kids. Each kid has there own secure spot to keep there money. We start each kid doing this at 6 years old to teach them money management. It works really well and Sara has over 200 dollars saved up and keith is starting to learn how to save.

My son Ben has never gotten the hang of saving. He has always been the type to spend everything he earns very quickly. He usually will do enough chores a week to get ten buck. By Wednesday the money is gone since he will spend it all at the school store (candy and what not). Well a new Kirby game came out for the switch and he wanted it. Well he didn't have any money saved up so he has to earn the amount he needs to buy it. The game is about 60 dollars so that means 120 chores. Well ben was really struggling at the beginning but was slowly saving up the money. He now is half way there. 

My SIL has never like this system and really believe kids should be spoiled. When she was over today she download the game on the switch and showed it to Ben. Ben started to play the game and we notice when he already started the game. We were very angry at SIL since it defeated the whole point of what we were trying to teach. So while SIL was here I removed the game from the switch and explained to Ben that he still needs to earn the game. That I will redownload it when he earned the money.

SIL blows up at me and tell us that its a present and my kid doesn't have to earn crap. That we are awful parents for doing this to our kid. She left and told my husbands mother and told us the same thing. Now we are both doubting our system even though it work great for Sara.

"AITA for telling my bipolar sister she‚Äôs selfish Me and my sister are both 18F. My twin sister has Bipolar disorder so growing up i knew she would need more attention from our parents . Our parents are divorced and we live with our dad even though our parents are on good terms but .. our dad is a alcoholic  so while our mom tried our hardest to help my sister she couldn‚Äôt be around all the time. 
I have been in my sisters shadow since i was a child . Even when this bothered me i never spoke up because i knew she was struggling. My sister could be a real bitch sometimes and her and my girlfriend never got along because my girlfriend saw how my sister would sort of walk all over me. she practically hated my sister .
Now for backstory ‚Äî my sister had always wanted to be prom queen it was her dream even since she was a kid because our mother was and she wanted to follow in her footsteps , i wanted to be prom queen too as i also wanted to follow after my mother but i never really told my sister.
My sister broke her arm and she didn‚Äôt want to run for prom queen anymore because she thought it would ‚Äúlower her chances ?‚Äù so she asked her girlfriend to step in for her to try and take the prom queen title . This really pissed me off that she didn‚Äôt ask me but i didn‚Äôt tell her but my girlfriend told me i should try and win anyway. So i ran for prom queen which really angered my sister but she didn‚Äôt have her girlfriend drop out of the running ‚Äî Having her go against me !
At prom my girlfriend told me she was moving and we broke up And then my sisters girlfriend won prom queen which stung even more 
I approached my sister telling her my girlfriend was moving and she told me she already knew! She had heard my girlfriend telling her friends around last week . So out of anger i told her she never cares about anyone but herself.
The next day i avoided her i was hurt and angry and depressed and i didn‚Äôt wanna see her .
My sister never takes her medication. My dad never really notices so she usually gets away with it. But it just makes her more bitchy
Her girlfriend approached me a few days ago in school . Telling me my sister had a really bad episode and she had calmed her down for now she thinks my sister could really use my help
i told her that letting her crash and showing her i won‚Äôt always be there for her will be the only way she will get help learn to take her meds 
her girlfriend then told me that my sister can‚Äôt control her brain chemistry which made me feel guilty but i stood my ground 
me and my sister live in the same house still though and we got in a fight yesterday where i told her all i ever did was worry about her and she told me it‚Äôs my fault i hid in her shadow for so long and she never asked me to do that. i told her to come to me when she wants to beg for forgiveness.
everyone seems to think i‚Äôm the asshole , especially my mom but i really don‚Äôt think i am.",0.95

"AITA for getting mad at my friend for not giving me a month to stay at his apartment? A bit of a back story. My boyfriend (23) & I (23f) allowed my friend (21,m) to stay at our 2 bedroom apartment hours away from our hometown because he messed on his nursing clinical rotations and was going to flunk out of nursing school. So he decided to move away from our home town and move in with us and try the nursing school in a new city. 

He got a job but he hated the management and people and told them off then quit even though he was living paycheck to paycheck. He was out of a job for 3 months and would voluntarily cook and clean for us while we were at work since he was home 24/7‚Ä¶then he‚Äôd get mad at us that he cooked and cleaned and called us ‚Äúmessy‚Äù. 

I felt bad he was -$200 in his checking account so I gave him my credit card since I don‚Äôt use it and so he can buy groceries and gas. I was wrong. He racked up 2.3K on my credit card and owes us $850 for rent. He‚Äôs only giving me $50 for they credit card to date.

Fast forward to now, our apartment is ending our lease a month before our new apartment is available meaning we‚Äôre going to have to stay at my bfs sisters for a month who already has 2 big dogs and a small home. My bfs sister has never liked me so I don‚Äôt feel comfortable staying with her. My bf and I have a small cat and a medium sized long-haired dog. He got a new apartment and will be moving in the month we will be ‚Äúhomeless‚Äù but refuses to allow us to stay because of our animals even after all we‚Äôve done for him. Mind you he also has a small dog that we welcomed to our home.

I called him snobby and an a-hole. He says I‚Äôm disrespecting him. AITA?

"AITA for saying a classist joke to a toxic friend that has said worse? I know what I said was mean. My friend, let‚Äôs call her Luna (14F), and I (14F) have been friends for almost a year now, and our friendship is mainly based off of jokes. The past 5 months the jokes on her part have been getting worse. The ‚Äòjokes‚Äò that she says have been making fun of my sexuality, religion, phobia/anxiety, other friends, appearance, supposedly ‚Äòrich and prosperous life‚Äò (which is false), and how my hard earned grades are just because my mom is a teacher and is hacking the school and making deals. 

These aren‚Äôt just one-timers; they are repetitive and in front of people most the time. Obviously I have told her to stop with the worse jokes. I ended up changing what I wear and feeling bad about myself for a while because she said that I had acne and hair everywhere. 

Fast forward to recently, we‚Äôre in class and she says something about my folder and that I‚Äôm rich because I take a (free) dual enrollment class at the local community college. I get a little annoyed with that, but since I bottle my emotions, I decide to respond with a joke. That joke just so happened to be ‚ÄúShut up, Luna, at least I don‚Äôt live in an apartment and have a crush on a childhood friend!‚Äù I know that was not the right thing to say, and I did say it in front of a few people, but most the class was talking.

 I get some angry texts from her, and I was still thinking that it was a joke. I then realized it wasn‚Äôt and apologized (multiple times and very well) about the crush part of the joke. She said it was ‚Äútoo far.‚Äù My phone then starts blowing up with 3 different people yelling at me calling me a privileged, classist piece of shit, proving everything in my life has been handed to me and I didn‚Äôt have to work for it ever. May I add that the apartment that Luna lives in is nice and expensive, she regularly shows up at school with chick-ful-a and starbucks, and my house isn‚Äôt even that big or nice. I ended up apologizing about the classist joke to not just the person that constantly makes hurtful jokes knowing I hate them, but to several others who she turned against me. They didn‚Äôt forgive me and I am now being shunned at school.

"AITA for forgetting to clock out my boyfriend while he takes a nap? My boyfriend 31M just got a new work from home job which has been great so far, I 21F enjoy seeing him so much more and he seems to be far less stressed out and the only thing that we had yet to do was go out and drink with friends like we used to with his old job. We‚Äôve done this plenty of times and he was almost always able to get up and go to work with no problem in the morning. This new job starts later in the day and he doesn‚Äôt have to get up early to drive over because it‚Äôs just in his office. Last night we were out for an hour less than usual and didn‚Äôt drink as much so I thought it would be much easier on him with adjusting to his new job. I noticed he had a hard time waking up but don‚Äôt we all after a night of drinking, he woke up the latest he could allow himself and went to work. When I woke up later in the day (I‚Äôm currently on the job hunt and sleeping in after a night out sounded nice) he was on his lunch break and we ate lunch together on the couch. He laid down halfway through and mentioned he was tired which I assumed he would take one of his 15 minute naps but he didn‚Äôt and instead mentioned taking a nap after work which I said he should. He contemplated about it and said he wanted me to clock him out because they would let him out of training early but still want him clocking out at a certain time after. I personally didn‚Äôt feel comfortable with it and mentioned several times I didn‚Äôt know how to clock out for him, my mistake was probably not mentioning it made me uncomfortable. He was still mulling it over when he went back to work. They did let out of training early and he came and laid down on the bed telling me to clock out for him because he was so tired and couldn‚Äôt stay up much longer. I finally just said ok after he explained to me how to do it and went back to what I was previously doing. I got up from my desk to stretch and go to the kitchen when I realized it was 20 minutes past the time I was supposed to clock him out at, I was mentally scolding myself for not setting an alarm mostly because I didn‚Äôt want to wake my boyfriend up with it. Me getting up somehow woke him up and he asked immediately if I clocked him out, I felt like a kid that was getting in trouble so I sheepishly said ‚Äúwhat..?‚Äù as if it would help. He asked again so I told the truth that I had forgotten, he rolled his eyes and groaned then buried his face in the pillow to go back to sleep. He hasn‚Äôt said a word since and I feel like a total jerk saying I would do something as easy as clocking him out and not doing it. Honestly I feel so bad, he did mention earlier he could just say fuck it and have them fix his time tomorrow morning and I know that‚Äôs what he‚Äôll have to do and it‚Äôs not a huge hassle but it wasn‚Äôt the plan and I seem incompetent now.

"AITA for going for a walk at night without telling anyone where I was going? I decided to go for a walk yesterday at night because I was feeling hot and bored. My husband wasn‚Äôt at home and my mother-in-law had already gone to her room to rest, I also never planned to be gone for very long or to leave the property so I never mentioned I was leaving to anyone.

I ended up going for 2 hours and leaving the property because I was enjoying the walk and just kept going. I didn‚Äôt have my phone so I never realised how long I had been gone until I went home and saw my very pissed off husband and worried mother-in-law.

Apparently, they had been calling me nonstop and thought something bad had happened to me. My husband was in the middle of arranging for people to go look for me when I walked in so I think that contributed to his anger but we ended up fighting because I didn't like how he was talking to me.

AITA for calling my mother worthless? [deleted],0.11
"AITA for being offended by the comments that my (25F) boyfriend's (27M) parents said about me? About 5 months into dating my bf (27M), he told me (25F) that his parents reminded him ""not to get taken advantage of.""

When he shared this with me, I was surprised and disappointed because I had no idea where it came from. We have only dated for 6 months total. I haven't even met his parents yet. I do my best to go above and beyond to be a good gf, whether it's being caring, taking turns paying for dates, cooking food for him, or buying him expensive gifts. I wanted to make sure that I hadn't accidentally said or done things that caused his parents to dislike me, so I asked my bf to talk with them to get clarification.

My bf found out that his parents dislike the following facts about me:

1) I'm a nurse, which they consider to be a dirty job that brings germs home to the family. They think working with sick people will cause me to put my bf/future kids at risk, so they think I am unfit to have children with him. I asked my bf if his parents felt this way due to the pandemic, but he said that they've always held this belief towards frontline workers.

2) I have allergies. One time, my bf's sister was baking cookies, and he commented that I can't eat the peanut ones because I am allergic to peanuts. His parents think my peanut allergy means I am genetically flawed, and therefore unfit to have children with my bf. My bf actually sides with his parents on this one.

3) I grew up without my dad. His parents believe this fact about my upbringing makes my background inferior to theirs.

To be completely honest, I was incredibly hurt and saddened when I heard all this because it sounds like they dislike things about me that are beyond my control. I was literally born with a peanut allergy and I don't think it's my fault that I didn't grow up with both parents like my boyfriend, so I find it unfair that they are holding these things against me.

I suppose I have some control over #1, in the sense that I could theoretically quit my job and change careers to make them happy, but it's not something I can easily do because I have invested so much time and energy into becoming a nurse. I also think it's unreasonable for them to stereotype my career because I work in a highly specialized area where adhering to sterile technique is literally the most important thing in my job.

My bf tried communicating with his parents about the career issue, but the conclusion is that his parents will never change their perception of me.

At best, they feel neutral/indifferent toward me because they see that I am a caring person who is hard working, educated, and can take very good care of my bf. On the other hand, he tells me point blank that there's absolutely nothing I can do to make them actually like me because their opinions about the above 3 points are set in stone. No matter how much I do for him, my acts of caring and kindness will never win back the points I lost on being a nurse, having a peanut allergy, and growing up without my dad.

"AITA For pushing my little brother too much? I'm (22 F) constantly irritated/angry that my little brother (12 M) never does chores. Whenever I confront him, it always turns into an argument. Some things I'd really appreciate from him are:

- Doing the dishes. Only a handful of times has he done a couple of dishes. I'm usually the main dishwasher of the house, if not my dad will.

- Picking up the trash. He'll sit at a certain spot for a long time, and when he leaves, he'll leave wrappers /socks and shoes/ dirty dishes for us to clean. If I ask him to clean, he'll do a half-assed job at it. When I ask him to really finish cleaning, my parents get upset at confronting him.

- Cleaning his pee around the toilet seat/not leaving it up. He hates cleaning it, so obviously me/my parents clean it. We hate it too.

These are just my biggest peeves, and I don't think it's too much. However, my parents, don't like it when I confront him. I'm always told I'm too ""tweaky"", ""wiggy"", ""hormonal"" etc, and I'm ALWAYS told to calm down and wait to talk until later.

"AITA for leaving my house after my mom didn't respond to me? So a little backstory, my mom (48F) is always angry at me (13F) when I'm on my phone too much, as any parent would be.

I would never want to worry her and have her think I'd gone missing but I was tired of it at this point and I wanted to prove a point that she was on her phone too much. 

When I got home she was blowing up at me saying how could I leave without asking first, why wouldn't I of texted her, she called me ungrateful and irresponsible and then grounded me. Now I know what I did was stupid but AITA",0.53
"AITA for being upset that my partner is going to a sporting event without me? I (29F) have been trying to get tickets to a sporting event (staying intentionally vague here, sorry) for months now, originally hoping to get them for my partner (35M) for Christmas. They were impossible to get. Once I told him that I couldn‚Äôt get them, he was like ‚ÄúAw that would have been awesome but it‚Äôs ok.‚Äù 

Yesterday, I get an email that they‚Äôre releasing one last batch of tickets. I tell him we should try again and he agrees. But we didn‚Äôt realize the release was today, so we missed them again. 

To clarify, this event is for a sport we both enjoy and participate in. He just picked it up within the last five or so years while I‚Äôve enjoyed it and participated since I was a child.

Tonight, he tells me that his friend texted his friend group saying he can get four tickets. He says one of his friends is already in but that he‚Äôs on the fence about it. I was confused and said, ‚Äúwell if the two of them already claimed tickets and they‚Äôre going with [their wive‚Äôs names] then aren‚Äôt all four tickets already gone?‚Äù He looked at me blankly while I realized and said, ‚Äúoh, this is like a guy‚Äôs trip thing.‚Äù He said yes. I said, ‚Äúwell, that really sucks‚Äù but told him he should go. 

I told him he should, and I meant it, but I‚Äôm still really upset that he spent zero minutes trying to procure tickets to this event while I spent months trying to get them for *us* to go, and then the tickets fall in his lap and he‚Äôs going without me.

"AITA for not wanting an XBox X? Hubs (50 M) and I (50F) have been married nearly 30 yrs.  Since we share a joint bank account, we always had an agreement that an individual purchase more than, say, $500 needed to be agreed upon by both partners.

So Hubs tells me he went an ordered an XBox X.  My husband is not a gamer, although he did play Clash of Clans or something like it.  He always says he couldn‚Äôt do well in video games because he has sucky hand-eye coordination.  We have an adult boy, who plays frequently in his own room on a PC.   

He says he is hoping it will draw the son out of his room, so they can play together.  He says ‚Äúmaybe we can even find something for you to play!‚Äù   

I am upset that he is spending our money on something I don‚Äôt believe he will use.   He has numerous ongoing projects around the house that he likes to do, a gargantuan collection of anime videos (most of which he hasn‚Äôt even opened), and now he decided he needs an XBox?   If I thought this would be good for him in any way, shape or form, I would support him.  But I don‚Äôt think he will spend any quality time with his son in front of an XBox. 

TL;DR Husband bought a $600 XBox without consulting me and I think it‚Äôs a waste of money.  AITA?",0.33

"AITA for getting mad at my mom for not telling us she has MRSA? So, my mom has been sick for a few days. She had classic food poisoning symptoms (vomiting, fatigue, etc.). She was also taking antibiotics for a nailbed infection that she later found out was MRSA (which, for those that don't know, is an antibiotic-resistant staph infection). We later determined that the cause of her vomiting and cramping was her antibiotics. 

Today, she casually mentions that she thinks she got MRSA from me because I'm a high school student and it travels through our schools sometimes. I got upset that she didn't tell me that she had MRSA. She got offended that I was only upset with her out of the fear of me contracting it, which, for the most part, is true (I'm a pretty big hypochondriac). She has recovered completely fine, and her symptoms came only from her antibiotics.

AITA?

TL;DR

My mom had MRSA and didn't tell me. I got upset with her for not telling me she had a contagious infection. She got upset with me because I ""wasn't worried about her and only worried about myself"".",0.31

"AITA for refusing to let my partner‚Äôs sister borrow my car? Okay real quick this is my first post so I apologize for anything I may do wrong. I haven‚Äôt been on Reddit for long. 

Alright so, my partner and I are planning to go to Las Vegas over the weekend from San Diego. We‚Äôre going over to celebrate my grandmas birthday. My partner invited his mom (who lives here in San Diego) to come along with us to Las Vegas, she agreed. She‚Äôs excited and ends up telling my partner‚Äôs sister that she‚Äôs going to Vegas with us. His sister gets excited and asked if she could come too, we said sure but that we don‚Äôt have space in my partner‚Äôs car, it‚Äôs a small Ford Focus, and we‚Äôre three people and three small dogs. She says it‚Äôs fine and asks if she could borrow my car to drive to Vegas. I said yes but that my two front tires need replacing. I didn‚Äôt have money at the moment to replace them so I said she would need to buy tires if she wanted to take my car. She said she would ask someone else first before she said yes. 

Fast forward to the day we leave to Vegas. I have already bought new tires for my car. She says she‚Äôs still going, and she‚Äôs bringing along her boyfriend and her two kids, but she doesn‚Äôt mention what car she‚Äôs taking. I assume she found a car or at the very least is renting. She sends me a text letting me know she‚Äôs taking my car that night. I let my partner know that she‚Äôs going to be using my car and he gets serious and gives her a call. He tells her that if she wanted to use my car she would need to give me $150 for the two front tires I purchased. She gets upset and tell him that it‚Äôs too much and that she doesn‚Äôt have the money for that. So in the end she doesn‚Äôt use my car and she ends up being passive aggressive towards me. However she does end up in Vegas but just barely. Are we the AH in this situation. I feel wrong about it, but I don‚Äôt know. Sorry if this is all over the place. I tried to correct grammar, and I‚Äôm not a very good writer. üòÖ",0.07
"AITA for being mad at my partner for giving his dad $2000? So my (28) partner (31) and I have been together for 4 years. We are getting married in September. We have separate bank accounts and he makes a little bit more than I do. 
Last week his uncle passed away. His dad was driving 9 hours away to where the uncle (his dads brother) lived to sort out his belongings and make funeral arrangements. In the rush of everyone finding out about the passing and his dad hastily packing his things to make the journey there my partner gave his dad his whole pay check ($2000) to use however he needed (food, hotel, etc). 
My partners dad is pretty well off, he made the sunshine list last year (make more than $100,000) and his mom makes a decent amount of money as well‚Ä¶they did not NEED the $2000 (funeral was already paid for) but I think in his dads rush to leave and grief he just took the money which i totally understand! EDIT: I am not mad about this
The day after the funeral I found out how much money my partner had given and felt sick. He also paid $700 for his entire family and friends dinner after the funeral (which he didn‚Äôt tell me about until after it was paid). 
 I know it‚Äôs not my money and he earned it but that is a lot of money and I can‚Äôt help but feel worried for the future because of the fact that he so willingly threw this money away without thinking of his own finances. It‚Äôs really making me rethink things and makes me not want to join our bank accounts after we get married if he is going to make thoughtless decisions with money that put him in the hole financially. I haven‚Äôt confronted him or told him about how I am feeling because his uncle just died and it‚Äôs not the time. Also I don‚Äôt even know if I have a right to be worried/mad given it‚Äôs not my money! EDIT: **im not trying to tell him where to spend his money or control his finances im just thinking ahead to when we are married as this hasty spending has been a pattern**
Am I the asshole if I bring up the $2700 he gave away to have a discussion about future spending after we are married? And how would I justify my worry given it‚Äôs not my money?

**edit to clarify: I‚Äôm not worried about how he spent it, I‚Äôm not trying to control his finances, just the pattern of him giving money away before thinking of his own finances as he is now telling me he needs to pick up shifts because of how much money he‚Äôs out**

Edit for people asking for the spending pattern: another instance where he gave money away was he gave a friend $3000 to help buy a trailer for his business. This was not a loan and he did not benefit from this trailer other than using it maybe once a year.",0.64
"AITA for wanting my girlfriend to never talk to one of her only friends? My girlfriend and I have been dating for almost a year. A couple of months before we started dating, she had broken up with this guy because their relationship was very toxic. They ended in good terms and decided to stay as mutuals. Over time, a friendship started to grow between them. I was well aware he was her ex and didn't mind because I trust my girlfriend. My girlfriend is a bit shy and therefore doesn't have much friends. I always did my best to not interfere with any of her friends. One day she finds herself very stressed and really overwhelmed with her own personal issues and mental health. She decides it's best if we took some space for each other and I said ""it's fine with me. If you need anything, just let me know"". We didn't really talk much for a couple of weeks but one day she calls me crying because she was at a really low point and her ""friend"" didn't care, said mean things to her and tried putting the blame on her for things she never did. I told her it be best if she'd block him and stop talking to him. She agreed and did so. Nothing from him for weeks. I'd never seen her happier and everything in our relationship seemed to be getting better. After about 5 weeks, he texts her and they start talking. After they talk they decide to stay as mutuals again. And after a while they start up being friends again. I feel very uncomfortable knowing they're friends. She asked me if I was upset about it but I said ""no"". I feel like I should've said yes. Everything about him makes me uncomfortable. Not only that, he has tried sexually harassing her while we were in a relationship. Whenever I try to bring it up now, she brushes it off or tells me that I'm overreaching. I'm honestly waiting for the day he decides to start treating her bad again so she would stop being friends with him again. Am I the asshole for wanting that?",0.41
AITA for sending an apology letter to my ex? [deleted],0.86
"AITA for telling my brother that if he ever contacted my parents again I would tell his probation officer about the times he's broken his probation? My parents are overbearing. To them being overly involved in their kid's lives is the default. We are South Asian so it's normal in our culture. There is a reason I don't live in Alberta with the rest of my family. I don't have a bad relationship with them. I just prefer some space so they can't meddle as much. I have an older brother, a younger brother and a younger sister. I'm in contact with all of them but I'm closest with my younger brother because we are only a year apart. Even now we te each other things we don't tell anyone else. I thought at least. This is what my post is about.

I have a girlfriend and we have talked about marriage. My girlfriend adamantly does not want kids. Honestly I am good either way so it's not a deal breaker for me. My girlfriend did not have the best home life as a kid. One of her parents went to jail. The other parent married someone with several sons who were younger than my girlfriend. My girlfriend's other parent had a (diagnosed by actual doctors) personality disorder. Her stepparent liked to drink. Growing up my girl was responsible for all the chores and to do most of the parenting of her step brothers. I told my younger brother all of this. My girlfriend said I could. She has met my whole family by phone, email and video call but she has met my brother the most. She knows we are close. I know things about my brother too. Like how he left Alberta for a trip with his friends which was a violation of his probation. Or things he did he didn't get arrested for. There is a million other things.

After I told my brother I've been thinking about marriage a lot lately my parents called me. They forbade me from doing it because she doesn't want kids and her background (one parent in and out of jail and one in and out of mental institutions). I've never told them anything about it and they told me my brother tells them everything I don't tell them. They told me several other things I confided in my brother to. They have forbidden me from marrying my girlfriend and ordered me to break up with her and find a woman who wants kids with a better background. It's weird they think they have any power to forbid me. Also my older brother has 5 kids and my sister has 2 so they gave grandchildren already and will have more in the future because my older brother and my sister want more and my younger brother also wants kids one day.

I feel so betrayed. I've never broken his confidence. I told him to never contact me again. I'm not asking about that. What I would like to know is if saying that if he did I would tell his probation officer the things he's done to break his probation or the other crimes he's committed (I could prove it). Not only does he think this was unfair but he told our parents, brother and sister about it and they lost it on me and said I was really unfair and wrong to threaten to do that. My younger brother says my parents had a right to know but he didn't tell me that because I would disagree.",0.12

"AITA for refusing to wear the prom dress my mom wants me to So I bought found a beautiful 90s gown at a vintage store and i rushed to buy it (with my own money might i add considering that i work almost every day) with the intentions of wearing it to prom. I brought it home all excited and it fit me perfectly, absolutely loved it. 

My mom hated it and made that clear, but I shrugged her off and said I was going to wear it to prom anyways.

Some weeks pass and I go to try it on again for fun and I can‚Äôt find it. Usually when my mom doesn‚Äôt like something she‚Äôll hide it, so over the past couple weeks I kept on asking her where my dress was. In response she would laugh and say she doesn‚Äôt know.

Recently before I went out with my friend, she happily told my friend she threw it away, then told me :) I was pretty gutted, not just because of the dress but just because she would do something like that behind my back. 

I was upset and made that clear over text, to which she responded by sending me loads of pictures of dresses she‚Äôd rather me wear. I told her i will not wear any prom dress she gets me and will just reuse an old dress i wore to some fancy party. She then yells at me for being arrogant and not telling her what color. 

Apparently she bought a dress even after i made it clear i wouldn‚Äôt wear it.

I was still angry when i got home and just avoided her‚Äîand she ignored me as well. She comes downstairs to tell me I need to walk the dog tonight. I don‚Äôt answer which gives her the opportunity to yell at me for 30 minutes saying i am very disrespectful, arrogant and apparently treat her like shit, repeatedly exclaiming ‚Äúwhat have i done wrong?‚Äù :) 

I didn‚Äôt say anything bc she was in her so angry if you talk you may get smacked kinda mood. I instead went ona walk and climbed a tree. 

She is still mad that i won‚Äôt wear the dress she got me. I don‚Äôt think i am being ungrateful but she is adamant that i am. AITA?

Edit on dress details: The dress I got wasn‚Äôt inappropriate. The dresses she sent photos of and ultimately selected were all tighter and more revealing

EDIT: She felt bad after a couple days. She said she made a mistake and asked me to forgive her. I can‚Äôt really stay mad for longer than a day so all good now. She said she would go to the goodwill and see if she could get it back, I told her not to worry about it and i‚Äôll just wear whatever dress I prefer between the one she got me and one I already had. She also got me sushi, and I was effectively bought off",0.2
"AITA for refusing to give my sister soap for her OCD I f19 have a sister f16 who has ocd symptoms, it‚Äôs not officially diagnosed as it‚Äôs nothing extreme so no one‚Äôs ever been to the doctors about it but my mum knows she had traits when she was younger and I also went through a rough patch with ocd traits when I was 12-14.
When I struggled with it, it was very frustrating and I would have to do certain rituals etc however I learnt how to cope with breaking the cycle and eventually I ignored the intrusive thoughts and urges.

My sister however does not and has made no effort to help herself. She has it worse than I do but nothing extreme. She does certain rituals before she goes to bed like turning all the lights off in the house and makes sure to check every room but everyone usually just lets her get on with it unless it bothers anyone else.

The problem is here: one night it was late and we ran out of soap in the upstairs bathroom this isn‚Äôt usually a big deal as we‚Äôll just substitute it for something like hand sanitiser or washing up liquid until we buy some more the next day. But I have an on-suite so I still had soap my problem was that whenever I would let my sister borrow the soap or use it she would never put it back which would annoy me as it‚Äôs mine and I like to have it available in my bathroom.
So this night she knocks on my door and asks to use it. I say she can use it but only to wash her hands in my bathroom instead of taking it to the upstairs bathroom to use. She freaks out and starts to panic saying it‚Äôs for her ocd and NEEDS it as I guess washing her hands was one of her new patterns. I tell her that if she wanted to wash them so bad in the upstairs bathroom she can just use washing up liquid and she says it‚Äôs not the same and it has to be THIS soap.  I still tell her no. By this point she is yelling and making a big scene trying to get my parents involved to make me. I say no and lock my door so they can‚Äôt get in my room and take it for her because in my opinion this only enables her OCD and encourages it to take control of her instead of breaking the cycle. In the end my sister ends up making my dad go to the shop to buy her this specific soap.

Edit: for people saying I don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs like to have OCD, yes I do, I had it when I was younger and it got pretty bad at times, I can‚Äôt remember much cos it was years ago but I learnt to cope with it as it would stop me from doing everyday activities and ignore it etc. 
My problem with her is that she knows she has it and it makes her do these rituals but is making no effort to help herself, I‚Äôve recommended going to the doctor to maybe see if they can help/get an official diagnosis but she doesn‚Äôt seem to care. 
I know it was a shitty thing to do to withhold the soap from her but in reality I was just trying to make a point about yeh she has ocd but does not seem to care about how it affects other people in the slightest. I know soap seems a silly thing to get annoyed with but it‚Äôs just built up over time. Maybe I need therapy too, who knows ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",0.34

"WIBTA for skipping my neices christening? In July I am travelling internationally for a week to visit my brother with my mum and kids (8f and 6f). It's their first trip overseas and we plan on visiting my brother, meeting his daughter who will be 4 months old, and seeing my grandfather, as well as doing the sights (zoo, aquarium, theme Park etc). We are there for 5 days. We aren't staying with him, but in accommodation nearby so we don't invade their space.

My brother is not religious. Agnostic at best, same with my mum. I'm athiest. Bro has been talking about getting his baby christened ""to follow the family tradition"" (we were christened, it was the 80s, its what you did), And is talking about doing it while we are there. I don't have an issue with him doing it. What ever floats your boat type of philosophy. However I do not want my kids involved, and have no interest in spending a day of my holiday participating in a ceremony I do not believe in at all.

"AITA for letting my friend go home by herself? So I went on a night out with my friends/colleagues. Originally I had made plans to go home with one of them (F24) let‚Äôs call her Kayleigh, and stay with her and her sister (F20) Mary. During the night, Mary came up to me and insisted that no matter what I shouldn‚Äôt let Kayleigh go home alone. I thought that this was unnecessary given she‚Äôs older than me (F18) and obviously i wasn‚Äôt going to straight up abandon Kayleigh, but she‚Äôs an adult at the end of the day and I figured plenty responsible to go home however she liked.

As the night progresses, the original group of us all sort of did our own thing (but we were all still in the same club). I end up bumping into some old friends from school and proceed to hang out with them. After chatting to them plans change and I‚Äôm offered a different lift home with one of these friends instead as it‚Äôs nearer where I live so makes more sense. After speaking to Mary, she said she wanted to go home early and had been offered a lift home with some friends so wanted to check I was ok with this, and explained that I had had an offer from another set of friends so it was more than ok by me. At this point she tells me to make sure I stick with Kayleigh, and I say ofc and Mary heads home.

A while later Kayleigh comes up to me and says she‚Äôs was going to head home. She seemed fine and had just had enough for the night and didn‚Äôt suggest or insist on me joining her. So I made sure I saw her into her taxi and that she got on her way home. 

AITA for not going home with Kayleigh despite saying to Mary earlier on in the night that I wouldn‚Äôt let Kayleigh go home alone.

"WIBTA for pretending my roommates cat got outside and taking him? I have lived with my roommate for two years now (we're civil but not close), and she got her cat last year as an emotional support animal. He isn't very cuddly though, and it's always been a conversation about how he's ""not a good emotional support animal & not doing his job"".

Last year I would check his water bowl in her room and it would either be very dirty or empty, so I would clean it or fill it every few days. This year, he has gotten really attached to me because I am the only one who plays with him. I have NEVER seen her play with him once. Since his water bowl is deep into her room this year and I don't want to be invasive, I have a water bowl for him in the kitchen that he drinks out of every day, which I started doing when he was drying to drink from the tub and I assumed she didn't fill his water. I got home from being gone for a week, and his kitchen water bowl was completely empty. I went into her room and saw that the water bowl in there was also completely dry. Since I know he only really drinks from the one in the kitchen, I have no idea how many days his water bowls were dry.

I checked his litter box when I wen't into her room, and it was COMPLETELY full and probably hadn't been emptied in weeks, so I emptied it. I had asked her once before how often she cleans his litter box, and she said ""about every 1 or 2 weeks"". He usually just uses the other cat in the house's litter box because his is always disgusting.

I have also heard her on the phone with her mom saying ""I ran out of cat food like two days ago, I should probably go get some but I don't feel like it"", so I don't think she fed him during that time.

The only ""affection"" i've seen her give him is trying to cuddle him by holding him tight for a very long time while he screams to get let go, and otherwise she pretty much ignores him or if he meows she tells him to shut up.

Her cat sleeps on my bed almost every night, and she has said many times that he likes me more than he likes her. I love him like he's my own cat, and I'm afraid that next year there won't be someone to give him water and play with him. It's hard to explain, but If I were to ask her to keep him, I know that she would say no because she is very performative (in my opinion) with acting like she loves him only when I or someone else is around. Since I have been caring for the needs that she doesn't, I don't think reporting neglect would work also.

"AITA - not giving enough information to my coworker I (35M) and my coworker (25M) work in healthcare. For the last few months we have been in the same team and, being more senior, I am supposed to be their first point of contact about clinical questions.
We have very different working styles. I am easy going and like to get things done quickly, they are very detail oriented so take longer in getting jobs done. 
Recently I have been told this coworker is saying I am bullying them because I am apparently not providing them with enough information to do their job, am affecting how they prioritize their work and haven't been available when they have concerns about our patients. 

As an example, when I ask them to speak to doctors for advice on our patients, they say I am not giving enough information when explaining the situation so they are unclear about what the question for the doctors is. In my defense, they often want information I don't have and the details I give are normally enough for me to ask the doctors directly. They say I should be the one to ask the doctors then if the information is unclear and I know the story the best. I don't do this as I have other jobs and it is normal for someone in their role to be calling doctors with these sorts of questions. I have never had this problem with other junior staff before which makes me think this colleague's expectations are unreasonable. 

Also, because they take longer to gather information to do their jobs, I have been checking in on their progress every couple of hours. They say being forced to formally sit down and report what's happening so often is affecting their ability to actually do jobs, especially when I come in and tell them what things are more and less important. On my end, I don't have the confidence they are managing their time so I feel I need to put my foot down. 
Our patient ratios have recently been really good, so there hasn't been any delays in completing the jobs. But I can't help feeling frustrated when I see how unnecessarily detailed the coworker is and how slow they are. 

For more context, this coworker has previously told me they felt I was rude in how I spoke to them and I communicated poorly (they are very long winded and I would often cut them off to get to the point quickly, they said my tone was belittling). Although their working style made me frustrated, I took their feedback and tried to change as I never wanted them to feel bullied. I'll be honest, I was actually shocked they felt this way as I'm normally the nice guy at work and have never had any suggestion of bullying before.
Things seemed to get better on this end as I was more careful in how I spoke to them so I was very surprised at the latest claims.

AITA or are my colleagues expectations on the level of detail that's normally expected at work excessive?

"AITA for having my friend photoshopped in my wedding pictures? A couple of months ago I got married to the love of my life.  We were surrounded by family and friends and got to have the most beautiful wedding.  Absolutely everything was perfect!  One thing that was important to me was to have our wedding party feel comfortable.  I chose to have my bridesmaids pick any style of dress they wanted, as long as it was the same color (navy, I wanted to pick an easy to find color) and didn't specify anything about hair, makeup, or accessories since I know everyone has different tastes and budget.  One of my friends loves to dye her hair different fun colors and for the wedding she had a really vibrant teal shade.  It looks great on her!  But once we got the photos back, I felt like it was clashing with the scenery in the group shots and asked our photographer to edit her hair to her natural color (brunette).  I only chose to do that on about 3-5 pictures- the ones I had wanted to frame in our home.  Well, my friend came over the other day to just hang out and have some drinks and she got very upset when she saw the group photo hanging in the entryway.  I told her that I wasn't going to ask her to change her look for our wedding- I didn't even think I'd mind at all- I just wanted more of a cohesive look for the framed photo.  She wasn't hearing any of it.  She got super pissed and said I couldn't accept her for who she is and was embarrassed of her.

"WIBTA if I told my mom she needed to eat more TW: Mentions of Disordered Eating
Hello, my mom (50f) and I (19f) went on a week-long vacation recently for our birthdays which are two days apart. My brother (16m) was the only other person who went on this trip with us. 
I have been having difficulty eating since I was about 15. I had a huge loss of appetite after something traumatic happened to me earlier that year. I opened up to my mother about how I was only eating at most one meal a day and how I was extremely fatigued and depressed a year and a half ago. She has been very supportive, she got me back into therapy, paid for a nutritionist, and makes meals for me occasionally. I was raised vegetarian and she encouraged me to become pescatarian to gain more nutrients and be less restrictive.
My mom has been a fitness coach in the past and has been on a strict high fat-low carb gluten free pescatarian diet for a very long time. I saw her growth growing up, she is much more fit and loves her body. I am extremely happy for her.
During this trip we had to drive 24 hours to our destination and back. This meant we had to stop for fast food for all of our meals those days, which is fine, I am all for saving time and money. However, multiple times over the trip she would not eat. Some of those times were because she was not in her ‚Äúfood time‚Äù. She has been doing intermittent fasting for many years, she starts eating at 12pm and stops at 8pm. 
Over the course of our trip she would make statements like ‚ÄúI usually only eat one meal a day‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not hungry, I ate [insert small snack] 3 hours ago‚Äù when I‚Äôd ask her why she wasn‚Äôt getting food with us. Both my mom and my brother encouraged me to keep eating for every meal while we were vacationing, especially when I was eating extremely slowly. 
Not only are the things she would say triggering to me, my brother has also started saying them when we go out to eat (specifically that he ate something recently so he isn‚Äôt hungry). My brother is very very dear to me and has had body image issues and it makes me very nervous when he says things that I have said and is hearing my mom say. 
I want to talk with her about it, but the times I have tried she has pointed out that she has been doing this for a long time and knows what she is doing. To me, it looks like she eats the same amount I used to. She knows what proper nutrition looks like, she is educated and went to all of my meetings with my nutritionist with me in support.

"AITA for being angry at my mother?  My \[24M\] friends \[25M and 26M\] recently found out that they will have nowhere to go because their landlord wants them out because their old lease allowed their cat, but the new one doesn't. My mother gave me my own end of the house separated by a ""door"" which is just a sheet, but I've made plans to put up a door in the past, which she canceled saying it would look bad.

I made plans to move out with my friends once they find a new place, but my mother got angry about it and cried saying I don't love her anymore and I hate her, as well as saying I would never make it on my own. I'm autistic, so I have a hard time interacting with people.  
Recently, my mother found a two-bedroom duplex for my friends that didn't allow pets. They politely declined because it didn't allow pets and it wasn't 3 bedrooms.  Ever since she keeps bringing it up to me and telling me to convince them to, ""Get rid of their shitty cat.""

I told her that they didn't want to get rid of their cat and they could just stay on my side of the house until we all three find a place to go, but she said they weren't allowed to stay at all and that she'd let them go homeless before allowing a cat in her home.  


At that, I got angry, mostly because it was my side of the house and she wouldn't even be seeing the cat. I said a few cuss words, she said a few, and then said if I ever cussed at her again she'd cut me off completely. She's threatened to do so several times.   


I feel like I might be the asshole for wanting to give my friends a place to stay and cussing at her, but I'm not that sure.",0.43
"WIBTAH to tell someone they were not supposed to get any life insurance and ask them to give it to the person intended? Cast: Parent (now gone) Children A, B and C

&#x200B;

Child A: Pretty much absent from the entire family for years. Did not participate in any gatherings, in caring for Parent, does not call, write, return calls/texts, was close enough to visit but didnt, not even a phone call on parent's death bed.

&#x200B;

Child B: Was the caregiver spending months away from work, mid week days off for doctors, was Parent's medical contact. Days on end sitting bedside. Many of B's weekends spent helping around Parents house... was always in around despite not living very close. You get the idea. Several years of this.

&#x200B;

Child C (me): lived too far to be around much but around for major holidays, calls/texts frequent. Was able to make it just in time to Parent's deathbed they knew I was there. I dont benefit here.

&#x200B;

No major money here, no written will, no estate other than family trinkets not in dispute. However, there is a modest life insurance policy of 15k. Policy was created with an even split 3 ways years before. Parent later decided Child A should nothing, instead B gets A's share and will help with travel expenses, ""Celebration of Life"" and other related final things. Also as repayment for all the time spent.

&#x200B;

Parent never updated the paperwork, still an even split. Again, no written will but parent was not shy about telling that A gets nothing. Even on a farewell video made bedside where parent discusses who gets what trinkets.

&#x200B;

WIBTA for telling Child A to give Child B the $$ to carry out Parent's wishes? B wont do it.

&#x200B;

FYI, life insurance payouts are tax free. A would not be out anything other than just not getting a share of a policy they likely didnt know anything about. This may or may not hurt A to know they were not supposed to get anything.

&#x200B;

EDIT: This isnt a legal question. Child A gets a check from life insurance and it's theirs. No question. 

The question is should they be made aware Parent wanted B to have A's share to pay parents final expenses and family travel expenses. This may or may not hurt A.",0.98

"AITA for refusing to attend any family events at my brother's place? So my brother is very well off due to hos job in the oil industry which made him now own a large house and have his wife be a homemaker. Because of thos they often host family events and holiday gettogether/bbqs. These usually include the extended family and close friends. 
Problems began when a number of his personal friends (all well off tradesmen with stay at home wives) began getting louder and more overt about some pretty rough topics. 
Misogyny (women cant do things because they are women)
Transphobia 
Homophobia
Anti-vaxx
And lately some white supremecy talking points from one spcific friend that my brother commonly nods in agreeance to. 
There are a lot of young girls in the family and the misogyny worrys me a lot as Id hate for my kid or others to realize how their fathers/uncles think of them. 
We also have a number of queer, trans, and poly members of the family; myself included. 
I have talked to him, my SIL, and my mother about these issues and they just wave me off. My mother goes as far to say ""hes not sexist. He just says those things"". So talking it out it kind of passed. 
Easter weekend they went off on their tangents and I opposed a lot of their stuff (being an expert in child development and developmental psychology) but was simply met with laughter and scoffs. We left early. 
Now I told my mother we are not going to attwnd any more events at his place as this stuff is too hurtful and I dont want it around my kid. She is devastated. And my family thinks I should just ""play nice"".

"AITA for ruining my brothers morning by not saying happy birthday as soon as he woke up Now I (M20) woke up in a not so great mood due to a neighbor using a mower at 7 in the morning, so yes i wasn't feeling the best a bit frustrated perhaps.
Since i woke up early i got the chance to go on the computer, its technically mine but my brother (m10) uses it since his broke and I'm fine with it since i play xbox most of the time anyway. 

Now here's the story of why i might be an asshole, my brother woke up and since its his birthday i was prepared to get off the computer as soon as i finished my mission. I also had a lovely happy birthday message all sorted and ready to go in my head, and the second he comes down the stairs after waking up the very first thing i hear from his mouth is ""get off the computer (name) now"".

To be honest it annoyed me that I didn't get a hello or good morning so i could respond and say happy birthday and explain that I'll be off in 5 minutes. Now despite the comment from him, I was gonna say happy birthday anyways, but before i could open my mouth he in an angrier tone demands me to get off the computer cause it's his birthday. Then he said it again and then again and then again, then my mum decided to weigh in on the conversation and say 'come on (name) do it for him'.

He continued repeating the demand and my mum started abusing me cause I'm not getting off the computer. This all happening in the very first 5 minutes of him waking up. Then she started saying I'm an asshole for not saying happy birthday and its all he wants and how i should be an adult and grow up, he's a child its all he wanted from me just to hear me say happy birthday. At this point im really really confused, all im hearing from my brother is him asking for the computer and my mum calling me an asshole for not saying happy birthday. 

I'm annoyed at this point and i get angry with my mum and try to explain to her that i was going too but the first thing out of his mouth to me was that he wanted the computer not that i say happy birthday. She kept hurling insults at me and i just ignored both of them. She finally just left me alone after calling me immature and childish, i finished my mission got off the computer, finally said happy birthday and went up to my room.

So am i the asshole in this situation it just doesn't feel like it to me but maybe i was. Should i apologize? I really don't know",0.1
"AITA for getting mad at my family for not making my sister do anything? I know this might sound bad, but hear me out. i, female 14 live with my mum and with my sister and brother. I have another sister which lives at my dads (divorced) she's turning 17 and she suffers from some mental conditions, but it didnt hit her that bad.

Growing up I always did a lot in the household, not too much tho but im used to it by now. Every now and then I go to my dads and i help in the household aswell but also hang out with my family.
My sister rarely ever comes over, so my mum is super happy when she does. But when she does, she never does anything. At my dads she does a bit household but always complains about doing too much and gets in fights with my stepmum and my dad. So my mum never let's her do anything, she sits in MY bed all day while I sleep on the floor next to my bed on a mattress and shes always on her phone. Obviously it's annoying. When she does come to the living room or outside it's for food and she mostly complains about it. Like sometimes she would complain about not having juice in our fridge or not always having ice cream, so spoiled i swear. She never had the feeling of not having enough money it's annoying. So sometimes id ask my brother and her to help my mum and i help with the groceries or dishes.
I did that today right after I came home after a long exhausting time of shopping etc with my mum and my mum didnt wanna ask them to do anything. They were sat down on the sofa watching stuff on the tv. I went to my brother and said ""can you help pack the groceries, we just came home and are exhausted"" i get a ""but we just sat down"" what the fuck? What are you sitting down for? ""what have you been doing, sitting down all day already."" ""no, we just sewed something"" (while sitting btw) obviously i get mad cause my sister is also getting involved ""and what the fuck have you been doing? All you do is sit in my bed and do nothing,just pack the groceries before mum does it"" ""we will pack it once she does"" i got even madder ""just do it now???"" ""no we will do it after"" (keep in mind, my other sister was at work and my brother is 18) ""okay fine, but if you dont im gonna get mad."" they did in fact pack them, but not all, my mum did the most.
And later on i got mad at my mum ""why dont you make her do anything? She's not a child"" and she hits me witb the classic ""she doesnt come over much honey i wanna make it fun for her"" ""fun? By making her even more lazy? She will think it's just a place for her to sit so her step mum doesnt annoy her anymore! She wont come for us or for you, but for the laziness she gains!"" we stopped after a while,

"AITA for guessing a movie plot correctly at the cinema I‚Äôve never made one of these posts before but this situation has baffled me and has got me second guessing myself. So I‚Äôm in need of some guidance. 

SPOILER ALERT: This contains spoilers for the movie Morbius. 

So, myself (20F) and my boyfriend (20M) went to the cinema to see Morbius two nights ago. Part of what I enjoy about watching things is guessing what‚Äôs going to happen as I honestly like being wrong when there‚Äôs a really good twist in a show/movie. My boyfriend knows this as we have watched countless movies/tv shows together. He has shown dislike for the fact that I am usually able to guess correctly, but this is only when the plot or the twist is fairly predictable. 

I suggested we go see Morbius as we had the night free and I saw it getting made fun of online and I wanted to see if Jared Leto‚Äôs acting was really that bad. So we go to the cinema and about 15 minutes in I said ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the odds the best friend forces Morbius to give him the cute and it turns him evil‚Äù. My boyfriend gets visibly annoyed at this point and tells me if that is what happens later in the movie he is going to fall out with me. He‚Äôs never reacted to this level before so I thought he was exaggerating as a joke. No. I was wrong. So I‚Äôm half right about the best friend being evil and so he keeps his word and falls out with me. I was meant to be staying at his place that night but instead we drove home in silence and he dropped me straight home. Since then, he has not text or contacted me at all. 

He has told me before I don‚Äôt seem to understand/read people‚Äôs emotions so I am not sure whether I‚Äôm just being insensitive to not know why he‚Äôs acting like this. I do the guessing thing with all my friends as we find it a really fun part of watching a movie, so I don‚Äôt understand why he is so angry at me. 

EDIT: To make it clear, he hasn‚Äôt told me to  it guess in front of him or said he dislikes it. By showing dislike in the past I meant that he doesn‚Äôt like when I‚Äôm CORRECT in a ‚Äúhow could you possibly know that?‚Äù way.

"AITA for not letting my girlfriend bring her seven year old sister to my sweet sixteen? I recently had my sixteenth birthday party, and my girlfriend who we will call Kay insisted on bringing her seven year old sister, who we‚Äôll call Katherine. 

Keep in mind the party was a small picnic with me and six friends. Me and my best friend who we will call Tom talked to her on facetime, and told her that we would all benefit from Katherine staying home. Kay became really upset, and told us ‚ÄúKatherine doesnt have a lot of friends, I just want her to socialize.‚Äù 

Then one of my other friends who we will call Connie offered to watch Katherine during the picnic, which drove me up the wall because I just wanted Connie to be able to relax and have fun! Im only angry because Kay always brings Katherine to hang outs, and argues with us if we dont want Katherine to go. 

Eventually, I decided to lie by telling her that it was actually going to be at a local restaurant, hoping she would agree to not bring Katherine, but she still said that she would. Eventually I told her that it was going to be a reserved table with only seven seats, and she literally would not be able to bring Katherine. 

When we were picking her up, me and Tom told her ‚Äúchange of plans, we‚Äôre still doing the picnic.‚Äù This is when she got pissed. She was so angry that I lied to her, and is still telling me that I‚Äôm ‚Äúawful at planning‚Äù and ‚Äúawful at communication‚Äù.

"AITA? Emaciated Pet Emergency Recovery. Tldr; the dog my ex and I both have equal rights to has lived with him for a year and has lost 40% of her body weight under his care. Should I continue efforts to rehabilitate and rehome her or AITA?

We paid 50/50 for our beloved husky about 5 years ago and after our separation shared custody. However, this caused her emotional distress resulting in aggression against other animals and eventually a family member. I wanted to put her through a specialized rehoming program that helps huskies with aggressive tendencies, but he was opposed and kept her since January of 2021. 

A few months ago I noticed she was smaller than she used to be when dropping off our daughter and recommended a diet plan to get her back to healthy weight. This weekend I came by for a drop off and could see several of her ribs, spine, and noticed her hips were also beginning to protrude. I told him I would take her to the vet to eliminate any medical reasons she may be so thin and he agreed. 

The vet was distraught by her appearance as she knew the dog when I would bring her for annual check ups. They did several tests to find a cause, but found no infection or signs of disease. They determined that she was being nutritionally neglected and warned me not to allow her back in his care or she could very well die from a slow starvation. He had not taken her to the vet in any of the time they were together and skipped the spay appointment I had set. His plan for her weight loss was to give her medication for worms and exercise her more. Knowing this, I have followed through with the doctor‚Äôs recommendation to rehabilitate and rehome her myself. 

So now he is very mad despite me warning that this would be a possibility when he agreed to let me get her checked out. I am being called names, being told I am destroying his family, that he loves her so much and would die without her. I stood firm and reminded him that I paid equally for her, arranged and attended every vet visit, am the person assigned to her microchip ID, maintained a healthy diet when she lived with me, and that animal abuse is a criminal offense. Still I am being told how awful I am. AITA?",0.1
"AITA for telling my parents that sister is overreacting over a birthday post? I had my birthday today. My sister had her birthday 3 days ago, and came home to celebrate it with us. My parents have the whole thing of posting cringeworthy photos of us on our Facebook timelines and saying happy birthday every year. This year, my father asked my sister if she still wanted a post, since we were having a party for her that day on her actual birthday.. the day before Easter. She said no. I even went out of the way as to wait to open relatives gifts until my actual birthday to make it special for her.
(Context: my sister and I have different dads)

Today, I asked my father to make a birthday post only because I wanted to do a fundraiser, as my dad has more connections with people willing to donate to charities. 
An hour later, I get a text from my sister calling my dad a douchebag for not making a birthday post for her, and that me and my brother got one this year. I fake agreed with her and ignored half of it until I got home, then brought it up with my parents.

"AITA for wanting my husband to treat my son (his stepson) better When I met my husband I already had a child from a previous relationship and he had none. At the beginning he never really saw him much because my son stayed with my mother. Things were not going well in our relationship and just when we were about to break up I found out I was pregnant. FF a few years later we ended up getting married to ensure I would be able to renew my visa and he did not want to be separated from his child. Our relationship was strained at best but we were trying to make it work. My mother started travelling more for business and church and the sitter she got an older teenage boy started using the money left to take care of my son for his own needs like buying alcohol instead of buying food and so I insisted that my son come stay with us. My partner was not happy when I asked him for my son to come stay with us after a particular incident which had my son hospitalised for dehydration because his sitter did not give him food. I raised hell and my son came to stay with us.
Now he has been with us for 4years now and my partner treats him really badly. Mind you he pays for his schooling and ensures his basic needs are met. He refuses to attend any school stuff for my son and only does so for ‚Äúhis kids‚Äù. He emotionally talks down to him and calls him fat (my son plays football and so has gained weight to keep up with requirements) any chance he gets to shout at him he does to a point were the younger kids know if they don‚Äôt want to get in trouble they put the blame on their brother even if it‚Äôs a lie.

"AITA for not intervening when my younger brother was getting the consequences of his actions? I'm a 19-year-old woman and my brother is 16 (Craig). Craig goes to high school, and on most days I pick him up after.

Craig has never been that good with communication. He has short bouts of anger as well, which concern me a lot. I'm afraid that he is growing up into a pretty bad dude and despite raising this issue to our parents many times, they are generally on his side. 

Last week on Thursday after school, I went to the normal spot to pick Craig up. I noticed a bunch of girls gathered in a mass. For the next few minutes I heard shouting but I didn't know what was going on. Eventually I got out of the car to find Craig at the center. I called over and asked what they were doing, ready to break it up, and the girl closest to him told me that he had called her a pretty awful slur to call a young woman. I thought about my options for a second and knowing his problems at home, gave her a thumbs up to keep going. I went back to my car for a smoke and made sure it didn't escalate past words.

Not a long time later Craig came back and sat down in the car on the verge of tears, immediately facing the other direction. I tried to talk to him about it, but when I started he basically jumped out of the still-moving car and ran across someone's yard where I couldn't follow him. Not knowing what to do, I left. I got home and when our mother asked where he was, so I told her what had happened. She immediately began shrieking at me. She called in to work and left to begin looking for him while I stayed home.

Craig came back at about 10pm crying his eyes out. I called our mother to tell her, and she came home immediately after to comfort him. 

The next day, our mother and father called me and told me that they wanted me to move out. I told them they weren't hearing the full story about how he called the girl a terrible slur, and they said they didn't care, and that I was a monster for not sticking up for my brother. They've been adamant for the past week that I should leave and Craig hasn't been to school since.

"AITA for agreeing to go to prom with somebody if they support me in an election? I‚Äôm a junior in high school. One of the extracurriculars I‚Äôm involved in at school is student council. I‚Äôd like to be student body president next year, since I think being student body president of a school with almost 3k students would look nice on my college applications. On its own it wouldn‚Äôt be big enough to make or break an application, but in addition to other stuff I have going on it certainty wouldn‚Äôt hurt. 

The senior that‚Äôs currently student body president happens to have had a crush on me since I was a sophomore and she was a junior last year. 

Prom was this last weekend and student body president elections were held the day before it. I decided to run. I had one opponent that I felt was even enough with me that it could go either way. I hated that guy, because he was a two-faced bully that was nice to me and other people that he felt were useful but then treated people he deemed as not having a use like shit. Since he mostly was a dick to people that didn‚Äôt have many friends, he still was pulling a lot of votes. I hate people that are dicks for no reason so I decided I had to win both for ambition reasons (being president would look good) and also because I hate people like him. 

I heard from mutual friends that the current study body president that had a crush on me was planning to ask me to prom, and I had an idea: I texted her I heard she was going to ask me and said if I was going to spend $200ish on tickets, a suit, etc when I wasn‚Äôt planning to go anyways, I‚Äôd want something in return, that being her support for my presidential bid. The president being ‚Äòbiased‚Äô was frowned upon but as president and somebody that‚Äôs well liked, her support could push me over the edge. She agreed, and her support did in fact cause me to win. My opponent figured out that I had bribed the student body president in some way and had called me out for that, but nobody seemed to care because I won anyways.

Both of us are in the same friend group and we have a birthday group chat where everyone else send gift ideas for whoever‚Äôs birthday (while the person in question is not in the chat as to not spoil any surprises). Our other friend, B (19F) is in our friend group as well and in the birthday chat. B sent a picture of a shirt she wanted to buy from the official website of A‚Äôs favorite artist.

B also said that she ‚Äúeven found the website‚Äù as if it was something that took a lot of work to find (it‚Äôs the official merchandise website, i found it in 2 seconds flat) One of our other friends mentioned that B could just buy A some artist themed jewelry because it is the official website. B then said she didn‚Äôt actually mind about the artist theme but that the shirts looked ‚Äúbasically the same‚Äù (they‚Äôre both grey). She then just decided she‚Äôll get something else even though our other friends were telling that A would be more than happy to have two different pieces of merch from the same artist. B didn‚Äôt feel like heeding our advice and was pretty bent on ‚Äúfiguring something else out‚Äù.

"AITA for asking my friend to pay me back? 
This just happened a few minutes ago and I'm really shaken up and I don't know if I did the right thing me and my friend have known each other for awhile almost a year and over that time I've bought him things and spend money on him. He always says he'll pay me back so I just wait. I know he isn't very financially stable since we are both in highschool but I makes around 20 dollars a week from his parents. My birthday way awhile ago and me him and my girlfriend went to the mall. He only had 20 dollars and I had 200 (my birthday present from my mom) and he asked for things telling me like always that he'd pay me back. I have a debit card and I can see the money being spent on different things. During me buying him stuff he'd lie about prices of certain things to be more cheap. Once he had left I check my card app and I only have 86 dollars! I was floored because I thought he only spent 30 at best. It's important to note that he has never once payed me back for anything that I've bought him. The next day I texted him asking for the money that he owed. No response. I checked all of the things he'd bought over the time I've known him and talked with a mutual friend about the amount of money spent which was over 200 of the time I've known him. He started ignoring me at school and didn't respond to any of my texts. So I texted him this 

""I realized that it sounds like I have a problem with the money I've spent on you and I'm not going to talk with you till you give me the money back but I'm not really asking for that I don't care about the money I have money but the problem here is that I feel like your taking advantage of my money and the things I give/do for you. I don't mean to sound selfish but I've spent and done a lot for you and I feel like I'm not being recognized for that.""

I knew he didn't have the money so I didn't want him to pay me back if he couldn't I just wanted him to address and apologize on what he did to me. He exploded on me. Told me that he didn't have the money and that I was being compulsive and rude to him. After he said that he told me ""we're not friends anymore"" I felt completely used and I was absolutely pissed. Now what I did next makes me feel like I messed up and that I'm an asshole but I sent him the amount he needed to pay me back and told him that I wanted my money back. He said ok and stopped talking. All of my friends are upset saying he doesn't have the money but I feel like he was just using me and the money wasn't the issue it was how he was treating me like I was his a.t.m. I'm really conflicted and I feel like the asshole.

"AITA For Telling My Birth Mother She Had Her Chance At Parenting Me and My Siblings? So for context, I was put up for adoption along with my two siblings when I was four. My little brother got adopted pretty much immediately because he was so young, but me and my sister were in foster care for two years. It was a cps situation, drugs were involved, and my birth mother was given several chances to take care of us before the judge ruled she was unfit. She chose that lifestyle over Us, and me and my sister were adopted by a really nice family. When I turned 18 I reached out to my birth mother and found out she turned her life around, she has a well paying job, three new kids and a husband. She was ecstatic that I reacher out to her, and seemed like she really had changed. I was the only one to contact her as my younger sister has no interest in her, and my younger brother‚Äôs family is the same way. He‚Äôs too young to reach out himself, as in legally he can‚Äôt. I‚Äôve told my birth mother multiple times that It‚Äôs up to him to reach out when he‚Äôs old enough, and I can‚Äôt say anything about him out of respect for his family‚Äôs wishes.

So last weekend, I visited my biological grandmother and aunt for the first time, and we were talking about my siblings. I Gave the usual speech about a loving home, and I mentioned how he‚Äôd gotten himself into a bit of trouble, regular teenage boy stuff. I also made the mistake of mentioning him by his new name rather then the name my birth mother gave him. My grandmother told my mother what his new name was and she found him on Facebook through me. She messaged him saying she‚Äôd like to hear from him, and he texted me about it, understandably shaken up. I immediately messaged her appalled that she would go behind my back like that knowing she‚Äôs not supposed to be talking to him. She shot off about how concerned she was about him getting into to trouble and how she was just trying to see if he was okay, I told her that that‚Äôs not her place and his parents would handle it. I also told her that she made her decision when we got put up for adoption. She got upset saying it happened so long ago and I shouldn‚Äôt be holding it over her head, and how dare I treat her this way. I simply said ‚Äúhe‚Äôs not your child anymore, and if I have to choose between you or him I‚Äôm choosing him‚Äù. 

She‚Äôs now ignoring me, and my aunt and grandmother are saying I‚Äôm a bitch for saying all that to her, and I‚Äôm just wondering if I as too harsh?

Edit: My grandmother did try to take us as kids but my birth father (who is a complete tool) didn‚Äôt want her to get custody, or so I‚Äôve been told

Second edit: oftentimes when kids are adopted parents will change their first names which is what happened here and I accidentally called him by the first name I know him as rather then the old name they were calling him

Third Edit: what I said about my brother was along the lines of ‚Äúyea he‚Äôs doing okay, he got in a bit of trouble but he‚Äôs fine now‚Äù for those of you saying I was gossiping about my brother I never gave away anything more then generic information",0.35
"AITA for telling my kids friends to get the FUCK out of my house? 14yo daughter had a couple 14-15yo friends over tonight  (1 boy 1 girl). I can't say that I really like them, I don't think they are the best influences. The boy smokes nic, pot, whatever he can, and his parents seem helpless to stop him. I don't like my kid hanging out with him, but telling my daughter that will have the opposite effect.  Everyone knows the house rules, no vaping, drugs, drinking etc. They go to the basement and I look on the nanny cam and see a puff of a vape (nic), passes it to my kid, who puffs, hands it back to him. I've had issues with my daughter vaping due to this group of friends. At this point she's taking it again and I call shout down the stairs to her ""No vaping in the house, get up here NOW"". 

She decides to play dumb, ""I don't know what you're talking about dad"", once she saw the video feed on my computer she stopped with that BS and had the ""oh crap I just got caught look"" on her face. Her male friend and his girlfriend then start coming up the stairs and he's just lying his ass off saying ""We weren't doing anything at all down there I don't know what you're talking about""... I informed him that I have a BLEEPING camera down there,  asked him who he thinks he is bringing that poison around my child, and then shouted at him to get the FUCK out of my house.

"AITA FOR RESENTING MY BEST FRIEND? So a little background, L has been my best friend for about 2 years. We went to school dances together, the mall, through family issues, ect. And I dont resent her for any of that. 
The issue started at the beginning of this school year. We had made plans to go to homecoming together a few months in advance. In my mind everything was set in stone but to her it didn't matter all that much. So around a week before I check in and see if our plans were still good because she had been dropping out of plans left and right. L told me that she wasn't sure yet because her boyfriend, who im going to call C, was thinking of taking her out to dinner. So I asked her to keep me updated. Needless to say all of our plans fell through an hour before the dance and I cried all of my make up off before telling her I didn't want to do a conjoined birthday party anymore since she wasn't consistent. Our birthdays are 2 days apart.
So after that she grew distant from me and refused to talk to me until I said something to her one day after she had blocked me on snap chat. We met in the counselors office and she explained to me that I needed to better myself and that I need to make it up to her. I was confused then and im still nconfused 3 months later.
She ended up getting a new friend and this is a girl she new I hated. She will be called M. M had a history of destroying relationships and back stabbing most of her friends. I knew M's history and tried to explain it to L who completely ignored me. I sit next to L in one class but I sit in that same exact spot for 3 periods every day. M sat in that spot and I stood behind her for 10 minutes staring at the back of her head with L staring at me. M tried to argue with me and I ended up going to a different seat. It turned out that M and L were going around the whole school calling me childish and that L had told M to sit there on purpose.
I blocked L on snapchat this time and posted a video titled 'Dear L'. She found it and then went around to anyone who would listen and explained how much I had hurt her. Between this time and our previous talk I had decided to act more serious about my school work and had even stopped eating most days because I didn't want to embarrass L by being the ""fat friend"" as C (her bf) had called me. 

Today I caved and apologized to her. Regardless of how much it hurt, I still love her like a sister even though I cant stand her anymore. AITA?",0.45

"WIBTA If I called the RSPCA to take my friend‚Äôs cats. I (F16) have an old friend (f16) called S who has had many pets. Her household is very small considering how many people live there,she has many siblings. And I know that her mother struggles to provide for all of them because their father is in prison. There are 7 people in the 3 bedroom house and one of her sisters are pregnant. Due to the overcrowded house it is difficult to keep it clean, but I know that they try their best to.  They used to have a dog however it died because of how the oldest brother treated it. He has since moved out of the house now. S had a pet parrot who lived for a very long time I think 11 years but he recently passed away, so I know she is capable of looking after her pets. The last time I visited them they had 2 cats one of the cats they found as a kitten in their shed. I thought it was so good of the family to take in the cat and nurse her back to health however I noticed that they don‚Äôt feed her cat food. They feed her bits of chicken from the curries they eat and the cats favourite food is crisps. I saw this as a red flag but I disregarded it because I saw how loving and caring they were towards their pets in all the other aspects and I know that cat food is expensive.  I drifted apart from S so I haven‚Äôt seen how her cat looks now but before they used to have another cat who ran away and I saw that one recently on the street and strangely enough it looked healthier than it did when living with S. this has made me worry for the other two cats who are living in their house, they look so skinny and their fur doesn‚Äôt look healthy.   I‚Äôm so torn because I know S loves her cats but I also know she isn‚Äôt feeding them right. I‚Äôve already told her she should but she doesn‚Äôt listen to me. I would feel so guilty if I told the RSPCA and they took her cats but then I would also feel guilty knowing that they are not being fed right.",0.18
"AITA for telling my cousin he should stop fighting with his ex-wife for the sake of his son? My cousin (Perry) is divorced and the divorce wasn't pretty. To say Perry and his ex-wife (Robin) do not get along would be an understatement. They are still involved in each other's lives because they have a son together (Martin). Even for the sake of Martin, they do not get along. During their divorce Robin was pregnant and they couldn't agree on a single thing. The judge had to decide how they would split their parental leave not to mention things like custody or which pediatrician they use.

Perry told me the judge in the divorce case admonished them several times for their lack of compromise. Either my aunt and uncle or Robin's parents do the exchange pickup or drop off for Martin because Perry and Robin don't even want to see one another. They only communicate through lawyers 5 years on. Recently Perry was upset because Robin wanted to put Martin in dance classes because Martin wanted to do dance instead of a sport. Perry disagreed and they had to involve their lawyers and the court again and he lost so Martin is in dance. I will point out that Perry looks like a jerk here and I agree but Robin does the same stuff. Martin is the age school starts in our province this September (5) and the two of them are already arguing about which school and pickup and drop-off schedule.

I told Perry he needs to stop it and try to get along with Martin's mom for his sake. Perry blew up at me because ""no one asked me"" and I have never been married or had a child. I felt I had no choice but to say something but Perry vehemently believes I overstepped.",0.03
"AITA for wanting to be strict with my roommate? Please bear with me through this - I've never posted before and I need advice!

I (20f) share a double room with my roommate (19f). We're in the same year, but I'm a transfer student, so it's my first year at this school. We live in an urban on-campus dorm, and it's part of a brownstone. I got lucky because I did housing so last-minute and I chose to go random with who I lived with. She's an international student from Vietnam and is super nice and quiet! We got along pretty well last semester, but I was also struggling a lot with depression during that time, so I suppose I wasn't that attentive with what she was doing. 

Anyway, it started out slow, like she would be out late and come back around 3/4/5am on school nights. I was always asleep by then, but she would constantly wake me up. Honestly, it never seems like she really tries to be quiet bc she's always slamming drawers, doors, etc. Sometimes, she apologized the next morning, but most of the time she didn't. Also, she constantly falls asleep with all her lights on (lamp, laptop, phone, string lights, AND neon light). I have to tiptoe over there most nights to turn them off. 

The major thing that happened was when I came back from winter break. I was a day late bc my flight was cancelled, and I made sure she knew exactly when I was coming back to the room so there wouldn't be any surprises. Anyway, I lug my bags up 4 flights of stairs and rustle my key out to open the door. And who do I see? Her friend who's CONSTANTLY over here. I'm not surprised, as it's 2pm on a Monday, but she whispers hello to me. Whispers. Because what do I see when I turn to look at my bed? A girl. Someone is dead asleep in my bed. 

Her shit was everywhere. All over my desk, her shoes were ON my shoes, my wall decorations had fallen down, she was using my pillow and CUDDLING MY STUFFED ANIMAL (pls don't judge but if u have a stuffed animal, you get it). Now, that really did it for me because I had never NOT ONCE given her permission to let her friends touch or use my stuff. I was so mad that I dropped my stuff off and went to run errands for a couple hours to blow off some steam. 

I came back to my unmade dirty bed that smelled like someone else and even had her hair in it. My roommate didn't bother to change/wash my sheets or apologize or anything. I know it really shouldn't be that big of a deal, but it felt like a huge invasion of privacy. 

She hasn't done anything like that throughout this semester, but it's back to the little irritating stuff again. Sometimes, she'll get back at 4am and talk on speakerphone on her side of the room (as if I can't hear her)?? I want to put down some boundaries but feel like it's too late to say anything bc we only have 3 weeks left in the semester.

"AITA for getting mad at my husband for not diversifying our stock portfolio? So we have a stock account that indiscriminate amount of money in it. Almost all of the money in this account came from my inheritance. Our rule was, after we got married, that we would split our picks in half. He would get to play with half the money and I would pick the other half. 

He basically hobbies watching videos on investing and he's a bit obsessed. He'll talk with his brother and his friends for hours every night about markets and investments. I also recently found him sneaking money out of our spending account into crypto, even though our budget is very strict. 

I knew that my husband had pulled several stocks in december. I knew that he was pulling some of my stocks, but I assumed that he was going to wait for a market swing and then reinvest into my stock picks.  Found out today that he and has invested our entire portfolio in tech. He invested about a third of it in crypto, and the other 2/3 in tech companies. So basically right now, our entire investment portfolio is split between our house and tech. My investments always included retail, finance, food, and entertainment to balance out his tech heavy picks. I was upset with him because he really should know better, we're trying to have a baby, and it puts us in a very dangerous position. 

Here's where I think I might be the AH.  I didn't notice until today. It's pretty obvious that he's spending a lot more time focusing on this stuff than I am. This money has been invested for 3 months. 

I chewed his head off today. I wanted him to pull his stocks and switch but he insisted that he wouldn't invest in any tech until half our stock portfolio was not tech. 

So reddit AITA?

Edit: while it is my inheritance in stocks, I should also mention that his income is worth double what my job and my annual inheritance amount to. He pays most of our living base cost.",0.01
"AITA saying that my wife was acting crazy for money? My (40M) wife(42F) grew up extremely poor, she has a money trauma because ever since she was little  she had to help her parents to provide for their family. It has affected her deeply, always looking too much in our finances all the time (we make good money and have a good household), always tracking every penny, unwilling to go on vacation until our son leaves for college, no ''fun money'', always on a budget even when we don't need to. 

We have a 16 yo son, my wife has never wanted him to work until he graduates college, we have made sure that he has everything he needs, but you know how teens are, they want to be independent and self sufficient, he wanted to get a job and I saw nothing bad with that. He has been working at a cafeteria for 6 months now.

My wife, however, has gone crazy, I think that our minor son working has triggered her and she's trying to act cool but I know that she's not. My wife told that he had to divide his paycheck in 3, 2 parts will be for him and 1 for the household, I didn't like it because there was no need, we don't need his money, but my wife didn't give in, so my son agreed. 

I guess my wife expected him to back out, but he hasn't, I've been noticing that she snatches the money from his hand and I find that very distasteful and rude, my sons seems a little sad every time she does it, so yesterday, when she tried it again, he kinda moved his hand before and let het grab air. Oh my god, she acted like he raised his hand at her, she went full-mad, berating him and telling him that he need to quit, that he doesn't need to work, he only sighed and went his room, my wife wanted to follow him but I didn't let her, we fought until I said she was acting crazy for money and she went silent.

"AITA for not wanting to take pictures with family and ruining the mood? i'm not really confident and more on the quiet side, and my sister is the opposite. We are just in general really different (but only 2 years apart)
The problem is that my mom and her really want to take pictures, especially when we are with family and for example go to a restaurant.
I am just really uncomfortable with it and feel like i'm ruining the mood for them when i tell them i don't want to be in a picture with my sister and her boyfriend or with my mom, because i simply don't like myself in pictures and just don't feel the need.
I'm pretty sure they know i'm uncomfortable and don't seem to care but just push me to finally give in.
My mom is a person that can get really sulky, so when i refuse she just repeats ""please!"" over and over again in her baby voice.
Note how she puts the pictures in which i was forced to be in as her profile picture on whatsapp without consent.
I know that her intentions are good. She just wants me to also be present and have pictures with me. But i really don't know what to do. I mean, i still feel uncomfortable. 

My sister is a little more harsh with her words (i have many... well, bad? experiences with her, we are not really that close. We had arguments in which she acts like the victim sometimes and doesn't listen to me but i don't know if this is relevant right now// i don't even know if i'm just exaggerating and too sensitive, i hear that a lot, or just simply wrong)
For example, everytime we happen to talk about me not wanting to be in pictures she's like: ""do it for mom, you're not respecting her wishes, etc."" In her passive aggressive tone and that judging facial expression that i feel very small talking against.
She recently said: ""no one will know you in 50 years"" and it hurt me, especially since i have problems with feeling invisible, irrelevant. I was like ""are you serious right now?"" and then she did her typical 'sigh and disregard' thing.
She avoids my confrontation and doesn't seem to take them seriously. I feel like she's talking to me like i'm a child, as if i wouldn't understand her anyway. 
She also says stuff like ""look, it looks much better when you just show your face instead of always looking away.""
I know that this may sound comforting, but she just has that weird and judging tone that ruins her words for me, as if she was trying to give attention to my insecurities in front of our family, which we are not that close to.
I know for a fact that my mom was the same as me when she was younger, so i can't quite understand why she does that when she should know how uncomfortable it is.
I understand that she probably doesn't want me to feel sad about not having any pictures from my teens. I can also understand that she wants me to feel included, and i want that as well, but not in the form of a selfie. 
However, i don't know if i would even want to remember when looking at the pictures, because i just connect the awkward and uncomfortable feeling with it.",0.26
"AITA for basically doing the opposite of everything my brother tells me? Hi, I know the title seems pretty stupid but the situation is very simple. Let me explain  
So I (20 nonbinary) have an older brother (26 male) who tends to be very pessimistic and discouraging and plays it off as ""realistic"". He's been extra discouraging and dragging me down a lot recently. Saying things about my weight, my interests, me spending money on things like clothes, food, and plushies. He also used to be like this when I was a kid/teen, degrading my art skills and giving unwanted ""criticism"" until I just gave it up. Something he probably wanted me to do out of spite, but thats a different story.  
Anyways back to the main point. I decided to try and stop listening to his stupid opinions and discouragement on pretty much everything I do. It's hard, but I decided to use it to my advantage. Now when I ask for his opinion, if he actively discourages it then I know its a good idea simply because he disproves of it. Like buying a hoodie, getting snacks, and more. I did this last night.  
I'm unhappy with how my current college career is going despite it being just the start, so I decided to look into some more careers I could get into. The most average one that I really like being park ranger that has a wide range of majors I could choose to become one. I thought It was a great idea, but I needed confirmation so I went downstairs and asked my brother about what he thought of me being a park ranger. Nothing else. Just working and living in a state or national park. He went off about how it was a bad idea, how I'm so out of shape and chubby, and how I'm not an outdoorsy person who's not fit for it. I knew it. This was the perfect backup incase my current major and career plan didn't work out. The only thing he was even right about was that I need to work out, which I already used to do before.   
Anyways, after that I talked to my parents. We had a discussion that I won't get into, but in the end I mentioned that the only reason I even considered being a park ranger in my list of careers was because my brother disproved it. And if he things something is a bad idea, I already know it's a great idea. They understood but I could tell they seemed upset and didn't like that I valued my brothers opinions so lowly now. But I have no choice. After how he's reacted to everything I do I might as well just start doing the opposite of what he thinks.

"AITA for brushing my hair in spite of my grandma? Sorry if the title might be confusing. Anywho, context: I (18f) have kind of curly hair? It's like half way I guess. The bottom curls a lot but near my scalp it doesn't curl nearly as much. Because of my curls, if I brush my hair it turns into a giant poofy lions mane basically. It's all frizzy and static-y and just looks bad. However, I didn't really discover this until I was about 14. My hair was wild growing up. 

Well, growing up my grandma always made a fuss over my hair. No matter what you did, it'd be frizzy when dry. So every time I was at her house she'd have me brush my hair because she never believed that I had already brushed it. I hope you can see where this is going. 

(Some additional context: I haven't seen my grandma in a few years due to going to a ""boarding"" school in a different country. I stayed there for about two years, but on breaks I'd only see my parents and friends, not my grandparents. When I returned home for good my grandparents moved away and I didn't get the chance to see them due to covid.) 

Well, I finally got the chance to see my grandparents again, and we went to their house for the weekend. With the way my hair is now, it's a bit frizzy as it's drying, but when it's completely dry the frizz becomes a lot less noticeable due to the curls. I also finger brush to minimize the frizz. My grandma saw me while my hair was drying and told me to ""go brush my damn hair"" and that ""by this age I should already know how to brush my hair"". 

I told her that brushing my hair so much is what made my hair so frizzy, so I refused. She told me that was bullshit, and that I'd better brush it before our special brunch. 

I just ignored her for the most part, and when into the guest room to do homework. That was until our ""special brunch"", when I came out of the room to leave. My grandma saw me and my curls and said ""look at how much better your hair looks when it's brushed. I told you so!"" 

I was literally dumbfounded. Did she seriously think my hair was brushed? Lmfao. I told her it wasn't brushed and she didn't believe me, so I went and got a brush, walked up to her, and brushed my hair. Wouldn't you know it, it was a fucking disaster. The look on her face was priceless lmao. 

She got all angry at me saying that I just ruined her family photos (guess that's why the brunch was so special) and that I needed to fix my hair. I told her there was nothing I could do now, and she was the one who told me to brush my hair anyway. My mom said I was an asshole for this but my dad said that it was hilarious (away from my mom of course).

Though, I do kinda see why I'm an asshole, because she paid for a professional photographer(which i didnt know until she told me after the fact lol), and she already told me my hair looked good and I ruined it on purpose to spite her. So, yeah, aita?

Edit: wow this blew up. Thank you all! I just woke up by the way, lol. But while my grandma is stubborn and stuck in her ways I still love her, she's usually good to be around, its just me needing to ""look presentable"". Also, my mom and grandma both have straight hair, for those wondering. Thank you for all of the support and tips though!!",0.35

"AITA for making my boyfriend move his setup into a different room? My boyfriend (20M) & I (20F) have been together for four years & have recently moved into a friends house to split rent. I‚Äôve recently started having problems concerning my health & have been unemployed since August of last year so I turned to gaming & streaming as a coping mechanism & (hopefully) a career. My desk is L shaped & the right half from where I sit is hardly ever used so I let him use that space to put his monitor & ps4 & we usually game together. He, however, has anger impulse. Hitting the desk with his controller, screaming & flipping chairs are just some of the examples of what happens when he games. I like to think I‚Äôm my boyfriends biggest supporter, I‚Äôm always there when he‚Äôs angry & do my best to calm him down. But streaming became impossible with his screaming & raging. Almost every day I was streaming, he was screaming at his game right next to me & it would pick up on my mic, disrupting my stream & distracting me from talking to friends & chat. I would usually mute my mic & ask politely if he could quiet down & he‚Äôd always agree, as he never intentionally tries to disrupt my stream. But recently, he had been disrespectful when I‚Äôd ask him to quiet down. ‚ÄúBaby I can‚Äôt control it‚Äù, ‚Äúplease stop‚Äù, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not being rude just f***ing stop‚Äù, etc. I didn‚Äôt exactly make him move either, I think he just got annoyed that I kept asking him to quiet down & moved into the other bedroom a few days ago. Today, I finish my stream & go in there to lay on the bed with our roommates dog while he‚Äôs at work & my boyfriend is playing the game with his friends. He‚Äôs loud when he gets excited as well, which never bothers me unless I‚Äôm relaxing, which is what I was trying to do, as it was 12:00 am & I wanted to start winding down. I asked him nicely a few times to just lower his voice because I couldn‚Äôt hear my phone & to no surprise, he agreed. But the fourth or fifth time I had asked, he yelled something along the lines of ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt you just go relax on the couch? You drove me out of our room so you could stream, where am I supposed to go so you‚Äôre happy?‚Äù I never intended to make him feel like I was driving him out. Am I the asshole for asking him to be quieter while he games?",0.22
AITA for not rushing my move because my roommates gf is uncomfortable? [deleted],0.02
"AITA for telling my mom I don't want to go to Hawaii for my birthday? I'm pretty spoiled I'll be honest. Especially in my siblings perspectives since my mom wasn't financially stable when we were young and now she is but I'm the only one still living with her since I'm also the youngest.

I'm turning 18 in July and my mom just surprised me with some news that she wants to take me to Hawaii for my birthday since it's the big 18. Usually people would be excited to hear they're going to Hawaii, I mean it's Hawaii. Plus I've never been before so it does sound like a fun trip to a normal person. But I don't want to go to Hawaii, traveling during my birthday sounds so exhausting and honestly I don't think I would enjoy it even if it wasn't on my birthday. 

I'm a home body and enjoy my time at home or with friends, I've never been the type of person who wants to see the world (that's more of my sister). Even with roadtrips I didn't like it and getting to the state we were traveling to never seemed any interesting unless we were meeting with friends of my moms.

I told my mom I didn't want to go to Hawaii for my birthday and she said that that's fine we can just change the dates and then I clarified that I didn't want to go at all.

my mom got sad and upset because she saw this as a family trip since my brother would be coming as well and she's always wanted to do a family vacation. I told her I would be down for a family vacation I just didn't want to travel for my birthday and them she got happy again saying that she'll just have us go to Hawaii the week after... then I clarified again that I wouldn't be going to Hawaii with them 

(another reason i dont want to go to Hawaii right now is that I always see native Hawaiians telling people not to come for vacation bc its hurting them so.. no matter what I won't be going but I know if I tell my mom this she'd be upset with me) (also im pretty insecure about my body since I'm FTMüè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è and people go to Hawaii for the beaches and being forced to wear a bathing suit will cause all types of dysphoria that I don't need more of)

after telling my mom this she got upset with me again and was honestly kinda guilty trippy with her words saying how she just wanted a family trip and she won't even try anymore and so much for wanting to spend time with my family, things like that.

I kinda feel bad, am I the asshole?",0.06

"AITA for getting upset with my mother for leaving the door open? I‚Äôm 23f living with my boyfriend (23) and roommate (23). we live in a townhouse that was redone specifically so the three of us could move in. two of the bedrooms (roomie‚Äôs and game room) didn‚Äôt have ceiling fans when we moved in so my mom offered to have a family friend put them in for us. we didn‚Äôt really need or want ceiling fans put in since we were already completely moved in by now (have been for four months) and didn‚Äôt see a need as we have fans and lights already. 

my mother insisted and came over today with the family friend and my father to put them in. they had came at 7 in the morning without letting me or roomie know they were on their way (boyf was at work early) but that‚Äôs not what i‚Äôm actually upset about. as the title states, all day from 7 am until 4:30 pm they were here putting in ceiling fans and my mom was pretty much on our garage rearranging stuff just to console her boredom. which again, is not the thing i‚Äôm upset with, it‚Äôs just weird she‚Äôd rearrange without telling anyone what she was doing.

all the time they were here, they would open the front and garage door without closing it and as a result there‚Äôs now bugs in my house. we live in NV and it‚Äôs end of april so bugs are having a time rn. i told my mom that i was upset that they propped the door open as i now have bugs and she just simply said ‚Äúwe worked our asses off today, don‚Äôt be a bitch.‚Äù when she left i texted her to say i‚Äôm not mad at her just upset because i work hard to have a clean house to which she responds with ‚Äúwell it‚Äôs never clean when i‚Äôm over so you obviously don‚Äôt work hard enough.‚Äù and she proceeded to call me ungrateful etc.

aita?

edit: also to make matters worse since i do live with my boyfriend we have stuff that my parents should never see and my mother snooped and saw the stuff. she didn‚Äôt say anything but the box was open and she gave me weird looks the whole time she was here. :(",0.05

"WIBTA for getting a Cease and Desist letter against my friend? I (17M) have a friend who we will call Mike (17M). We have been friends for a few years now, met freshman year in English class, and have been friends ever since. We sit together during lunch at school, with some other friends of his.   


He has had this necessity to get laughs out of making fun of me, which is fine, as we are highschoolers and I am well aware that friends poke fun at eachother, and I am not really a pain about that. Recently though, he has had started spreading lies about me on sensitive topics for laughs.   


He tells people that I say slurs, that I hold certain bigoted views, and that I hold political beliefs which I cannot delve into here due to the nature of this subreddit. He does this for laughs, and claims that everyone knows he is joking around and that it is the nature of our friendship. At this point I know that I will have to break off this friendship as it could be dangerous for my career and educational future, but would I be the asshole if I got a Cease and Desist letter to scare him off from continuing?  


I have repeatedly told him that I am not fond of this humor, and when I have tried to do it back to him, it just does not work the same. I want to scare him with a letter, but I want to know if it will be taking this to far.

"AITA for not doing more to get more people of color involved in my college environmental club? This is a specific situation and I doubt it‚Äôll get any responses, but I‚Äôm going try anyways.

I am a white 22F and I am a social justice leader for my school‚Äôs environmental club. My social justice leadership position was just created this year, so I didn‚Äôt have any guidance on what specifically I should do to be a good leader, but I really care about equality and social justice in general, so I thought I‚Äôd be able to make a difference. 

For context, I go to a college in the midwest, and 90% of students there are white. While my college is a public college and is pretty liberal, there is hardly any diversity. I really wanted the club to become more diverse because climate change significantly impacts black and indigenous people in the US, and I know how important it is for them to be represented in climate action and for their voices to be heard. However throughout this year, I‚Äôve found it difficult to figure out the best ways to recruit more diverse people to my almost all-white environmental club. When I suggested to my co-leaders that we reach out to diverse clubs on campus, we became worried that the diverse clubs might see this as tokenism, so we decided not to reach out to them. I did frequently do presentations at club meetings on how climate change impacts marginalized communities, but the whole year, I felt like I was never qualified to hold my social justice leadership position. 

Okay, so here‚Äôs where my AITA question comes in:

Yesterday, my environmental club held a big rally and march for the ENTIRE campus and public to encourage our college to take more climate action. We had a pretty good turnout and overall, it was a success. However, today, a black student (who wasn‚Äôt at the protest and isn‚Äôt in our environmental club) reached out to our club after seeing our social media posts from the protest (where most of the students in the pictures were white because most of the people at the protest were white). He stated that it‚Äôs disappointing to see that there wasn‚Äôt more diversity at the march, that our club should have gotten more people of color to attend the march, and that overall we should do more as a club to promote diversity. The rest of the club leaders said that since the protest was open to the public and have always been welcoming and inclusive at our club meetings, we didn‚Äôt do anything wrong. One of my friends also pointed out that since about 10% of the people are the protest were people of color, we actually accurately represented our campus demographics for the protest. However, I still feel really bad and like I failed my duty as a social justice leader. 

AITA for not doing more to include more people of color in my club and at the protest? And if so, what can I do to diversify the clubs I participate in in the future without tokenizing anyone or causing harm?",0.12

"AITA for yelling at my mom at my dad‚Äôs funeral? TA and mobile

Backstory: My (29m) dad died last year. It has not been easy but my wife (26f ‚ÄúS‚Äù from here out) has been amazingly supportive and I can‚Äôt imagine having gone through this without her. My mother (59f) hates my wife and has since the second she met bc S ‚Äústole her baby boy‚Äù from her. I am LC and only maintained it bc I couldn‚Äôt see/talk to my dad otherwise. I do not subject S to her bc my mother can be extremely nasty. However I knew that I needed her to be at the funeral and she even offered to join before I asked. 

The funeral was Friday and it was a complete disaster. When S and I walked in and were spotted by my mom she immediately started berating us. Me for having the gall to bring her and S for having no respect for a private family ceremony. I was too stunned to speak bc I thought she would have a shred of tact at her own husband‚Äôs funeral. Before I got my bearings S launched a counter attack. Asking how she had the nerve to say anything about family when she treated me and my sister so poorly. 

Before anything more was said I yelled ‚Äúboth of you need to stfu and have some amount of dignity. How tf can you make my father‚Äôs, your husband‚Äôs, funeral another event all about you. If you don‚Äôt want to be shut out of both your kids lives and see any potential grandkids. Sit down and shut up.‚Äù It was tense for a second before my uncle told me to show my mother some respect. This started a large fight that ended with a lot of things hidden from my extended being exposed and me leaving early. 

I realize I blew up my family, but it was actually really cathartic to say the truth to someone besides my wife and therapist. My wife supports me but my sister said I went too far.",0.11
"WIBTA for telling my dad to ‚Äúsuck it up‚Äù I know this sounds bad, but let me explain, I‚Äôm [15F] and I‚Äôm not allowed to do most things like, cook, clean, get a job, or normal things kids my age do. So yesterday I made myself a hot chocolate (which I‚Äôm not normally allowed to do) and I adjusted the dial (the water comes from the top, idk what it‚Äôs called) so nothing overflows and so, this morning my dad woke up, made coffee, and got me breakfast.

I want to tell him to suck it up because I‚Äôm sorry that it wasn‚Äôt perfect, he just never listens and keeps yelling.

"AITA for for taking someone‚Äôs full cart at Walmart? I‚Äôm buying spring cleaning supplies at Walmart. I‚Äôm (m 58) average hight but pretty fit and muscular, nothing outrageous, just, I can look intimidating. In the back of Walmart there are double doors that the employees use to bring large carts out to stock the shelves. It‚Äôs usually near Isles that must be stocked regularly like cleaning supplies or groceries. I here a girl say excuse me I need to get through. In front of the double doors are two women (mid 40s) talking with their carts blocking the employee from getting to the back. The girl says again, very nicely I must add, excuse me ladies I need to get through. The Women look at her, they know she needs to get through but continue to stand there talking. Attitude like it‚Äôs a big inconvenience for them to move out of the way. This just pisses me off. Why do people treat workers like freaking trash? I‚Äôm about to say something but hatch a better plan. One of the lady‚Äôs carts has her purse in it, so that‚Äôs a no go. I make eye contact with the girl and smile. I can see she it fighting her irritation. As I casually walk past the women I snag the other woman‚Äôs cart full of groceries and walk away. They don‚Äôt notice for a second then start to pursue me.

Now this may be were I might be the ass hole. I could have just left the cart and went about my day, but obviously that‚Äôs not what I did. As I quickly move down the Isles I put some of her groceries back on the shelf‚Äôs. I try to get the stuff close but I don‚Äôt have time to be perfect. The lady tries to pull the cart from me claiming that it‚Äôs her stuff. I say it‚Äôs not your stuff until you pay for it. And continue on my way. I didn‚Äôt get much put back on the shelf‚Äôs because she kept pulling on the cart. I take a bag of frozen chicken breasts and throw them back into the freezer case.  Almost make it to the front of the store and the three of us are starting to make a seen so I abandon the cart but take several item with me, I think she was going to make chocolate chip cookies. They don‚Äôt follow me and I make a clean getaway. When I get back to my shopping I notice the other woman‚Äôs cart, her purse is not in it now so off I go. I roll it to the camping section pull out all the cold items there were only a few and I needed milk and butter anyway so bonus.

I told a friend about what happened later and she asked me why I was such an a-hole about it and wondered why I didn‚Äôt stop after I had solved the problem. She told me it‚Äôs just like a MAN (yes she said it like that) to think he has the right to be judge, jury and executioner. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm a misogynist pig but then again I am a guy so who knows. I did go back to the camping area later to put the rest of the stuff away but it was gone when I got there. I feel bad that an employee might have had to restock the stuff, my bad. I never did see the girl again, hope she had a chuckle about it.

"AITA for wanting to wake up early and eat healthy? I (19M) am a very physically active and social person.

I also cook and eat the same thing every day as part of my bodybuilding diet plan.

"AITA For not going out with my friend on her birthday? Me (25f) and my best friend (25f) have been planning for her birthday since early this year. I was so excited that we talked for hours about what we‚Äôd wear, what our makeup was going to look like, what the plans for the day were possibly going to be. As it got closer and closer to the day the plans changed and it was decided that we‚Äôd just go clubbing for the night. I was anxious about what exactly we‚Äôd be doing because money was tight and I wanted to know if we should just drink before hand or if we‚Äôd were going to order from the bar, if I needed an Uber. It just made me extremely anxious and uneasy. 

I love my best friend, more than words could ever describe so I was more than willing to accommodate no matter what though because I was excited for her. This is the first time we would be going out together since we were 19/20. Plus it just a nice change of pace from both of daily lives of being full time moms. I was so so excited.

Since the plans for that day we originally had were cancelled, I decided I‚Äôd go visit my family, since the last time I had seen most of them was over a year and a half ago.  The reason for it being so long is that this last year my mom has become addicted to drugs. So I‚Äôve stuck to visiting my dad only because my mom was very unreliable and barely responded to messages anymore. What use to take her an hour or so to respond to us has become months. My mom has always been a short heavy set woman my whole life. 

I didn‚Äôt recognize her when I saw her. She was one third of the size she use to be and was extremely pale. It was awkward the whole time. I didn‚Äôt even know how to talk to her and she didn‚Äôt know about everything important going on in my life.

It stressed me out, my friend still hadn‚Äôt said anything about what we were doing, it was getting later and when I got home I just had a mental breakdown. All I could do was cry I was so angry. I wrote my friend and told her exactly ‚Äú Please please don‚Äôt hate me, but I can‚Äôt go out tonight.‚Äù She left me on read hours later and the next morning I wanted to check if she still ended up going out with other friends and found she had deleted me from everything. She hates excuses so I didn‚Äôt explain anything that happened earlier. I just wanted to recover from the incident before I called her & explained but after seeing she deleted me I sent her a text.

I told her I understood why shed delete me and that I know it was wrong to leave her hanging. But I admit I was still angry and after I explained everything that happened, I blocked her on everything. 

Now it‚Äôs been awhile and I feel like I am the asshole for missing her night. But I also feel like she could‚Äôve communicated about her feeling hurt before deleting me off everything. It also hurts me because I do love her and even excused her for forgetting my own birthday.

"WIBTA for being upset at my family for neglecting our dog? My family‚Äôs had this dog (female lab) since I was in about 8th grade or so. We always just called her the ‚Äúfamily dog‚Äù. I‚Äôve been noticing that none of my family has ever really given her any attention. I want to convince my parent to give her to another family. My family keeps her outside in a cage, unless there is BAD weather. (Flash floods/tornadoes etc.) She only has a tennis ball to play with. She‚Äôs supposed to have black fur, it‚Äôs brown cause of all the dirt out there. We have never given her a bath, so she could easily have harmful things in her system.

I eventually decided to talk to my mom about it. I said that we should give her away because she has no room to run around and we never care for her. She said ‚ÄúThe rain cleans her and she has a dog house and tree for shelter. (Dogs name) is fine.‚Äù I feel like she needs more than a dog house an tree, and the water just makes it worse. We have two small dogs in the house that get cared for properly. The lab thinks she is a lap dog so that‚Äôs they made the choice to keep her outside. But I feel like if we trained her to not jump onto people when she was younger, this would‚Äôve never been a problem.

I feel like I might be part of the problem because I haven‚Äôt really taken care of her much either. I just want her to be given to a caring family. So would I be the asshole for being upset with them?

"WIBTA if I asked my partner's mom if their family ever attempted an intervention? I (19f) have been with my boyfriend (20m) for about two and a half months. We've known each other for much longer and graduated high school together.

A few weeks ago he did something pretty shitty, I won't get into it because it's resolved, but I thought we might break up. I have become somewhat close with his mom so I called her not to complain about my bf's behavior but to ask about dropping off a small gift for one of his siblings bday's if we were to break up.

Some background is that his mother has been very candid about my boyfriend's mental state. She's not a woman who will jump to defend her son and has literally told me I don't deserve that (referring back to the shitty incident). He experiences bipolar 1 and also struggles with drug use. Important to note: nothing like heroin, just *way* too much pot, some acid, and often chain smokes cigarettes which obviously does not help with his condition. From my knowledge, his drug use basically started around twelve.

I am wondering if I would be an asshole for bringing up to her if their family, who are equally (most likely more, since they are his family) concerned for him as I am, have ever attempted to do something forceful to get him to realize he needs help. Something such as an intervention but anything, really.

I know she would agree (and has before) with me that he needs more serious help, but the reason why I feel like I may potentially be the asshole here is that although we have known each other and been friends for years, we haven't been dating very long. I'm also unsure if bringing it up at all would make me the asshole.

TLDR; My boyfriend struggles with a serious mental illness and his drug use is making it worse. Many people in his life are scared of him going down a road of complete self destruction. I am debating speaking to his mother, who I have become close with, if the family has ever attempted to open his eyes to the destructive behavior that always results in bad things happening.

"AITA for not wanting my daughter to go to in-law functions I'm not welcome to? Hi there. This is my second post on AITA and last time y'all were super helpful and actually turned my whole thought process around, so I'm hoping you'll be as helpful this time. I would like to ask that I am VERY open to coaching and honestly want to know if I'm in the wrong (and will change if I am), but I'm also kinda sensitive due to being 8 months pregnant, so please please be kind.   


I (29f) am 8 months pregnant with my first child. My boyfriend (29m) of two years and I have never seen eye to eye about his family. For the most part, I don't like them because they have disrespected my boyfriend and myself on several occasions, and they don't like me because I am outspoken about it. Nothing CRAZY or super dramatic has happened aside from a few angry, but not trashy facebook messages being exchanged. They have not shown an interest in me or the baby during this entire pregnancy and barely spoken to him. 

My boyfriend and I are now at odds because he wants her to be involved with his family. I am of the opinion that if I am not welcome or included at a family function, my daughter is not included either, because we are a package deal. She is part of me whether they like it or not. If my boyfriend and I are together and they invite him and my daughter but not me, that is VERY insulting and I don't want to set the tone for my daughter that I am not valued as her parent, but my boyfriend is. He refuses to hear me out on this, saying I'm being selfish and they have a reason to ""not be sure about me,"" even though I have just as many to ""not be sure about them.""

I haven't reached out to attempt to mend fences because it is literally an entire family against me for the sole reason that I stand up for myself. They tend to be passive aggressive and lowkey insulting and I'm not the type of person that stands for that. I'm also pregnant and have more to worry about than making nice with them. On the other hand, as I stated previously, none of them have tried reaching out to make nice with me or even ask their own brother/son about his baby on the way. 

I'm not asking that they try to be my best friend. If I'm invited I will go and be polite and nice and grateful and mingle like a respectful adult. I am not trashy or spiteful. But if my daughter is going somewhere, I expect to also be welcome. Am I the asshole? If we're both assholes, is there a compromise?

Since I have been 19 or 20 he distanced his self when he and my mom split. He moved about 600 miles away when I was around 21 so it we only really communicate in phone calls.

Two or three weeks passes and I sent him a final message letting him know I will never speak to him again and he is to never contact me or my child.so am I the a hole for feeling like this he raised me since I was 2 until I was an adult and this has been a really tough time for me and my siblings and he shows no care or anything towards us.

Addition : when my mom had a heart attack and ended up in the hospital that lead to her passing away I had health issues and we were in the same hospital I was discharged after two days and spoke to her to let her know I was ok. An hour later she passed away from another heart attack I still had to get my health in order and deal with all of that and he did not call once.",0.01

"AITA for telling my teacher that she embarrassed me in front everyone and that she was an idiot? So I (13f) have been with my partner (14m) for a few months now. We are so happy together and nothing let us affect our relationship even though my friends dislike him. So here‚Äôs the situation I had a favorite teacher Mrs. K and I thought she was nice teacher but one day when me and my partner had to go to class since the bell rang for 3rd period after nutrition break, we hugged as always and suddenly Mrs. K yells, ‚ÄúNO HUGGING, NO HOLDING HANDS, OR KISSING NEXT TIME I‚ÄôLL SAY IT LOUDER!‚Äù Me and my partner were red in the face and immediately went to class also this was in public. During 6th period I had her and I asked to use the restroom but she then stops me and tells me that it was inappropriate to do those things SHE DIDN‚ÄôT EVEN APOLOGIZE. I just nodded and went to the bathroom. I ended breaking down in tears because I had just gotten embarrassed by my favorite teacher. I went back into the classroom and Mrs. K asks if I‚Äôm alright and I dont what got into me but I snapped I yell, ‚ÄúAlright?! Of course I‚Äôm not alright! You just embarrassed me in front of a bunch of kids! You handled this very inappropriately and you didn‚Äôt apologize. Your such an idiot for thinking this was okay for you to do that!‚Äú my teacher told me to go back to my seat and said she‚Äôll talk to me later about my behavior. When the bell rang I ran out as fast as possible. I told my partner and he‚Äôs on my side and apparently the teacher called his mom saying he was ‚Äúbothering‚Äù(if you get what I mean) other students. My parents told me I was wrong for calling her an idiot and I needed to treat with respect. So Aita?

INFO: This is not even the first time she has done this, she recently had done this to my best friend and he felt awful for the whole day because he isn‚Äôt the type to be a troublemaker. My friends dislike my partner because he‚Äôs ‚Äúweird‚Äù according to them. We had a friend group and they kicked him out they also kept telling me he was cheating and I wasn‚Äôt going to believe it unless they had proof in which they didn‚Äôt. I told them this and they got pissed, accusing me of choosing my boyfriend over them. I know I shouldn‚Äôt believe either of them but here‚Äôs the thing, my friends have a history of lying and they admitted to this is how I know.",0.75
"AITA for telling my friends to go get a therapist instead of using me as one? I(15M) have been listening to my friends problems and giving them advice for the past 6 years. While I genuinely do enjoy being there for them it's taken a major toll on my mental health since I listen to all their problems but they don't listen to mine. I've basically just kept it all inside for the past 6 years. 
About a month ago they all tried to unload their problems on to me again. I ended up snapping on them and told them that I'm done and to get an actual therapist instead of trying to use me as one. After that interaction people started telling me that I'm an ass and I shouldn't snap at my friends and I should be there for them. I'll admit I should have tried to handle it better but at that point I was just at my limit and was tired of listening to there problems almost everyday for 6 years when they won't even listen to mine back.

"AITA for being too tired to run errands with my dad? As a little bit of background, we had agreed that he'd come pick me up to spend a week at his place.

Basically, he let me know that he'd pick me up and we were going to run some errands first. I asked him if it would be okay if he came for me tomorrow or Wednesday, because I was really tired after a long day at work. He started shouting at me and telling me i'm full of crap. So I told him to not even bother picking me up then, and he responded saying how i'm the pinnacle pf selfishness and whatnot.

Am I the asshole? He lives rather far and was already kn the way so idk.


Edit: two people have mentioned how it wasn't the best idea to tell my dad to pick me up another day since he was already on his way and this whole thing had been pre-arranged. So I wanted to give a little background as to why I'm so tired.

I was essentially ""promoted"" (same pay, more benefits) to a slighlty better role at work three months ago.

Problem is, they essentially replaced the old people with us (outsourcing at its best), and we were dumped with 1400+ cases to go through between three people which mostly involve customers yelling and swearing at us. So let's just say these past three months haven't been very kind on my mental state.",0.71
"AITA, I had my MIL trespassed after she entered my home and fired my babysitter. I am a widower. I lost my wife (Anne 34) just minutes after she gave birth to our first baby (Sammy). She had a difficult pregnancy so I took an indefinite leave 3 months before she was due. Sammy's 4 months old now and before I went back to work, I told my MIL (Sandra 56) about my plans and if she can recommend a nanny to take care of my daughter when I work. She offered to do it (nanny) for free. I told her she's free to come by anytime during the day if she feels uncomfortable with a nanny looking after Sammy but she insisted on doing it herself. So I said yes and gave her a copy of the house keys. She comes 30 mins. before I leave for work, and when I come home, she stays for dinner and leaves after putting Sammy to sleep.

Everything was fine for the first couple of weeks until I noticed that Sammy's not feeding as much. Her formula's barely touched. I asked Sandra about it and why Sammy's not feeding well. She said she's trying to breastfeed my daughter. At first I thought she was joking then I realized she wasn't. She said Sammy needs to latch for a few minutes everyday to ""activate"" her milk production. I almost lost it, I told her she cannot do that, and she needs to stop. She said she will but I caught her again when I walked in my daughter's room and she was forcing Sammy to latch. I confronted her and told her she's no longer my baby's nanny. I didn't ask for the key back as she is still welcome to come visit anytime.

I asked for a 1 week leave from work to care for my daughter and find a nanny. I found one but two days after she never returned. I called her and she said my ""Mother"" fired her the day before. I asked her to describe the woman and I was livid when I realized it was Sandra. She came in my house using her key and fired my nanny. I was about to call her when she showed up and said a convoluted story like how I hired an incompetent nanny, etc. etc. I told her to leave but she refused and told me she's calling CPS because I am endangering my child. We argued back and forth before I called the police and she was charged with trespassing.

I know my MIL is grieving the loss of her daughter, I am too. But she crossed the line when she disregarded my wishes. She is very upset with me. My SIL and BIL are calling me ruthless and I am now second guessing myself. Have I taken it too far by calling the police? AITA?

EDIT: Thank you everyone for your advice and showing concern for Sammy. I called CPS to tell them about the situation. My mom is coming over to help look after my daughter and look at our options (she's a retired family law attorney). I do have a doorbell camera but reading some of the suggestions here, I decided to up my home security system. BIL and SIL know the whole story and they also think that forcing to breastfeed Sammy was wrong, but they are angry at me for calling the cops on MIL and having her trespassed. They said it was unnecessary and cruel to do to a grieving mother.",0.12

"AITA For Trying To Break My Ex Girlfriend Up With Her New Boyfriend? I (17M) had started dating this girl 7 months ago and knew little about her. We went our separate ways and ending things peacefully and decided to be friends after a month and a half. I didnt speak with her for a month then shortly after that my uncle had passed away. He was a very big pillar in my life so i posted something about him and she was the only person to give her condolences and talk to me to see how i was doing and seeing how i was feeling. We talked for a while after and she let me know she had a new boyfriend and started dating him less than a week after we broke up.     
       We get a lot closer and i get to know her better and she gets to know me better. She has a lot of mental disorders that i help her talk about and help remind her to take her medicines and etc. She then goes into detail about how her last relationships have been and how she been treated wrongfully by her 2 last boyfriends before me. She tells me 
        ""im the only one who do that to her"" i then asked her ""what do you mean by that?"" She then tells me how her new boyfriend likes to touch her while they are in public and even when she says to stop or no that he still foes it and his excuse is that no one is looking so its ok. I then got very angry but calmly let her know that that is not ok and as a friend i dont think you should still be with him. 
  Last week she was on a trip that i had no clue she went to and i so happened to be there and she quickly pulled me to the side to talk. She was having a panic attack because she knew no one except for me her bf was stressing her. I calmed her down and we spent the day having fun together. She tells me that she has a attachment disorder and that she doesn't think she can break it off.I was talking to her last night and she was talking about how she told her friends about how we talk and her friends told her boyfriend that she was going to cheat on him with me. he texts me and blows up on me today and tells me how i make her feel terrible and that im a bad person to her. I then ask her if any of this is true and she tells me sometimes i do. I ask her to be more foward with me because I didn't mean to do that, she then tells me to not tell him what we talk about and to just stay peaceful. I do as she says and i try to stay polite with my messages and his only response is that i make her feel bad and that it doesn't matter what my intentions are and that I shouldn't try to break them up. He then shows multiple screenshots of her talking about how im always stressing her out and making her feel bad and that i tried to break them up. I then ask her what was she talking about and is this really how she feels and she says, ""idk"" and so i politely respond saying i had no clue i was causing trouble and i have apologized for doing that. I have no idea what to think atp point because I have tried the best I can to get her out of this toxic situation and im being called a bad person for it. AITA?",0.02
"AITA for changing my mind about a different type of pasta for dinner. Hey Reddit! I'm new here but love to read this community and now I need some advice. Here's some background info first: 

My fianc√©(M30) and I(F27) have been together for 8 ¬Ω years and have been engaged for about 6 months.

We both work full-time but he makes a lot more money than I do. We split the house bills in half, but he does help me a bit with my loans.  I enjoy to cook and our rule is, I cook-you clean. So, I usually cook every night (usually a protein, veggie, and starch) but he does not do the dishes every night. I end up doing them the next day.  I also clean the house, do laundry, and all other chores around the house. 

Now for the story:

I am cooking dinner tonight (seared chicken with pasta). I went to ask him if he wants boxed mac and cheese or plain white pasta? I was kinda feeling the boxed mac and cheese but wasn't sure. He says the plain pasta and I said aw really, I was thinking the mac and cheese.

His voice starts to raise and says the mac and cheese is bad for you and has a ton of fat in it and you always put a whole stick of butter in it (not true). I said alright (nice and calm) and walked back to the kitchen. 

I grabbed both pasta boxes to compare because I was truly curious how bad the mac and cheese is. So I take both boxes to show him as well and while I'm walking I start reading the labels and say ""the mac and cheese really isn't that bad for you. The fat isn't too bad but the sodium is insane"". 

He takes the boxes, starts analyzing, and then tells me the difference of each nutritional fact, line by line. I took the boxes back and while I'm walking away I calmly say ""I'll just make the white pasta""

He gets real pissed now and raises his voice and says ""You really just came in here to argue with me about the mac and cheese and now you want pasta? What was the point of you walking in here then?""

I told him ""I just wanted to show him the difference and I don't want all the cheese now"".

He now gets even more mad and starts laughing in a condescending way and says ""just cook the f\*in mac and cheese, that's what you want"". I said ""I changed my mind"" and walked back to the kitchen to start cooking. 

A few minutes later, he wants into the kitchen to put a plate in the sink and I said ""you need to chill you're gonna have a heart attack at 60"". 

He says ""Were gonna have diabetes before then anyways"" I told him then he can cook more often if he wants healthier food. 

He got the most disgusted look on his face and says ""are you kidding me? Really? You're really serious right now? This is a f\*in joke. This is all over because you came in to argue over f\*in mac and cheese when you didn't even want it in the first place. You started this shit"". Then he walks way and I just start cooking dinner.

"AITA for telling my SIL I don't want pics of my niece?  Every year I visit my mom out of state, and each time my brother, his wife, and daughter drive to our mom's to see me. Every time my SIL will walk up to me with my niece's school/sports pics and says something like ""You can pick whichever sizes you want."" She also does this to my sister. I never ask for them. My issue is she assumes I want them. I prefer she asks or leaves a few behind. Instead she presents them to us so I feel like I have to take at least one.

Last month she did it again. I told her no thanks, I already have a lot of pics of her. She got mad, told my brother, and he got mad too.

I do have lots of pics of her. I found a stack of her baby pics. I could keep a few, but honestly I don't want most of them. They gave out so many of these back then. And I have her school pic for every year since then. I'm not very close to her, but I do love and care about her. But I don't need pics every year.

My niece is 11 yo. She's an only child. They kind of worship her. But the rest of the world doesn't but they don't get that. AITA for declining the pics? I could have easily accepted as I always do to keep the peace, but was it truly wrong to be honest? I wasn't mean about it.",0.6

"AITA for beating my girlfriend in a game of NBA2k? Yesterday I had my girlfriend over. She showed up while I was finishing a game of NBA2k. To my surprise, she was interested in the game and wanted to try playing. She is not much of a gamer at all, but does know the basic rules of basketball and sometimes watches games with me. I asked her if she wanted me to teach her how to play, but instead she wanted to hop into a game against me right away. I told her at least three times that she would not have much of a chance, as I have been playing this game for years, but she insisted.

I decided to play as the Raptors (a decent team but far from the best) and she picked the Bucks (one of the best teams). I tried my best to give her easy chances to score at the beginning of the game, but my competitive instincts kicked in. After a couple of minutes of playing I looked at the scoreboard to see that I held a 28-0 lead. It did not seem like she was having much fun, so I asked her if she wanted to do something else. Instead, she said that she had to go home and quickly got up and left.

We have not spoken since. I tried to check-in on her on Instagram this morning after I saw she was online. She will not respond to any of my messages. I told my close friends about the situation and they said that I did nothing wrong. However, my girlfriend still will not talk to me, which is starting to make me think that I did something wrong.

"AITA for provoking my younger brother? AITA for provoking my younger brother?

I (34f) have a brother (33) who lives with my Dad (71), my youngest brother (29), youngest brother‚Äôs fianc√© (29) and their son (7). I don‚Äôt live with them anymore.

The 33 year old brother (call him Matthew) has been getting worse and worse of late, constantly spouting racist, eugenic, slurs and thinking himself smarter than anyone else. He‚Äôs always been confrontational and he used to bully my youngest brother; now he‚Äôs turning his attentions on my 7 year old nephew in the name of teaching him not to be ‚Äúweak‚Äù.

So today, I bumped into my 29 year old brother, his fianc√© and their son and went home with them because my nephew wanted me with him. Matthew was there and almost immediately stole my nephews‚Äô favourite teddy from him and taunted him, because he wanted a hug or something? And then he wouldn‚Äôt give it back, holding it above my nephew‚Äôs head who was very upset.

So I took Matthew‚Äôs hat off his head to balance the scales and gave it to my nephew to ‚Äútrade‚Äù. My nephew let it go too quick and so Matthew kept the teddy and said ‚Äúwhat is the lesson here?‚Äù My nephew didn‚Äôt know and didn‚Äôt care; he just wanted his teddy back. So I said as a jokey thing we say, that the lesson is that Uncle Matthew is a pain in my nephew‚Äôs side.

But Matthew persisted in asking what the lesson was. At this point, and having seen him do this too many times before, these ‚Äúlessons‚Äù that just make my nephew cry, I said it again. And so my nephew repeated it. So then Matthew said something about ‚Äúno, Auntie‚Äôs lying, that‚Äôs not the lesson‚Äù. So then my nephew got more upset, thinking he was wrong, looking to me for answers.

So then (this is too long, sorry), Matthew repeated what he always says ‚Äúyou‚Äôre making him weak, teaching him to be weak‚Äù. Usually, I ignore him but this time, fed up, I said something along the lines of ‚Äúwhat you‚Äôre trying to teach him may not be the lesson he learns.‚Äù And Matthew properly bellowed ‚ÄúSHUT THE FUCK UP, WOMAN.‚Äù

I said no. He accused me of being overbearing, making my nephew weak, and that ‚Äúthe literature‚Äù all agreed with him. And yes, I said ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather be ‚Äúoverbearing‚Äù than a knob head‚Äù which wasn‚Äôt very grown up of me, I admit.

My youngest brother stepped in at this point and told us to stop because last time we argued, Matthew kicked a hole in the toilet door while I was in there and he (youngest brother) didn‚Äôt want it to happen again. And he said to me that I don‚Äôt back down, Matthew doesn‚Äôt back down, it escalates and that youngest brother has tried arguing back and it never works.

So I might be TA because it‚Äôs not my house and I don‚Äôt want to make things uncomfortable for the people who live there, especially not my nephew, but I‚Äôm also just so sick of Matthew talking down to everyone and airing his horrible views and making my nephew cry again and again, and that we‚Äôre all expected to not say anything because it‚Äôll ‚Äúmake him worse‚Äù.

"AITA for asking questions about someone‚Äôs eczema? So I was at the park today with a couple of friends ( I‚Äôm 19) and we saw this girl at the park who was about 14. And she was wearing shorts and a tank top and she had a whole bunch of brown spots all over her. She looked to be Spanish or someone that was black but light skin ( I mean this in the least racist way possible)  but the brown spots looked pretty. So I approached her and asked her what the spots were. She looked kind of defensive at first, and then realized I was just genuinely curious. So she told me that it was eczema, so I asked her why it left spots. And she told me it was hyperpigmentation. We spoke about her eczema for about 30 minutes before my friends caught up with me. One of my friends then told me off in front of the girl saying that I was extremely rude. And that I shouldn‚Äôt be asking her that, especially because she was a person of color (my friends are white myself included) and because she was child. I then tried to explain to her that I was just genuinely curious and how I thought it was interesting, and that the hyperpigmentation complimented the girls looks and skin tone. So I apologized to the girl, who tried to reassure me that it was okay and that I was one of the first people to question her without being malicious. And then my friends and I left the park. My friend then complained about me being racist for a questioning a POC child and that it wasn‚Äôt my place. So AITA for asking questions about someone‚Äôs eczema?",0.93
"AITA - Not planning activities for my friend who's in town for my Baby Shower So here's the context: I (f/40) went through rounds of fertility tests for several years and finally through some effort - ;) - and patience, we're pregnant.  First ever pregnancy and depending on the delivery, could be my only one.  My husband (m/40) and I are planning our baby shower at 34 weeks  (only us, no help from our friends which is 100% ok) the same weekend my best friend Jamie (f/42) is coming into town - which is a birthday gift for herself.  Jamie has 2 other friends out here.  I've been only focused on my baby shower but did plan to have Jamie at the baby shower.  Her friend, Christine (f/43) and I had a very lengthy call about Christine's trip.  She's very opinionated and I've stepped away from chatting with her since she tends to have very different opinions than I do and she doesn't want to hear my thoughts only wants to hear herself talk.

Christine basically said she was surprised I hadn't made plans for Jamie's time out here.  She went on and on about how Jamie is my bestie and how I should have planned something for her and so on.  I at first said that Jamie is an adult and could vocalize if she wants to hang out.  Truthfully, this is the only weekend I've been able to get some time off, and planned a final outing for myself (a day alone doing whatever I want).  

Christine brought up that we need to celebrate Jamie's birthday while she's out here and make it a whole weekend.  This pissed me off, this is my Baby Shower weekend, my weekend.  I will only get to fully celebrate this once.  Even if we have another baby, it's not going to be the same.  I blew up at Christine and told her that I don't need to plan for everything and that I'm focused on my Baby Shower.  That I haven't had the time to work on the nursery, get early presents unpacked and stuff until this weekend.  Then because I wanted her to shut up, I made tentative plans.  Now I don't want to see either of them this weekend.  And mind you, Jamie has no clue what went down and I don't believe I can say anything to Jamie.  Now I have plans for Friday - Sunday when all I really have the energy to handle is the Baby Shower.  My husband is already working so hard to help me with everything and goes beyond anything I would have ever dreamed off.  I'm not going to push more stuff on him so I can go out with Christine and Jamie.

Now, I don't know.  Should I have planned something for Jamie?  Should I share anything with Jamie?",0.16

"AITA for ""letting"" my family and friends disrespect my boyfriend by calling him by his first name? 


My boyfriend (32/M) is a doctor. I met him through my dad back when we were traveling and after we started dating he started coming over to my hometown to visit.


When I introduced him to my family and friends, I told them his full name, then occupation, then mentioned the other stuff like age and hometown etc. all good until months later where he started complaining about my family and friends referring to him by his ""first name"" and not putting ""dr"" before. I found this strange I told him that's his professional title but as a society we use first names/nicknames etc. He said he can't help feel annoyed especially considering that ""these people"" don't know him well. but it's been 8 months. he said once we're married or engaged then they can start referring to him using his first name.


Recently he started correcting whenever my friends or family call him hy his name, his tone becomes aggressive and then he goes on a long lecture about how they should put ""Dr"" before mentioning his name. It became exhausting because my friends and family can't understand his strange hangup and he keeps picking fights with them about it.

Last night we were visiting my parents and my dad called him ___[""Justin""]___ instead of ___[""Dr. Justin""]___. My boyfriend started arguing with him which cause a huge fight in the house and we ended up leaving.


In the car he went off on me saying I'm letting family and friends disrespect him continually by letting them call him with just his name. I told him he was at fault here and he was being unreasonable because what he's expecting is bizzare. He said he takes pride in his proffesion and that he sacrificed so much to get where he is today and my family and friends literally lose nothing if they respect his wishes. He called me an enabler and said that siding with them paints me in a bad light and advised me to step up and take a stand but again, I thought he was overreacting and being hostile for no reason.

We got home and he shut me down and refused to speak to me. Mom called me later and we talked a bit. Today he's gone completely radio silence but the look on his face is telling.


AITA?

EDIT: we don't have anyone who's a doctor in the family or friend groups but we know for certain that we don't use people's professional titles all the time when addressing them, especially not people we have a relationship with. I don't understand how me and my family are offending him. he is choosingbthis his hill to die on apparently.",0.17

"AITA for not taking my step son to ‚Äútake your kid to work day‚Äù? So basically, i have two kids. My biological daughter that i had with my wife, and my step son. Let‚Äôs call my step son Michael. My wife was only 18 when she had Michael, and i met her when she was 22, and Michael was 4. She‚Äôs on low contact with Michael‚Äôs father because she honestly despises him for getting her pregnant, and i can‚Äôt really blame her. She wanted to get an abortion and the guy told her she should too but she found out she wasn‚Äôt allowed because it would cause a lot of health problems.
Anyway..

Last week, my work place announced a ‚Äútake your kid to work day‚Äù. I decided to take my daughter and i told my wife the day before the event. She said to me ‚Äúthat‚Äôs great and all, but is it alright if you can take Michael?‚Äù i kind just stood there and said ‚Äúcan‚Äôt you?‚Äù. My wife is a detective and often works alone in her private study, working on cases. I offered that Michael could sit beside her while she solves a case or something, or he could go to his real fathers work place and catch up again. 

I didn‚Äôt think much of it but my wife said that she would be going on a few important meetings that day and it wouldn‚Äôt be fair for Michael just to sit and watch her. Michael didn‚Äôt want to go with his father. Don‚Äôt know why, but he just didn‚Äôt want to go. 

The problem is, me and Michael don‚Äôt have a good bond with each other. He‚Äôs about 13 and my daughters 8. Of course they get along, but me and him don‚Äôt get along at all. I‚Äôm not his father figure and he knew that from the start. I‚Äôm really trying my best but that kid just hates me for no reason. He also has bad anger issues that have not been resolved when i came. We really don‚Äôt know the reason, but it would cause a problem if he came to work with me. I‚Äôve stopped trying so hard and i‚Äôm just working to be a good dad to my daughter. Also, even if i did bring him, people would think really weirdly of me because my daughter and step son look absolutely nothing alike. My daughter looks a lot like me and her mom, while Michael looks like his dad and my wife‚Äôs father. He IS her son, but they don‚Äôt look immediately like they‚Äôre related, only just a bit. I‚Äôm fully filipino and i have pretty dark skin and darker hair, while Michael is basically the opposite. He has blonde hair, blue eyes, and is pale as fuck. 

I ended up not taking Michael to the event and he stayed home alone. My wife had a huge heated argument with me about not taking him. She said that she thought she trusted me to love our children equally enough to let them have fun together, and she thought i viewed Michael as my own son. I‚Äôve never EVER yelled at my wife before but i had had enough. I told her that michael was not my responsibility and for her to actually take care of her son for once. I kinda just stood there after saying all that and i only felt bad for yelling at my wife. I wish we could‚Äôve resolved this calmly but i couldn‚Äôt control myself. My wife isn‚Äôt taking to me and neither is michael.

"AITA for helping my homeless friend and attempting to move out? The past few weeks have been extremely rough, so I apologize if anything in this story seems incoherent. I'll clarify anything if necessary. 

A few weeks ago, an internet friend (19F) of roughly a month came to our friend group with really bad news: she was being evicted and had nowhere else to go. Due to this, we initially all planned to have her fly out to my city, and then have her go with a mutual friend of ours once they could drive out here to pick her up. Last minute, this person claimed they couldn't help her out, and hasn't contacted us since then. She was essentially stranded here.

Because of this, I (21M) elected to offer her a place to stay. However, since I'm a student and live with my parents, it wasn't technically my home to share. I knew that if I asked my parents, they would deny her, so I basically snuck her in and out of the house to make sure that she at least had a place to sleep. From my perspective, I knew that the alternative was to abandon my friend, and I don't know if I would ever have the conscious to be able to do that.

Regardless, things continued for a while until my father (49M) found out and kicked her out as well. Luckily, her and I were able to find her a place to stay for a short while, where she is now. 

In the aftermath of all of this, my family has come down hard on me. Accusations of stranding her out here, making her life more difficult, claiming that I only offered to help her out because of her looks (citing the fact that we slept together after she came out here), calling me stupid and naive, harassing me by saying that I'll pay child support for the rest of my life and that I'll amount to nothing, among others. 

This led me to analyze his current behavior, and I reached out to my estranged mother (43F) for her opinion. While she agrees that I should not have snuck people in and out of a house I didn't own, she also says that I ought to do what makes me happy. After a long discussion, I decided that I'd move out. 

Upon telling my father this, he got extremely upset. He continued to tell me that I was going to amount to nothing, and is now demanding that I pay him $400 in rent due by the 1st of May, with my PC as ""collateral,"" knowing that I won't have the money by that date. He's also telling me that he'll cancel my health insurance, knowing that I have active medications, and that he's removing his financial support for university as well.

Despite how I might have made this sound, I am genuinely torn right now. I don't know if I'm doing anything right, or if I'm genuinely not appreciative of my parent's support and have doomed my friend's future.

AITA for not getting my sister coffee? [deleted],0.5
"AITA for wanting my sister and I to be treated equally UPDATE: I was not expecting this money ppl to respond. But ok I get it.... Im wrong. 
I said sorry to stepmom. She's not mad, at is very understanding. After much digging and crying I find out the only money for college for me is what my dad is offering. He's willing to buy me a used car(and car ins) to commute to school also. Apparently they have had conversations about it with my mom and my mom wanted no parts of a savings plan for me the expectation was for me to get a loan. I'm so disappointed in my mom. 

To answer some of the questions, my dad pays child support. My stepmom babysis and I have a good relationship, we spend alot of time together, and the only person who ever talked to me about my life after HS was my stepmom. Her and my dad got married 4 years ago, she says she would always say ask your mom to me because that's what my mom wanted.*********


I (17f) have a sister Sabrina who is three.  I was visiting last weekend with my Dad and stepmom and she left all her accounts and things open on the laptop and I saw that Sabrina has a college fund. To reiterate, she is 3. 

I bought up that I didn't see a fund for me at dinner. She told me I should talk to my mom and dad about it. I found this werid because her and my dad have been together since I was 5, I just thought it was so unfair that they wouldnt have money set aside for me also.  So I bought up her blatant favoritism for my little sister since she already has a college fund THE AGE OF 3. 

She gets all mad and says that I'm asking the wrong person. I told my mom when I got home and she said that my dad and stepmom should have money for me for college. 

Today my dad calls me and says that I would have to go to local community college and he would pay 50% of tuition for college. I told him that it was bullshit that the focus should go to me since they have plenty of time to worry about Sabrina later. He just said 50% is what I'm getting and I would have to pay the rest or take out a loan. So I called my dad TA for favoring Sabrina.",0.33

"AITA for claiming I'm too tired to play with a friend Am I the asshole for claiming that I was too tired to play Valorant with my friend John?

For context John just got a computer a few days ago and is really into Valorant at the moment, he has been asking to play every day to the extent of me not having time to play with other friends. Earlier today one of my friends Daniel asked me to play or watch a show later at about 2:00 PM, I agreed and made plans to do so. Around 6:00 PM as I was getting home John asked to play Valorant as usual; the transcript goes as follows-

John- Val?

Me- No

30 or so minutes pass and I get on with Daniel

John- I thought you said you were too tired

Me- Yes, Im too tired to play with you

John-  bruh fuck you 

John-  you do this shit all the time and when we play your just fucking negative and not even fun to play with, it‚Äôs getting on my nerves that you feel like you can just be a dick and have no consequences but that‚Äôs why you don‚Äôt have many close friends 

Me- Chill out, I just said I didnt want to play a video game with you

John-  Don‚Äôt tell me to chill out, you made a bitch excuse saying your too tired and then I ask to play since I see you on and you act like a fucking dick. You do this shit often and i‚Äôm tired of it and i won‚Äôt put up with it or be around someone who does it 

John- None of my friends act like this

Me-  ok then dont be around me, i told you the truth, i am playing causal with danny, the enviroment with you and jake (mutual friend) is too high energy 

John- No you fucking lied about playing a video game like the little bitch you are 

John-  And then tried to act like you didn‚Äôt lie and say something mean about it 

John-  Like you always do 

Me-  jesus im sorry, i just said i didnt want to play valorant with you today, like i said i am too tired to play valorant with you because it is a very different dynamic 

John-  Then fucking say that instead of lying and saying your just too tired. And you did this the other day where i was gonna get on and play with you and danny but you said no you just wanted to play with him and to just leave. How do you think I feel when i go to text you i see you and Danny are playing valorant while you told me your too tired to play. You do this shit often where you just act like a dick like it has no consequence and take no one else‚Äôs feelings into account

Me-  Danny asked me to play at 2pm today, i said sorry what else do you want me to do 

John-  Jesus fucking christ your brain dead.  Don‚Äôt fucking talk to me 

End Transcript

I will admit that i should not have lied about being too tired and that i neglected his feelings. I never meant to hurt his feelings but he also never gave me a chance to apologize. 

It also kind of concerns me that he was so quick to begin gaslighting and saying things such as me not having many friends. 

I really just want to know if his outburst was warranted because from my point of view this came out of no where due to him not letting me know about how he was feeling before hand.

"AITA For making fun of my friends asthma? 
This was a while ago but I'm still unsure on how to feel, I (17F) knew this dude (18M) for around 5 years and were talking alot with him and his friends during those years. He and his friends were very racist and toxic which I now realize while I'm typing this out, they would make remarks about my appearance based on my race and give me degrading nicknames such as limited asian vision.

Not so long ago he got a girlfriend (16F) who I also were friends with which I didn't mind but the so called ""bullying"" got worse and his girlfriend didn't even bat an eye even though she knew what was happening but she would side with them and make fun of me to then say that she was sacred to say anything in our private messages. 

It got to the point where I couldn't joke about them but they could make jokes about me since they backed up each other. So one time I got mad and we had a heated argument about something completely unnecessary to even fight about and he pulled the ""you have no rights because you are a ching chong and a woman"" so I replied with ""at least I am able to breathe without dying or needing an inhaler"" which made both of them angry and wanted me to apologize for being rude and inconsiderate and making him ""feel bad"" about himself.

Maybe I'm just tripping and not understanding since he really can't control if he has it or not but others have told me that I am not the asshole while they said I was being completely out of hand and that they want an apology.

"AITA for not wanting to share a bed with my boyfriend‚Äôs dogs My boyfriend is very close to his dogs and I spend most of my time at his house. I struggle with sleeping anyway and although I love his dogs, I find spending time with them constantly to be really overbearing.  

He insists on sharing the bed/covers and they are two very needy dogs. I find it a bit gross having mucky paws under the covers with me and being licked and walked on and smelling their farts and being drooled on and being covered in dog hairs when I want to sleep. 

I‚Äôve posed to him that it makes me uncomfortable and it doesn‚Äôt make for a good nights sleep but I feel I may be in the wrong as it is his house, his rules, his dogs. 

I‚Äôve started sleeping in a separate bed if his dogs come into the bedroom and he gets upset with me for this and tells me I‚Äôm ‚Äúobviously not a dog-person‚Äù even though I am.

Am I in the wrong for telling him that this makes me uncomfortable and sleeping in a separate room when it happens?",0.06
"WIBTA if I stopped hanging out with my bro as much bc of his gf's gross implications about my siblingship with my bro? I'm (21f) currently helping out my brother (28m) due to a work place injury. his gf (44f) lives with him but works during the day. My bro and I are huge goofballs. When we're hanging out we love joking around, making fun of each other and annoying each other. Recently once again his gf got pissed off that I was lightly annoying him by flicking his head while he was on speaker phone with her. I was giggling and he flicked me back. We laughed and that was it on our end but his gf was pretty pissed by this. They were just talking about their plans to hang out after she comes home. It was pretty casual small talk. The convo they were having was pretty much over before I started to flick him. Once the phone call was over which was pretty soon after my bro got a text from her saying bs like ""how close are you two to where she can flick your head"" ""you two are having a tickle fight"" ""your relationship is weird and inappropriate"". My brother shut down all bs and she eventually said sorry to him. This is not the first time though that she's said things like this. She hates me spending time with him. Claimed before was too much and inappropriate then too. (We'd watch a movie every once in awhile.) Their relationship is unhealthy even besides all this and I'm very much over being made to feel uncomfortable about having a friendship with my own brother. I will still be helping him around his and her place while he's healing but after that I don't want to be near his place anymore or anywhere with him if she's around.

TLDR; my bro's gf thinks siblings hanging out and joking around is wrong and inappropriate making me not want to be around her or near his and her's place anymore. I don't plan to visit him if she's around ever again.

edit: they had been calling each other every hour for 25ish mins at a time. I don't live with them. I'm only there during the day while he's injured. also like I had said in the post but I'll make it a bit more clear here the convo had ended and they just finished making their plans for the evening. How my bro and I joke around is nothing new and she knows that. It's all done in a pretty ironic way now since him and I are adults. As for someone else saying I sounded like I haven't liked her for awhile. I never minded her until this type of accusation from her. I want my bro to be happy and loved if that's her and what he wants then I support him. No matter my outside view of the relationship.

UPDATE: my brother doesnt care how his gf makes me feel so because of this and some other factors i no longer speak to my brother after he no longer needed my help with his injury. injury wise hes doing very well.",0.08
"AITA for claiming a co-worker‚Äôs health is to blame for their poor work-ethic? 
A few days ago I(F19) was on an important work-related zoom call with my co-workers and our boss. We all worked really hard on our project. Except for one person, who I‚Äôll call ‚ÄúMark‚Äù for the sake of this story. He barely helped out at all. Which is nothing out of the ordinary for this man. He rarely contributes to doing anything right at our work place. Which is lame I know. But I think because of his health, and the fact he‚Äôs starting to age more is the reason why our boss feels obligated to keep him around. He has worked here the longest out of almost all of my co-workers. And this is important to say because he‚Äôs struggled with keeping a job his whole life. He‚Äôs almost 50-something but due to his health he‚Äôs never been able to stay at a place for too long. I feel the need to disclose that I do feel bad that he‚Äôs constantly getting sick. I was raised not to disrespect others for their differences, and I‚Äôve tried my best to do so. But I regret to say I ended up betraying my morals during this specific zoom call. 

Little did the rest of my co-workers and i know, that behind our backs he was changing everything we were working on. We didn‚Äôt notice at first because this was done literally the night before we did our presentation. We had no clue he decided to do this until we joined the zoom call and saw that he changed everything. And also chose to be the one who took the most credit for what we did. He also never let any of us speak, and he kept sniffling and blowing his nose the entire time he spoke. I was so mortified that he did this. So were my co-workers. Because of the way he acted and the fact the rest of us were so confused with what he did to our presentation, we were prevented from getting the promotion. Our months of hard work went to waste because of him. I felt so bad for my group and wanted to defend our honor to our boss, so I decided to take matters into my own hands and have Mark take the fall for our poor presentation. I even mentioned that because of how sick he tends to get he wasn‚Äôt even able to work on our project half the time. So basically the rest of us did everything, and he barely contributed to it at all. I mentioned that he changed around what we did so it‚Äôd come across like he did the most work, or whatever. Upon hearing all of this our boss decided to confront Mark about betraying us. He flipped out and accused me of lying and victim-blaming him for my failure. 

My group has my back, but the rest of our co-workers don‚Äôt seem to believe our side of the story. I feel like because I judged Mark for his health issues, and held him accountable for his actions my own reputation at my workplace is going to become ruined. Hardly anyone believes me that this happened. I‚Äôm scared I might get fired since I couldn‚Äôt keep my mouth shut. And now I‚Äôm starting to really regret disrespecting Mark since he‚Äôs so much older than I am.

AITA for going off on a parent of one of the kids at the school I work at?? Hello all I hope your doing well.  So I just got into an Argument with one of the parents of the school I'm working at and wanted to know if I was the asshole in the situation. So here's some backstory on this situation before I tell you about today. So this parent is always late picking up their kindergardener it's either I was to busy or I forgot it's usually not a big deal either me or one of the other custodians puts on SpongeBob in the staff  breakroom and get the kid something to eat and drink then we'll go back to work checking in on them every 15mins or so until their parent comes and gets then. This has been going on all school year and honestly it's not usually a bother to us necause shes usually only 30mins late but today this parent was late over 4 hours and the child was crying for most of the final hour because they didn't understand why their parents were always late (Yes I know there are school busses but this kids parents refuse to let then ride the busses). Honestly it tore at the hearts of all of us today. When this child's parent finally arrived she had an attitude and told the child to straighten up and stop crying otherwise they would be grounded the whole weekend. That did not sit right with me because the child was crying because of their parents actions. So I told this parent off about how bad of a parent they are and told them that if they are ever this late again I will not hesitate to call child services (we are suppossed to do this anyway but we haven't because it's not really a bother to us). So was I the Asshole for telling off this parent??,0.44

"AITA for insulting my ex boyfriend when I bumped into him at my job? Long time reddit story listener, first time poster! 
Short (?) backstory: I (F23) was in an on-off relationship with a guy (23 now) from ages 16-21. He was my first love, He cheated on me multiple times, and cheated on his ex-gfs with me. He has a child with one of those girls too, but I was dumb enough to keep taking him back. He was verbally and sometimes physically abusing, controlling, and manipulative, and racist towards hispanics and african american (despite being 75% hispanic himself) and criticized me when I didnt agree with his racism. But I honestly didn‚Äôt see it that way at the time (Ive COMPLETELY opened my eyes and realized the type if person he was).
The last time we were together didn‚Äôt end very well; I found a new guy when I got tired of my ex putting off/avoiding making the relationship . (Note: I later found out he already had a girlfriend that he kept hidden, which is why he didn‚Äôt make things official w us) 
He was ‚Äúhurt‚Äù and said awful things to me before we parted ways. 
Well, last year (2021), I ran into my ex at my job. He was shopping with his mom and spotted me fixing up an aisle. He came up and talked to me, asking me how I‚Äôve been and so on. I tried to keep things short because I wasnt comfortable speaking to him after everything Ive gone through with him. But it caught me off guard when he suddenly ask me ‚Äúso, are you still the typical whore sleeping around with every guy you meet?‚Äù I was taken aback and in shock. I told him I never was a whore or slept around, Im actually in a relationship with a great guy. He noticed my phone lockscreen when I took it out to check the time, and saw that my boyfriend is African American. He scoffed and immediately said ‚Äúso I was right all along, you ARE a N****R lover after all. I shouldve known back when we were together, I dodged a bullet there‚Äù 
I was so angry and shocked to hear him say that. So I immediately replied back with ‚ÄúYeah, now I know why youre so insecure about black men‚Äù as I looked down to his crotch while smiling. He was so OFFENDED, calling me disgusting to be with a ‚Äún****r‚Äù and callinf me a terrible person for insulting him in that way (he was always insecure about his dick size and manhood). 

I walked away abs he later messaged me on facebook calling me all sorts of names and a terrible human being for hitting him where it hurts him the most. 
Was I the asshole for saying that to him???

Edit: I guess i might have been the AH since i couldve just walked away and not said anything to him but im not sure",0.14

My close friend from high school(25F) and I(26F) have been commucating only through whatsapp or phone for about 3 years now. She always declined my offers to hang out, when I asked her for a reason she told me ""I can't afford it because my father's work is not going well""(she was still a student back then) and I soothed her and said ""if you want to meet sometime everything will be my treat"" because we don't do much when we meet anyway, having lunch, going to have a coffee and maybe shopping, etc. It's been 3 years and her financial condition has gotten much better, she goes on vacations and hanging out with other friends of her but still not with me.
Since she knew I was planning to move away to a distant place permanently soon, she recently told me ""I want to see you -for the last time-"" but I let her know after I already moved out and she got quite upset. But I couldn't bring myself to see her, it felt fake since she didn't bother to invite me hanging out for years.

"AITA for telling my sister my honest opinion of her relationship? I (17f) have an older sister, N (21f). My sister is a VERY obsessive person, she meets people and they become ""her person"" for a couple months and then she never talks to them again. all good I mean it doesn't affect me and if she's happy all I care about. N has recently (about 2 months ago) started dating K (23F) and as predicted is extremely obsessive with her ie. they moved in after dating for 2 weeks.  

Recently I invited my sister to come to my birthday dinner, she asked me who was attending so i let her know it was our dad, my boyfriend and her if she comes. she replys with ""ok cool me and K can come at said time."" I reply ""??? huh"" N continues with ""wdym?"" I say"" K isnt invited"" N:""why?""

Now little context i have met K three times and she has not said a word to me once, I introduced myself and she literally scoffed at me and walked away. first of all even if she was nice to me I dont want a random woman who I've met three times coming to my brithday dinner and second shes literally an asshole to me.

N continues to text me for about half an hour which i for the most part ignore (most of the messages were her making fun of my bf)  since i was busy her last message was ""whats your f-ing problem"" this is the message I responded with:

""You know what happens when you and K are together? you ignore literally everybody else and you guys sit there basically groping each other in public. Thats what my problem is, I dont want to be around that in general but especially for my birthday dinner.""

"AITA for insulting my husband when I was telling my mother in law how she failed her kids So When I (28f) first met my husband(30m) he didn‚Äôt know how to cook out side of making a sandwich nor how to work a washing machine 

Like his idea of washing the dishes was throwing away paper plates which was funny at first but when we got serious and moved into together I wanted to be his partner not his mom so I basically thought him basic human skills. Now I know what you‚Äôre thinking but his parents are so old school especially his mom they begged to pay for our wedding before we even moved into together so ‚Äúpeople wouldn‚Äôt talk‚Äù 

Fast forward to now we have two kids a girl five and a boy just gone two like my parents before me I‚Äôve thought my kids (age appropriate b4 anyone loses it) life skills as games and songs like 

The tidy up song 
The got ready for bed song 
The wake up song
The outside game 
The lost mommy/daddy game 

If you‚Äôre confused each game is basically a life skill like if god forbid my daughter got lost she knows to stand were she is and keep calling our names and a certain code word that only non crocodile people know. 


So onto the situation it was my sons birthday yesterday while everyone was over and my brother in law (my brothers husband) noticed that my son gave me his dirty plate and put his new toys in his toy box while doing singing. So I basically explained the tidy up game and how when my kids are done playing they put their toys in their boxes (each child has different boxes in the house/garden) 

I told him about the song and how I got him a toy washing machine/cleaning trolley/kitchen so while I‚Äôm cleaning/cooking he helps. I pointed out my son knows his colours and numbers because of this 

Most adults including FIl told me it was a good idea but my mother in law loudly said ‚Äúwell that‚Äôs one way to turn him into a f slur‚Äù 

I said ‚Äúexcuse me?‚Äù She said ‚ÄúI kept my mouth shut when you made my son clean like a woman but my I can‚Äôt stand back and watch you force my grandson to be gay‚Äù 

I bust out laughing at this stage and told her ‚Äúif any of my kids is gay this moma is flying the pride flag because on like her I‚Äôm not a bad mother who didn‚Äôt even teach her kids basic life skills‚Äù I went on about how my husband didn‚Äôt know anything about being an adult till he met me 


The kids were outside for all of this but the party ended soon after and my husband told me I humiliated him even tho he did nothing wrong I tried to explain but he just packed a bag and went with his parents",0.05

"AITA for saying I want to lose weight in front of my overweight coworker? I‚Äôm quite short (157cm or 5‚Äô2) and I have a small bone structure, so when I gain weight people don‚Äôt really notice but I notice it because it goes straight to my belly and back and my cellulite gets a lot more visible and it makes me very insecure. I‚Äôm really not the type of person to go around saying ‚Äúomg I need to lose weight‚Äù just to get people to say ‚Äúno you‚Äôre so skinny!!‚Äù but I still have a lotttt of insecurities, I don‚Äôt like my body shape and when I notice I‚Äôm starting to gain weight I try to hit the gym and eat healthier. 

The problem is that now my coworker (Mia) thinks I bullied her because I was talking to another coworker (Jamie) about fitness in general and I told Jamie I wanted to start going to the gym again to lose a little weight and look more fit and Mia happened to be there to hear it. She took that personally and later I got an email from our manager saying we needed to talk. He was trying to understand the situation and I was confused as hell, before this I hadn‚Äôt noticed Mia was there listening to the conversation and she didn‚Äôt talk to me about it at all, she went straight to my manager. She claimed I knew she was there and that I looked directly at her while saying that, which isn‚Äôt true at all and I had to even suggest that we look at cameras to prove I wasn‚Äôt looking at her. My manager said I shouldn‚Äôt talk about this topic anymore in the office and I had to apologize to Mia.

Ever since this happened she‚Äôs been giving me a hard time at work‚Ä¶ always giving me dirty looks, ignoring me when I‚Äôm talking to her, and even making comments in the break room while im eating like ‚Äúbe careful not to eat too much‚Äù and then laughs.

"AITA for not paying for the cat? Hello! My fiance (25M) and I (26F) wanted some clarification on who was right/wrong in this scenario. I wanna preface by saying we have a great relationship, we love each other. This is not really an argument, we just want to see what reddit thinks!

So my partner (Clive) wanted a cat. We don't live together, but do plan to within the next year, so obviously I had to be on board too. I was excited about it! After a bit of hunting and research, Clive ended up adopting (a veryyyyy cute) little kitty called Duck. I love Duck SO much. I understand and empathise now with new parents who get worried when their baby farts too many times. I visit Duck (and Clive) about once a week (as my job is quite busy, and I live a little far from them), and I think Duck knows me now. 

The conflict is because Clive is feeling the hit of the up front costs of having a new cat (buying carrier, toys, bed, adoption and vet fees etc) and has requested I chip in 50-50 for care of Duck. We both make reasonable money, and he does have enough money to care for Duck. It won't hurt me to chip in, either. HOWEVER, my opinion is that Duck is (at the moment) HIS cat. Duck lives with him, not with me, so I don't really get the full (or even half) benefit of having a cat. He also didn't tell me before getting Duck that he wanted me to chip in. I would be okay helping out now and then, or if he was having trouble affording it, because I love Duck. I will definitely be looking after Duck once we are married/moved in and our finances merged. 

Ultimately, my side is that I don't think Duck is my cat yet - Duck is MY PARTNER'S cat, whom I also love. His side is that we are engaged, and Duck is OUR cat (we picked him up together and made sure Duck liked both of us before he adopted) and he plans to put me as co-owner on the certificate (I'm not particularly bothered). 

I don't really mind chipping in, and I think I will do so regardless of judgement, but I do sort of want to know if I'm in the wrong on this. So AITA? Thanks and a have a good day!",0.7
"AITA for refusing to pay for bills my boyfriend and his sons should be paying for? A little back story first. My bf (51m) and I (43f) have been dating for over two years. Last December we moved in together and along came his adult sons (25 and 19).  We told them that come May 1st they would be paying their portion of the rent plus $150 for cleaning after them and they‚Äôd also be paying their portion of the utilities and internet bill.  Yesterday we did a spot check to make sure they were following the rules and they weren‚Äôt.  Even though pot is legal here in Canada neither my bf nor I want to have bongs in the house. Not only that, we signed a leases where it specifically says no smoking/vaping of any kind. So I bagged the bongs and put them in my car. The 19yr old flipped his lid and threatened to hold his rent if he didn‚Äôt get his bongs back because they‚Äôre his property and then threatened with coming into our bedroom and taking something from us to see how we liked it.  I did give him back his bongs and told him I expected his rent to be paid on time, which he did today.  We weren‚Äôt able to talk to the oldest in person because he wasn‚Äôt home but he apologized for his mess and did as he was asked and has been ok, so far.  Last night I put a lock on my door. My bf was resistant but I did it anyway.  Today they‚Äôve transferred me the rent but not anything extra as was discussed.  I feel like I shouldn‚Äôt have had to pay for their portion of the utilities when it‚Äôs 1 of me and 3 of them.",0.14

"AITA for showing my friend a private story post about her family? Context: I am 17F, this involves 2 friends (M 18, and E 16) and their siblings who married eachother. 

I have classes with M and E, and I‚Äôm fairly close with both of them. I saw on M‚Äôs snapchat story hinting that her sister wanted a divorce from E‚Äôs brother. 
Later in the day, when I saw E, I asked her how her brother was, figuring she knew about it. She didn‚Äôt. She asked to see the post, so I showed it to her. That‚Äôs where I might be TA, because it was a private snapchat story post, and I betrayed my friends trust. 
E confronted M, and M sent me a long text about me betraying her trust. Apparently it was a joke I didn‚Äôt get. (I have autism. high functioning but still, social queues aren‚Äôt a thing for me unless ur on the floor bawling)

"AITA for using my roommate‚Äôs iPhone charger when she‚Äôs gone For context I‚Äôve had a 39 degree fever for the past week and the only source of entertainment has been my phone. My charger broke and I joked about my phone probably being evil and breaking every charger it touches. Either way I wasn‚Äôt able to leave the house to buy a new one since I‚Äôm still sick with a sore throat. 

Later my college roommate came home and asked if I had borrowed her charger which I told her I did. She got mad at me and told me to not use it again. Am I the asshole for doing so in the first place? We usually share everything from clothes to food and the underlying assumption is that borrowing is ok. We share a room so no entering of private space was necessary to retrieve charger, I simply saw it plugged in next to my laptop and hooked my phone on it as I was typing on my laptop.

"AITA for wanting teenage roommate to move out? Hello all. 

My girlfriend (21) & I (M22) have lived together since December 2021. We started struggling with bills for the first 3 months, so we decided to look into getting a roommate. 'Emily' (F18) has been our coworker for the last 5 months. We weren't very close, but we got along enough that we would talk during shifts.

Emily has a lot of family issues, and that's why we offered her the room at our place. Before she moved in, we told her she'd have to stay in the living room until we made more space for her. We believed that this situation was an emergency, so everything happened within the matter of a week. After living with us for 3 weeks, she mentioned how she wanted to take a gap year to become independent, & we said we wouldn't mind. 

Things started going downhill. We live in a not super safe neighborhood, and it started off with her not locking the front door. It would be left unlocked over night, and this neighborhood has a history with break ins so we're very cautious. We've had to remind her to lock the door at least 5 times.

There was also one night, where she ended up going for a drive without paying attention where she was going. We'd just gotten off work and were extremely tired. She called GF at 11 to say she didn't know where she was and that she was ""3 minutes away."" Whenever Emily shared her location with us, she was actually 30 minutes away & in a different state. GF told Emily that it was best if she called her parents, because our cars both weren't doing too well. GF also has anxiety about driving on the interstate & my license is expired. GF told her there were people (Road-Side Assistance or insurance company) she could call to help since we couldn't. Instead, she decided to drive on a flat tire for 20 minutes. She tried to guilt trip us with the fact that she had to use the restroom so badly that she had pissed her pants. We were out on the interstate until 4 AM, and luckily received help from a stranger. She apologized, but asked if we could take her to the tire shop the next day. This was the beginning of her treating us like parents. We had a discussion with her about this, but nothing changed.

Anytime GF or I would leave our bedroom, she'd instantly leave her room to start trauma dumping about her family issues, depression, etc. She'd also come into our bedroom & sit in GF's spot anytime she wasn't sitting next to me, including one time when she almost fell asleep in our bed.

Emily's cleanliness is the worst part of everything. She never showers. Ever. She also doesn't clean up after herself. We've tried nicely telling her to rinse off her dishes, or to not leave food sitting out. GF had to go through the living room to get mail one morning, and the smell of Emily's living space was so bad, she had to keep from gagging. It smelled like a rotting body. 

GF and I just want an outside perspective.

So Reddit, we're asking, are we the assholes for wanting her to move out?",0.04

"AITA for not wanting my grandma to come see my sick mom? So, my (F19) mom (F47) has been in cancer treatment for a few months. Somedays she's fine, somedays she can't even get out of bed. My grandma (F75) lives in another state and wants to come stay with my mom, but that's where the problem starts.

My grandma lives in a pretty small country town where she knows everyone and can do pretty much everything by herself. But me and my family live in a big city, so everytime my grandma comes my mom always goes out with her and never lets her go out alone. My mom would always go buy her stuff to eat and even send money to her aunt to pay my grandma's bills. My grandma is a sweetheart but she's just too naive to walk around alone like that. She also doesn't do well with my state's weather, she lives in a very hot place and it's very cold here so her health can also become a problem here due to that.

In a normal or at least a little better situation it would be totally fine for her to come, but now, with my mom herself barely being able to go out on her own, I just feel like having my grandma here would only make things even more difficult.

You see, I'm disabled (full time wheelchair user) so I wouldn't be able to do much for grandma either, my dad works all day, and even my paternal grandpa who lives here and could be the one to help couldn't do much right now because on top of it all my great-grandma (grandpa's mom) is also sick so my grandpa has been spending a lot of time in the hospital with her.

For all the reasons I said, it's also not like my grandma would be able to even help us much, so I'm just like, she's gonna come here and then what? It would basically be another person to be taken care of instead.

My dad keeps saying I need to understand my grandma's side and that any mom would want to be there for their sick child, and I said I truly understand her feeling, but I just feel like letting her come would only cause more stress and worry for all of us. And my mom doesn't want her to come either for the same reasons I said, so in a situation where is impossible to please both sides, I honestly believe my mom's feelings and wishes are the most important right now.

So, AITA?",0.15
"AITA for not bringing a disabled woman‚Äôs order to her car because she doesn‚Äôt tip   Tough week. So I (24f) am in college, getting ready to take my exams and graduate soon. To pay for some of my living expenses I work part time at a locally owned restaurant. Our restaurant does not offer curbside pickup, the owner has repeatedly said it‚Äôs up to whoever working if they want to bring it out or not. In order to offer curbside pickup the owner would have to provide us with raincoats, which he doesn‚Äôt care to do. Sometimes to be nice though, myself or some other employees might bring an order to someone‚Äôs car. 

This older women in her 60s is disabled and ordered from here last month. I brought her order out to her car that day, and when she mentioned how happy she was that we were willing to bring it to her car, since she‚Äôs disabled and most places in town won‚Äôt do curbside, I made sure to tell her that we aren‚Äôt required and next time whoever‚Äôs working might not bring it out, but that I was glad to do it that day. 

Since then she‚Äôs ordered from us twice, one other time a coworker brought it out, and then another time I brought it out. Well, she ordered from us again last night. She‚Äôs a nice enough lady but she never tips, which I would overlook except she‚Äôs ordering 40$ single person meals. IMO if you can afford to  frequently splurge on nice dinners for yourself you can afford a dollar or two to whoever is going the extra mile to make your life easier. 

Last night it was raining and cold out, and I was the only person working the front. When she called to say she was there for her order, I politely let her know that since it‚Äôs raining I wouldn‚Äôt be going out. She kind of yelled at me, saying that she‚Äôs disable how is she supposed to come get it? I told her that we do not offer curbside pick up, and that she was previously made aware of it. She asked to speak to a manger, who refused to give her a refund. He explained to her that the food was already made, and that we do not offer curbside and she knew that. One of the kitchen guys ended up eating her lobster. 

When I told my husband about my day he said should have helped the old lady, and that I was an asshole for not doing so. I didn‚Äôt want to work out the rest of my shift in soaked cold clothes for someone that can‚Äôt even be bothered to tip. Based off her new Range Rover and frequent lobster I assume she could afford to tip at least something.

"AITA for reporting and pressing charges on my brother and mother So my great grandma had passed away 1 year ago and my grandma had offered to sell her house to my husband and I because we were about to have a baby. She was going to sell it to us in a rent to own type situation. Well my great grandma's house was a giant storage unit for all of her children grand children and great grand children. 

When we moved in everyone in the family came and got their things except for my brother and mother. 
This is an issue because I am no contact with both of them. We moved their stuff to the garage and shed as it filled the entire garage and shed. We have been asking for over a year if they will get their shit so we can utilize the space for our cars and tools. They have said they will come over multiple times to get things but only end up moving them around and never taking them. They spend hours doing this. Well my husband and I had plans for today and got told they were coming 30 minutes before they showed up. I had asked for a 24 hour notice and was told that my grandma gave them permission so it was not needed. So instead I told them they had until 6:30 to get off the property or I will press charges for trespassing. 

This was matched with a slew of messages from my grandma, mother, and brother all freaking out on me saying that they had a legal right to do it because my grandma still owns the house. I buckled down and said I was not given a 24 hour notice and I now have to change my plans to make sure they have access to the garage and shed. My brother and mother then made a fake Facebook profile and threatened my husband's and my life. So I went to the police and filed a report and am going to the court to get a restraining order tomorrow. My grandma is beside herself and doesn't understand why I couldn't be reasonable and let them take their time getting things out today and why I had to report my brother and mother for threatening us.

"AITA for not going into detail with what I would like to eat. To summarize the situation, I have endometriosis. I had a huge flare up today and asked my husband to pick up dinner. Anything, whatever we wanted. He wants Publix subs. I don't care, that's fine. 

He wants me to now explain exactly what sub I want. I don't care. I'm sick, in pain, puking. Whatever works. He is very upset I don't know exactly what I want. I tell him to get 2x of whatever he gets. He claims I won't like it. I tell him I do. Not. Care. 

I tell him get literally whatever I just don't want to worry about dinner. He is on and on asking me exactly what I want. I say daily deal.

He says they might not have one. So I say some random sandwich. He wants to know exactly what I now want on it. I keep trying to explain idgaf I just want him to handle dinner. He knows the exact food I like. He knows I'm not a picky eater at all. I want him to just take the lead and decide. I'll accept and eat it even if I don't like it and I've said it numerous times. Feels like he's just being difficult for no reason at all. 

Am I the asshole for asking him to handle dinner then being expected to plan all of it down to every detail and just not having the energy to plan every detail out?

"AITA for not updating my bf on my day? My bf and I are in a LDR and we talk everyday. Once a week I go home from college and visit my parents.

My husband and I were in the midst of cleaning up after dinner when I showed him the new song by Lizzo, About Damn Time.

"AITA For Telling My More Religious Peers Inviting Me to Bible Studies To Fuck Off? I am suffering from loneliness, but I am coping well, between the tragedies that befell me in past years and the work that I must do to survive in this world. I like taking walks in the park to think about things and to exercise whenever I have downtime. It helps me cope with my loneliness.

So two gentlemen approach me, probably fellow students on campus, and ask how I was doing. I replied that I was fine, and they stated that I ""looked lonely"", which I affirmed as accurate. They then attempted to invite me to bible studies, and I was absolutely livid because this isn't the first time I was solicited with such an offer. It happens occasionally.

I told them how disgusting and seemingly ""un-Christian"" they were to offer me friendship on the condition of me attending their meetings and assumingly entertaining the notions of Christianity. I am more or less a devout agnostic. I called them ""holier than thou, sanctimonious assholes"", and asked them ""Why is that your idea of generosity is dependent on me being Christian? I am lonely, and you are not willing to be my friend unless I became Christian? Fuck off."" They told me to cool down, and then left.

I have no issue with people being religious, but from my view, it seems predatory to look at this person, who they assume to be suffering from loneliness, and thinking ""Yeah, let's recruit him"" or ""he needs Jesus to be happy"". 

Now, I don't know much if anything about Christianity, I was just angry that someone portrayed themselves as being concerned for my wellbeing, while simultaneously being unwilling to do anything because I wasn't willing to be Christian. From my understanding, if someone saw someone else suffering from loneliness, the most charitable and thus most Christian thing to do from my understanding would be to be their friend without foisting their religion.

On the other hand, I did lose my cool telling them my own feelings on that matter. Did I misunderstand their intentions, or their religion? Is there more to these folks then I give them credit for? I am seeing therapy about my issues, but I don't feel completely wrong regarding my point here.",0.71

So it just occurred to me today that Mother‚Äôs Day is this Sunday. I have been very out of it this year for a lot of different reasons, so I‚Äôm not surprised this snuck up on me. 

For backstory, our family consists of me, my husband, his two kids (9M & 8F) and our daughter (3F). My husband‚Äôs ex-wife is, to put it bluntly, a toxic narcissist. She has made it her mission to ruin my husband‚Äôs life since he left her. She has successfully made a lot of horrible things happen to him and has put our family through hell. I don‚Äôt want to go into details, but I guess if anyone feels it‚Äôs important for the story, I can include a few of the worst. 

To make a long story short, she makes co-parenting an absolute nightmare and we interact with her as little as possible. We don‚Äôt go out of our way to do anything nice for her unless we are doing it for our own benefit. While, I‚Äôm not proud to admit it, I‚Äôm a petty bitch, so as long as no harm would come to the kids, I go out of my way to annoy her. 

All that being said, I really don‚Äôt want to do anything with the kids for her for Mother‚Äôs Day. My husband feels the same. We want to do crafts and presents for our mothers, and I think my husband is planning something for me for when they come back to our house on Monday. 

Maybe this makes us horrible people, but I don‚Äôt know. I genuinely never thought I could hate a human being, but I hate this woman with every fiber of my soul. I know I‚Äôm biased. I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs a good mother, so I don‚Äôt think she deserves it.

When she turned her back to walk away we noticed how her dress was riding up and the bottom of her butt was showing. It was a really tight, form fitting dress.

I told her and Melody yanked it down and said thank you but she sounded irritated. When she got back from the bathroom she was mumbling under her breath about she can‚Äôt just wear a nice outfit without getting criticized and how she can‚Äôt feel good about herself. 

I told her I was just being nice and it wasn‚Äôt personal and that a real friend would let you know if your ass was hanging out of your dress.

I‚Äôve spoken to him many times about this and he continues to do it. I‚Äôm of the philosophy that everyone has quirks and sometimes living with someone means you have to put the metaphorical toothpaste cap on the tube. So, I would put things away for him. I did this for a few reasons: 1. Mess 2. We have kids and I don‚Äôt want them to get sick. 3. Food wastage. I have been, however; always reminding him when I did it. I didn‚Äôt want to nag, but I also didn‚Äôt want to further enable the behaviour. Recently, I got really frustrated and I stopped. I would take note of what was on the counter and make sure that if it reappeared in the fridge or freezer that I would not feed it to the kids or myself. I gave him fair warning I would be doing this. He started to notice things on the counter and would ask how long they had been out. I would give him my best guess, but I also wasn‚Äôt keeping track. After a few days of this, I would just shrug. No idea. 

Well, he got sick. We don‚Äôt know for sure if it was food poisoning, but that‚Äôs my guess because no one else got sick. He‚Äôs pretty upset about it.

"AITA for telling a 9 yo on the internet to stop bothering me with her issues? (on mobile so shitty formatting)
So I (14M) run a small animation youtube channel. I am friends with some larger youtubers, and sometimes they tell their friends to check my channel out. Recently (21 days ago) a girl named ‚ÄúAsami‚Äù messaged me on discord, saying ‚Äúhi i‚Äôm asami! i‚Äôm 9 years old and i came from our friend Bee‚Äôs youtube  channel‚Äù.

 I didn‚Äôt want to respond back, but since she was a friends friend, i responded, and reported her for being underage on discord.

I said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a lot older than you, and I might not talk to you much.‚Äù and she said it was fine. 

I didn‚Äôt talk to her for a few days, and then she just sent a whole ass vent paragraph in our dms. I didn‚Äôt and still don‚Äôt know why a 9 yo would share their vent with a random dude on the internet, but I responded and tried to make her feel better. I did this bcs she is 9. I also asked her to not send me another vent. She didn‚Äôt listen.

This went on for a few days, and I ended up getting annoyed.

She hasn‚Äôt responded yet, but she clearly saw it because she talked to Bee about it. Now I feel terrible but I still don‚Äôt feel I was in the wrong because I had already stated that I didn‚Äôt want her to vent in our dms anymore, mainly because she was 9 and because we didn‚Äôt know eachother.

"AITA for exposing my sister when she made a joke about my miscarriage? Am i the asshole for exposing my sister after she makes a joke about my miscarriage? I(28F) told my parents about my sister (25F) and what she did in her teenage years. We come from a very strict Asian household, so our teenage years was filled with the expectation that we study and read the bible all the time. My sister was a troublesome and rebellious child but she ended up doing a great job hiding that from our parents. Throughout her teenage years, she would always sneak to go to parties, smoke weed, has sex, and drinks alcohol. Sometimes, I would be tired from all the pressure and go in with her. My sister is still that kind of person, and she always expects me to cover for her despite our parents thinking she is this perfect christian child. 

Today I told our parents everything about what my sister did, and needless to say they are livid. I got married about 2 years ago to a great man, and i recently had a miscarriage. I was devastated and thought i could never have a child again because i could never love them as much as i did to the one that is now gone. I cry about it everyday, and it has caused me thousands of therapy money. My sister knows this as she would always comfort me about it and be there for me. 


My in-laws hosted a dinner party and my whole family was invited. Things were going well, till my mother in law thought it was a good idea to bring up children. My sister opened up her stupid mouth and said ""Well it never works out the first time. Lets hope you dont make the mistake again or you'd be famous for killing babies!""  the whole table went silent. My heart shut down. As a response i said ""Youre the one who killed all those babies for getting abortions from being such a whore in highschool."" My parents were confused and i explained everything to them. Everyone at the party left early and my sister hates my fucking guts. My parents are extremely close to disowning her. They threw out her stuff and trashed her house and everything. My parents dont even want to talk to me. My husband thinks what i did is wrong. Everybody hates me. Am i the asshole?",0.85

"AITA for NOT baking a baby shower cake? Some background: I am not a professional baker, I have been enjoying myself while learning how to bake over the last year and I have found a passion for a certain type of cookie... 

I shared this information with the staff of a coffee shop inside my local grocery store where I go often and we are on friendly terms. One of the staff members asked me to make them a treat I had never heard of a few months back so I took the challenge and made something called Ooey Gooey Butter Cake Bars. It turned out pretty good, but not really my thing, the staff member really enjoyed it though. 

Fast forward to a month ago, same staff member asked me to make her a cake for her baby shower in July. I explained to her that I had only once made a real cake and that was a carrot cake. We talked about the theme, she is doing a Bob's Burger theme and wanted the cake to have something to do with the show, btw I have not watched the show but know what it is. She discussed the cake looking like a burger with the inside being red velvet but I was not confident that I could do anything like that and we discussed making some cupcakes that look like burgers she said she would do. I told her I would need to take a look at the show and see what I could come up with and would let her know. 

A couple weeks passed and I had not seen her at work, I do not have her number, but I discussed my ideas with some of the other staff, I was going to do a pink lemonade cake (she wanted pink because she is having a girl) with vanilla buttercream frosting smoothed out to look like the white aprons Bob and his wife both wear on the show, I was also going to figure out how to make a pocket with a pen in it on the top as that is what they have on the show. Not sure what else I was going to do as I have never decorated a cake but I wanted to get some feedback and I made a test cake for her taste.

Couple weeks ago I saw her at work and she immediately went into how she didn't want what I was making and she wanted the cake to look like a burger. I was confused as I thought she was doing the cupcakes as burgers, she wanted the cake to also be a burger. I tried explaining to her that I would have no clue where to even start and that I am not a professional cake decorator or someone on one of the many cake shows. She said it would be easy and if I knew how to pipe frosting I should be able to do it. Again I tried to explain that I make cookies, and brownies, not cakes and that I was just doing this as a favor. She is still trying to tell me how to do a burger cake and I had it and told her to do it herself then. I was not going to spend time trying to teach myself how to make something like she wanted and she needed to hire a professional. I tried apologizing but she is obviously mad and cold to me now.

"AITA for breaking it off with my friend? About 2 months back I broke it off with my best friend, we'll call him Gideon. I did this because he had been doing stuff to make me extremely uncomfortable. I've spoke with him about this at least 5 times always telling him ""If you wanna do it then avoid doing it around me, I don't like that type of stuff."" He would completely ignore me and continue moaning and calling me daddy, Continuing on with his problematic sexual-ness. I found a plastic frog on the ground once and took it home. Later on however, he got his own frog and would make it r*PE the toy frog. I tried ignoring this but then he started taking interest in my emails he would ask to see them but I always told him no. I went to take a bathroom break during math class once and he had took my Chromebook and looked through my emails and even wrote down my mom's email, I had fucking had it with this person. So I went back to an old friend that Gideon and I hated. I saw that he had changed from what he previously had been doing, he acted nice and respectful and still has been to this day. His friend and I wanted to get revenge on Gideon. So we got dirt on him and I told him to erase my mom's email from his computer or I would share all the dirt with his parents, he started telling people I was an asshole and spreaded rumors. Later on I found out he made lies about the person we used to hate (let's call him Jack). So knowing that he didn't have an oculus quest I sent him a taunting picture saying ""No Oculus quest?"" He then proceeded to spread more rumors and started harassing me through emails.

"AITA for taking back a signed guitar when my friend didn't pay me back for the concert ticket 6 months ago my friend and I got an opportunity to buy limited edition (only 1 package sold) VIP tickets to see an artist we both loved. It cost alot at the time and since I had the funds I told him I would buy it if he paid me back by the show, no interest of course. We initially agreed on bi-weekly payments to make it easy for him and not overburden his finaces, but before we even got to the first payment he texted and asked if he could just pay me in total after the holidays (~2 months) and I agreed. He never reached out and 3 months in I asked him for a payment and he sent what he could, about half, and told me he'd have the rest by the show. He had ensured me multiple times before the show he would be able to pay me. One of the perks for the show was we received a signed guitar the artist played on stage. We initially agreed he could keep the guitar if I got the remaing merch, but when we arrived they told us they would give us double of all the merch items. At the end of the night he kept the guitar because he was lookign foward to it. I reached out a week later and asked about the payment for the tickets and he told me he couldn't pay me but he'd try, then later sent about 1/3 of what he still owed me. When I had texted him I was actually at his apartment hanging out with his roommate¬π, his roommate told me he actually owed his other roommate¬≤ money aswell and my friend never payed him back. I was honesty angry because he had reassued me so many times he would pay me before the show and roommate¬≤ isn't the confrentational type and just let the debt slide for 8 months. This is where I may be the asshole, I went into my friends room and took the guitar back. I went home that night and the next day received an angry call from my friend furious I invaded his privacy and stole the guitar. I told him once he payed me what he owed we could talk about the value of the guitar and either I could buy it from him and keep it or he could buy it from me and I'll give it back. We where both pretty heated and angrily agreed to talk about the guitar once he paid his debt to me. So reddit am I the asshole for taking the guitar back after my friend didn't pay me?

 I also want him to pay roommate¬≤ back but roommate¬π suggested I should let that be between the two of them to figure out.",0.76
"AITA For thinking that my Brother should explain to my neice that her mother doesn't want to be in her life? So here's the stitch, my brother (38) has a 13 y/o  daughter who has been in and out of the foster system because of her behavioral health and her mother's lack of wanting to deal with the child.
My niece ""C"" wants so desperately to be in her mother's life but her mother wants absolutely nothing to do with her.  She goes as far as pushing her away physically and ignoring her. While she wants to play off that she's a good mommy(she's not) and as a third person I see the hurt that it brings ""C"" she doesn't have a female figure in her life to help her with those puberty issues or boy issues. General teenager things. I recently suggested that he sit ""C"" down and try to talk to her so that she doesn't get hurt in the long run.


EDIT:: My brother was never awarded custody of  ""C"" prior to this year. He, and the rest of our family were calling the state everyday to try to bring my niece home. But as mentioned in the comments, her mother lied to the state and said that no one in the family wanted ""C"". Brother was recently awarded full custody of ""C"" in Dec. But he has been letting his child get hurt emotionally by letting her interact with her Mother. 

I suggested that he sit down and talk to her and his only response was ""She'll figure it out on her own.""",0.56
"AITA for cursing my parents at my anniversary party I'm going to try to keep this as short as I can. My parents have never accepted my wife. When we were dating, they were mad. When I proposed, they were mad. When I got married, they were mad. Where they see shortcomings of hers, I choose to see positives. They don't like that she didn't go to college, I don't care. They're mad she has tattoos(small), I don't care. They're mad she likes to party, I'm right there with her. 

We celebrated our 1 year anniversary last week with family( hers) and friends. I was asked to make a speech, and I told her how much I loved her, how much she means to me, how incredible I think she is. I thanked her parents & the crew of friends for their support. Because there was an obvious elephant in the room, I decided to semi-address it. I chose to try to make a larger point. I said that, in life, you can't make everyone happy and that you have to figure out who the important people are in your life are, the people you want to make happy and who the unimportant people are. I finished with saying that, when it comes to the unimportant people, fuck 'em.

Some people afterwards came up to me and said it was a great speech, albeit raw. Other people were really put off with how I ended it. My wife shrugged it off as me just saying how I feel.

"AITA for defying my fianc√©? We‚Äôre getting married in later this year and we just bought a house.  Tensions are high. 

The other day he walked into my office, we chatted for a bit. Then he saw that the desk chair was directly on the carpet and not the mat thingy. It was that way because i was moving the room around. He asked me to put the chair on the mat thing. 

I said I didn‚Äôt have time, stupid response sure. I was stressed out with work, on the verge of a breakdown and didn‚Äôt think it was that big of a deal. 

When I said no, he got all pissed because how dare I do something that is going to destroy the carpet. I am a sloppy maniac who can‚Äôt take care of anything nice. 

Later, I saw a tree blowing outside the window. I told him to look at it in case we want someone to come take it down. His response ‚Äúmaybe if we‚Äôre lucky it will fall on your office and we‚Äôll be able to replace the carpet you just destroyed.‚Äù

"AITA For refusing to spend my weekends taking care of my mother Most of the kids have moved out of home except for my brother (single M53), we all have our own families and I also work some (not all) weekends so when I have a free weekend, I want to enjoy it, occasionally making the drive down to see mum (F80) but not to specifically take care of her.

My eldest sister (F59) works part time and looks after mum 2 days a week, the second sister (F55) who also works part time looks after mum 2 days a week and the brother who doesn't work looks after her the remaining 3 days.

So all 3 complained that that I who works full time 50 hours Mon-Fri and also full time on some weekends should spend my weekends off to give my brother a break thus reducing his load to 2 days. I said no for the following reasons:

1) She fully qualifies for nursing care and they refuse to hire/appoint a nurse as it would be a stranger in her house.

2) She would be much healthier and better taken care of in a nursing home and right now she spends her day mainly in bed as they don't let her get out of bed for fear of her falling.

3) Both sisters only work part time and the brother has been unemployed for decades (he had a job decades ago but had been living off govt for decades), so they actually have alot of free time.

4) (This is where I think I may be a TA) My brother recently made her sign over ALL her assets to him l as in his own words he looks after her and deserves it as he has to put up with her 7 days a week (even though the sisters look after her for 2 days each). 

So in my opinion he wants her over $1 Mil in assets he has to work for it by looking after her or agree to option 1 or 2 above which I have been insisting on.",0.33
"AITA for not giving my ex-friend her dress back? Back in 2017, a then-friend of mine gave me a dress to borrow for a high school dance (I graduated university a year ago now). After the event; she told me I could keep the dress.

The last time we talked was a fight on New Year's Eve 2021, 5 months ago, and even though I was open to repairing the relationship, she officially said she doesn't want any contact and unfollowed me on all social media mid March 2022. 

She is now messaging me asking me to return this dress I borrowed 5 years ago, because she told someone they could borrow it, and giving it back is the least I can do. She lives almost an hours drive and wants me to drop it off. AITA if I don't give it back? Also, what do you think the motive is for her contacting me for this dress after SHE chose to cut me off?

üö®UPDATEüö® she ended up texting me more and even calling me (I let it ring out) and I decided to just give it back. I drove the 1hr 48 minute round trip to her house, left it folded in a bag on her doorknob, and sent her a venmo request for $10, which I think is reasonable for gas/effort.

"WIBTA if I didn't tell my mom I was sending my dog over the rainbow bridge? My dog, Lizzie, is 14 years old. She was diagnosed with dementia 2 years ago but has been rapidly declining the last few weeks. The vet knows it's time, and so do I and my mom.

I've had Liz half my life. My mom bought her for the family when I was 14 but she chose me as her person, so even though she was a 'family pet' she has always been /mine/. 

For the last 7 years, Liz has been solely my responsibility. She started going blind about 6 years ago, and her hearing has diminished in the last year or so alongside her cognitive function. Nowadays she spends the vast majority of her day asleep, she's often stressed if alone or in large spaces, her housetraining is gone, she gets lost if left alone and will do circle until she falls over from dizziness, she doesn't sit with me anymore and mostly takes herself to our room and sleeps by herself - she's only ever really comfortable when she's sleeping. 

Though she's healthy in other ways (weight, eating/drinking, organ functionality), the overall quality of her life isn't there anymore. So, again, my mom and I agree that the time is now before she's even more scared and confused or can't recognize us at all.

This brings me to my dilemma, I really feel like I have to do this alone. I don't know if I can deal with my mom's emotions and my own. I have a hard time being vulnerable in front of others, so I often won't let myself feel my emotions if I'm not alone, so I have asked a more neutral but supportive party to take me on Monday or Tuesday instead of my mom (who would be working if that's relevant). I have mostly come to my decision and am now just trying to find peace with it.

My mom loves Liz, I know she does, and she wants what's best for her so this isn't a matter of whether or not my mom agrees that this is the next step. But I wonder if I'm being selfish by taking away (or hoarding?) The opportunity to say goodbye. If I told her I had come to my decision I am pretty certain she would want to go, but again, I just feel like I need to do it privately.

So, WIBTA if I didn't tell my mom?

If it makes a difference I'm not planning to tell anyone beforehand, including my siblings who also grew up with her. They cared for her but never had the same interest/bond with Liz, which isn't a judgment on them - it's just the reality. They are also both aware of Liz's situation, though neither of them live in the same state as me and our mom.",0.9
"WIBTA for demanding my parents teach me to drive so I'm wondering if I'm going to be acting entitled or anything and needed outside opinions before I  do anything. So I  have a visual impairment and because of that didn't know I  could drive until 2020 when I  was 21, so in 2021 I  went and got my permit at the urging and eencouragment of my parents (spent about 100-120 USD having to uber there pay for it etc) I  then had a driving instructor for two lessons but those stopped as it was far too expensive to drive with a paid teacheer and my step dad took up the mantle of teaching me to drive. While he and my mom seemed really into it for a while the driving time quickly stopped (went from every other day to once a week to twice a MONTH if im lucky) now they complain about having to drive me places and my step dad complains about being the only one who can take me driving annd how he doesn't have time to do it giving me a timeframe of goinng at 6am-7:30 only and of course not on weekends. I've asked my mom to take me which she outright refuses saying ""no I  won't take you"" my steep dad is leaving the country for a few months so what little skill I  have will backpedal quickly and I've tried to ask my bio dad to take me and he didn't respond. Would I  be acting entitled to say to one of my bio parents to step up to the plate and actually help me learn to drive? 

some extra info is that they routinely say to just uber but I  can not afford to do that workinga minnmum wage job it costs at least 20 usd to get to my job from my home and double that to get from work to school.

additionally they're telling me to get a full time job but I  know they would get upset because it doesn't align with their schedules. 

they constantly complain about having to take me to school/work and theen play the victim wheen I  tell them it's on them for being flakes on helping me drive. 

no I  can't afford to pay for a teacher (I  make about 1k-1200 after tax and mostly use that to go towards student loans/medical/vet bills), and my friends also work retail with irregular schedules (and one of them has routinely been cancelling/not replying in reards to any plans)",0.93

"AITA for refusing to interact with my classmates during a birthday celebration? This happened a few years ago but i still think about it from time to time. I (F19 at the time) was studying English in a language school in Johannesburg, South Africa with my brothers.

I was the only Brazilian in a small class with students from Europe around my age. I was trying my best to take the initiative and make friends, talking to my colleagues and sharing common interests, but i guess we just didn't vibe.

It felt a bit isolating during class, because they were very chatty among themselves. I wasn't lonely, since i had my brothers and the friendly staff to talk to during breaks. My teacher noticed that i felt left out in class though and applied many activities to invite interaction, which was kind of her.

At a certain time, some of the opinions my colleagues had during debates and discussions really bothered me and painted them in a different light in my mind. From that point on, i lost the will to talk to them casually, except for conversation exercises and greetings.

One day, a student in my class had a birthday, so the teacher wanted to take us to a caf√© to commemorate. I knew i wouldn't have a good time and i wanted to keep the interactions with my classmates to a polite minimum. But i didn't want to embarrass my teacher and stop the class from going to the caf√© because of me. I asked my teacher in private if it'd be a fast lunch. She said it should take less than two hours. So i went with them and the teacher.  

It was a very nice place, but full and noisy. We ordered and waited. They were having a fun time chatting and laughing loudly in their group. I was feeling very anxious because of the noise and how i felt i was invading this moment by just being there. Since i had nothing else to do, i decided to read a book. Reading at least helped me focus on something. It were very long two hours.

After class, my teacher called me to talk. She explained to me that it was not appropriate of me to bury myself in a book while a social event was happening. My introversion broke the atmosphere and my classmates felt uncomfortable because of it. I said i was sorry and i would try to be more engaging next time. In actuality, i just kept my distance and was relieved whenever class ended.

I understand where my teacher comes from. It really wasn't nice of me and my actions could be read as arrogant and anti-social. I wouldn't like to have a lunch among friends and one of them didn't talk to us the whole time. But then, i would only invite only my close friends and not people I'm not in friendly terms with. On the other hand, i could put more effort in getting out of my shell and be more warm, since it was someone's special day. Or even be more stubborn and not go to the party like a doormat. I'm trying to grow as a person and learn how to deal better with situations like this one, both respecting my boundaries and not hurting others.

My cousin had gotten in contact about a year ago with her ex and they started hanging out a lot. The way they got in contact was because her ex‚Äôs mom posted him on facebook and she decided to search him up on instagram but in my phone and she texted him on my acc. They decided to go out and ‚Äútalk‚Äù and she immediately went and got ready.

She told me about their date and then she went to bed, the next day when i woke up she told me she had stayed up till 3am on facetime with him and i was shocked because she never did that with her bf. She continued going out with her ex while lying to her bf about what she was doing and she made me promise to not tell anyone and i didn‚Äôt.

"AITA for being annoyed and tired? I (32F) moved in with my bf (29M) 12 days ago.  I have a 14 year old cat and he has a 6 year old dog.  We decided that the guest room would also be my office (I work from home) and the cats room.  The dog would never be allowed in there.  After the first couple days, we developed a good routine were we each take care of our own pets, except for me letting the dog outside once or twice during the day.   
 This is because the first couple mornings, since I always wake up first, I was dealing with a VERY hyper dog, and a cat that was screaming for his breakfast while I was also trying to get my coffee and shower, while my bf was still asleep.  

Three days ago, my bf tested positive for the dreaded illness (with symptoms).  Since I tested negative, I moved into the guest room.  But, I've also had to take over care of the dog too.  It's totally fine, I have no problem with that.  I like the dog, and it's not like my bf got sick on purpose lol.  The last few days have just been an adjustment.  I'm not used to sleeping in the guest room, my cat isn't used to the house yet and therefore paces a lot and keeps me up, and the dog doesn't like the fact that he has to sleep in the living room, and stands outside of the bedroom doors pacing and whining.  Between that and working, and taking care of any of my bf's needs, I'm kind of tired.  So, earlier, the dog was driving me crazy being hyper and, although I didn't yell, I did kind of snap loudly at him to go lay down.

Well he has a tattoo now and my wife is pissed at both of us. She's telling me I'm a bad/irresponsible father for allowing him to get a tattoo at 16 and that he'll regret it.

"AITA for annoying my bf to the point that he stopped the car and got out? So me (21F) and my boyfriend (23M) go out driving every now and then in my car. My bf has a full license and is insured on my car as a second driver. He‚Äôs recently passed his test so he‚Äôs not as good as I am yet as i‚Äôve been driving for a few years. He kept drifting slightly into the middle of the road so I told him to move over a bit and he said it doesn‚Äôt matter cause there‚Äôs no one around. I disagreed because it‚Äôs important to stay in your lane no matter what time it is. I also have a manual car so I ask him to put the car into neutral and the handbreak on every time he stops at a light so it doesn‚Äôt wear the clutch down. He got very annoyed at that and told me to stop whining all the time and then started to drive faster and go around roundabouts in a high gear so we swung around the roundabout and i was uncomfortable. I asked him to slow down and he brakes harshly and asked me if i was happy to which i responded that i‚Äôll be happy when he stops driving like a c*nt. I know I shouldn‚Äôt have called him that. He then stopped the car in the middle of the road completely, got out and walked away. I rushed to get into the drivers seat and pull the car to the side of the road. He left me really shaken up and pretty upset but i can‚Äôt help feel like it‚Äôs my fault and he‚Äôs adamant that it‚Äôs my fault.  So AITA?

Edit:: He‚Äôs really annoyed at me still for criticising his driving and he says that because we were driving late at night and there was no one around he didn‚Äôt drive dangerously and i have no reason to feel as shaken up as i do so i feel like even more of an AH now.",0.04

AITA for wanting to spend time with my step kids on Mother‚Äôs Day? So I have one child of my own and 4 bonus kids. My husbands ex wife is a pretty horrible person. We normally get my step kids on Sunday evenings and most years I get to spend a good chunk of Mother‚Äôs Day w my step kids. This year she has decided she is going to keep them until Monday morning. So I won‚Äôt see them or spend any time with them on Mother‚Äôs Day. All this is because she is pissed that her daughter has decided that her mom is crazy and she doesn‚Äôt want to spend any time over at her moms. So for the past school year she has been living w me and her dad. And barely talking to her mom. All of which her mom blamed me. None of this was my decision.

"AITA for demanding my grandmother to know where her wedding rings are I (31) got fierce on my grandma(70) because she let my mother (47, and decades long drug addict) take her and grandpa‚Äôs (74) damaged (cut) wedding bands and a tri-stone motherhood ring to a jeweler (supposedly Jared) to be recast/stones be reset. That was around Christmas 2020. My mother told my grandma; ‚Äúthe pandemic put them out of business, and there is no way to get the rings back.‚Äù I called bullshit and demanded grandma ask to see the invoice/ receipt. I explained that if a specific store location closed then another store would have information of the location the rings may have been sent. She said ‚Äúit‚Äôs not for me or her to do anything about, she [my mother] will handle it‚Äù, and that she‚Äôs ‚Äúnot wasting another second on this.‚Äù I told her to pull the wool from her eyes and use it to cover her ass.

"AITA for wanting absolute silence when I have panic attacks? I have dealt with seemingly random panic attacks since I was a kid. Im now 22 and currently living with my parents until I can find an apartment in my area.

Lately my panic attacks have been getting more intense (Im on meds and see a therapist). Im working on trying to work through the panic attacks. However, noise only makes them worse. It doesnt even have to be a loud noise, it can just be somebody talking to me or hearing a TV in the next room. Ive told my parents that when Im having these panic attacks, I need to be left alone for a little bit. I dont want anyone to talk to me or ask for me, and I dont want them to check on me. Its easier for me to mitigate the panic when Im by myself and theres as much silence as possible. If someone tries to talk to me, it just makes it worse.

My dad tells me Im being overly needy and dramatic but my mom understands and just leaves me alone. When its over and Im calm, I'll keep going about my day normally. I dont know if this is normal for other people who have panic attacks, but its causing controversy in my family.

"AITA for getting mad at my dad for getting drunk? I have never had a good relationship with my father. He wasn't necessarily strict but he would always tell me how much of a sorry excuse for a child I was. He would constantly blame me and berate me whenever he had the chance (which was every day), yelled at me, and made me feel dumb for any and all opinions I had (He's done more things but I can't mention it on here). This all happened when he got drunk.

I hated being around him and constantly avoided him, and for years my mother has told me that this is just how men are and that this is normal. And I actually believed her, for 11 years of my life (which is how long I've lived with him since I was 7).

Last year my mom has decided that enough is enough and told my dad that if he doesn't stop she and I will leave him. And he stopped for a while before getting back into drinking again and this happened over and over until my mom told him she will get a divorce this year.

That's when things shifted and he actually tried. Though he never gave up alcohol he tried not to drink so much. He stopped berating me as much and yelling and was nicer and I appreciated that so much. I started respecting him more and listening, but I had my guard up the whole time in case he decided to go back to how he was.

Low and behold, my worry happened. Today while I was baking a cake for mother's day he came downstairs, drunk, and started babbling on about how he hates this one person at work and made fun of the person's way of speaking (even though he literally has an accent himself). I grew irritated because he invaded my space and I got uncomfortable. That's when he threw the first insult at me and I lost it.

I yelled at him about how I was sick and tired of him always doing this and that I knew he was gonna go back to being a horrible drunk father. I told him how I hated how he criticized everyone and his obvious sarcasm when he talked to people (not the funny kind, the really hurtful kind). I called him an alcoholic and how I hated him for always declining to get help on the issue. My mom was shocked but said nothing until my dad left angrily and slammed his bedroom door upstairs. That's when my mom told me that what I said was really hurtful and that he's my father and I should show some respect towards him since he's trying. I feel horrible for what I did and now I'm wondering, AITA?",0.06
"AITA for going off on my wife after she made a sex sign to keep my mom from knocking on our bedroom door? 
So I‚Äôve been married to my wife for 4 years. We have a medium sized apartment. For the last 2 months, my mother has been staying of and on in our guest room. My dad recently passed away and it‚Äôs hard for her to live in their house alone, so I‚Äôve been letting her stay with us. My wife and her have never particularly got along, but I expected her to understand why it‚Äôs important to me that she overlook this just for a little while. I mean she lost her husband of 40 years, she‚Äôs fragile and I really want to be able to do what I can to make her feel better.

My moms presence has changed our routine a little bit. Mainly our nighttime routine. She‚Äôll usually come knock on our door to talk. My wife hates this. Partially because it interrupts our intimacy. Usually when she‚Äôs over we just don‚Äôt make love. 

So this past week I noticed my mom wasn‚Äôt coming in at night. So we had normal nighttime habits. Yesterday mom pulled me aside and told me that the sign I let my wife put on the door at night was disgusting and not something she ever needed to know. She also said it that she was very hurt that I don‚Äôt want to speak to her since I‚Äôm all she has left now.

I told her I had no idea what she was talking about. She said the sign about sex. I still had no idea and talked to my wife about it when she got home. She admitted to it. She said that she made a sign to keep my mom out of our hair at nights. On the sign was written, ‚ÄúPlease do not disturb unless you want to see me fucking your son‚Äù. 

She thought it was funny was necessary but I was mad about it. I took the sign crumpled it up and tossed it in the garbage. I then went off on my wife about how inappropriate abs embarrassing this was. She told me it‚Äôs my fault that we needed this and it‚Äôs just joke. I slept on the couch last night and she‚Äôs still pissed at me.

"AITA For Getting Upset When My GF Brought Up Mother's Day? All day long, since my gf got off work, she has been talking about mothers day, and asking why we even celebrate it when some mothers are narcissistic assholes. I lost my mother in 2019, and it's still quite a touchy subject. She knows I lost my mom. I got a little impatient with it, especially when she asked me why I wasn't being all lovey. I told her I was kinda upset. I didn't want to think about mothers day, at all. And so I didn't feel like talking. She texted me, asking me why I talked to her the way I did, and I explained to her that she upset me. I didn't want to hear about her problems with her mother, especially considering the fact her mothers still alive, and she may not be talking to her atm, but at least she has the option to text her.... or email her... or call her.... she then said that she wished her mom was dead, and I said 'no you don't. Bevause if you did, you wouldn't let her live rent-free in your head 24/7. Don't bs me' she got mad at me, calling me rude and that 'I don't have to talk to her that way' and that she's sensitive.

I have a greedy aunt and I‚Äôm worried that if my dad passes that she will take everything he owns. There was a time my dad lived with my aunt (paid for rent, food, his share of the bills, and cleaned) she had a fight with him and stole 20000 from his bank account. She also did the same thing with my other uncle.

"AITA for not listening to my neighbors? I‚Äôm a 26M who lives in a relatively nicer neighborhood that has no HOA.

There‚Äôs a Facebook group for the neighborhood and some people have complained about it and some have jumped in defending it and saying the like it. 

Long story short the ones who don‚Äôt like it are saying it‚Äôs disrespectful to my neighbors, tacky and trashy of me to do it. They want me to take it down.

At this point I‚Äôm refusing simply because I will not be bullied into it. No one has knocked on my actual door and sent me a private message asking me to remove it, only public bitching. 

My thoughts are no one pays my property taxes or my mortgage therefore they get no say in how I choose to decorate my yard. The grass is always cut, trash cans are always brought up. Everything is nice and neat excluding the skeleton.

"AITA For Not Letting My MIL Meet My Baby? My husband(M23), we‚Äôll call him G, and I have two kids who we‚Äôll call M(F7weeks) and T(M2). T‚Äôs godfather, P, and I recently received custody of him and I only have him once a month. 

M was born with ASD that require red open heart surgery  which she received at just 5 days old. She is okay now and will live a pretty much normal life. 

When P and I received custody of T, he was already a healthy, easygoing kid and he‚Äôs not been sick before and we pretty much never go out in public(I do online college and my husband works from home) so, until I had M, I‚Äôve never really been worried about illnesses(plus I‚Äôm a bit of a germaphobe so I do my best to sterilize everywhere I go). 

When M was born and we found out about the hole in her heart, G and I chose not to let anyone meet her because, even though we knew her immune system wasn‚Äôt weakened by this, we still worried about it. 

My mom was in the room with G and I when I gave birth and my dad and son were waiting outside so they had already met her by the time we learned about her heart so we didn‚Äôt exclude them from spending time with her but, everyone who hadn‚Äôt met her was. 

When my MIL found out that we wouldn‚Äôt let anyone meet her she freaked. My FIL, one of my SILs and two of my BILs are one MIL‚Äôs side while my other SIL and BILs as well as my parents and P are on my husband and my side. 

Recently(as in just this past Friday, G and I reached out to our families, letting them know that we feel ready to let them meet M. Everyone except my MIL were extremely excited to meet her at our weekly family dinner(we all live close by which is nice).

We brought her to the meal and everyone fawned over her, even MIL.

Later that evening, MIL asked me to help her clear the table. I said sure and handed M off to G who went out onto the porch with the others. 

I follow her to to dining room and start to stack plates to take to the sink. I turn around to say how happy I was that everyone had taken to M and saw her glaring at me with her hands on her hips. I open my mouth to ask her what‚Äôs wrong and she just starts yelling about how dare I poison her own children against her *inappropriate words and stuff* and, until I am willing to apologize, I am no longer welcome at her house. I may have told her to go to Hell and stormed out‚Ä¶ 

I apologized for yelling and saying such things but I refused to apologize for not letting anyone meet M. 

My husband and SIL tell me I‚Äôm not in the wrong here but I‚Äôm really starting to feel like the AH here for causing all this drama and most likely ruining the already stiff relationship between G and one of his brothers.

Edit: So, since social media gives me anxiety, I decided to pathetically check in on this post less than an hour after I created it and I saw a lot of you ask for info about why I let my parents see her and not my in laws. For one, I did not let any other of my biological family meet her  and, two, G and I actually live with my parents so it would have been kind of hard to quarantine from them. I realize I should have mentioned that. One more thing: My husband and I stand by the fact that the one who is giving birth gets to choose who‚Äôs in the room when said person is giving birth. Also, G didn‚Äôt want his parents in the room. Plus, we didn‚Äôt know M had ASD until after she was born. And, about T, he was immediately sent to P‚Äôs who graciously took care of him until G and I felt comfortable having other people around M.",0.33
"AITA for going to the school board and above about a teacher? My daughter (16) has been extremely depressed since 2020.  When they came to virtual school my social butterfly wilted.  She became withdrawn and never fully recovered even when in school resumed.

She has never been a problem student but this year her grades have suffered because she has refused to put effort into her school work.  This includes in class.  She will often put her head down or will cover her head with her hood of her sweatshirt.

One of her teachers has suddenly taken offense to her lack of effort.  She has kicked her from class every class for 2 weeks for putting her head down calling it ""attention seeking behavior"". The teacher has gone so far as to accuse my child of passing out for attention in front of her whole class (she passed out due to her ED).

I attempted to speak to the teacher and have stated if her behavior is not disruptive then she should not be removed from class and the teacher just continued to remove hee.  I went to the principal who agreed with me but has done nothing when the behavior continued.

I finally emailed the school board as well as safe schools about the discrimination as my child is suffering with mental health issues and is not disruptive.

My family says I have taken it too far.  I feel like I am just trying to protect my daughter. AITA?


Edit:

Of course my child is in therapy.  My child sees a psychiatrist, 3 therapist, and does group therapy as well.  Her school is well aware of all of this as well.  My child is not breaking any rules (teacher even said this to me).  She is simply doing her work then laying her head down or laying her head down.  She is passing the class with an 80 percent currently so it's not like she is failing and it's an honors class.

Let me also explain her grades are all still passing she just used to be an A student and her teachers know this. Now she is a B/C student in honor classes.  Of course I would love my daughter to have all As again but I refuse to pressure her to be a straight A student.",0.11
"AITA for having a tracker on my Nan? My Nan (62F) is an alcoholic and has been for a while now, me (19 F) and all my family have been getting extremely worried about her recently more so than before. She has custody of my 4 year old cousin, for now as his dad went to jail( I know messed up family) and her drinking has became a lot worse since gaining custody of him and he can be a handful. However back to the tracker, recently she has been leaving for a long time and not coming back for hours swearing she‚Äôs stopped drinking for good this time, lying that she hasn‚Äôt drank when we can smell it, coming back with bottles of vodka hid in her bag. She also drives with my cousin in the car whilst drunk. This is the main reason we decided to put a tracker as if something happened eg a crash, we would be able to see where they are more easily or if we worry we can check they‚Äôre okay. This tracker is on her phone just to check if she‚Äôs been to any shops and it‚Äôs kind of a last resort option for us as she is becoming yellow and very ill again, I feel bad for invading her privacy but I just have no other options. She‚Äôs getting worse and it‚Äôs the only way we can track how she‚Äôs getting the alcohol and mainly that she‚Äôs safe.

"AITA For Judging Someone for an Old Felony? I [F24] have never dated a guy before. I've never been seriously asked (aside from creepy men just wanting sex), and I never had the confidence to ask a guy out due to shyness and low self-esteem with my body (I am overweight, but I've successfully have been working on it with the help of a personal trainer). 

I'm not looking to just hook up. I'm a virgin, though I am interested I'm sex. I just feel uncomfortable giving my virginity to a guy I don't know. I'm not asking to wait until marriage, just wait until I trust you enough to take my clothes off without worrying if ill be judged.

I want kids, I want to get married, and I feel like I've wasted a lot of time because I've been to scared. I started puberty really early (9-years old) so I worry that I will miss out on kids.

I matched up with a guy on an app who seems to be a sweet guy. I asked him out and he agreed. He suggested a movie. He lives a little far, but was willing to drive halfway to meet me, which I was happy with.

We exchanged numbers and started to talk. After asking why he hasn't pursued a career path he was interested in, he became upset, saying he has a Felony from when he was a teen (17). I asked if he felt comfortable enough to explain, and he told me he robbed a house with some friends. He said he was looking at getting it cleared in a few months since it was 8 years ago, and he didn't wanna talk about it. I apologized for pushing the subject and I didn't mean to upset him. This was 8 hours ago. He didn't text back.

I feel like I wrongly  him,  but I'm uncomfortable with this. I've worked hard to get where I am. My family has a lot of issues that has affected me, but I'm hardworking, I'm successful, I'm friendly, and I've never been invovled with the cops, aside for a jaywalking ticket i got with my dad at 15.

So, while I'm grateful that he told me, my confidence is shrinking again. I feel as if the only people I'm going to attract are creepy men looking to have sex, or someone who might damage my goals. I've spent a lot of the day crying.

I feel like I'm ready to date now, but I'm so inexperienced with dating, I feel like I'm going to fuck it up, which I think I did.

Was I to harsh? Am I the asshole for judging him for this when I don't want to be judged for my issues? What can I do if I'm in another situation like this? 

TL;DR: A guy on a dating app got angry with me when I asked him to explain his Felony. I feel like I was judging him when I don't want to be judged myself. AITA?

This is our conversation verbatim:


Him: I can't work there. I have a Felony okay?

Him: I don't wanna talk about it

Him: Seriously? Fine, I robbed a house with a bunch of fugitives who were with my friend when I was a teen. I'm getting pissed, drop it.

Me: I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to upset you, though it is concerning when you vaguely tell me that you have a Felony. 

Him: ""Look, I don't normally get mad about this, but I get pissed off when people ask about why I can't have my freedom. Now enough I'm pissed and don't want to talk about. ""

Him: K

When she came home for Christmas noticeably heavier than when we last saw her in August, I expected it. I didn't feel the need to do this big sit down chat. I said nothing, and my wife stewed over it, and ended up telling our daughter she needed to handle it and that she was trusting our daughter to handle it.

She recently came home for the summer much heavier than she was at Christmas. This absolutely floored my wife who began this scatter brained screaming about how she was going to make our daughter work out every day and about how she looked like she'd outgrown all of her clothes save for the sweats, and how obesity is not going to be celebrated here and on and on. I could see how sad my daughter was, so, I yelled at my wife to cool it and go calm down somewhere. She stormed off, my daughter & I hugged.

"AITA for saying tomy child can change his name? EDIT TITLE: to my*

Me (39F) and my husband (40M) had two children (17M twins). 

My husband and I never agreed on a name, because I think the name he wanted was very ugly, Tulio (Brazilian here), which was in honor of his late father. And I wanted the name Henry. After much discussion, the only compromise they both accepted was to each choose a name for a twin. 

Then...Tulio and Henry.

One of the most interesting facts in my country is that at the age of 18, a person can change their name without justification and has a period of 1 year to do so. 

Tulio has never been a big fan of his name, as he almost begs everyone to call him Lio, because he doesn't like being called by his full name. 

You can already imagine what happened. 

Our kids will be 18 in 3 weeks and we were having a family lunch on Sunday. 

Tulio started to say that he wished I had won the argument about their names, because the way I am so stubborn, I could easly have won the argument and I could give nice names. 

My husband told him not to complain because it is a tribute to his grandfather who was a very respected teacher in the city. 

In the middle of the whole conversation, I just commented ""you know you can go to the registry office and change it to whatever name you want when you turn 18? The two of you actually"". 

My husband was silent for the rest of lunch, while Lio was excited about the idea, but I didn't think he was going to actually do it. 

On Sunday night, my husband was still frowning and I asked him to speak up soon. 

He replied saying that there is no reason to change the name if it was a beautiful tribute to his father and that it was AH of me to have suggested it, knowing that my son would want it. And that he hoped Tulio would forget the next day. 

He didn't forget, in fact, he watched how he went about it and first thing in the morning (Monday) he went to our room to ask what his registry office. 

My husband is complaining in my ear and even suggested that I did it on purpose because I never liked the name Tulio. And that I encouraged our son to dishonor the flight's memory (even if the last name is his anyway). 

I really didn't mean it, I just said that possibility that our son didn't know about, and i knew this from having a law degree.

"AITA? My husband's best friend and his wife are won't stop coming to spend almost every weekend.. On Easter I told them we have plans, they live 2 hours away from us. They showed up anyway. We dealt with it and included them (reluctantly) in our outing. On Friday they called again to let me know they are coming, I told them firmly that we have plans for some activities, about perhaps 3 hours later I see headlights on my driveway. It was them again (Steve and Diana) I asked where they were heading and she says we came to see you. She's very overbearing and pushy. I thought she was joking but she came in with a plastic bag with clothes in it. She calls it the Mexican luggage, 
I was so flustered but I was cooking and when my husband came home from work, we sat down to have dinner. She helped herself to the pot roast and after a few bites she started complaining that it has mushrooms in it. I thought she was allergic to it but no she hates mushrooms. I didn't get up to fix her anything because they weren't invited. The next morning on Saturday, four of my friends and their husbands were to come over for potluck breakfast, I see her scrambling eggs in the kitchen. I was livid because she knew the plans, she made enough for her and Steve, then when my guests came over she sat down to eat again. She had also gone through 4 pastries that I was for breakfast. Now there is only 6 left out of 10. I want to tell her off for several things she does and I don't want them to come over almost all the weekends... WIBTA to tell them off?",0.13
"AITA for misinterpreting a compliment? Hi. I, 16f, was going to a coffee shop with my step-dad, 32m (We have an amazing relationship btw, for clarity) and was ordering my drink, when the SWEETEST old lady came up to us and said ""Wow, you're so pretty! You and him look so alike"". I have very low self esteem and am very insecure about my looks, so that made my day. I beamed back at her, and continued ordering for my other siblings. My step-dad was standing next to me during all of this. No more than 30 seconds later, the kind lady gently tapped my shoulder and said ""You're like a pretty version of him!"". I smiled back at her, but I wasn't sure what to make of it and looked at my step-dad awkwardly. He thought I was confused by what she said, so he re-assured me that it was a compliment, although the reason I was confused because I thought the lady basically said I was better looking than him, and felt badly about it. I laughed and explained this to him, and we both had a good laugh about it. Not long after, we got home and told my mother about this, to which she reacted the same as we did.  I then told my friend, 16f, what happened, but surprisingly she took it as a lot more than the light-hearted joke that it was- she actually called me self-absobed to think that anyone would ever compare me to somebody else in a positive way, and that I should have apologized to our step-dad for ""insulting"" him. I was really hurt by this, but didn't say anything. Now our other friends have started leaving awful comments on my  posts, calling me a self-obssesed a$$hole, ugly, and other terrible things. My friends have said commented negatively on my looks before, but it's never been this bad. I feel like this whole thing is absolutely RIDICULOUS. I'm so confused, because I truly don't think I did anything wrong, but am starting to doubt myself now- what if I did come off as rude?

"AITA for not inviting my future father in laws partner to our wedding? 
So my partner and I have decided to have a very small wedding in about 3 months time. We have only invited people we could not imagine our day without (22 people) and absolutely no plus ones. (No siblings, aunts, uncles. Just parents, grandparents and very very close friends). 

My future father in law recently got a new girlfriend (about 2 months ago), when we were chatting with him on the phone a few months back regarding the wedding she overheard, got excited, made the assumption she was invited and went out and bought a dress. When this was bought to our attention a few weeks later my partner addressed it and all was good. 

Fast forward to 2 nights ago, my partner and I have come home for the week & were calling family to catch up while we are in town. My partner calls his dad and they set a date/time but at the end of the phone call his dad goes ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just letting you know we‚Äôre really upset that xxxxx isn‚Äôt allowed to come to the wedding‚Äù. My partner just said oh okay, I‚Äôm sorry and left it at that. 

Last night we catch up for dinner, the girlfriend and his dad arrive and she‚Äôs visibly upset. She‚Äôs downing her drinks In 30 seconds, taking shots at the bar, being very blunt, sitting on her phone and not even making an effort to chat with us. (This is the first time we‚Äôve met this woman). When she walks away we say to his dad, we‚Äôre not excluding her because she‚Äôs a new item or anything, we just want our day super small, there are lots of people who are not invited and upset about it but it‚Äôs just the way it is. Shes more than welcome to travel with you when you come for the wedding but I‚Äôm sorry she will not be attending on the day. He then goes ‚Äúoh well if money is the issue, I will pay for her‚Äù. We reassure that money isn‚Äôt the issue and this is just the way we want it. She then returned and we stopped chatting about it. 

Later in the night my partner and his dad wander off to go get dessert and I mention it to her in the hopes she will realise that we‚Äôre not excluding just her, there‚Äôs 140 other people who are in the same boat. I told her the same thing, that she‚Äôs more than welcome to come down and we‚Äôd love to have her visit but just his dad is coming to the ceremony & dinner. To which she responds ‚Äúoh I have no issues, (the dad) just thought it was weird I‚Äôm not invited. But he will only be coming to the ceremony and not the dinner because it‚Äôs not fair I‚Äôm not invited and will have to sit in the hotel all day.‚Äù I left the conversation at that because I was pissed off about the last comment. 

So what I want to know is: Are my partner and I wrong in this situation? We‚Äôre both upset now he‚Äôs not coming to dinner and kind of want to turn around and say ‚Äúyou either come to both and support your son or don‚Äôt come at all‚Äù but that will stir the pot massively. I‚Äôm on the edge of becoming a bridezilla over this. Are we in the wrong for not inviting her? Am I the asshole?",0.09

After that she said i cannot  tell anyone im romani or "" dont act like gypsies ""  i asked why and she told me her family wouldn't let me be friends with "" someone  like me""  and that her friends would make jokes  

I asked what jokes and she told me some very racist jokes ( sorry  i dont remember it happened while  ago ) 

I told her they're racist and she got mad at me "" we aren't  racist! We dont call you n*word and you aren't  even black so we cant even be racist!!, its just jokes chill"" 

i got **bit** mad  and called her "" racist bitch""  and  she told me that gypsies always pull out the race card ( whatever that means?)  and that i over reacted over some harmless jokes . And that it was a mistake being friends with gypsy...

she then stopped talking to me i assume her parents found out or something.

"AITA for uninviting my mother from my wedding? I've recently got engaged to a really lovely person that I've been with for almost 4 years now. We're going strong (clearly) and my parents have no issue with him, his family, and likewise there's no issues on his side of the family with my side of the family.

I haven't saved the date yet but due to the engagement we've had lighthearted conversations and mild planning of the wedding. I was casually talking to my parents over FT and my mom says ""You do know that I'm not coming to your wedding."" I got so confused as I didn't see a reason why. My dad in the background replied with ""well, grandma and grandpa"" (my dad's parents) and she confirmed, ""grandma and grandpa will be there""

My mum has a lot of tension with her in-laws that has gone on for maybe 2 years. Doesn't matter how it started, but she's apologised and is waiting on an apology from them for like.... 2 years. It's not going to happen and they haven't seen each other since, my dad visits alone, he speaks to them alone, and they have nothing to do with one another. My grandparents can be passive aggressive and can take a high almighty kind of stance so I understand her breaking that relationship but as I don't think conflict will be initiated during the wedding I didn't think much of it other than do NOT sit them at the same table. I love them both and wouldn't want them to be uncomfortable, but I also wouldn't want them missing my wedding.

I was upset and asked my mum if she was really going to miss her only daughter's wedding because of some petty falling out? Just avoid them? I can warn them to not start a conversation with her and that thought of rivalry shouldn't even be present during my wedding, because it should be about me and my fianc√©. I told her I felt upset that she would put her anger for my grandma above her love for me and she reminded me of how she took the high road over this argument. I scoffed ""maybe they'll be dead by the time the wedding comes round and you won't even have to worry"" and she said maybe. The sad part is I don't think my grandparents would have even thought about my mum's presence on my wedding, but then their high horse makes them completely oblivious that they've even done anything wrong (which they did) but still they'd accept my invitation in a heartbeat no questions asked.

I told my mum if she doesn't feel comfortable going, or she's going to cause tension then she shouldn't even come. I said that I couldn't believe this was even a problem and there's no way I'm not inviting my grandparents for her benefit.

Now my mum goes into sulk mode where she snarkily says okay fine with me and my dad is saying that he might not go if mum isn't invited and so my brother also won't go as he relies on them so basically I may miss my closest family at my wedding. AITA? Should I reinvite her?",0.01
"AITA for not contributing to a $900 vet bill for the ‚Äúfamily‚Äù dog who lives with my sister, when I recommended against going to the vet in the first place? I (31 F) have 2 sisters (24 & 29). My middle sister adopted a dog from Texas at the worst time - she was in an abusive relationship and living w my mom, her 2 kids and her then-bf in my mom‚Äôs 2 bedroom apartment. During Covid, the dog became too much with my middle sister‚Äôs at home schooling responsibilities as by that point she was (thankfully) no longer with her ex and a single parent. My little sister loves the dog and he came to live in the city my little sister and I live in. We sort ‚Äúshared‚Äù custody, but she is truly obsessed with him and he‚Äôs been staying primarily with my little sister and her roommate for the past year or so. 
Fast forward - dog has been having stomach issues past week, everyone is concerned. They make a vet appointment for today. On the way to this appointment the dog throws up a plastic bag. My sister goes to the appointment and the vet recommends an X-ray to ensure there‚Äôs not a partial intestinal blockage, to the tune of $900. My littlest sister is a recent graduate without full time employment or any real income to speak of. She calls and essentially asks for the money. I strongly recommend against going for the X-ray, at least today, and to wait a couple days and see how he does, given it seems pretty likely the plastic bag was the cause of his issues and it just came out. 
They proceed w the x-ray. No blockage found. Now I feel somewhat compelled not to contribute to this vet bill out of principle - I told her to wait, she knew she couldn‚Äôt afford it and she went ahead anyways. 
AITA if I refuse to contribute and let her learn a bit of a lesson here?
For further context she has a long history of treating me like a bank bc I am so much older and our parents are not financially stable.",0.6
"AITA for snapping back at my dad after his ""joke"" hurt my feelings? I (19F) got hurt by a ""joke"" my dad made to be earlier about my job. I work at a retail store and on Saturdays I work five hours (I only work 3h on week days because that's just the normal hours there) 
So I'm usually tired when I come home Saturdays because I work 5 hours, lift heavy boxes (truck comes Friday so Saturdays are typically refilling the store) and we are usually the busiest on weekends. So needless to say the combo of stocking and having to deal with old women complaining about sales leaves me exhausted. 

So this all comes to a head when I say I'm gonna be tired tomorrow and my dad asks why and I tell him that it's because I work 5 hours tomorrow. And he mocks me, and says ""awwwww, what are you gonna do with and 8-10 hour job?"" 
Which ik, that's something I've worried about on my own, because I've only had jobs with a max of 5 hours a shift. I realize I'll need to suck it up when I eventually go work in like a warehouse or something. But just the way he said it made me feel like he didn't see my job as a real job. So I clap back at him and say ""Well sorry I don't have a REAL job"" and that stopped both my parents
 My mom said I needed to apologize to him and I asked why and I said that it kinda hurt my feelings. This isn't the first time he's said shit as a ""joke"" but the way he says it sounds more judgemental.

Also for a little more context he wants to take me practice driving right after I get off at 8 and go till 10 or 11 at night. I'll be exhausted already and I have to go in tomorrow too, only 3 hours, but I'd still like to rest instead.

She is an extrovert, very very pretty, funny and always gets attention and praise, its that she is both pretty and have a great personnality. She gets friends in like one minute of talking to the person, they immediatly like her.
In the other hand, there is me , an introvert, a shy person, am not bad looking, lets say iam quiet beautiful too(but you can see the difference). But i lack social skills, it took me much time to make friends and relationships and am not as funny as her. 
Actually i had never been bothered by this, we have been friend for like 8 years and i just accepted the way iam and the way she is. 
Until one i get engaged. I was very happy that i finally found great person who liked me for the way i am and was so happy for my engagement. So we decided, me and my fiancee to have a family meeting where his family and mine get to know each other. So my bestfriend came to help me prepare myself and was so excited for me, and i felt bad for not inviting her (because all my family know her) so i tell her she can come. I didnt think much of it, not realizing its gonna be the worst day of my life. 
The meeting started. My family, my fiancee and his family were all in my house. So i said hi to everyone. And set next to my fiance's sisters to start some conversation. And guess what. As usual, my bestfriend start talking to them before i even had the chance, and they become friend before i even said one word. They was falling in her charm, and all of my fiancees family was staring at her, talking about her and they didnt even notice me or try to talk to me. I felt very very bad and leftout. I was very angry and i couldnt enjoy a moment. It was my special day, that i wanted to enjoy but she was outshining me , she stole the show and i felt like total shit. 
I also felt like my fiance was staring at her, i knew because he never stare at me that long so he was absolutly looking at her for a long period.
I than set next to my fiancee to talk to him so she  decided to change her place next to us , and she tried to talk to his mom and him. She was the centre of attention. Even his mom felt in love with her. 
So i was very angry and never talked to her since. I just wanted to enjoy that only day, it was my right to be seen and heard. But now iam left with a bad memory that i want to forget.
Also, the same thing happened in my weeding day when she was trying to talk to everyone and was stealing the show from me.
She than felt that i was treating her differently, so she was bragging that its not her fault that people like her instantly, that i get offensive very easily.",0.2

"AITA for leaving my best friend and his friends stranded in an unfamiliar city? So for background, my best friend has gotten into going to these Spartan races. He and a small group of his friends have started going to local ones but recently heard about one in another state they wanted to go to and compete in, but they didn't have anywhere to stay. So they asked me if they could borrow my truck and trailer (I have a tow behind camper) for the weekend. I said no, I wasn't comfortable with them taking my truck and trailer but that I'd drive them and the camper to their event. We made the three hour trip and set everything up in the area where the race was taking place the next day. 

I have a habit of leaving my keys on a hook next to the door to my bedroom in my camper. Remember this. 
Come nightfall, I went to take a phone call outside and ended up wandering around the grounds for over an hour. When I got back to the camper, the door was locked, and I was told by my best friend's older friend through the window that there wasn't enough room for me in MY trailer. So I reached for my keys to unlock the door, but realized I had left them inside the camper on the hook in my room. So I called my best friend from outside and all I was told was ""sorry bro, nothing I can do"". So I ended up sleeping in my truck that night, which I had fortunately left unlocked by accident.

Their race began at 8 am, and at 7, they came meandering out of the trailer and woke me up. No apology, by the way. 

So while they were in their race, I hooked my truck back up to the trailer, closed and locked everything, and waited until just after they finished and had started walking back to the trailer (think really wide open field). When I saw them coming, I started the truck and drove off the property. With them chasing behind. I made the three hour trip back home declining call after call. When I finally got home, I finally took my best friend's call. He started yelling at me saying ""why would you do this? We have no way home now"". I just said sorry, you shouldn't have made me sleep in my truck after I did you this solid. 

He told me that there were better ways to handle this than by leaving them in an unfamiliar city with no way home. I think he ended up calling his dad to come and get them. 

Is he right? Was there a better way to handle this? I felt justified until he said that. I am kinda doubting my decision now.

"WIBTA for leaving my grandpa's burglar alarm on to teach my dad a lesson? My father and I clash a lot. We're both very stubborn, but he has this know-it-all complex and he hates being proven wrong. No one in my family dares to correct him over things, except for me. We're not always fighting, but we argue more than any of his other daughters.

For context, my grandfather 87 just recently moved from his home 3 hours away to my town, where my parents and sisters live. He's in an home care facility where he will most likely remain for the rest of his life. We've begun the process of selling his house; I've gotten most of my things out of the room I was staying in when I was his 24/7 live in care assistant for a year until he required too much help. My uncle from Scotland is currently staying there to get all of his father's things in order, sorting them into piles we should keep, sell, give away, etc.

My grandfather has a burglar alarm that, ever since he officially moved out, has been armed 24/7. I set it up for him so that it arms every night at midnight and disarms at 11:50 pm, leaving it 10 minutes to disarm and then rearm. It might not be the most convenient way, but it was the only way I could figure out to leave it armed at all times. I'm the one who gets called when the alarm is tripped and I have to say a code word to disregard it. I got a call from the alarm company this afternoon and came to find out it was my uncle arriving there for the week. I disregarded the alarm, then called my father who also has access to the alarm system and asked him to turn off the 11:50pm-12:00am automation, so it wouldn't arm at midnight and detect my uncle. He spoke to me condescendingly and said ""OP, you just don't know how alarm systems work."" He thought that since my uncle disarmed it once, it won't arm again. Not the case. I lived there for a year, I know how the alarm works. I got frustrated and logged in just to see the automation was still there. I wanna turn it off to not cause my uncle trouble at midnight tonight, but I also wanna teach my dad a lesson that a) I'm not as dumb as he thinks I am and b) that he's not always right.

anyway. on friday night, i got together with some friendd and we were drinking. it was just 4 of us and i got pretty drunk. my other friend and i (F18) got really sick and threw up a bunch. when we went to sleep we were still pretty much pissed and she climbs into bed next to me, puts my arm around her back and cuddles into my chest. we talked for a few hours until my other friend came in and told us to go to bed. 

my friend leaves and my other friend takes her shirt off and she was just in shorts and her bra. (which idk i may be TA for this) and we went back to cuddling. it didnt mean anything to me, not sure about her though since she had been flirting with me all night. 

my best friend says its no different than him and i cuddling but i dont know how my boyfriend would take it if i told him. im just wanting to know if im TA or i was wrong to cuddle with her. i‚Äôd understand if i was to be honest.

what are your thoughts reddit?

EDIT: i told him. he didnt care or see anything wrong with it and said he doesnt care as long as it meant nothing. which it didnt",0.91

"AITA my GF goes as a formal date with someone else I‚Äôm (F22) being told by my GF (F20) that I shouldn‚Äôt be upset she went as some other girls date to a college sorority formal. My GF is not in this sorority and is apart of her own. They have their own formals she can go to. 

The girl asked my GF while we were dating and my GF said yes. I‚Äôve had a gf in the past that had a similar situation but the date was set up before we became a couple and I just brushed it off (still was weirded out).

I‚Äôm uncomfortable with the fact my GF went in the first place. And on top of it didn‚Äôt text me once the entire night and got home at midnight expecting me to wait up for her to come over. 

She insists they are just friends and the girl that asked her is straight. But if the roles were reversed‚Ä¶. she would 100% be upset with me but is saying that wouldn‚Äôt be the case. AITA?",0.14

"AITA for wanting to move back with my family I (f24) moved away from my family 4 years ago for college. I started dating David (26m) shortly after moving here. The thing is, David is in the army and has been deployed for a while. I don't have many friends here and I don't have any family here. I've been really lonely.

My family lives around 5 hours away so I try to visit them once a month. I told my mom how I was feeling and she offered to let me move back home. I thought about it because I'm very close with my family and I've missed living near them. I also have a lot of friends in the area.

I talked to David and he was 100% against me moving. He said that he'll be leaving the army and we can move in together soon but that still doesn't fix the issue that I don't have any family and only a couple of friends here. He says he has family in the area but I've never met them. 

David will be in college full time once he leaves the army and doesn't want to work while he's in college. He has a good amount in savings but he wants to save that to buy a house so I'd have to support both of us and we're in a HCOL area. My parents are in a LCOL area, plus they wouldn't charge us rent so it would be a lot easier for us there. 

He's still against this and we've been arguing a lot over the past few days because he's mad that I'm considering moving.

"AITA for being annoyed when I found out my partner didn‚Äôt feed our 8 month old two meals? So me 20f and my partner 34m live separately and have an 8 month old daughter. Last night I left her in his care whilst I went out for a birthday party saying would be back for 9/10pm but due to events going on couldn't get a taxi back for over an hour and a half so we decided I would go home and he would have her for the first time over night. I told him that our daughter had some food under the pram it just needed to be heated up before she had it. Today she came home and after a couple of hours I looked under the pram and found all the food sent unopened. I confronted my partner about this and he responded ""yes I messed up that's on me I'm sorry""

I tried to talk it out and asked how on earth you could forget to feed your daughter TWICE or at least what excuse do you have? His response was in these exact words ""It's the first time iv had her over night on my own....i had also not eaten the day before..i also didnt even get chance to shower yesterday...I was expecting you to come back to mine as you told me you would be back 9 or 10 then get a message saying your not but fine I dealt with it.. we was also meant to be going to the family day at the park with our friends today also didnt happen....my apologies for not giving her food last nice that is on me so yes I greatly apologies for that..this morning I gave her a bottle she fell back to sleep she woke up for maybe 30mins and then fell back to sleep i can't feed her while she's sleeping so again my apologies for not giving her the pouch of food won't happen again xx""

I still don't understand how you forget to feed her even when you're under stress because I do this on a daily basis our child should be our priority

I don't want him to have her by himself over night but after that message he made it about himself and how he works all the time and he works his ass off and is getting a mortgage he doesn't even want to provide a home for me and our daughter and how his brother always stresses at him

So I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for being mad and not wanting her in his care over night alone anymore (he is not on the birth certificate so I have full legal rights of her)

"AITA for calling my sister a bad parent? 
My older sister (She is 31F) is a very busy woman. She travels a lot for work and does this all to provide for her children. She makes 6 figures and our whole family is very happy with her successions and has always supported her. Sometimes supporting her also means babysitting her two kiddos (4F & 11M), she‚Äôs a single mother. Knowing that, her success so early on in life is amazing and very looky-uppy. I look up to her. 

I usually watch her kids on my days off. I work one week and don‚Äôt the next. Her son informed me he was giving a speech for his 5th grade send-off. I was very happy for him and told him the whole family would be there to support. He told me that his mom would be there too and told me that she was giving him a big present. I was smiley inside and was happy as hell for him. 

Day of, the whole family packs at most, 3 rows. All there to support him, my brother and mom took off of work too, since it was a weekday. For me, it. was my week off. When he gets on stage, I see the look on this kid‚Äôs face of absolute sadness, I‚Äôm just sitting there wondering why. He gives his speech with teary eyes and a cracking voice. After, we all shower him and kisses and hugs and gifts. I pull him aside to ask him what is wrong and he tells me how his mom isn‚Äôt here to see him. I told him she‚Äôd probably be there for the dinner. When I get into my car, I call my sister‚Äôs phone. I blast at her asking where she was, and that her son was looking for her. She tells me she had a last minute business trip and was sorry she couldn‚Äôt be there. I call her a bad parent and she just missed a important aspect of her kid‚Äôs life and he will remember this day as - ‚ÄúThe day my mom didn‚Äôt come.‚Äù she gets sad and I can hear her start to cry. She starts explaining her single mom story and how she needs to provide for her kids and does have to miss some stuff to do that. She says she gets her kids everything they need and want.

"AITA for wanting to move away from my mom after she came out? Obviously, context is needed. 

My mother married my stepfather in 2014, but met him in 2010. They've had 2 children together, and have been in a PERFECT relationship. No arguing, always talking through their problems, and avoided eviction in a financial crisis, etc. My mom recently (May 2022) came out as gay, has had a girlfriend since December 2021, and will soon be filing for divorce. My mother has primary custody, but I'm really REALLY considering moving in with my dad. 

**EDIT**

I am 17 in June. 

**EDIT EDIT**

I want to move in with my dad because my mom has done this before with him in 2005. She disappears every night of the week from 9pm to 6am to sleep with her girlfriend. She destroyed a beautiful family, and has always put herself first in every situation. I can't stand living with this vile woman anymore. She blames everyone but herself, regardless of the situation.

"AITA for ditching my boyfriends birthday and taking our son to my family‚Äôs reunion This summer my stepdad is planning the annual family reunion. We haven‚Äôt had an official family reunion in probably 10 years. I‚Äôm really proud of my stepdad for taking the reigns and organizing the entire thing. Its at least 100 people spanning across several states. It‚Äôs not easy. I have a 3 y/o son that I know a lot of my older relatives would love to meet, and this will probably be the only chance for a few of them. The dilemma that I‚Äôm running into is that it‚Äôs scheduled on my boyfriends birthday, and the reunion is an out of town event so it‚Äôll take up the entire weekend for sure. We may have to request one day off of work. My boyfriend takes his birthday pretty seriously, which is something I can‚Äôt relate with. Do whatever the hell you want, but idk I‚Äôve always been the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy with an intimate night at home‚Äù kinda person when it comes to my birthday. As long as my partner celebrates me, I‚Äôm happy with something small. But my boyfriend always seems to have an issue when something comes up that‚Äôs not all about him.

This year he‚Äôs turning 31, and he‚Äôs already mentioned how he does not want to go to the family reunion for his birthday. I‚Äôve mentioned that we can still have a celebration the weekend before of after, but he‚Äôs not happy with that either. I truly don‚Äôt know why it matters to celebrate ON your actual day.

"AITA for buying a round of drinks for the bar instead of paying for unnecessary testing for my daughter? My (48M) daughter (12F) is mildly autistic with ADHD. She has a 504 plan but no IEP and my ex-wife (50F) has been obsessed for years with the idea of our kid being in special education.

However, our daughter is very intelligent and excels in school to the point to having skipped 6th grade already and her heading off to high school next year. Because of this she has obviously been denied an IEP because she doesn‚Äôt meet the requirements. So ex wife has decided to find a private psychiatrist who will work with the school as well. The testing for this is almost 2000 dollars, and I would be on board with this if it was necessary. However I don‚Äôt think dumping that much money on an unnecessary IEP that will likely just hinder our very intelligent daughter is a smart idea.

A couple weeks after this though, I was drunk and at a local bar while my wife was having her time with our kid and I decided that since a lot of people at the bar were my coworkers and I was having a nice time, I woukd cover the drinks for the whole bar. It came to around $1300 and although that was pricey, I would he okay because I make enough at my job to get it back within 3 weeks. My ex wife found out about thid and we got into a massive fight, her screaming at me and calling me a terrible father. I called her a munchie and that she needs to stop being obsessed with our daughter being in special education and all of that. She hung up on me, has ghosted me for several days, and refused to take our daughter over for my week with her. AITA?

ETA: My daughter doesn‚Äôt want an IEP. Also, I think a lot of you guys are confusing an IEP for a 504. IEP is accommodations and specialized services/learning strategies/special education classes. 504 is just accommodations.",0.89

"AITA for honking at pedestrians crossing the street I live in Davis, CA.  The drivers and pedestrians here are both horrible.  Drivers go too fast, and pedestrians ignore common sense, failing to ""drive defensively"".

I generally avoid driving in downtown, but sometimes it's inevitable.  It's where the parking is available.  

I was at a four way stop and waiting for the pedestrians.  You have to really watch them, because people will cross one street, then immediately turn and cross again, often on their phones or talking and not paying attention.

The person in front of me finally goes, and I'm at the intersection.  I let another car go, and the. Two separate sets of pedestrians cross without looking, causing me to wait for them.  Whatever, I get it, pedestrian right of way.

However, I'm finally able to turn left, no pedestrians at intersection or trying to cross.  I start my turn.  About half way through it, these ladies exit a shop and dart into the cross walk.  I'm forced to slam on my brakes and wait for them as they slow down and slowly cross, talking to each other and ignoring the car with the bumper touching the cross walk.

I honked at them and they gave me the dirtiest looks.

"AITA: My type of humor So, one of my best friends has a boyfriend. Of course, we're best friends since we have the same humor, but his boyfriend can't take a joke.
To explain a bit of what my humor is, we joke about being mad at each other (not in an aggressive way or anything just like joking around) But, even though my humor is like this, I get triggered when people are actually angry with me. (As of right now, I'm shaking because of this situation.) It may seem over dramatic but the reason I'm like this is because of my trauma. 
This time, I was joking about how my friend forgot his boyfriends age. To quote; 
""Htf you forget your bfs age üò≠ü§ö""
""What if he was like 20 dude üíÄ""
But his boyfriend didn't get it was a joke and got mad at me. Obviously, his aggression and anger towards me triggered my trauma and I was on the verge of tears. So I left the group chat. 
But now I feel horrible. Should I stop joking like that? I don't know if that's fair because my friend also jokes like that and he doesn't have a problem with it. I just don't want to be an awful friend.

"AITA for not turning right? Today I was exiting a parking garage (driving) and came to a stop at the exit because I could not merge into the middle lane. The parking garage faces the right lane of a three lane street. In other words, the garage exits directly into the center of the right lane. The right lane is to turn right only and the middle and left lane are to go straight. I‚Äôm trying to get to the middle lane. However, sometimes the middle lane is full and most cars wait for it to clear up if they‚Äôre not trying to turn right. 

So that‚Äôs what I did. I stopped at the exit and waited for the middle lane to clear so I can get in. I did not block the lane and I did not black traffic. I blocked the drivers exiting the garage briefly for traffic to clear. However, the person in the car behind mine starts honking at me aggressively and gets out of her car to berate me for not getting into the right lane and holding her up. 

There‚Äôs no signage saying we‚Äôre not supposed so I believe I‚Äôm correct, legally. It‚Äôs not unusual to wait to exit the garage because sometimes traffic coming into the lanes blocks drivers trying to exit the garage. So AITA driver in this scenario?",0.74
"AITA for taking my daughter out for a nice dinner when her school accidentally gave her an award I have 2 daughters, Adriana (18) and Arianne (16). Adriana is a senior in high school and Arianne is a junior.

Both of my girls are talented in their own ways. Adriana is an amazing painter and is starting to get into digital art as well. Arianne is academically gifted and is very musically inclined. She skipped a grade, she is fluent in 3 languages, she plays the piano and the guitar, and she sings. Their school offers this accelerated program with the community college that lets her take her last 2 years of high school at the community college then she will graduate high school with an associates degree. Adriana is a pretty average student, one advanced class and mostly B's and C's, except for AP Art, which she has an A in.

Last week we got an email inviting us to their school for senior award night. It didn't say which one of our students would be receiving an award but we only have one senior so we assumed it was for Adriana. We were very proud of her and decided to take the family out to dinner to celebrate.

Well it turns out the school made a mistake and Arianne won the awards. Adriana didn't win anything. The school decided to let Arianne keep her awards and the scholarship money that came with one of them and they let her accept them on stage at senior night. We decided to still go to the dinner because if Adriana winning an award is worth celebrating, so is Arianne winning one. We also got both of the girls gifts but Arianne's was nicer.

When we got home from dinner and the ceremony, Adriana yelled at us for making us watch Arianne ""steal her awards and her party"" (She didn't want to go but she had to support her sister. When we thought Adriana won the awards, Arianne was going to go to the ceremony and dinner to support her). I told her that what had happened was not our fault and that, while it was disappointing, she should not take her anger out on us.

She yelled that she can't wait to graduate and get the hell away from us and has hardly spoken to any of us since.

"WIBTA if I don't pay for a plane ticket? My friend (21f) is getting married to my cousin (21m). The whole time she's been planning this wedding she's been acting really distant and has been disrespecting me a lot. Here's a list:
-We gave her my spare bedroom for $60 (not per month, just a flat fee) because she couldn't afford to live at her sister's place anymore. We gave it to her with the idea that she had nowhere else to go, but she ended up just moving in with her fiance and used my spare bedroom as a storage space and refused to pay more to rent it out.
- She won't hang out with me anymore, call me, or text me, unless she needs something.
- She has stood by while her fiance and one of her sisters criticized me over minor things (2 separate occasions, one was over a joke about a band she liked and one was about a wedding color)
- I payed like $150 of her wedding dress when she couldn't afford it and just asked if I could come with her when she altered it (just to hang out cuz I missed her). She said ok and then she didn't bring me with her. 
- She is super codependent on my cousin (he's codependent on her as well) and doesn't go anywhere without him except work. I asked her for a girls night and HE SHOWED UP DURING OUR MOVIE. That was the last time we hung out and it was 4 or 5 months ago. I have asked her to hang out 5 times since then and she has never bothered to try to schedule to see me. 
I reached out and asked what was going on, had I done something wrong, etc, and she said no, but explained she has some mental health issues lately cause of some issues with her family last year (won't go into specifics for privacy, but it was really bad). I told her I loved her and we should hang out sometime soon. A couple weeks later I heard that the MOH may not be attending. We were all friends in high school, and she (F18) had moved out of state with her family. Her parents are extremely overbearing and won't let her get a job or save any money. They ALSO said that she would have to pay for the plane ticket herself. I really wanted her to be here and I wanted to see her again, so my other friend and I took it upon ourselves to doordash to save up for a ticket for her. We started doing that and told my cousin about our plan, but have not told the bride yet. AND THEN she told my husband she didn't want him to walk her down the aisle anymore (In place of her dad who's abusive), and she instead wanted her sister to do it (the one who kicked her out). Last straw. I feel rage everytime I'm out doordashing, knowing that I'm doing it for 2 people who have taken advantage of me and my husband so much. But on the other hand, I don't want to make the MOH sad and I really want to see her.

"AITA mom made me have a panic attack; because I was upset. To begin, today I had gotten into a conflict with a friend I truly cared about, it really made me upset. At the time I got out of my stepdad's house and settled in the car, pair of pliers in hand for my arts and crafts. I found that squeezing the pliers repeatedly was therapeutic to me, my mother piped up and said ""Why are you squeezing the pliers, it makes you look crazy."" I admit maybe it did but at the time nobody was outside and I kinda needed the relief.

So I put it down on my backpack as she seated herself next to me, then she proceeds to say ""Tell me what happened."" To this, my response was ""None of your concern."" I confess this was a rude thing to say but I wanted to make it across that I didn't want to talk about it. She called my discomfort to tell her something I wanted to keep to myself ""playing games."" I find this frustrating because she should understand if I don't want to tell her something, what I believe she should've done was tell me to tell her eventually not in my volatile state. after my constant refusals, She then proceeds to pry ""I got into a fight with a friend"" out of me. Which I consider a violation of my personal life.

After this I raise my voice asking her why needs to know because I too am frustrated she doesn't understand that at the moment I don't want her in my business which I admit could be seen as compulsive, she then proceeds to call my an immature crybaby and little kid behavior. I try to civilly explain I don't like her forcing me to tell her things I'm not comfortable with and saying something along the lines of ""I'm sorry, but I don't like it when you interrogate me like this, it makes me uncomfortable."" She then proceeds to yell and call me more names. This makes me internally panic and even more angrier that she's doing this when I obviously had a shitty day and I start to overthink about if I'm actually seen by people as immature and sensitive.

I go home and proceed to have a full-on panic attack, silently hyperventilating and crying. While she was in the kitchen cooking dinner, now let me elaborate; these panics don't happen often but it's only when I'm stressed and trying to hold it together does it have a chance to occur. She egged me on instead of comforting me, some reasons I understand while others I find apathetic to my emotions. But in the end, she made my shitty day shittier.

"AITA for asking my American friend to move on a bus? I don‚Äôt know if people know this but I‚Äôm certain countries on the bus and trains they have things called ‚Äúpregnancy seats‚Äù.

So he sits there and starts talking, I didn‚Äôt pay attention to where he was sitting until a very obviously pregnant woman came up 

She was waiting for my friend to get up after awhile she Politely asks for him to move because she was pregnant and needed the seat showing her ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a mom‚Äù badge 

My friend raised a brow and laughed telling her that just because she was pregnant doesn‚Äôt mean she needed special service 

At this point I notice the seat and I explain what a pregnancy seat is and that he Has to move 

He said no and I said ‚Äúplease move you‚Äôre being disrespectful ‚Äú

I got tired of his bull crap and gave her my seat which she highly appreciated since she looked really pregnant 


This made him more pissed and when we got of the bus he said that I was ‚Äúnot being fair to him since he‚Äôs human too‚Äù and that this country is ‚Äúfull of shit and that men have rights to‚Äù and he called me every name in the book for not taking his side and telling her to leave and he called me a ahole

"AITA for being silent during class discussions? My teacher pulled me aside for class yesterday and told me that I needed to start participating in class on my own accord and not forced to by him calling me, and that I needed to stop doing nothing in that class, because during discussions, I usually don't say a word. If I didn't, then he would make my grade a fail.

I don't talk during discussions, usually I just observe the group, jot down notes, and just listen to what my classmates are discussing but I never speak up, even when I have the answer that could be potentially right due to the fear of being wrong. I only speak when needed to, which is when he calls on me, forcing me to speak. Our class is an english class, where the students discuss the books that we've read to our teacher nearly every day. He seems to think that I'm doing nothing because I tend to look spaced out quite frequently, even if I'm listening.

However, i have tried my best to explain that I struggle to participate because I get quite anxious when speaking up, and that i still take notes frequently, but he would always call my explanations ""excuses"".

"AITA for asking my boyfriend to stay home from going out with friends? I just moved to my bfs hometown and have been feeling really homesick. I have no friends of my own yet and work from home, so have been feeling extremely lonely. Today he walked through the door and I got so excited - i‚Äôve really been going through it lately and haven‚Äôt felt this positive of energy in a few days, so it meant a lot to me. He even commented on how happy i seemed. We were hanging out and having fun when he told me he was going to go meet up with his buddies. I totally respect his individualism but tonight i asked him to please stay home. He said he had to go. My whole mood shifted and it was obvious i was upset but we moved on with dinner as if nothing was wrong. Now im sitting alone on the couch bawling my eyes out. 

I know im probably being a bit dramatic and i shouldn‚Äôt depend on him for happiness, but am i the asshole for getting so upset? 

TLDR; I just moved to my boyfriend‚Äôs hometown with zero connections to the city and am upset he went to hang out with friends after i asked him to stay home.",0.08

"AITA for telling my boyfriend I wasn't going to wash the dishes? Pretty simple story, throwaway because my bf uses reddit.

I (24M) live with my boyfriend (22M). Chores-wise, we don't really have assigned chores - we just kind of do what needs to be done. My boyfriend ""Liam"" (fake name) is super good about keeping the house clean and doing kitchen cleanup and cooking and stuff, but one thing he absolutely hates doing is washing the dishes. He absolutely hates it, but he does do it when needed.

&#x200B;

The other day, he made lunch for us, and as I was eating, he was cleaning up. Putting away dishes that were already on the rack, putting away spices and herbs and other stuff back in the pantry and the fridge, wiping down the counter, putting all the dirty dishes in the sink. He does all of that, then looks over at me and tells me to look at how clean everything is. I do, and I tell him that wow it looks great, thank you. He continues to smile, and says that now all I have to do is wash the dishes.

&#x200B;

So I kind of looked at him, and was like what? And he repeated that since he did everything else, I should wash the dishes, with this little playful/smug smile. And that pissed me off tbh. I didn't like how he was manipulating me and trying to get me to wash the dishes, and creating this whole plan to clean up everything else so that I would have to wash the dishes. I kind of raised my voice and told him angrily that I wasn't going to wash the fucking dishes if he was going to try and shittily manipulate me like that. Well that wiped the smile off his face, and he just kind of looked at me and then said he was going out. So I told him he needed to finish cleaning up and washing the dishes first. He again just looked at me dumbly, but then did the dishes and went out. This happened around 2 pm, and he didn't come back until 11 pm, which is very late for him and out of character, so now I'm wondering if I'm the asshole here.

Edit: To be totally fair to Liam, he did not ""order"" me to do the dishes or try to force me to, like some of you assumed. When he said all I had to do was wash the dishes, it was less ""You have to wash the dishes since I did everything else"" and more ""Since I did everything else, the only task left for you is washing the dishes"".

"AITA for getting onto my friend for Self Diagnosing Hello, I am quite young for this Reddit. I am a high school sophomore. However, I am in a scuffle for this certain situation, and I need to know if my friends are overreacting or if I am?

For context, I am part of a large friend group, around 13 people. The person who is the star of this conflict is my friend D. Now, D has a history of self diagnosing himself (he self diagnosed himself with DID when it was a ‚Äútrend.‚Äù D is like the center of the friend group, everyone always takes his side, no matter the situation. 

For example, almost half of the group took D‚Äôs side when a mutual friend (J) made a joke regarding my autistic childhood friend, saying that J didn‚Äôt mean what she said, completely disregarding my feelings and emotions of the situation. I get that D was trying to reassure me in that situation, and I could have communicated with him; I tried, but he remained a little adamant, he claimed that he will change. Keep that in mind, as we transition into the main story.

This story happened a few days later, after the school day was over. I was walking with two other friends, and D. I was telling a story about a funny embarrassing moment involving me mispronouncing something, and it was a good laugh from everyone. One friend made a joke about my horrible English which made me chuckle. D immediately saying, ‚ÄúYeah we all have an audio-processing disorder. I do.‚Äù
I asked him if he was diagnosed, to which he said no. I told him that he shouldn‚Äôt be self diagnosing, and unless he is actually is diagnosed then he shouldn‚Äôt be saying that he has it. I get it, I could have worded my case better; not many people have access to diagnosis for APD.

This situation has caused a major argument, with many people in the group calling me toxic. D, himself, has argued that APD is commonly associated with people who have ADHD (something he is diagnosed with). When that argument failed, he said, ‚ÄúI might as well not had depression when I was crying endlessly when I was 9.‚Äù However, several people defending me, but I don‚Äôt know what to do. I am so confused and scared that I am going to lose my friends.

So.. am I the assshole?",0.33

"AITA gf wants to leave family? 23 male have been with gf 19 for almost 2 years 

At Christmas gf got her first job in the hospitality industry. That job position was causing her to have flare ups in her feet, was unable to walk without pains. I tried bringing up my concerns, she brushed them off as nothing 

Recently her condition has gotten worse. One night while at work she dropped to her knees due to the pain, she couldn't hold herself up 

Family and I pushed her to go to Dr's/ hospital. She wasn't for listening to us, in a desperate attempt to help her, I made a chat with my family and her bff, talking of how to help, take away the option for her to go herself 

Later on I told her I wasn't planning to show her the messages, when she asked to see them I could see the hurt in her eyes 

Recently she says everyone has been ganging up in her for how I handled the situation, saying what was a private matter should have stayed between us 

Everyone is telling her to ""get over it"". She feels betrayed, like she can't trust anyone

"AITA for getting pissed off and angrily telling my mom I have absolutely no idea what she's talking about when she accused me of using uber with her card? Edit: I meant my mom is 49...

I (26f) borrowed my mom's (29f) credit card for gas because I'm a little short on money, and *only* for gas. I obviously have not used her credit card for anything else and gave the card back afterwards. She came downstairs as I'm eating dinner to ask me about some charges. She asked if I used her card for uber. I hate Uber but even if I like Uber, I have no reason to use it. Hell, I don't even have it downloaded on my phone. She doesn't use uber either. But lo and behold, there are 3 different charges from uber. I told her that I have no idea where those charges came from because I really don't. She is now adamantly arguing that I used her card for uber even though I repeatedly said I have no idea why she's getting charged. It took me almost screaming at her to get her to leave me alone. There's also no one else in my family who would use uber.

"AITA for getting upset with my mom about leaving the front door open, leaving my dog vulnerable to the busy street? I (f26) and my mom (f 58) got into a fight about her leaving the front door open. I am currently living at my moms house with my boyfriend (m28) for economical reasons, we are trying to save for a house and I am currently in school to hopefully switch my career. Last year we bought a puppy that was originally supposed to be a family dog (shared with my mom and sister) but we all decided that it would be best if she was just ours since we want to move out in our own again as soon as I‚Äôm done my program. 

Our dog is well taken care of and loved by everyone but there is a concern that we live on a very busy street with cars driving by quickly constantly. My dog is fairly well trained given her age but she doesn‚Äôt seem to be aware of the dangers of cars and I‚Äôm worried that if she ever gets out accidentally she could dart out impulsively after a squirrel or another dog. Because of this, we always make sure to watch her by the front door and we routinely check to make sure that the fence is sturdy (not that she‚Äôs very prone to running away but this is one of my biggest fears). 

Today, my mom had a friend stop by and they came in and my mom forgot to properly close the door, leaving it open a little bit. I could hear the swishing sounds of the cars and people talking very audibly from the other side of the house. My dog was in another room near the front door napping. Thankfully she didn‚Äôt wake up but she could have very easily gone to the front door and walk straight out. This is not the first time this has happened and I have asked her to be more careful with this. 

Usually I‚Äôm not so confrontational with her since fights with her tend to be catastrophic (threatening to kick me out, telling me she doesnt need me in her life), but this triggered my anxiety and I told her it was unacceptable for her to leave it open like that as this could mean life or death with our dog.

She blew up and said that she won‚Äôt live like that and that I can move out if I don‚Äôt like the door being left open sometimes. The fight escalated and she told me to fuck off, shut up and find another place. Out of anger I told her that if anything happened to our dog because of this I would never forgive her. I know I came off too strong and the way I phrased it initially came off as controlling but emotions definitely took over in that situation. 

If I could move out I would but financially I don‚Äôt have the means to just yet. I feel like I‚Äôm stuck and her reaction made me feel like I was unreasonable in that situation and that I can‚Äôt control life like that. Other than this issue the dog being with us hasn‚Äôt caused any issues. We pay for all of her bills, provide care for her when we‚Äôre working and my mom loves her company and chooses to spend a lot of time with her.

"WIBTA If I told this girl about how her boyfriend acts when she‚Äôs not around? I (High school junior) sit across from a girl in my math class who I know decently well. She‚Äôs a nice person- shares notes with people, helps even when not asked, generally kind. She‚Äôs accepting of everyone and tries her best to understand people and their perspectives. 
She‚Äôs been dating this guy for around two or three years now. I‚Äôve known him for most of my life. He‚Äôs generally alright when we talk, but he‚Äôs always kinda been off putting to me. Freshman year he told me how he was having sex, and then got upset when this cycled back to his girlfriend who wasn‚Äôt happy he was telling people. But that‚Äôs the worst I‚Äôve seen. 
My girlfriend, however, sits near him in her health class. She knows a lot of people, and they tend to be a lot less careful around her. He apparently will tell aggressive misogynistic jokes in class- specifically during our violence unit. I know for a fact something like this would horrify his girlfriend. He‚Äôs also said to just be a dick. He used to be in my math class as well, and nearly daily they would get in arguments. They generally seemed pretty miserable. He would ignore he boundaries, and then get mopey when she didn‚Äôt want to pamper him. 
She‚Äôs been making plan for her future- college, living situations, future business. I think she deserves the best and I just think he‚Äôs eventually gonna hurt her.

"AITA for not wanting my mom to let my kitten near our dog? A couple months ago, we got a dog. My mom loves him to death and I do too, he‚Äôs a sweetheart. The issue is he has a biting problem.

My mom thinks this is just because he‚Äôs a puppy, but I think he‚Äôs just going to grow up to be an even worse behaved dog. Anyways, that‚Äôs besides the point.

"AITA for getting angry at my dad for bringing home random women he meets? I (22m) live with my brother (21m) and my father (58m)ever since my mother (54f) passed away in 2020. So the back story to this is basically my dad was taking care of our disabled mom while she was in a retirement home but when covid happened things got super hard and she died summer of 2020 with her diabetical condition. It was really traumatizing for me and my brother before she died we were supposed to have an FT call with her and it was so unexpected. My dad, however after a few months started going out with random women and initially that doesn't seem like a problem but he kept bringing random women over to our house and doing sexual acts with them and it honestly makes me uncomfortable. I guess you can say that since it's his house he can bring over who ever he wants but he can't stand the idea of me bringing over a male date so I think that's a big hypocrisy from him. Random nights I would get up and hear my dad bring home a woman I've never seen in my life mostly the same age as me and this is the man who wrote love songs to my mom when he and her were dating in the 80's so I can't wrap my mind around how quickly he ditched her for way younger women and i can't help but think he was only taking care of my mom in her final moments out of pity rather than love because he'd often get annoyed of having to push her on a wheel chair and complain how much of a burden it is to bring her to places. I got the courage of asking him to not bring random women he meets at business dinners to then immediately fuck them when he comes home or just bring them to a hotel instead. But he got defensive and he said he's allowed to bring over whomever he wants. I haven't brought it up since but whenever I see him with a young lady in her 20's together it makes me uncomfortable.

Last night (the night before I had an exam) it rained pretty hard. My girlfriend is terrified of thunder, and ended up waking up in the middle of the night. She woke me up in tears and told me she was scared. This was a little over 4 hours before I had to leave for my exam, and once I‚Äôm awake it‚Äôs impossible for me to go back to sleep - she knows all of this. I was cranky from being woken up so abruptly but I stayed up to comfort her. I asked her why she was so afraid of thunder and what the thunder could possibly do to her, but she didn‚Äôt seem to know how to answer me. 

The whole time she was clinging to me practically shaking as the thunder continued to rumble. She kept calling out to me to check if I was still awake, though I guess she could tell this irritated me. She would call my name, ask if I was still awake, and then apologize for ‚Äúburdening me‚Äù. I told her it was fine and I didn‚Äôt care and I‚Äôm happy to protect her from the rain. This kept on until the rain stopped, which took forever, and my girlfriend fell asleep again.

When the hour of my exam came, I was exhausted, as I had predicted. I ended up not doing the best on that paper. 

I came home and my girlfriend asked how the exam went. I told her the truth, that it went horribly because I hadn‚Äôt gotten enough sleep the night before and I was still tired. She apologized to me and said it was her fault for waking me up, and I admitted yes, it sort of was and politely asked her not to do that again, especially since she knew I needed my sleep that night.

"WIBTA for confronting a kid talking about me behind my back  So, to put it bluntly, I (18M) am the gay guy at my school (I live in rural Australia, so there aren't a lot of students at my school, much less gay students). As many have pointed out, I am often more feminine than some of the women in my grade. I have even occasionally worn dresses and other feminine clothing on non-uniform days (again, Australian school), which probably caused this incident.

A few days ago, I was talking with two of my friends after school. Somehow this one guy in my grade was brought up in conversation, who we'll call Ricky. The thing you need to know about Ricky is he's got more than a few... controversial opinions. I won't go into too much detail, but understand we have very different moral standpoints. Anyway, he was brought up in conversation, and I, in humourous spirit, told my friends, ""I've never met Ricky and I already don't like him.""

One of my friends, we'll call him Steven, looks at me confused and says, ""Oh... Really? He talks about you a lot.""

I was shocked. I asked Steven, ""What does he say?""

""Just... backwards views on... identity.""

I know that Steven said it that way to save my feelings, which I can respect. But I truly don't know what derogatory stuff Ricky could be saying. Still, the nerve he has to have to talk about someone he's never spoken a word to behind my back. If he has an opinion about me, why can't he just say it to my face?

My school's actually fairly open-minded for rural Australia, and most people try to be supportive, which I am so grateful for. So I think that, since I've never met the kid, he might just be resistant towards something he isn't familiar with. Gay people have just never been humanised for him. I'm thinking of giving him a piece of my mind, so he knows his words can have a real effect on people.

But, as Steven reminded me, Ricky has autism, and isn't always able to understand other people's thoughts and feelings. Fair enough. Steven also says that Ricky can struggle with social interaction, so confronting him about it might not necessarily help, and perhaps worsen things. But I can't help but feel that inaction would be worse, as that's basically condoning it.

So, now I don't know what to do. Is it the right thing to do to confront someone even though he mightn't exactly know what he's doing is hateful? And should I even do it when I don't know exactly what he said? And how can I be angered by him talking behind my back when the only reason I found out about it was that *we* were talking about *him* behind his back? Would that make *me* TA? I'm not sure anymore.

Edit: since a couple people mentioned it, I should clarify. When I say ""confront"" I don't mean it with hostility. I would be sure to keep it civil. Perhaps I should have said ""discuss"" rather than ""confront""",0.11

My mom is the product of a summer fling between my poor unwed 16 yr old grandmother and her rich college age boyfriend. His parents paid my grandmother to give my mother away to keep up their families image. My mom for years has wanted to meet her bio father but he has zero interest in meeting her. Apparently his family has no idea she exists. She knows he has two legitimate children who are probably in their early 40s. One being a man with three adopted children. My mom has expressed just wanting to wait to make contact with her half siblings until her father is dead. 

WIBTA if I anonymously contacted my moms siblings and let them know they should take an ancestry dna test and that it might reveal some thing‚Äôs about themselves? (She has an ancestry account) It feels really unfair that this man has swept my mothers entire existence under the rug.",0.57
"AITA for not attending my SIL's wedding? My fianc√© (24M) and I (25F) got engaged in October 2021 and decided elope in the mountains just the two of us. We knew we could never afford a traditional wedding & it honestly wasn‚Äôt that important to us to have that. We chose August 3 2022 as our date & signed our contracts for everything in February. We chose to tell our families our plans as many were helping us financially in lieu of gifts. I told all our family & friends basically within a week of our contracts being signed. Our families seem to understand why we chose to elope & seem excited for us! My friends started planning a trip to Vegas in March for a joint bachelor/bachelorette and we determined everyone was available the weekend prior to our wedding, which is July 30-Aug 1. It is booked by my friend.

Now here lies the issue. Very end of April, my SIL (36F) texts my fianc√© & tells him to save the date of July 30 for ‚Äúsomething‚Äù they are planning. I think immediately it is a wedding. However, my SIL & her boyfriend are NOT engaged!  My MIL then texts us to ask if we heard the news, realized we don‚Äôt know what it is, & said it was obvious. Then I knew 100% it was a wedding. I‚Äôm thinking WTF, we told them our date in February & now they decide to get married 4 days before us out of the blue? I felt very hurt she didn‚Äôt come talk to me first. I would never have asked her to change her date, but some warning would‚Äôve been nice. It felt malicious, even if it wasn't meant to be. We talked to her & she confirms it's a wedding. She didn‚Äôt get why we were hurt AT ALL. She said they wanted to get married fast because her boyfriend wants to be married before having kids, they want to have her boyfriends dad see them get married as he has cancer & apparently that was the only date this summer that the barn they wanted for their reception was available. The ceremony is in their backyard. I get it, but I'm still hurt. Now I‚Äôm put in a super shit position. We have to choose between her wedding and our bachelor/bachelorette trip that is already booked & paid.

We made the tough decision that we would like to focus on our own marriage & go on our bachelor/bachelorette. We respectfully told her we wouldn‚Äôt be attending. She was completely pissed & didn‚Äôt understand how we were hurt about her wedding date & how we were put in a bad position. She told me & I was ‚Äúout of line‚Äù for the way I felt. She brought the rest of the family into it & against us. We had family members calling us telling that we should be sacrificing for family. We were told to change our plans or cancel them. We were also told that our elopement isn‚Äôt as important as her wedding because it‚Äôs a real wedding. We stood our ground & said no & that it wasn‚Äôt fair for us to cancel what wedding plans we had FIRST. Literally everyone in his family doesn‚Äôt understand our position at all.

So, AITA for not attending my SIL‚Äôs wedding?",0.1
"AITA for going on a keto diet during my wife‚Äôs pregnancy? My wife and I have an 8 month old daughter now, but after having very burnt Whole Foods pizza for dinner tonight, we‚Äôre reflecting on this aspect of the pregnancy.

"AITA for thinking he‚Äôs trying to manipulate me and maybe overreacting? Basically I‚Äôm going between friend groups atm. None of my friends seem to like me that much so I‚Äôm trying to hang out with new people. One of them I was particularly getting close to (I‚Äôll just called him possible jerk PJ). PJ has been pretty nice to me and the other night we called and talked. He told me about a lot of fucked up stuff he had done and it really started to remind me of my past ex who was a horrible person.

I then asked him if I reminded him of anyone. I kind of zoned out on his answer but he basically said this guy who he hated because he was a nerd and who just kinda hung around their group until everyone had to accept them even though nobody wanted to. I was out of that call pretty fast. He tried to text and apologise.

I told him that he knew I was feeling very lonely and between groups and he just tried to apologise again (I had opened up to him about one friend group shit talking me in a gc I wasn‚Äôt in). I then said

 ‚ÄúYou remind me of my manipulative, abusive ex. I sense all his shitty tactics in you. I don‚Äôt think what you said was an accident at all, I honestly think you‚Äôre trying some fucked up shit to make me insecure enough to keep hanging around you.‚Äù

"AITA for calling my classmate an idiot in a moment of annoyance? My theatre class had a substitute today, and our assignment was self-guided. Now, I absolutely adore my class and the people in it, but when our teacher is out, things get a little more chaotic. Not horribly so, just enough that I get overwhelmed.

Our assignment was a group activity, and one of my group mates was a guy we‚Äôll call B. He tends not to be very energetic in class, which is fine. But because our teacher wasn‚Äôt present, he spent most of the time sleeping on the floor. This annoyed me since for the group project, everyone had to act in some way.

At one point, another group came over to check on B. When they asked if he was okay, I said, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs just sleeping because he‚Äôs an idiot.‚Äù Looking back, ‚Äúuncooperative‚Äù would have been a better term than idiot. Anyway, one of my friends, who we‚Äôll call A, looked at me and whispered, ‚ÄúHannah, that‚Äôs not nice.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt say anything in response.

I‚Äôve apologized to A for my outburst (B didn‚Äôt seem to hear it). I just want to know if I‚Äôm an asshole here.",0.5
"AITA: My nephew's graduation vs support of my Fiance's exam Me and my Fiancee have been having a very difficult time in life. She suffers from OCD and GAD. We currently have been moving across country to start life in another city. But getting re-established has been really hard. Apartments are too expensive, hard to find, or just unlivable. But we finally have one and we move in in 6 days. For the last 2 weeks we have been staying at my brother's house and it has been beyond stressful. Too many people. Too messy too noisy. On top of the fact she is currently finishing the last stages of her PHD. Next month she will be defending. 

As a last minute requirement they are making her take an exam online and it's super important to have a good environment, Internet, computer, ect. Which isn't a problem because my mom has offered her apartment a good place. I was going to help as tech support and such as well because sometimes she gets really frustrated by computers. 

The problem is my nephew is graduating  from highschool the same weekend of the exam. My family is big on supporting each other and this is the first kid of our new generation that will be graduating. We all wanted to go in support. This has been a big deal for everyone and we all have been planning for months to go. 

Originally our plan was to make the 12 hour drive together in my car to get there as soon as her exam was over and make it just in time for his open house and graduation the following day. But as a last minute change of plans she decided not to go for personal reasons and stress. Which I told her I understood given the current situation. 

But gas prices have been crazy and my brother had space in his car. So to save money I was offered a ride with him and I wouldn't have to make the 12 hour drive alone back and forth. But I would leave the night before her exam. 

I wanted to discuss it with her and see if she would be ok with me leaving. It erupted into this entire conversation and a whole discussion about everything that has been happening and all the problems we had been having and everything I've done wrong and more. She accused me of not supporting her and being selfish for even suggesting it. 

I explained this was really important to me and my family and if I was going to go this was the best way. Plus gas is really expensive and this would save a bunch of money. She suggested that if gas is so expensive I just shouldn't go then. She should be the priority. Supporting her was the priority and it wasn't fair to leave her on her own especially with all the sacrifices she made for me. 

I tried to reason with her and I offered her the chance to call me or text me if she needed me. But it just got worse and she just told me to just leave we are done anyways. 

I did end up leaving and I'm writing this on my way to my sister's. But AITA for leaving her to go support my nephew at his highschool graduation?",0.06
"AITA Flatmates should not be friends? About 7 months ago my husband and I moved into a house with our friend. Ever since we all moved in together there have been nonstop issues. My husband and I tried to hit him up about him bailing on work as he hasn‚Äôt worked a full week since starting his new job 3 months ago. I said, ‚ÄúHey it‚Äôs not a good idea for you to go to cards tonight since you called in sick to work you can‚Äôt keep doing this‚Äù, and I got met with excuses and him flipping out at me. After my husband lost his cool at him my husband stormed off to which our flatmate turned around and said ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù to my face, even though I wasn‚Äôt the one who lost their cool. I have been waiting for an apology for 7 days and eventually told him to not bother, to which he flipped out, a lot was said including ‚ÄúYou just don‚Äôt know how to wait.‚Äù This was when I decided I was done with it and contacted the tenancy agency saying I wanted him out.

By this time, he had already given his notice to the tenancy agency. I get a call from the agency giving me all the information for him leaving the tenancy.

So in short, since my husband and I are pretty well off money wise he would harass us for not spending money on him, never went to work, constantly borrowed money, constantly complained about money, would spend all his money on cards then complain he had no food, never put things away after himself, didn‚Äôt help with flat inspections, he cleaned only the bath in the bathroom then didn‚Äôt do the rest so I had to do it, he didn‚Äôt do anything on our second flat inspection so I cleaned the entire house myself even though he was home for the entire day ‚Äúsick‚Äù from work (he wasn‚Äôt sick he just didn‚Äôt want to go), even though I had end of term assignments due that I was supposed to be working on, would constantly interrupt Luke and I while we were watching a film or a show, never cleaned his room, there is still dirty dishes and a pile up of rubbish in there, constantly overstepped boundaries with us even to the point where I had to tell him to stop touching my husband because it was making me uncomfortable and he acted like it was a joke, would constantly interrupt me while I was talking, would butt into conversations, harassed us for minor things like a piece of clothing being left in the bathroom even though he did bugger all in the house, kept asking if we could get his laundry in for him (I am not even kidding), to which we said yes a few times until it got a little ridiculous and we started saying no then he would get shitty.

My flatmate is 21, I am 27 and my husband is 30. We did bring up the bailing on work constantly thing a fair few times and he would get shitty every single time even if we brought it up calmly with concern. I attempted to kick him out last night, but he had handed in his notice before I could. I am still going to kick him out even if he changes his mind. I am pretty fed up. Did we make the right choice?",0.21
WIBTA for cancelling dinner for my boyfriend? [deleted],0.65
"WIBTA if I left a roommate agreement? I've had an agreement to room with a friend next year (formerly two friends- there were issues with our third), though we only really started looking at places recently. As we've looked, I've been having doubts about living together, even if we've already resolved some conflicts, like the general area we're looking in and overall cost range. We've now looked at places and are starting applications now, so if I'm dropping out, it's now or never (I would pay them back for any applications already put in, of course).

My current lease ends after theirs, which means that I'd be paying rent for two places at once for at least a month- they'd basically be moving in a couple months before me, and, reasonably enough, they don't want to cover multiple months alone. This wouldn't be too bad, but we live in a high-rent area, where most of the more affordable places are already taken (our fault for not looking earlier). My current place is relatively cheap for the area, which is nice. But, because of this, once all fees and utilities are factored in, it may very well be cheaper for me to live on my own than with them, especially since my current landlord wouldn't really raise my rent next year. It would save me the trouble of moving and buying furniture too (current place is furnished).

I also get anxious when future plans aren't settled, so because we just haven't had time to look for places together, I've done everything short of actually applying and signing for a renewed lease on my own. This normal for me, and I'd like to emphasize that I didn't enter into our agreement planning to back out- I literally researched the minutiae of housing history in my area when finding my current place. I like having backup plans, and I'll do this for any activity I participate in. But the more I look at it, the less sense it makes for me to room with someone this next year. Maybe the year after that, if we start hunting for places earlier and actually plan it out, but not next year.

I mentioned that I might drop out of our agreement for the above reasons. They were, naturally, upset, as they felt we had formalized an agreement, and they said they'd been relying on having me as a roommate. Which is fair. But as someone who is being financially supported by family, I'm extremely focused- possibly excessively so- on minimizing costs. I'm also far less spontaneous as a person, and am uncomfortable with waiting, especially as the other, cheaper, option that I'm looking at will effectively expire soon. I know there are places they could live alone too, having done the searches already, and I'd be willing to help them hunt. WIBTA if I dropped out now? Or would I just be somewhat rude but not quite an AH? I feel bad, but maybe not bad enough to guilt myself into staying.

TLDR: I'm thinking of leaving a roommate agreement for a cheaper, more convenient housing option at what is approaching the last minute. This obviously doesn't make me a great person, but would it reach AH levels?",0.3
"AITA for starting a fight between my husband and my step-son causing husband to lose friends? My step-son (SS) came to live with us when he was 14. His bio mom is out of the picture and the reason he had to move in with us. Not long after he stole some personal items of mine and I've never trusted him since. I tried to enact rules but they were negated by husband (out of guilt) and MIL out of spite. I include this for full disclosure, as when it comes to SS I am biased.

Husband and I share a hobby we've had before we met. We play D&D. We've been in a lot of campaigns all of which SS joined later. We usually play Mondays. Recently my younger son (bio) has joined as well. (Everyone is an adult and they live with us).

Now husband, SS, and YS play on Saturdays with husbands long-time friends. I was okay not joining in as I was busy caring for my dying mother and her estate. Now I am free to join some of the Saturday campaigns but I've not been invited. They take place in my home.

We live in a place so tiny that I have to spend my Saturday evenings in my bedroom lest I be in the way.

When I learned that SS just started a new campaign specifically designed to exclude me I expressed to my husband how I didn't think this was fair. That I should be allowed to play or have a campaign without him and with our YS. Husband thought this was fair and brought it up with SS.

SS blew up and they fought about a bunch of issues including the gaming one. Husband emailed the gaming friends that he was bowing out due to SS's childish behavior. Now SS is gaming without husband and my husband's feels that HIS friends chose SS over him and is considering ending friendships because of it (20 years). I feel like had I said nothing none of this would be happening. Hubby feels like shit right now. AITA?  


Edit: I think it's important to note after reading a few of the comments. SS is 29 and lives rent free as he can't keep a job. YS is going on 21. Friends have been our friends for 19 years and what really set hubby off to nuclear was SS demanding we pay his bills after we supported him for years now.",0.29
"AITA For Getting Upset About my GF‚Äôs Birthday Plans? My girlfriend and I had the idea of going to Disney land for her birthday for 3 days and getting a hotel for 5 nights to just enjoy that whole week off because Weber never done anything big for we other of our birthdays. She‚Äôs also turning 21 so it was sort of a bigger thing because of it. I had already book the hotel until she out of the blue decided she didn‚Äôt want to go anymore and would rather save the money (despite my constant reassurance that money would be okay and I‚Äôd been working extra hours to pay for it all without a problem.) I talked about it to make sure this is what she want and eventually she said said she‚Äôd rather have a small friends gathering. I was very much okay with this, obviously. So I ended up canceling the hotel booking. It was a month before so it wasn‚Äôt a big deal. 

Now, a week before her birthday I am told by her friend that my gf was saying how she wished we could go to Disneyland but that we didn‚Äôt have the money. Because of this, her two girl friends decided to surprise her with a Disneyland ticket on her birthday. At this point, all the extra money I had was used to pay some bills and student debt I had collected so there‚Äôs no way I can even pay for ticket to join them. 

I know it‚Äôs not her fault that her friends decided to surprise her. Honestly I‚Äôm not really mad AT my gf I am just upset bc this was supposed to our plan and now I just won‚Äôt be part of her birthday celebration because I can‚Äôt afford it anymore. AITA for feeling this way?

Edit: she currently doesn‚Äôt know that she‚Äôs going to Disneyland and full expects to have a friends gathering. Her friend just told me so we don‚Äôt plan anything on the day of her birthday, which I was understanding of. I just have to keep this a secret and I never can tell her how I feel bc I don‚Äôt wanna ruin her birthday. 

Again, Im not upset at my girlfriend as this is in no way her fault. Im just upset at the situation and the timing of everything. But I can‚Äôt help but feel like I shouldn‚Äôt feel this way.

UPDATE: She knew something was up with me when she got home and she got it out of me. I wanted to just be by myself for a little bit so I didn‚Äôt wanna talk to anyone. Her friend came over as well. 

I messed up when I left without saying and just as I walked outta girlfriend caught me and knew something was up. I originally just wanted to leave and be alone for a while and but she‚Äôs very good at getting information out of me. Once I started noticing she was getting mad at me for not talking, I expressed my feelings to her. I told her I‚Äôm not mad at anyone, just a little upset at the situation and that I‚Äôd probably get over it very soon as I am not someone who holds on to things like that. 

Well now her friend (and probably my girlfriend) thinks I‚Äôm the asshole. Granted after this conversation I had with my girlfriend, her friend (Lexie) called me and yelling at me bc I ruined her plans (which I did, and for that I‚Äôm sorry.) The thing is, it didn‚Äôt have to be this way. I just wanted to be allowed to be upset for a bit until I get over it, even thought about working a few hours extra to give her spending money on the day of. 

I know Lexie is mad at me for ruining her plans, and said I could‚Äôve communicated when she originally told me and they would‚Äôve paid for my ticket so her and I can go have our day. However, I wouldn‚Äôt feel okay with someone spending that amount of money on me so it never occurred to me and plus I think she‚Äôd have more fun with her girl friends instead. She even said I could‚Äôve told her and that they‚Äôd cancel. Really? Cancel just because of me? How could I do that and not feel terrible. I just want to be allowed to be upset for a day or two and get over it bc at the end of the day it isn‚Äôt a big deal. 

Mind you Lexie never knew of my plans, hence why I‚Äôm not mad. No matter how many times I say I‚Äôm not upset, she keeps saying that in fact I am? And that is frustrating.

They‚Äôre making it seem like I threw a tantrum by leaving without saying anything when I really didn‚Äôt, I just wanted to be alone and not have to talk to someone bc I am going through many personal issues and this one was the straw that broke the camels back.",0.37

"AITA for sleeping over at my friends place while in a relationship? A little background. I (19F) have had some issues with my boyfriend (22M) recently, as i feel like he has gotten progressively more jealous and possessive. 

It has been building up for a while, but really started to overflow a few days ago when this happened. 
I had been drinking with my friends at one of theirs apartment, and when the host got tired and asked us to leave one of my friends (19M) said he felt like he wasn‚Äôt done drinking, and asked me if I wanted to join him at a bar. 
I said yes as I didn‚Äôt really feel like going home yet either, and so we went on our way. We stopped a few places to sit and talk, and by the time we wanted to head off to a bar it didn‚Äôt make sense with the public transport anymore. 
We then agreed just to go to his place to drink instead, and did just that. 

The next morning I woke up, and all seemed fine other than my hangover until I texted my boyfriend an update as he had been texting me a few times throughout the night and I hadn‚Äôt noticed as I was drunk and on a pretty chaotic adventure through the city. 

At first he just seemed a little upset that I had forgotten to update him on when I changed locations (something he has asked me to in the past when I go out, which I have tried even though I find it weird as we don‚Äôt live together.).
But then went out to be quite angry when he found out me and my friend had slept in the same room, even though I explained I just slept on a mattress on the floor. 
He then said he gets uncomfortable by the thought of me just sleeping in the same room as ‚Äúother people‚Äù.

I feel pretty weird about all this as I feel like he is over reacting (he has been super passive aggressive about it ever since).
I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôve done anything wrong? But I‚Äôm starting to get confused, so please enlighten me with what you guys think. 
Did i cross the line? Or is he overreacting ?

(Edit: I just wanted to add that I‚Äôm bi so the gender doesn‚Äôt really matter, he says he feels weird about me sleeping over at my girl friends as well.
And second of all the reason I stayed over was because I don‚Äôt like walking from the bus stop and to my place alone at night as it makes me anxious, I don‚Äôt know if this matters)",0.53
"AITA for the way I handled a discussion about a tattoo cover up? If it matters, Im 25F and the artist is in his 40s

Long story short, years ago I got a medieval solider in armour tattooed on my thigh. It‚Äôs big and gothic and I love it. A friend pointed out to me recently that the armour in the tattoo has an iron cross in it. It‚Äôs big and bold and I‚Äôm mortified at the thought of anyone thinking I‚Äôm into Nazi shit. 

I contacted the artist on Instagram explaining the situation and he seemed to think that I was accusing him of being a Nazi and said he wouldn‚Äôt do a cover up because it would ruin the tattoo and he wouldn‚Äôt want his name associated with that. I approved everything and have just become more informed, I didn‚Äôt accuse him of anything but he blocked me. 

I used an alt account when I was checking to see if he did in fact block me, and he had screenshot our DMs and reposted them to his stories. He said something like ‚Äúthis woke shit is ruining our industry and freedom of artistic expression‚Äù

"AITA for not going to my boyfriends family gatherings I (F34) have been with my boyfriend (M37) for 3 years now. I should start with saying he is first generation Chinese American and I am an immigrant to the US. Our relationship is wonderful and things between us are perfect with the exception of one thing, I do not go with him to family events and this really bothers him. 

I come from a culture where you do not show up to someone‚Äôs home unless you were invited, this is especially true for someone you are romantically involved with. After we had been dating for a year I met his parents, my boyfriend invited them and me to dinner. It was a tough dinner since his mom hardly looked at me or spoke to me. I would ask her a question and she would look at her son as she answered the question. She made no effort to get to know me but his dad was very nice. I chalked this up to his dad being a typical American dad and his mom being from a different culture especially since my own mom comes off as ‚Äúcold‚Äù sometimes. 

Since this dinner the parents have not invited me to anything, not holidays or regular family functions. He has dinner with them 4 times a week and still no invitation. Sometimes they stop by my boyfriends house or we run into them in town, I always greet them well. Whenever he see‚Äôs them he updates them on the tiniest things in my life like a recent exam I took for work. But still no invitation. Each time my boyfriend invites me I ask if his parents invited me and he says they didn‚Äôt bring it up so I decline to go.

This weekend his extended family was in town and he really wanted me to meet his cousins. We went to lunch with just the cousins and the next night we hung out with them at his house. I really liked them and we had a great time. My boyfriend told me the whole family (he and his parents, the parents of 2 sets of cousins, and the cousins (12 people in total)) would be going to dinner that night and the next day they were going to have a BBQ at his parents house. He said he wanted me there. Again I explained to him I don‚Äôt feel comfortable just showing up to this family dinner or BBQ his parents planned but didn‚Äôt invite me to. He got upset with me and said that‚Äôs just how they are and they‚Äôve never invited his other girl friends so he‚Äôs sure they think he‚Äôll just bring me. I pointed out it‚Äôs been 3 years and it‚Äôs interesting they still think I‚Äôll just show up. 

I don‚Äôt think this is one of those situations of differing cultures. I think if someone wants you somewhere they will invite you- just like my family always mentions him by name and tells me to invite him to our family gatherings.

"AITA For Cutting my Hair and Going Against my Mothers back? (sorry if anything is wrong with my writing im a little new to reddit). First a little bit of backstory, I (15m) have been letting my hair grow out for quite a while. I always wanted to have long hair for a while and I finally convinced my mother to let it grow out. Well a little while ago I was told that I would be getting my hair braided. I (clearly not wanting braids) argued back saying that I didnt want to have braided hair and have been growing it out for my own stye and not whatever she said. she then proceeded to yell and send me to my room and said im getting them wether I wanted to or not. Me not wanting to get it braided decided to sneak out and go to a barber shop to get it all cut. I was thinking (I rather have short hair than braided). So I snuck back home. Once I entered my home, I was greeted with my mother in shock about my hair. She yelled at me, took all me electronics (except my phone) then proceeded to call me an asshole and a petty bitch for cutting my hair. I told her that it was my hair and I could do what I wanted to with it. I am now stuck in my room writing this now.

"AITA for asking my gf to shave her legs? Me (18F) and my girlfriend (17F) are going to prom together and are excited about it. We already picked out our dresses, but while mine is floor length she opted for a shorter one that would expose her calves. She has never shaved her legs and has told me that she never will for anyone or anything unless she wants to. She doesn‚Äôt have any religious reasons or trauma behind this decision, she just doesn‚Äôt want to. 

Now, under literally any other circumstance I don‚Äôt care about this‚Äîif she‚Äôs wearing shorts I hardly notice that her legs are hairy because it‚Äôs casual wear. However, proms are a formal event, and if she‚Äôs refusing to shave her legs I told her the least she could do is wear tights. She said that she‚Äôll check them out but it‚Äôs unlikely she‚Äôll wear them because she hasn‚Äôt really liked the way they looked on her before. This might be a more traditional opinion but I think it‚Äôs completely unacceptable to have visible leg or armpit hair during a formal event. Even men cover up! Because no one wants to see that. And sure its easier with male attire to cover up but there are still options for girls and she has refused all of them (also, she can‚Äôt wear a tux because her parents wouldn‚Äôt let her). 

I won‚Äôt refuse to go to prom with her if she ultimately decides to go without shaving or tights, but to be honest I‚Äôll be embarrassed, upset, and disappointed. I‚Äôll keep pushing for either unless she gets seriously upset about it. This is the one time I‚Äôd ask her to do something like this because it‚Äôs formal and appearances are important.

Edit: After reading through comments and sitting on it, the more I thought about it the more I realized I couldn‚Äôt stand actually persisting to my gf she wear tights or shave if she doesn‚Äôt want to. I still have the same opinion about it being informal, but not enough that I‚Äôll let visible leg hair ruin a night that‚Äôs supposed to be fun/memorable.",0.95

We get into town & got left at the airport as his step dad did not tell us he couldn‚Äôt pick us up due to work.. we let him know a MONTH in advance and then had to pay $75 for an uber to his moms apartment. Fast forward to the day before the wedding.. his grandma agreed to alter his tux as we have been tight on funds. We had to go take it to get altered that morning as his grandma said ‚ÄúI never said I would do it.‚Äù Later that evening we found out he was not invited to the rehearsal dinner (we knew he wasn‚Äôt in the wedding) so they all went to dinner without us & his mom had NOTHING in the house to eat so we had to order out which was fine but ya know.. what? The DAY OF the wedding his mom bickered at him so much about how he ‚Äúneeded to be a certain way‚Äù that he just went with it to shut her up. We get to the venue which btw we had no ride to until 20 minutes before as his family left us behind. Cocktail hr rolls around & he was not included in ANY family photos nor was he was not included in the after party. He got extremely drunk that night because well he was upset he‚Äôs been away from home for 5 yrs due to being over seas in the military (he got back to the states in 2019 & then COVID hit) and expected his family to want to spend time with him even though it was his sisters big day. Around 3am he was so out of it that he had a mental break and went off at his mom who turned everything he said about her. Ex: ‚ÄúI was just as hurt you weren‚Äôt apart of the family photos‚Äù ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you think I wanted you there‚Äù At this point I was fed up with everything and ready to go back home. I calmed him down and we went to bed. The following day we talked about what happened and I explained to him that what they did was a bunch of bullshit & I did not feel that this was in his best interest but I would stick by what he chooses to do as this is his family. He got upset with me for being honest & expressing how I felt like it was a waste of $450 to fly out there & they weren‚Äôt even around that much or had interest in including him in the important things. I also expressed how his mom felt the need to make everything about her when it had nothing to do with her. We are past it now but seriously AITA??,0.22
"AITA: Friend told me to pay a maid $140-200 for cleaning. I paid her 150 and now he's mad. I was house sitting at a friend's (we'll call him B and his wife C) house while they hired a maid to come clean it. Its 1 story house with 3beds, 1 office and 2baths. The maid cleaned everything but left the office room untouched as it was already well maintained. B told me that the maid charged $140 but is giving me 200 depending on how well she cleans. Once the maid was done, I paid her $150 when I was waiting outside on the porch so I didn't even go inside to check how well she cleaned. 

B comes home with C and for some reason, they're amazed by how much the maid had cleaned. So when they asked me how much I paid her, they got upset and asked why did I pay so low. Low?? She charged 140 and I gave her 150. How is that low?? She also cleaned for 2hrs if that helps.

They're making me feel like I'm unappreciative of lower class workers and I underpaid her. As if I'm supposed to know the market value for cleaning maids?? They started calling me heartless and greedy. In the end, they're gonna call the maid back to receive the remaining $50. 

I don't care how much they wanna spend but was I wrong for just paying the maid $150 when she was only charging $140?",0.25
"AITA for calling out my friends traditional opinions on the prom dress code? I am graduating this year and decided to become part of the prom committee and help the parents who run it, big mistake. The co-parents of the prom committee decided to implement the rules from previous years where grads from our school wear long dresses and suit jackets (for the gentlemen üôÑ) while dates from other schools or non-grads must wear short dresses and no suit jackets. 

I, AFAB, decided to wear a suit for the event because I was uncomfortable with being in a dress. My partner, also AFAB, is graduating from a neighbouring high school and was also planning on wearing a suit. When I found out that they may have to remove their suit jacket I asked my best friend since grade 7 (also a graduate) what she thought.

I was surprised to hear that she supported the idea of only grads from our school wearing suit jackets and long dresses because she thought  that we would stand out more and it was our ‚Äúspecial‚Äù night which she was excited about wearing her own moms dress to. I didn‚Äôt want to disrespect my friend so I asked if she would be okay with my partner wearing a suit jacket to the event, as they were uncomfortable with their shoulders or arms showing more than wanted (and were really excited about the matching pants and jacket). My friend suggested we invest in a blouse or something else for a top because ‚Äúpopular kids‚Äù may not approve of the jacket on a graduate from a different school. My partner dislikes blouses due to gender dysphoria and was compliant with the fact yet disappointed when I told them about it). I then asked again if my friend personally had an issue with it and was met with the fact that she did not want my partner to wear a suit jacket, not just a third party.

When I tried to point out the fact that not all grads from other schools wanted to purchase another dress or top for the occasion due to personal financial situations, consumerism,and environmental standpoints, I was ignored. Obviously this upset me so I went to our other friend for advice to which I was met with the same opinion on outfits and my partner wearing a jacket to our prom. My partner is saving money for school so obviously I felt bad about the idea of having to buy yet another thing for this event, as they were so excited that the suit hadn‚Äôt cost too much. I can‚Äôt help but feel this is because of their slight reservations towards my partner and is a means of belittling them in some form??

 I now feel like an asshole because of my opinion towards the event. I don‚Äôt want my friends to feel uncomfortable but I also don‚Äôt want my partner to feel that way either. I know they have been looking forward to this night for a long time and it‚Äôs the first big, real school event since the pandemic started; however, I don‚Äôt understand how someone else wanting to look nice and feel comfortable takes away from how they look. Shouldn‚Äôt it be considered respectful that people want to look their best for this occasion?

Both of their (my friends) outfits are beautiful and will stand out at the event but it‚Äôs 200+ grads, most people have a similar dress, and it‚Äôs not just THEIR prom. I understand not allowing grade 10-11 and older dates to not wear long dresses or a suit jacket because they can go out and buy a specific outfit or reuse something to wear to the event, but why force other grads to have two outfits just for two separate nights? My partner is open to the idea of a different long sleeved top but I can‚Äôt help but feel frustrated with my friends for being so stubborn about the whole situation. I hate that this type of drama and I want it to be over but I don‚Äôt want to give up so easily for both my partners and I‚Äôs sake. Now both my friends and I aren‚Äôt talking to each and I don‚Äôt want to start a reconciliation because it seems like such a weird thing to be upset about. Am I just inconsiderate towards others wishes or is this just a stupid rule to follow? Please help, Reddit. *sorry for all the edits, I should‚Äôve previewed it more first*",0.5
"AITA for not inviting my little brother to my birthday party? I, a 16F, have a brother(11M) called K. Him and I have been close since we were little, and we've done everything together! We've played together, got into trouble together, and were always there for one another when we needed it most. You see, I struggled making friends growing up, so I never really had much outside of my brother. I was always that quiet kid in class that just sketched on her paper in the corner, and never participated in class activities. 

However, that soon changed recently. Over the course of my Junior Year, I have finally made some friends; actual people who understand me and want to hang out with me, outside of my K! This feeling was amazing for me, and I started doing everything with them! We went to the movies, caf√©s near my apartment, and had sleepovers; again, it was amazing! Of course... that meant that I started to hang out with K a little less, but he was totally okay with it! He developed a group of his own at school, and they hang out more often ever since I started making friends! And, of course, my brother and I would have some sibling time together every now and then. 

But enough of that, onto the part where I feel like I'm TAH. In June, I have my 17th birthday coming up, and I want to go to this big trampoline park in our city. For the longest time, I've always wanted to go there with some friends and I feel like I finally have that opportunity! When I relayed the news to my family, they were more than happy to take me when the time comes! K was the most excited, and got amped up about*** jumping on trampolines. Sadly, I didn't want K to come as I just wanted to hang with my friends. I broke the sad news to him, and his expression changed swiftly to melancholy. He asked why, and I gave him the reason. He was upset, but told me he understood and left to go to his room. My parents, and my grandparents have been berating me since then, asking how I could choose friends over my own flesh and blood. My friends told me that I have to right to choose who gets to come, and so did K. However... my parents and grandparents beg to differ, and even threatened to cancel my party entirely. Help me, Reddit... AITA?

Edit: For those of you wondering why I don't want K to come, let me explain: my parents always see things like these as an opportunity to make me a babysitter for K. I want to hang with my friends, and, as much as I love my brother, I don't want to stress out and worry for him that something bad will happen. I'd be happy to allow K to come of my parents watched over him, but as I replied, they expect me, *and my friends*, to babysit him.",0.03

"WIBTA if I don‚Äôt get my boyfriend a birthday present? My boyfriend (21M) and I (21F) have been together for 1 year now. Everything has been going well, besides the typical hiccups that resolve very quickly.

So our anniversary is the day after my birthday. I personally don‚Äôt care about my birthday and don‚Äôt feel the need to celebrate it, but the anniversary is obviously important to me. I feel like it‚Äôs worth noting that I‚Äôm unemployed and on welfare so a majority of the time I have a hard time to even afford to feed myself. But I still managed to drop $100 on an anniversary gift for him. Not that the amount it costs for a gift matters but that I put effort towards it.

He spent months hyping me up about the present he was going to get me but a month beforehand, ended up saying he can‚Äôt get it because he has a lot of events coming up and isn‚Äôt sure if he can afford it. No problem, all I care about is some effort and thoughtfulness.

We were then supposed to go shopping with a friend of his but uninvited me last minute so that he can buy me a present there. I went over to his house later, the day before my birthday and gave him his present. That was when he confessed he didn‚Äôt get me anything. He apologised and claimed it‚Äôs because he has been distracted with work and moving. I tried to be understanding but I felt extremely hurt.

The next day I cracked and told him how upset I was. He clearly felt bad, apologised again and begged me to let him make it up to me the following Friday. That Friday came around and he was staying at my place and he was tagging along for my grocery shop. He clearly forgot about everything he said and was buying the materials he needed to make gifts for his friends. I didn‚Äôt say anything but unfortunately wasn‚Äôt surprised that he forgot.

I‚Äôve been feeling bitter about this the last few days. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm materialistic, it‚Äôs more about the thought and showing he cares. If he couldn‚Äôt get me anything, that‚Äôs fine. A card, my favourite chocolate or some flowers would have satisfied me. Just SOMETHING to show he cares. I gave him a chance for him to make it up to me and he blew it. There‚Äôs no way he can make it up to me now, this is a big red strike for me.

I‚Äôve been trying to figure out how to move past this and the conclusion I‚Äôve come to is just making it even and not getting a present for his birthday that‚Äôs coming up. I don‚Äôt know how he‚Äôs going to react. I feel like I can‚Äôt really talk about this to anyone and just want an outsider‚Äôs unbiased opinion to let me know if this is being petty and if I should just let it go.

"WIBTA if Me and my mom stop allowing my sister to use the family car after receiving a ticket? Using a throwaway account, english isn't also my first language so my bad if i don't make sense.

I (20M) was recently informed by my mom that my younger sister (17f) got a ticket using our family car. My sister begun using the car a couple of weeks ago to get to and back from her driving school, there hasn't been an issue except for today when my mom checked our mail and found a ticket. The ticket is $250 and its a school bus ticket from one of the days she was attending driving school (Failed to stop at a school bus) and once informing her, she insisted that while practicing on the road with her instructor, her instructor told her that just as long as the light aren't on, you don't need to stop for a bus.

Originially, both me and my mom thought she was lying but there has been issues with the school, the instructor either teaching her incorrect information, her instructor being late for her on the road practice and my sister even complaining that she feels like she's learning nothing since her instructor just mostly pays attention on his phone. Yet, We want my sister to face some responsibility as she currently doesn't work.

"AITA for telling my friend guy is stringing her along Hi guys, I (31F) have a friend (32F) who met a guy (35M) through online dating and they have been dating since January this year but not exclusive. Her goal in life (she said this herself) is to get married and have kids. She had two long term toxic relationships prior to seeing this guy and I‚Äôm pretty sure at this age she is worried that her biological clock is ticking. 

She‚Äôs been dating this guy for 4 months now but they are not exclusive and I think he is stringing her along. Whenever We meet I ask what‚Äôs the progress she tells me they are taking it slow and that he has been very busy expanding his business. She had a conversation with him on where they are heading to in terms of a relationship and he said he‚Äôs just been busy and he is exhausted from work and etc. She‚Äôs also asked him questions to get gauge his interest in her and she asked if it‚Äôs okay if she activates her dating apps to meet other people meantime. He said ok but she should not get intimate with them. Now that‚Äôs a red flag for me. It was also mentioned that lately their ‚Äúdates‚Äù feels more like friends hanging out rather than a date. 

She‚Äôs also shared that he ‚Äúis/was‚Äù a playboy and this to me is a red flag because obviously she is looking  for a serious long term relationship. She makes excuses up for him like his parents depend on him financially so he has to work hard, my response to this is that would that mean people who have their parents rely on them cannot have a relationship because they need to focus on work?
FFS he drives a luxury sports car and his parents are not living in poverty.

The guy also told her that she is ‚Äúokay‚Äù (as a partner) but that she tends to budge in whenever he is talking and can be rude sometimes. She said this is true and she realises she has flaws and isn‚Äôt perfect and should improve. To this I said nobody is perfect, and you can‚Äôt be improving yourself forever waiting for a guy to commit to a relationship and that she deserves someone who loves her for who she is.

She and I had a heated conversation about this and she said she will talk to him about these issues. I said what‚Äôs the point of talking to him because  nobody should be pressured into a relationship and if he wanted one he would‚Äôve committed himself in a relationship with her months ago. I said to her at this age we probably know ourselves better than when we were younger and id think if man is interested he would‚Äôve committed simple as that. And if he doesn‚Äôt then he is just not on the same page as her and she should just walk away. 
She asked me to calm down and told me ‚Äúdon‚Äôt be so negative‚Äù. AITA here? She tells me all these details and expects me to tell her what she wants to hear but I can‚Äôt so I‚Äôm negative? I don‚Äôt think we will be talking much after this because of this conversation.

TLDR : Told a friend about the red flags in a guy she is seeing and that he is stringing her along and got called negative and we‚Äôre probably not talking for a while or ever. AITA?",0.17
AITA for having this? [deleted],0.03
"AITA for outing my stepmom to her new coworkers? I don‚Äôt really get along with my dad that well but he has custody of me for a few months per year. The backstory is that my parents divorced when I was 8. My mom was having an emotional relationship tbf, but I'm pretty sure my dad was sleeping around a lot. I just have a lot of vague memories of him hanging out with nice ladies that weren‚Äôt my mom without my mom being there. Then one day he was like I‚Äôm leaving your mom for Shelly, the 23-year-old nanny you‚Äôve had for 3 months. And then was all \*shocked pikachu face\* when kid me wasn‚Äôt like ‚Äúyay can‚Äôt wait to live with my new Mommy Nanny Shelly‚Äù

I‚Äôm 16 now. It's been almost 10 years and I went to therapy and everything. I don‚Äôt really care about Shelly at that much either way, I blame my dad much more than her, if it wasn‚Äôt Shelly, it would have been someone else and eventually my mom probably would have left my dad anyway. But that doesn‚Äôt mean I like her or respect her that much.

She was having some friends from her work over which was really unusual. I came out for food and one of the coworkers waved me over to where they were sitting and started asking me how old I was and if I'd started applying to schools yet and stuff. I was feeling really awkward and just wanted an excuse to escape the room so I picked up my half-sister who was playing on the floor nearby and told Shelly I‚Äôd put her down. Shelly would normally say thank you but instead said like thank you in a really ott way and saying how great I was and how close I was to my half-sister and all this stuff. One of the coworkers was like ‚Äúyou two have such a great relationship how long have you known each other?‚Äù

Usually when they get asked the how did you meet question Shelly or my dad is like ‚ÄúWe met and just knew right away.‚Äù The age difference between them is obvious but they moved to a new city post-divorce (so did my mom) so it‚Äôs easy to not share the details.

But I don‚Äôt think anyone has ever directly asked *me* how *I* met Shelly. So I was like ""Oh Shelly was my nanny. Before the divorce.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt say it but I didn‚Äôt really have to. There was this long awkwardsilence and I left the room with my half-sister.

Shelly was really mad at me for bringing up the past like that, and I do feel bad because she just started working again. She has been a SAHM but now my half-sister is in school so she wanted to work again and actually start working in her degree field for the first time ever. So she really wanted these coworkers and this company to like her and I outed her even though she said all this nice stuff about me first which yes she was doing for her coworkers but it wasn‚Äôt totally made up like she said real true nice things about me. I don't know why I said what I said honestly, it was very embarrassing to her.",0.21
"AITA for yelling at my sister? AITA for yelling at my sister? My sister is a little prankster who likes to make a lot of stupid jokes and she mainly targets me even though I have told her to stop doing so. One instance was when we were walking home from school and she told me I ""was as red as a tomato"" and she then proceeded to take out her phone to take a picture. And then she put a filter on to make it look like I was smiling. So I yelled at her that I hated her after she refused to delete it. And then I also called her an idiot. She immediately told on me and after getting severely lectured by my mother I told her my side of the story. Where she left out that she had taken a picture of me which was what made me mad. And so my mother told me that what I did was wrong but also sided with me. To which my little sister said was ""very unfair"". AITA for that?",0.94
"AITA for Calling An Entitled Family Out On Their Sh!t? I (43f) flew home with my sons after vacation. It was a great, but super long, week. I got very little sleep and spent a lot of time on my feet. By the time we collected our luggage, I was beat and just ready to get to my car. We had to the shuttle station to take us to the parking lot. The wait was unusually long. 

There was family of three already waiting. Ten minutes after my fellas and I got there, another family with three children, including an infant and a toddler, arrived. I know that traveling with little people is a production, but this family had so much luggage and other items that you would think it was for ten people. I'm not exaggerating.  

Finally, the bus rounds the corner. As it  approached, I stated that we needed to make sure the first family to arrive got on first since they had been waiting the longest. However instead of stopping at the actual stop (as indicated by the sign), the bus stops about 15 yards past it right in front of the family with all the stuff and they are, clearly, poised to get on first, like others had not been waiting. Aloud but not directly to them, I said, ""Really? That's not right. They arrived dead a$$ last. That's so inconsiderate."" 

They stop moving and allow the first family to board. Then the mom looks at me and says, ""You go ahead."" I told her thank you and that I appreciated it. It was genuine gratitude. I was exhausted and in pain. Then, she followed it up with, ""You know since we arrived dead a$$ last. It's whatever, we just have the littles."" 

In my mind I'm thinking, 'Nah Lady, emotional manipulation won't work on me. My kids were that little once. I survived it; you will too.' 

I just continued boarding with my sons in silence. The shuttle driver asks the dad if they're waiting on a shuttle then tells them that one would be there in a few minutes. Dad says, ""That's okay. We wouldn't wanna be up there with that trash anyway."" I made sure he heard me say, ""You're welcome."" We pull off and I go about the rest of my day. 

It's one thing to ASK to go in front of multiple people who were there before you. But it's the selfishness, entitlement, and audacity for me. 
I definitely didn't have to respond to him calling me trash. But, AITA for calling them out and/or not letting them go first?",0.52
"WIBTA if I told a member of my family that we were visiting? At the end of this week, I (M18) and my family are supposed to be flying down from the US to Mexico in order to visit family, but this is meant to be a surprise. I feel the urge to inform at least one person, against the wishes of my mother.

For context, it has been 8 years since we were last able to see most of them, but a surprise just seems too far. Wouldn't they have to scramble to be ready for us to stay and change all of their plans? I think my mother is being unreasonable.

At the same time, it *is* supposed to be meant to be a joyful surprise, after the initial flash of anger and the visit will happen regardless. Would it be wrong to ruin that? It's wholly possible that the news would leak past any single person and my grandparents are not fools in the slightest. Telling anyone could jeopardize the joy. Or maybe there'd be anticipatory joy? 

She genuinely doesn't have bad intentions, and this would put potentially unnecessary strain between us. Still, it doesn't seem wise.

"AITA for yelling back at my mom for not respecting my boundaries? F/20 Yesterday I went to the gynecologist for the first time. My mom didn‚Äôt go with me cause she was gonna take our dog to the vet and forgot about my appointment even though I told her 3 weeks in advance. 

TMI but, I‚Äôm not a virgin. This is an issue because my mom is Catholic (so am I, but I‚Äôm not a ‚Äúfanatic‚Äù like the rest of my family) and she got mad at me when I told her the tests that the doctor performed cause she thinks I‚Äôm a virgin. Anyways, she made me feel really guilty about me going alone to the doctor and blamed all the ‚Äúunnecessary‚Äù procedures on me for not reminding her of the appointment. I shouldn‚Äôt have to, she could‚Äôve written it down on a piece of paper. 

What I got really mad about though was the fact that, after she blamed me about everything, she told my dad IN DETAIL about the procedures and what the doctor had to do (for anyone who doesn‚Äôt know they inserted a cotton swab and a finger up my‚Äîfor some testing). I immediately saw my dad from a distance get really upset and he wouldn‚Äôt look me in the eyes. It made me feel uncomfortable. 

I wouldn‚Äôt have been upset if my mom didn‚Äôt tell him about the details. 

I went up to my mom and told her that that‚Äôs exactly why I don‚Äôt trust her/don‚Äôt tell her anything. That comment started a huge fight that involved her yelling at me among other things, so I yelled back. She said that he‚Äôs my dad and that I‚Äôm a baby for not wanting him to know the details. Yesterday she yelled at me for about 30 min straight but today it lasted for about an hour and a half. I hate being back from college.

"AITA for leaving my date outside the club My date (22M) and I (22F) went to my favorite clubbing event that's hosted once a month. At that time, we had only known each other for about 3 weeks but we had a good thing going on. 2 hours into the event, my date got kicked out of the club for getting too drunk. I knew he got kicked out but it didn't occur to me to leave with him. In my head, the event would've gone on for another 2 hours and it would've been a month till they hosted the next event so I stayed on. While there, I tried to call him a few times but (he was on a foreign number so) he didn‚Äôt receive my call. I also peeked outside to check on him too and saw him chatting with other people so I assumed he was fine. When I came out, he got angry at me and said it was a messed-up/wrong thing to do.

It occurred to me then that I should have left with him or came out earlier. I apologized and realized it wasn‚Äôt a nice thing to do to a date but I didn‚Äôt feel it was deserving of a scolding (I guess I felt it was subjective because I would have understood if that happened to me). Although I get that I could‚Äôve been more sensitive/caring, I'm curious to see if it would be perceived as a messed-up thing to do or if it‚Äôs a gap in expectation/communication.

"AITA for posting a meme that spoils a recent movie trailer? SPOILER WARNING for the Dr. Strange trailer, if you haven't watched it yet.



So my friends and I got into a heated argument after I posted a Meme where it showed Professor X, I was then told to ""spoiler it"" as some people haven't watched the movie yet. We started debating as to why I needed to in the first place as the first trailer showed professor X in it and it has been almost a month since the movie came out. My friend argued that it didn't matter as some people avoid trailers as they have spoilers. My logic was that if someone was diligent enough to not watch any trailers or social media spoilers, they would have watched the movie by now. They said it didn't matter as some outliers are casual fans who don't have a direct investment in seeing it so soon but have some interest and would still not like to get spoiled.

"AITA for asking my girlfriend if something isn‚Äôt clicking in her head? I know the title makes me look bad but hear me out. I (15M) and my girlfriend (15F) have been together for 3 months and if you want to call it a serious relationship with only this context, fair enough but theres much more to it. I don‚Äôt want to say too much because she doesn‚Äôt want everyone knowing everything and shit so I‚Äôll only say a bit. So in every class we both have (we don‚Äôt have the same classes but we both have this after-school program because our parents work late) anyways so after each class we sneak out of our classes and meet in the school library for a few minutes and just talk and shit but each time she usually calls me short, mean, or annoying after each time. She says it as a joke but it really annoys me, so that day when we went to our program and she called me short I told her I wasn‚Äôt in the mood and she calls me short again, i snap and say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not in the fucking mood, is something not clicking in your fucking head‚Äù I said it loud but not loud enough that the teachers would notice, and everyone else was watching.

"WIBTA if I said my co-worker‚Äôs brother‚Äôs death ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt a tragedy‚Äù due to how preventable it was? Last week has been quite a disaster for my co-worker (30F). You can call her Aly, Ali, Allie, etc. but anyway I remember her being confident and content the day we went into work. Her brother Rhett (26M) would end up falling off a roof of his house hours later. From what I‚Äôve heard, he was conscious at the time of the hit and believed he was okay and that he felt fine so he didn‚Äôt call emergency services. Turns out he was really messed up internally and died and when I found out Ally‚Äôs brother died, I was in shock and saddened by her loss. I couldn‚Äôt imagine losing a sibling. However when I heard more information, I couldn‚Äôt help but think he was reckless. What was he doing on the roof? Why didn‚Äôt he just call for emergency services just in case? If that was me, I would have definitely have done that, especially knowing something like this could put my family throw grief and sorrow if it ended fatally. It was unfortunate that they had to lose him, but when I think of tragedy, he‚Äôs just not what I think of. Careless and reckless deaths don‚Äôt belong in the same context of ‚Äútragedy‚Äù as other types of deaths. Now, I would never ever say this to Aly but I‚Äôve considered venting this to other friends or co-workers but I just don‚Äôt know if they would see my point or not. Many of the co-workers especially seem like the type who would disagree with my stance but it only makes me feel it stronger in a sense. A reason why this would come off as asshole-type behavior is that Rhett was a minimum wage worker from lower-class income and he may have just decided to let it go because he was afraid of being in steep medical debt if he went to the hospital. I do see the point of how class would have an effect on his death but I don‚Äôt know if that was really his reasoning. I don‚Äôt know him well and I‚Äôm not a minimum wage worker. Would just simply venting to someone I knew who knew Aly or Rhett (other than Aly) be out of line or is it okay?",0.67

"AITA for telling my brother that he is wrong to exclude our niece from his wedding reception? My brother Martin was supposed to get married on 2 May 2020. We all know what happened with the pandemic. Things began shutting down across the world the same week the invitations were meant to go out. When it became clear restrictions on gatherings were not going to end soon Martin and his wife Tiffany ended up going to the registry office on their own to get married and told everyone not to make a fuss or bother with gifts.

Even though it will have been 2 years since they got married, Tiffany's aunt and uncle are hosting a reception and dinner for them this summer since their original wedding was cancelled almost last minute. All of my family, Tiffany's family and their friends are invited save for my 8 year-old niece Megan. The reason Martin didn't invite her is because Megan has a disorder known as Oppositional Defiance Disorder and he doesn't want her to misbehave and ruin the reception.

Megan's disorder does cause her to act out at times but I think excluding her when every other family member is invited is hard-hearted. It also ensures that both our sister and brother-in-law both won't be able to attend as no one will babysit Megan because of her disorder and so watching her always falls to one of them. My sister and my brother-in-law are invited, just not Megan. I couldn't imagine having to leave my child behind while no one else was excluded. I even tried to appeal to Martin and Tiffany as parents because they have a 6 month-old baby however they wouldn't be swayed and Martin got angry at me for bringing it up. I just believe it is unfair that all his other nieces and nephews as well as Tiffany's and even our/her cousin's children are invited. My understanding is that the reception and dinner are not a formal occasion. It's being held at her aunt and uncle's house in their garden and guests don't have to dress formally, so it's not the kind of event where you would need to worry about a disruption from a child. However now Martin is furious at me (as well as our sister and brother-in-law) for our requests not to exclude Megan. I want to know, was it really so wrong of me to tell him it is wrong to exclude a member of our family from the reception, especially a child?",0.88
"AITA for wanting to go to the movies with my bf‚Äôs best friend just us? I live in Ohio (18) and I met my boyfriend (17) in a friend group with several other people, we‚Äôve been dating for about half a year and are very close. We adore each other, and usually go on dates regularly. I love him and I think we will be together for a long time.

One of the people in this friend group is his best friend S(20) and him and I have also gotten closer. We hang out a lot, usually all 3 of us if other members of the friend group aren‚Äôt around. However, S lives in Texas. When I graduate, I wanted to go to Texas as that‚Äôs where some of my family lives and S lives nearby them. I was excited because it would be my first time meeting an online friend, and everyone else is excited too. Even my boyfriend.

Me and S started discussing things we can do once I go there and he suggested going to watch a movie. I liked the idea and I asked my boyfriend if he was okay with it, surprisingly he wasn‚Äôt okay with it. He said that he wasn‚Äôt comfortable with it, but he is fine with us meeting each other. S asked why not? He wasn‚Äôt going to try anything with me and he thinks it will be fun. My boyfriend said that he just didn‚Äôt feel comfortable with us hanging out in general, he thought we were just going to meet and go on our way.

S thinks that my boyfriend doesn‚Äôt trust him and is insecure. I don‚Äôt see the problem with hanging out with him, but I do understand why my bf wouldn‚Äôt want me to. S and I agreed we wouldn‚Äôt go to the movies and just put it past us, but My boyfriend has been distant from me because of it.

"AITA for letting an acquaintance use my place instead of my sister ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Background:
I have moved to a different city for work recently and I own a small house back home. The house was partially payed for by my parents. Originally the place was supposed to be a gift from my parents to me, but I recently offered to start paying them back as I got a new job and my financial situation is good enough to do that. 
My sister lives in the same city as my house is located, in an apartment she rents on fourth floor, without an elevator. 

So about a year ago, my sister had a pretty bad accident. Her leg was badly broken and she needed operation which included metalwork. Months passed and the doctors decided the leg improved enough that they can remove the screws. She was scheduled for the operation in the beginning of April. 

Meanwhile, at the end of March I found out that a coworker is having some issues at home. I reached out to them and found out that - let‚Äôs call them A. - need a place to stay ASAP because they have been kicked out of their house and they have been a victim of domestic abuse. 

Since the beginning of April was approaching the likelihood for A. To find a place to live earlier than from May was very low.
A‚Äôs situation was desperate enough that I offered to drive them home that very same evening we talked, helping them pack and to stay on my couch until things are resolved. 
They didn‚Äôt take me up on that offer but we met the next day and decided that A. can stay in my house in the other city. 
A. has a car so driving to work from the other city wouldn‚Äôt be a big problem. 

I offered A. to stay at my place because I know that statistically the risk of violence escalation in domestic abuse cases, increases when the victim tries to leave the relationship.  
I was determined to help the coworker because I believed their life could be in danger. 
Even though we didn‚Äôt know each other well as we‚Äôve only for worked together for a few months, I felt like I have to do something since A. trusted me enough to tell me about their problems. 

Anyways, when my sister found out that I offered practically a stranger to stay at my place without thinking to offer it to her first, she was upset. In retrospective, I understand why. She never mentioned it, but the operation to take the screws out of her leg was gonna leave her using crouches for minimum of 6 weeks time as the leg healed. Given that she lives on the fourth floor and there is no elevator, I could have offered my place for her to stay since there are no stairs. 
However it never came to my mind and she never asked. She only brought it up once she found out I offered the spot to my coworker. I refused to revoke my invitation and the place is too small for two people to live. 

I feel awful for the fact that my sister had to struggle for such a long time but on the other hand I don‚Äôt feel bad for helping an acquaintance, when I believed their life might be in danger.

"AITA for refusing to do more than the rest of my family? Throwaway for obvious reasons.

I(30sf) have a small family of 3. It's just me, my husband ""Dustin""(30sm), and our son ""Danny""(early teens m).

Dustin and Danny are slobs for a lack of better words. It usually takes me 4 hours a day after work to get the house straightened back up, laundry, dishes and dinner done. I'm sick of it. I do this daily with not a damn bit of help. I've talked to them, begged them, set chore charts, yelled, hid electronics, hid the wifi router, tried grounding, and not a single thing gets thru to them.im exhausted and quite frankly, fed up. 

A week ago, I started refusing to do more than they do on anything. They want a clean space, they better clean it, they want clean clothes, they can wash them, they want food. They can cook it. Neither noticed until yesterday when neither had clean clothes and you could barely walk thru the house. Honestly I'm completely disgusted and I've almost given in, especially during the fight yesterday. 

Danny was throwing a fit that he couldn't find something and Dustin lost it on me calling me an awful wife and mother. Dustin yelled that I didn't have to take it this far and I should have just talked to them. I yelled back that I had, that I've tried so many different ways to get them to pitch in and nothing works so I'm done, im not doing anything that they won't. Dustin took Danny and went to his mother's saying he wouldn't be back nail the house was clean and if it wasn't clean in a few days, he was calling CPS and divorcing me. I told him to have fun being his mothers problem. I now have my MIL calling me saying  this wasn't a healthy environment for Danny and I was a b word.

Danny came back home today and started cleaning the moment he walked in the door and crying that he didn't want us to get divorced, but Dustin is refusing to talk to me and has his mom constantly calling to chew me out.

"AITA for asking my sister to do the dishes? So my sister and I live at home still. We‚Äôre both in our early 20s. We both have jobs and graduated from school just so everyone has all the info. She works 9-5 at an animal hospital and is usually very tired when she comes home. Ever since I came home from my last year in college, my sister hasn‚Äôt really been doing her part with the dishes.The rule is that whoever doesn‚Äôt cook has to clean up the kitchen and handle the dishes. Lately my sister has just been leaving all the dishes I cooked with in the sink when she could just put them in the dishwasher. I end up doing the dishes because she‚Äôll leave them for days. 

I ended up doing it again earlier today. She just cooked so when I was done eating I asked her if she could handle the clean up herself because I did it when it wasn‚Äôt even my turn so it‚Äôs only fair that she clean the small amount of dishes she cooked with since I dealt with her whole sink full earlier today.

"AITA Neighbor taught my son a new word. Am I (36/W/M) an asshole for telling my neighbor (40's/B/M) to not say (his voice projects when he talks) the N* word every 3-4th word? Live in a PNW middle/lower class area In a very diverse community. I think there's another white family within a ten house radius. 

He's a passionate person as I have talked to him many times about random things and in all the years living here I have not have had one problem with him or herd him say that word before. Our interactions have been nothing but good. He's a pretty chill guy.

Out of nowhere he started talking on the phone or have his friends over on their back porch. I get it its his house, he wants to express himself cool. He is the only one that does it around here as others have commented on it. Me and my wife cuss sometimes and we try to set rules/context for our 3 boys about cussing. The two teenagers know but the 4 year old is still learning. 

My youngest son was in the backyard playing and as I'm walking back out from grabbing something inside I can hear the neighbor talking/yelling dropping N* left and right and I hear one came from a little kid. Before I could even try and correct my son the neighbor losses it and starts yelling at me that Im a racist and taught my kid to say that. Wait...WTF?

"AITA for excluding myself from my husband‚Äôs company? My husband started a business 3 years ago with just us two. He‚Äôd go do jobs and I‚Äôd basically be a secretary. My husband was getting more jobs than he could manage so he asked his brother to help. BIL was going on jobs so often that he gave him a permanent spot in the business. This took some stress off my husband.

We also have twins (5F) that I‚Äôm with all day. I‚Äôm currently pregnant with our third child who will be due in 3 weeks. When I was about 7 months pregnant, I asked my husband if we could get his parents to take over my job from now until I recover. He was for it saying ‚Äúdo what‚Äôs best for you‚Äù. His parents agreed but still wanted me to feel included. So I was responsible for advertising and printing things if they needed it (the in laws don‚Äôt have a printer at their house, they also said they don‚Äôt know how to use one).

Any time I would type up an ad or if I was printing something out, I would always show them before doing so in case they wanted to add something. Well, FIL always says ‚Äúeverything looks fine to me‚Äù but his mom found issues. One time I had to order more business cards and everyone told me to keep it simple. All I put was the business name, phone numbers, and the slogan. Before I ordered them, my husband showed his family what they would look like. MIL had a problem with the font, color, size of the words. Another time I was supposed to print flyers for a festival. She, again, found issues with the size, font, she didn‚Äôt like the way I worded some things and asked me why I only put her husband‚Äôs number. Basically anything that I came up with or any ads that I put together, she had a problem with it. I didn‚Äôt mind fixing it. What she‚Äôs saying isn‚Äôt really bad. It‚Äôs the way she says them.

The other day I made invoices and on one I forgot to put our return address. She made it a point to call me and ask ‚Äúcan you print me some blank invoices so I can write the address MYSELF?‚Äù
Last night my husband came home in an off mood. I asked him what was wrong and he said that him and his mom got into it because apparently she didn‚Äôt like the logo I made. My husband told her that I wasn‚Äôt going to change it, to which his mom responded ‚Äúif she made it look good to begin with I wouldn‚Äôt have said anything‚Äù.

Today I sat down with my husband to tell him that I won‚Äôt be involved anymore. I said he can take the printer and computer over to his parents house and that her constantly finding something wrong with everything I do was stressing me out. He said he understood and he would have a conversation with her. 

MIL called me berating me about starting an argument between her and her son. That I wasn‚Äôt helping anyone being a part of the company. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt bother asking for the job back because you just lost it.‚Äù I told her it wasn‚Äôt her decision to make, it was my husband‚Äôs.

"AITA for throwing away my sister's work equipment and ruining her business after she didn't want me at her engagement party? Context: My sister's makes and sells simple traditional outfits for women. At first she did it just as a side job and would sell her stuff to friends and family.  Approximately 2 years ago ago she dropped out of college to go full time and wanted to start by selling on Facebook groups and on our country's Craigslist.

After a year she decided to stop making the outfits because she was actually losing money. She was depressed for a while because it was her dream and something that she enjoyed doing. One day I told her that the pictures she was posting are terrible. I asked her to check with her friends if they want to model because a lot of people wouldn't buy her stuff if she keeps posting low quality pictures with bad lighting of outfits lying on bed. Then  I took some new pictures of her and her friends with the dresses.

I also made a ""brand"" for her and created new Facebook and Instagram pages which I managed. and I also helped her with ordering supplies and shipping. After two months or so she started getting a huge amount of orders and even though she spent many sleepless nights she was happy and for the first time started making money. I never took a cent from her and I even used all the money I saved on my summer job to pay for advertising on Facebook and Instagram at the start because I knew how much effort she put on her work and didn't like seeing her depressed all the time after she decided to stop.

Her engagement party is at our house next Saturday. Last weekend, she asked me If I could stay somewhere else during the party. When I inquired about the reason, she said that she didn't want me to get embarrassed if her boyfriend's family keep starring at me (I have burn scars on my face). When I told her I was okay with being present because I am used to people starring at me. She said she still didn't want any unwanted attention on her engagement day and it would be better if I wasn't there.

After she left the house with my parents to buy some things for the engagement. I took all of her stuff (sewing machine, fabrics, threads and the orders she was working on....) and threw them away. I also deleted all her social media accounts.

When they found out they were livid at me. My sister was crying and insulting me using some words that even bullies at school didn't dare to say, my dad informed me to better start saving and looking for a place because he was kicking me out by the end summer with my mom telling me that I should pay back all the stuff I threw.

When I told my other older siblings they were angry at them. Still my brother wanted to keep the peace and offered to send money to sister and talk to them about not kicking me out. My other sister was more furious and decided not to come to the engagement anymore and asked me to come live with her after I finish my exams.",0.4

The problem comes with this. Me and my wife have strong political beliefs and have decided to raise our children apolitically. When they have a politics/government related question, we answer smartly but try to see what my kids think and feel. When they are old enough to understand the nuance of politics we are absolutely open to having these discussions, but I think they need to be kids and think for themselves.

Apparently, last week when my kids were out with him, they drove by a tent city. My boys asked about it, and my brother explained, and tossed in some...more unsavory views about the homeless. While I haven't raised my boys politically, I have told them that they will respect anyone regardless of circumstances, yknow what I mean. It is basic human decency. 

When my boys came home and told us about it and started parrotting unkind things about people on government programs and the homeless my wife got visibly upset. She handled the conversation well but was clearly hurt by the words that came out of their mouths. She doesn't want them to go out with my brother anymore and part of me agrees, but part of me feels like kids are exposed to the opinions of the world and part of raising them apolitically is the fact that they might form opinions we disagree with.

"AITA for telling a woman who shamed me for eating ice cream that she is a horrible human being? I really like DQ a lot, probably more than I should. A medium chocolate dipped twist is my guilty pleasure, and I look forward to stopping for one on Thursday night on my way home from work all week long.

I would probably go way more often than one a week except that I am also pretty darn overweight, officially in the ‚Äúmorbidly obese‚Äù category (which is something I am very self conscious about). My bloodwork always come back fine and my Doctor says that I am pretty healthy but I still wish I could lose a couple of hundred pounds and I am pretty self conscious and insecure about it.

I HATE the walk from the car to the order window with a passion, I can feel the eyes of everyone sitting at the picnic tables and in their cars following me every step of the way there. I just KNOW that they are judging me for being a big girl and eating ice cream but I force myself to ignore it and try to feel good about myself any way. All that said I can‚Äôt bring myself to go more than once a week, which is probably for the best anyway.

Tonight I stopped by on my way home, finished ordering and was patiently waiting for my ice cream to be made when this woman (mid 30s, yoga pants, thin as a rail and with a snooty look on her face) walked past with a 7 year old kid in tow, the child made a face when he looked at me and almost at the exact same time his mother (I assume) said to him under her breath ‚ÄúSee, that‚Äôs what happens if you eat ice cream.‚Äù She was staring straight ahead when she said it and avoided eye contact with me.

I stood in shock for a minute and then had a sort of out of body experience where I found myself shouting at her. I told her that what she said was very mean, that life was hard enough without having to deal with bullies, and that she should keep her mouth shut if she had nothing constructive to say. I told her to go fuck herself a few times too. I finished by telling the kid that she (I pointed at the woman) was a bad human being and that it was better to eat tons of ice cream and be fat than it was to go around being mean to people for no reason. She stood there stunned the whole time.

I then burst into tears and ran off to my car and drove home, I didn‚Äôt even end up getting the ice cream I had paid for.

It‚Äôs been a couple of hours since it happened and I‚Äôve almost now stopped hyperventilating and crying, but I‚Äôm also sort of starting to feel bad about what happened. I mean, I know she was being an asshole, but the kid seemed pretty upset by the whole exchange and I really feel bad for swearing in front of a child (I think there were a few elderly women in the line too).

"WIBTA if I told one of my roommates he has until the end of June to find a job or get out Okay, so I (F21) have never posted before but I need some real advice here. Also I am on mobile so sorry for the formatting. Also, sorry for how long this is. 

Well the first couple weeks were fine, until the dishes were getting piled on every surface in the kitchen, including on top of the WHITE microwave my aunt had given me. So I told them they needed to keep the dishes in the sink if they didn't want to put them in the dishwasher right away.

Well that lasted a whole two weeks and then when I asked again H came up with the excuse that 'I have seen what his living situation was like before' and all I said was 'just try to keep the dishes in the sink.' After the dishes started piling up again I stopped trying to clean the kitchen once a month because the dishes weren't even the worst of it.

Each time I would go to clean it would take me close to 2 hours because they didn't clean up ANYTHING. The stove top was originally white, now it is red, brown, and black with spots of white showing through. When I called them out on this mess they said 'they would try to do better.""

H has held a job for a total of 3 weeks in the time we have been living in the apartment and at one point was asked if he would be able to babysit some kids which I said no to unless the kitchen was cleaned, their bathroom was cleaned, and the living room was vacuumed. They cleaned the stove top and then asked again if H could babysit and I said no because they couldn't do most of what I had asked of them.

H is home a solid 24 hours a day 7 days a week with one or two times he leaves to go to his mom's house while B is working 5 to 6 days a week trying to make enough money to save for a new place, afford rent and electric each month, and buy groceries for the 2 of them.

I have asked H multiple times to find a job or go back to school and each time he says he will I ask him how it's going a week or 2 later and he says he isn't interested in doing anything.

I have even tried telling B that the way he is letting H live and spend money he doesn't have is teaching him that he can do whatever he wants and someone else will pay for what he needs/wants. While B agrees with me he is too much of a people pleaser to do anything about it.

I am on my final straw at this point because we all had an agreement that if we were having anyone over we just shoot out a quick text to the group chat letting everyone know there will be company and the last 4 times H has had someone over I have been completely blindsided on my way out the door. (I am highly introverted when I am at home and don't like being surprised by strangers)

"AITA- destination wedding woes. TLDR: My best friend and I had a disagreement and I‚Äôm still very hurt over it. She expected me to pay for her stay for my destination wedding as a thank you for asking her to fly cross county to attend my wedding. 


I started talking about my micro-wedding/elopement since spring 2021(big wedding is supposed to be when the global situation  is over and post Global situation wedding craze is over 2023? 2024? I don‚Äôt know.). 

On Nov 7 when The White House announced that Italian citizens could come to the US, we decided to get married in January so my husbands mother could come from Italy and attend(she‚Äôs older and we didn‚Äôt want to put her through the stress of going to Mexico for two weeks in order to enter the US). I waited until she was in the US before booking anything this way we wouldn‚Äôt loose thousands in deposits-Photograoher and lodging was non refundable. 

The day my MIL arrived, I booked everything and called my best friend to confirm our wedding date and ask if she could come. She said yes. I told her we would arrive a few days before the wedding and if she can she should come so we can hang out. She asked about lodging and I told her she could do hotel or she could stay with my family and I at a house we booked and we would split it. I sent her the links with prices and dates and she says ‚Äúit looks beautiful. I love it‚Äù. I let her know who‚Äôs staying. that was the end of the convo.  (A little background- we have traveled three times for her birthday. Once we took a road trip in the Southwest US and we have gone to the US Virgin Islands for weeklong trips twice for two of her other birthdays. When we stay at an Airbnb with friends everyone splits everything, everyone pays their own way. When her and I stay in hotels together for getaways we split things evenly. She‚Äôs also travelled cross country twice for other friends‚Äô weddings and has stayed at hotels in order to attend the weddings- one of these I was a plus 1 and we split everything except the present so I know she has paid for her own lodging for weddings before) 


We talk about other things in between but a week before the wedding I remind her of how much it is (220 per night for CO ski town).  She tells me she was not expecting this expense because she was already spending 2k between flights, dress(I told her she can wear anything as long as she looks pretty and is warm because it will be outdoors in January) cab to airports and from, expected food and activity expenses. She lists all her expenses with price and sends it to me. I tell her I sent her the link with all relevant info before she decided to stay with us and she says that she‚Äôll have to find a way to shorten her stay because she has two rents to pay and other expenses (her bf pulled the trigger on moving in together last minute). I offer to pay her flight price difference and tell her that I understand if she needs to stay less time. She tells me I should have given alternative options and that she thought we were covering the lodging as a thank you for making her fly cross country in the middle of the week for the wedding.

AITA for wanting everything I gave back from my ex? [deleted],0.85
"AITA for being determined to make my parents separate? Hello!

My (18F) mother (42F) and father (60M) married each other almost 20 years ago. Despite the age difference, no one was pressured into it. In the beginning they had good relationship. My childhood was happy. My grandma, mother's mom, also lives with us. (70F)

By the years my parents' relationship declined. Being around 11, I started noticing their miscommunications and mom's unhappiness. Father seemed rather satisfied with everything. They argued often. There was a lot of teamwork and happy days. But I'd say they don't have a relationship anymore. They care for each other to a certain point and sometimes seem like good old acquintances. But that's all.

My father is kind, loving and intelligent, we understood each other a lot. At the same time he is stubborn and short-tempered. With age this issues became more visible along with alcohol use and bad hygiene. I try to dedicate more time to my family, but lately it feels like a chore with my father. There are many small annoying things he won't stop doing. Maybe I shouldn't expect a person to change in an old age, but some people actually try to accommodate. (for example, my amazing grandma)

I still love him very much and make efforts to change things. (like gifting headphones to prevent him from watching videos out loud (just asking didn't help much); discussing the themes he's interested in even if I find it annoying; being the peacekeeper of the family when there are arguments; defending him behind his back when it's needed; etc.) BTW he is not abusive.

I want them to separate. My mother wants it too, my grandma hates my father anyway. (it's reciprocal, but father could me more appreciative of his MIL, IMO) Why not earlier? They didn't want to hurt me and worsen family's financial situation since it has never been good, but...

I understand that putting father through separation can break him, that's why I could be TA. I know I will support him, care about him, but...

Me, mother and grandma discuss it often. Seems that I care too much. Maybe because for me he's my beloved dad and like a twin soul, but for them he's not ~that~ important. Though they admit he was a good parent.

Mother repeatedly tried to have a discussion. He's mostly in denial.

For around 2 years my mother is seeing other people. Mostly lightly romantic dates, but a few times they were not. I don't want to know the details. I think she deserves some happiness too. Maybe it makes my father sad (me too honestly) but he mostly has come to terms with it. Once while discussing it he accused my mom of trying to find a stepfather for me (I was around 17 at the time) and said he'd like to ""approve"" him before a relationship.

It really is lesser evil, IMO. Mom is respectful enough, keeps a distance. Hard to be offended when I see how wrong her marriage was from the beginning, stemming from daddy issues. It all doesn't align with my morals, but I won't sabotage it.

So AITA for being determined to make my parents separate?

Edit: Thanks for the judgement! I was able to look at it from different perspectives and I'll try to improve my ways of coping. I must admit it didn't change my general opinion about my family and I still look forward to the day we stop living together. But I'll try to be less invasive and just be there for my loved ones without trying to forcefully ""save"" them. I guess the best thing to do for my mental health is to live on my own in another place when I'll be able to.",0.84
"AITA for getting a mullet? My fiance (M33) has been giving me (F31) the silent treatment since I got home from the salon with a blue mullet.

My hair had already been blue, so that wasnt the surprise, the mullet definitely was.

I hadnt had my hair cut in over a year and decided earlier in the week to book an appointment. I've always thought that girl mullets looked dope as hell but was on the fence since it is such an out there look, and I was worried it wouldnt look good with my face/figure.

Decided to just go for it cuz its hair, itll grow back! And sure I dont look like the hot mullet girls I was looking at on pinterest but the blue looks even better than before and fuck it it's fun, I still think I look pretty cute.

I hadn't mentioned it to my partner beforehand cuz I knew he'd think it was dumb but I had said I was going to go shorter and radical.

Since getting home with the mullet he's barely said two words to me. Just stared at me flately. And it makes me feel weirdly guilty/insecure about how it looks.

I didn't think he'd be actually upset, like maybe laugh and call me an idiot but not this.

Should I have... warned him? Did I mess up by getting a dumb haircut?! Am I the asshole?",0.31

AITA for making my stepdad leave the TV so i could watch it? [deleted],0.86
"AITA for leaving the house every time my stepdaughter comes over? I (29f) have been with my husband (32) for 3 years. He has a 15 year old daughter, ‚ÄúAshley‚Äù from a previous marriage. 

Ashley had never like me. Understandable, as I also had a hard time when I was younger when my dad got remarried. I have tried to be as patient and understanding with her as I can, but she really tests my limits. She makes remarks about my weight and appearance, and will purposely do and say things to upset me. She will make nasty remarks to me like ‚Äúthis is why my dad cheated on you‚Äù when I do something she doesn‚Äôt like. It‚Äôs true he did cheat on me at the beginning of our marriage but Ashley constantly uses it against me no matter how many times I ask her not to. A more extreme example of her expressing her dislike for me would be when she stole my deceased sisters antique necklace from me and told me she had destroyed it and then LAUGHED when I broke down crying. She didn‚Äôt really destroy and gave it back to me saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs just a prank‚Äù. I‚Äôve caught her stealing my things before (like makeup and shirts) and putting them in her bag to take back to her moms. I‚Äôm constantly having things go missing but I hate to be the evil stepmother so I turn a blind eye and try to be patient. 

It really hurts because I always wanted a daughter and I really wanted us to get along. I‚Äôve brought this up to my husband so many times when she‚Äôs not in the house (so we don‚Äôt argue in front of her) and often he‚Äôs been there when she acts like this towards me but the most she ever gets as punishment is her phone taken away or he‚Äôll tell her mom (who does nothing abt it). It‚Äôs caused many arguments between us and put a huge strain on our marriage. He always says that she‚Äôs just a kid and is having a hard time but I always tell him that it‚Äôs not fair he won‚Äôt stick up for me and she‚Äôs old enough to tell wrong from right. Recently we got into an argument about it when she stole an expensive eyeshadow pallet of mine and tried to make acrylic paint out of it because she saw someone do it on tiktok. I told him that if he won‚Äôt stick up for me then when she comes over, or set any boundaries I‚Äôll simply just leave to eliminate any conflict. He called me childish and stupid but I upheld my promise and the next time she came over I packed a bag and left to stay with some friends. They and my mom agree with me but I‚Äôm not sure if they‚Äôre biased just because we‚Äôre friends.

At first I tried to get her to like me and often took her on shopping sprees and restaurants etc. but I‚Äôm at a point where I can‚Äôt continue to feel like a doormat in my own home. AITA?

Edit: the reason I am so tolerant is because #1: I don‚Äôt want to be that person that resents their own step kids and #2: I‚Äôm infertile and have always wanted children so I kept holding out hope that we could have that we could have that bond

Edit 3: maybe I should add it‚Äôs not all my husbands fault. A large part of why Ashley doesn‚Äôt like me is probably because her mom doesn‚Äôt like me. She‚Äôs rude asf to me whenever I see her and I have no doubt she tells her bad things about me.",0.2
"AITA for telling my daughter‚Äôs dad to put his foot down? Me (24F) and my ex (24M) have a 1 year old together. We live separately, but my daughter goes to his house (he lives with his mom) on the weekends. His mother constantly ignores the boundaries I try to set for my daughter, such as no braiding her as (her hair gets matted because his mom can‚Äôt braid correctly, causing it to fall out), no more than 1 nap per day and it can‚Äôt be anytime after 5pm (she has a habit of waking up in the middle of the night to play) and letting her go outside more, but using sunscreen. I try to keep my daughter on a sleep schedule, as well as get her used to eating different kinds of foods. 

Ever since she was born, my ex‚Äôs mother has been trying to take over how we raise her. She feeds her all organic food and doesn‚Äôt allow her to eat anything else, let‚Äôs her nap whenever she wants to because ‚Äúshe‚Äôs a baby and she can do whatever her grandma says‚Äù, and yells at her dad for trying to be a parent. His mom micromanages everything he does regarding our kid. She doesn‚Äôt respect boundaries and she‚Äôs talks down on our parenting. 

Today, she let my daughter sleep from 3pm-7:30pm. Her bedtime is 8pm. I told my ex to put his foot down because I‚Äôm honestly fed up with her not respecting my boundaries and rules. I explained that if she was going to keep this up, I would limit how much time she spends at their house, but he can always come see her at mine. I, also, explained to him that I was trying to keep her on certain habits for a reason. He got upset and said everyone is going against him regarding his kid. He says he can‚Äôt control what his mom does and I‚Äôm being too hard on him. Now, he won‚Äôt speak to me. AITA?

"AITA for starting to go out so soon after the breakup with kids father? So I F(23) have been together or at least was together with my ex M(24) let‚Äôs call him Dave for 5 years from when I was 18 and he was 19 till recently when we broke up. The whole reason of us breaking up and why we led to break up is a long story so all I‚Äôll say is that the relationship just didn‚Äôt work anymore. I will admit I was the toxic one and I never put my hands on him or anything like that but I would always raise my voice give attitude Etc. etc. We have 2 kids together and are still living together 

Now we have been separated since Easter Sunday and we were actually planning to get married in October, my dress had even been purchased. Now since the break up I have started going out and not necessarily enjoying the ‚Äúsingle life‚Äù but doing the things that did before I met Dave. I want emphasize that he NEVER forced me to stop doing the things that I liked but I stopped because I wanted to be with him. I would always try to plan dates and outing and just fun stuff for us to do but he never wanted to. Me trying to just want to be with him didn‚Äôt mind not doing those things as long as we got to hang out. Well he‚Äôs kind of been giving me the cold shoulder since I‚Äôve been going out again. I‚Äôm honestly just starting to get to the point where I don‚Äôt care what he thinks and just want to go out and enjoy the years that I wasted just being at home. I‚Äôm not talking to anyone seriously nor do I plan to but I feel like he thinks I am. I guess my question is as stated above am I the asshole for doing things so early on into the breakup?

Edit: Because I guess this what not clear in the above post I AM NOT DATING NOR AM PLANING TO I go out with friends and that‚Äôs it y‚Äôall I still love this man but our relationship just didn‚Äôt work we still are a team and our kids always come first we just don‚Äôt kiss hug or show affection anymore but we still hang out as friends and still talk about our days and so on and so forth we both go out and sometimes I even take my kids with me and have play dates with my friends we are a team I have his back as much as he has mine",0.77

"AITA for not helping my homeless friend? I had a friend from hs, we had a falling out 5 years ago. I cut her off and recently started talking to her again this year. She has had some rough months which ended up making her homeless and estranged from her family. 

I felt sorry for her at first and gave her help which consisted of giving her rides, her using my hotspot, and buying her food with my ebt. This was the first few instances but then she skirted around some details about getting kicked out. She wouldnt tell me, she would just start crying and then check her messenger. Then she would just be scrolling through her messenger and completely ignoring me. I offered to buy her food and took her to a store where all she bought want was candy and iced tea.

I then offered to put her things in my storage which she did and was thankful. I tried to help her get her ID so she could find employment and gave her money for it but she put her important docs in my car so we would have to meet up to get anything done. For the next few weeks she would constantly text for ride and when my days off were, and it wouldn't just be 1 trip, she would be asking to go to multiple stores all over town which would take alot of time out of my day. Yesterday I asked her when she wanted to get her ID and she ignored me then said well let me find out what docs I need and how much it will be and I'll let you know when I dropped her off she grabbed her docs.

Today she asked for a ride again. I told her I can try to later in the day, I ended up getting caught up and when I checked my cell she had blew me up, getting angry with me, saying its my fault she can't get anything done and I shouldn't tell her I'm going to do something if I'm not. She asked if she could come get her things out of my storage I said yes.

To be honest I was tired of helping and her thinking I was at her beck and call whenever she wanted. She was rude and never acted like a friend when we were together, she would just ask me for my hotspot password and ignore me. She made it obvious i was just a ride to her so I don't get why she got upset when I wasn't in the mood to drive her around again. Also not to mention, she is ablebodied, I would understand if she wasnt and couldn't get around well, but she would literally ask for a ride up the street from her current location. She is more than capable of walking to the places she needs to go but she always had this attitude like she couldnt get around if I wasn't giving her a ride.

Personally I don't think she was interested in helping herself. She was getting money somehow but everytime I would take her to stores she was buying random things like peroxide and glass cleaner, or butane for her dab rig. I get you're going through a hard time but your priorities arent straight. She has mental illness issues, but it's wrong if you think that's an excuse to manipulate and use people who are trying to help.

"AITA For expecting partner to find better Employment So me (38F) partner is (50m). We have been together for 14 years. We have a very strained relationship. More like roommates at this point.  I'm currently disabled with a myriad of health issues (mentally & physically). My partner is a pretty typically aged with some limitations on physical abilities and also has ADHD. He was on disability when I met him for ADHD, depression, anxiety. But is not currently. He decided to be self employed which he has done on and off for his entire life. Reselling. Had a Antique store for a while. That closed right before covid because traffic was slow and had been struggling for a while. So during the whole time he puts pressure on me to run /help with his business. He knows nothing about online posting, selling online, taxes, using banking. He has relied on me to do it. We would get into fights if I tried to suggest he learn how to do it.  I get helping him is part of the relationship to a degree but I feel like I'm doing his job. Lots of resentment because all of this causes me a great deal of stress. SO the past 3 years his income has been very dismal. Bringing in less than $600 a month . Sometimes only $200.I wasn't worried about it as much for 2 years because his mother lives with us and was helping with household expenses.  But her husband died and she took a $600 pay cut. Because of the pandemic I took forebearance also for close to a year and a half. We had an extra $850 a month between all of us. Not to mention I got him several loans for his business to, he had stimulus checks as well and did not attempt to open another store (which is what he wants).

So that's all ended now. I warned him that if he didn't make at least $500-700 a month it's going to get pretty bad financially. We all have to contribute to make it easier for everyone. That it is putting extra burden on me and his mother to where we are covering all of the bills and we have nothing left for ourselves. He gets very defensive and tries to devalue my income and hers ( says it's free) and I suggest him finding a different line of employment or expanding his education on his business or something else. He says he can't work for someone else due to ADHD and he refuses to file again for disability. Refuses to educate himself. I'm at a loss. I can't talk to him in any manner about it blowing up into WW4 and he tries to shift it all back on me, gaslights me, be littles me. It's my fault his business closed  It's my fault things aren't listed. I have scaled back what I do, reasonably so. He uses my mental illness against me that I'm being unreasonable and ""poking"" him when I'm just trying to get him to do something else. I'd say I bring it up once a week, maybe less. SO is it unreasonable for me to ask him to contribute financially more in whatever it may be?  I'm not even asking him to match my income. Things here are getting dire with increase in everyday living expenses. And I'm kinda ""stuck"" in the situation because all of my immediate family is passed and there's not very many places I could live on my income alone.",0.43
"AITA For Wanting My Wedding Guests To Pay for Their Food? I just got engaged (I would say yay but my parents have made it hell). We have finally picked our wedding venue but budget has been an unspoken issue. We haven't settled a budget with my parents because my parents keep dodging the question and keep saying they will ""find a way to pay for what you want"". The venue is 1k but it is $86 per person for food and $26 per person for drinks. 

I have a REALLY big family but I only want to invite close family and friends but my parents want to invite extended family as well as my parents friends. Our guest list is looking 100-150 (the venue can hold 150 comfortably and 180 pushing it) (this is also not including my parents list and they have a ""wait list"" for when people say no). My family aren't rich and we live comfortably in our means so a 20k wedding isn't super ideal so I thought that guests should pay the $86 for their food to ensure their RSVP and save us 10k+ for this wedding. 

My parent are LIVID about this idea and think nobody is going to pay that. I said that's fine, if nobody wants to pay that then they won't attend and the wedding is cheaper. They think we should find a cheaper venue and cut down the list.

"AITA for wanting to skip the wedding in a few days even though I'm the maid of honor? My bestfriend is getting married.
She did not want a Bachelorette Party of Bridal shower which is Maid of honor job.
She hasn't really communicated to the bridal party about the day of the wedding other than what dress she wants the bridesmaids to wear. (We paid for our dresses). She didn't say anything about shoes or jewelry etc. 

None of the bridesmaids are meeting before hand, there is no rehearsal. No one knows who their walking with or anything. As someone with major social anxiety, not being prepared is a HUGE triggered. Especially standing in front of 50 people. 

She asked me to stay in the bridal suit with her the night before but then changed her mind and did not tell me (I have a toddler, I have to make arrangements for this stuff). My younger cousin is graduating high school the day before the wedding so, I'm thankful I asked for a graduation ticket last week. It's insulting that I could have missed out on a family event and been stuck at home as a result of her being unorganized.

She has changed a lot of things frequently and not showed up on days where she has finally asked for  help and she did not say she was canceling any of the times. She just did not show up. This has been anything but an honor. The bridal party is basically paying to attend the wedding. Nktjing makes us different from the guests. She could have canceled the bridal party and just asked us all for help decorating. (Very low budget wedding with a baby on the way). The bridal party wasn't even aware they'd be paying for their own dresses, hair and makeup. I had to tell them so, some people did dropout as a result.

I've told her thousands of stories about our friendship, but Riliane was traveling this year, so I haven't had a chance to formally introduce them. But then, two days ago, Riliane called me saying that she would be back soon, and that she wanted to spend a few days with me. 

I talked to Fiorella about this, and she loved the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãfinally meeting Riliane. I confirmed that she could spend a few days in our guest room, and everything seemed fine. 

Until, when Riliane arrived, she jumped on me to hug me, kiss me on the cheek and greet me in a singsong voice. 
She called me by a very sweet nickname that we created years ago, and then Fiorella sighed in exasperation. 

The rest of the afternoon was too awkward, but when Riliane went out to get a soda, I asked Fiorella what the problem had been. 

Her response was: I expected her to be ugly and rough, not pretty, loving and sexy. Why does she call you Prince, darling and diva? I told her it was an inside joke, and that she tends to obsess over people and be overly affectionate. 

But my girlfriend was upset, and said that I had to tell Riliane to stop ""bothering"" me. But I said that I love her, and that she has supported me in my darkest moments. That I will not leave her. 

Was I the asshole? Fiorella hasn't spoken in hours and Riliane is back, but I don't want her to know about the argument because she might cry.",0.57
"AITA for not offering to split a prize with my GF? My GF(19F) and I(18M) are both in college and drink coffee from a certain shop that gives prizes if you pull open a tab. 99% of the time, it‚Äôs a pretty shit prize like 5% orders over $50 and stuff like that.
 
On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, she gets coffee for both of us. The other 4 days, I get for her. On Friday, I find out that my prize is that I get a free drink under $10 daily for an entire year. I‚Äôm obviously ecstatic because it is pretty cool.
 
Today, I get a more expensive drink for me, while I get the regular brew for her. She seemed really pissed for the entire day. She eventually said that she feels like I should give the prize to her or at least split it because we‚Äôre dating and she brought the drinks that day.
 
For precious prizes that she has won, she never gave them to me. She won a dozen donuts a couple months ago and I got precisely 0 of them. 
 
I just said it‚Äôs not her prize because I won it. AITA?",0.78

"AITA I don‚Äôt want my mother to join us on our vacation? My(51f) husband(56m) and I like to vacation in Colorado where I used to live. My brother lives in the same area and I still have lots of friends there.  It is geographically between where I live and where my mother lives so it makes it easier for her to see us this way.  We used to go out for a month and a couple of those times my mom and stepdad (both 80) would come out for a week to visit.  Now, we are only able to vacation for 10 days and don‚Äôt want to spend it entertaining my parents.  They can‚Äôt do the hiking and fishing my husband and I enjoy.  We both are so busy with work we want to relax, do our own thing and not worry about what we are all doing for dinner etc..

"AITA for not letting my son go to football camp with his boyfriend? My son Kellan(15M)  has always wanted to play football like I did, but I've never let him until this year because I got constant concussions which still affect me today and I want him to aspire to be more than just a football player.  This year he begged me  to play especially since his bf DeShawn (15M) was  also trying out this year and that he'd do whatever it took. I talked to his mom about and she got me to relent. I did tell him though that he had to keep his grades up and I told him that he had to tell his coach anytime he so much as got dizzy.

He kept up with the latter and he made 1st string and I was proud of how well he played but his grades started dropping some and he was having trouble keeping up with football and his grades. I gave him a warning that if he didn't get his grades back up he'd have to quit and he assured me that he would and I trusted him.  His coach wants Kellan and DeShawn to go to a football camp this summer , but I found out that Kellan barely passed this year.

I was pissed and I told him he couldn't go. He's been pleading with me to change my mind and I've said no. The camp starts next week and he's made one last plea and I told him no because he wasn't keeping his grades up like he promised he would and he told me he wouldn't need school in the NFL and that I was just jealous I couldn't make it. I got upset and told him he was being disrespectful and he yells at me that I'm being unfair because he still passed his classes and stormed off. My wife says I'm being to hard on him . AITA?",0.07

"AITA For Siding With My Son Who Had An Affair Over His Ex Wife? I (M 58) have a son Gerard (33) and a daughter Jackie (35).¬† About three years ago, Gerard's marriage to his then-wife Alice (32) failed because he had an affair.¬† It was a troubled marriage on both sides. Probably wouldn't have lasted much longer anyway, but be that as it may, I'm embarrassed¬†by Gerard's actions, it was wrong, and there is no justification.¬† Needless to say, they did not part on good terms at all, so it is good they do not have children.¬†

Before the divorce, they were together for about ten years.¬† Jackie and Alice were pretty close.¬† Gerard and Jackie haven't spoken much because Jackie has not forgiven Gerard for the affair and Gerard hasn't tried to patch things up with Jackie because he considers it none of her business. Alice moved back with her family after the divorce in another state, but recently returned.¬† Gerard has been in a relationship with Kylie (28) for about two years and recently got engaged.  Kylie was not involved in the affair.¬†

Things came to a head this Easter.¬† Normally, I always hosted with my wife before she passed.  Our family was never particularly tight knit, but not contentious either.  So we only really got together for holidays with a handful of extended family.   Originally, Jackie and her husband were going to host.¬† However, she told me that she invited Alice and her new man to come.¬† I asked her why she would do that.¬† She said it is because Alice was like a sister to her for years and she has nowhere else to go. I asked her about Gerard, and she said that he can come if he wants, but she'd rather have Alice there than him. It got back to Gerard.¬† He and Jackie talked about it and he declined the invitation to do something with Kylie.

I called Jackie and told her that I was very disappointed with her decision.¬† What Gerard did was wrong, but the marriage is over and it is time to move on.¬† Jackie then said that Alice was her family and that her decision was final.¬† I told her, if that's how she feels, I can't tell her otherwise.  I liked Alice too. If she values Alice over Gerard, she's a big girl and can make that decision.  But I choose my son.

I then told her that I originally wasn't going to host anything for Easter because I thought she'd host a family dinner where all the family could comfortably attend.  But she's not, so I'll host one and invite Gerard and the extended family.  I told her that she's of course welcome.

So, Gerard and Kylie quickly accepted the invitation as did the extended family who cancelled on Jackie. She then blew up on me since I was siding with Gerard over Alice, even though he cheated.¬†

I told her that Gerard is not a child for me to discipline anymore and I can't get involved in his relationships especially one that ended three years ago.  Also, father doesn't abandon his children--even if they screw up badly.  Which she should also be grateful for due to her own reasons which I will not publicly disclose (not cheating).¬†

**EDIT**\--Two things come up which I should have noted.  First, we are Russian (American) Orthodox. Our Easter is really our big family holiday, and closer to what people think of as Christmas.

Also, something that keeps coming up is that I'm asked about is favoritism. Ironically, I put this together in an attempt to avoid favoritism.  Jackie's event was something that nobody could expect Gerard to come to and Jackie knew he'd never come if Alice were there.  So, if I went to Jackie's, I'd be showing favoritism to Jackie by going to an Easter which he wasn't really welcome.  

Gerard made some grumblings about putting together an Easter at his house and not inviting Jackie.  I told him I would not go to an Easter where Jackie isn't welcome.  

So, me putting together an Easter at my house where everybody was invited was the best I could think of to avoid favoritism.  Maybe you'll tell me it wasn't the best idea, but it was the best I could find.  ",0.25
AITA for wanting my boyfriend to put an end to the girl that likes him? [deleted],0.75
"AITA for questioning how my sister has the money to buy so much property? Throwaway account. My (52M) sister (48) has recently purchased 3 plots of land in two different areas, plus a house in another area. I know this because this is all my mother talks about when I talk to her. My sister lived on the poverty level during her 20s and early 30s. My mother has paid many of her bills throughout the years, including stuff for her child (she's a single mom). Just 6 yrs ago, when my father fell ill (parents are divorced), my sister called and asked me for miles so she could visit him across the country, which I did. My mother paid for the next trip for her, which was the last time she saw him. Note I have a bad relationship with my sister. She's an abusive bully. I usually keep my distance from her and rarely talk to her. 

I'm scratching my head trying to figure out if she won the lottery recently or something. After hearing all of the exciting news about my sister's property for the 500th time from my mother, I asked my mother how she could afford all this. Well, apparently one plot came from a good deal she got from a friend, and she sort of let it slip that my sister's partner (on and off for several years, but on now and living together for the last 4 yrs or so) is paying for a lot of it, but once had to go through bankruptcy and isn't able to get property in his name, or something like that. Not really sure the exact details -- don't really care. When I mentioned that this really isn't that much to get excited about, my mother got really defensive, and I should be happy for my sister, and blah, blah, blah. Personally, the nonstop talk about my sister's properties is annoying. AITA for asking how my sister can afford all this property?

And if anyone needs to know, I own an apartment and have never had my mother pay my bills for me.",0.75
"WIBTA if I asked my family to cook for me? I (20F) live with my dad (61M) and my sister (26F). I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm a picky eater, but I really hate tomato, prawns and coriander. If there‚Äôs things I don‚Äôt like say squash, I‚Äôll still eat it. But those three things I‚Äôve never liked. It just so happens they both really love those. 

I don‚Äôt like red pasta sauces (ketchup is fine it doesn‚Äôt taste like tomato to me) pizza I am fine with as there‚Äôs usually other ingredients that overwhelm the sauce. But red sauce pastas physically make me feel nauseated. I cannot stand the taste of tomato, it is probably my least favourite thing to eat. 

I am fine with cooking my own meals but I just can‚Äôt find the time when I‚Äôm studying for my exams. I really just wished they‚Äôd make some food during this time. They do both work, but there are so many meals we all enjoy. 

Whenever I cook food, I have to make it to their liking. I am fine with that, but recently it‚Äôs getting to the point they‚Äôre intervening my cooking making the whole process annoying. 

For example I like to make a parsley and mushroom pasta. I add less cream for my dad, more egg for my sister, more mushrooms for my dad (my sister and I prefer more ham and onion), less parsley for my sister, and less baby spinach for the both of them. I barely add salt in because then my sister will complain but then my dad complains there‚Äôs not enough salt same with pepper. My sister has stopped eating my pasta because dad wants more parsley and she doesn‚Äôt like parsley, so I sometimes just make a carbonara. 

I feel like when I cook, it has to be to their standards, and they expect me to cook when they can‚Äôt. I am fine with that. I‚Äôd just wish they‚Äôd cook for me during exam period or at least the days I don‚Äôt have time. 

So would I be the arsehole if I asked my family to make dinner for me?

Edit: I do not use ketchup in pastas. I meant it is the only sauce with tomato that I like. I am not a barbarian. I would never put it on pasta.

Update: I decided to cook a meal and told them not to eat it. If they do I will crack the shits. I was going to say something but they got all shitty I was cooking dinner a bit late and so I just kept my headphones on. 

I have no idea what I‚Äôve made. I just found all the shit around the freezer and pantry I could mash together. The best way I can describe it is a gnocchi scrambled egg with hash brown and peas beans and broccoli. Yep. It tastes fine. Not healthy but the lettuce I saving for a healthy lunch tomorrow.

AITA for yelling at my family after my grandma had to put her dog down? [deleted],0.91
"AITA for not wanting to spend my week away from school with my grandmother? I (14M) was told that I had to spend most of my week off of school with my grandmother. Me and my brother (10M) are already here but I'm thinking it over and I'm not sure if I am actually the asshole.

The reason I'm staying here is because my mother and her partner (not my father) are staying with my mother's family because of her partner, ‚ÄòM‚Äôs, birthday that was last month. Me and my brother had been supposed to stay with my mother's friend but she had to deal with family stuff. We were told a few days before we had to leave that there was a change of plan and we were staying with my grandmother.

She is my bio father's mother and is very *old school* as literally my whole family says. My main issue is that she refuses to accept that some people are queer, trans, etc. and will not use correct pronouns, names, etc unless prompted. I've been out to her for about half a year yet yesterday she still called me my deadname and used she/her. It's not the first time but it's very annoying. She is also ableist and won't do anything to support me or my brother's autism or ADHD. She calls us weird for getting overstimulated and shames us.

The reason I think I'm the asshole is because when I was first told, I practically broke down screaming because I did not want to stay with her; I practically begged for them to cancel the trip, let me stay at home alone for the week (which I could do fine) or even with my mother's other friend, who id stayed with a few years before for other reasons.
   My mother knew all the things I didn't like about my grandmother yet wouldn't cancel the trip because they were ‚Äúalready looking forward to it‚Äù. M called me selfish and thought I just wanted to ruin their trip because I had a bad relationship with him. That wasn't it at all, I just didn't want to stay with a woman who made me feel like shit. I just feel like it maybe was selfish to ask them not to go just so I wouldn't have to see her, but I've had no contact with her for months and she's still as small-minded as she was the last time I saw her.",0.12
"AITA for expecting at least a card from my in-laws for our wedding? My husband and I got married 2 weeks ago.  After bugging him over the last 2 weeks, he finally sat down with me last night to open the cards.  We didn't do a gift registry and posted in our FB event that we didn't register, monetary gifts are appreciated, but not expected.   We just wanted everyone to come and enjoy a good time.

I got curious because we got cards and some cash from almost everyone, except from his parents and 4 siblings.   I thought it was odd that we didn't at least get cards from them.  The money was absolutely unimportant.  But I felt it telling that we received nothing at all.  Even a card.  I thought perhaps he had spoken with them before and told them not to do anything.  If that was the case, I should have been told this as well so my messaging to my family could have been the same.  Make no mistake, I was not expecting money, but cards would have been nice as a keepsake.  

His mother was bent on us sending a thank you card to one of her friends the day after the wedding for her attendance, card, and money gift.  If she is so invested in the etiquette of a Thank You card, why was she not as invested in a wedding congratulations card?  

I asked him about it just now, which then proceeded to be an absolute blowup.  Now I'm the bad person for hoping to get something from them.   I asked him if he specifically told them no to do anything, he said no.  I was fine with that.  I accept the fact that they didn't give anything and think nothing less of them for it.  But that wasn't enough.  I've done something ""foul, unacceptable,  and rude"" by wondering.  

 So, am I the asshole here?",0.25
AITAH for playing video games while my wife cleans? So Sunday night ends after a day of going to the beach and having alot of fun for the holiday weekend where before going to sleep my wife and i talk about cleaning and doing yard work monday. Today rolls around and my back is feeling a bit off [back has been out to where I can't put on sock or pants for 4 weeks due to pulled muscles and a pinched nerve] so I get out of bed and go to the store at 7:40am to puck up 10 bags of dirt for the new garden we are putting in. I finish at the store and spread the 10 cubic feet of dirt and just am in agony to where I'm just  ready to sit down and relax. It was about 9:10am at this point where my wife comes out of the house and says okay time to clean the house. Tired and in pain I tell her I need to ice my back and take one of the muscle relaxers that I was prescribed. She looks upset and goes inside snd sits on the couch. I hobble in and empty the dishwasher and put the dishes in the sink in . At this point she just tells me to go take the meds and ice my back. So I went to my chair and tood my meds and put a ice pack on my back and turned on a video game because I knew my med really makes me sleepy and I'd probably pass out. Next thing I know it is noon and she is just livid due to cleaning while I was playing video games... so am I the ass hole for taking 3 hours to ice my back while she cleaned the house.,0.18
"AITA for saying my bf‚Äôs sister was being a hypocrite? I (27F) have a family history diabetes, so because of this I avoid consuming unnecessary sugar, which in turns means I drink diet sodas every now and then (very rarely, tbh). I also do not drink alcohol and neither does my bf (29M) mostly for health reasons. I have a bf whom I love and have been seeing for about two years. I‚Äôm not sure how the conversation between them came up, but one day my bf‚Äôs sister and him had a conversation about diet sodas and aspartame and she basically seemed to convince him it gives people cancer (which has been I think largely been contested scientifically). Now, my bf‚Äôs sister is a pretty regular drinker. She drinks alcohol often, not to excessive amounts usually because she has developed a tolerance, but I‚Äôd say she has a drink at least 4 days a week.

When him and I were at the movie theaters he was not wanting to share a diet soda with me because of this, and we‚Äôre not exactly rich so we didn‚Äôt buy a second drink at the movie theatre. He shared with me what his sister said about aspartame and I essentially said something to the effect of ‚Äúwell that‚Äôs a bit hypocritical being that your sister is a pretty regular drinker and alcohol is a *proven* carcinogen.‚Äù My bf seemed to take this as me launching personal attack against his sister. I apologized to him and he accepted my apology, but I am still slightly confused why #1 he did not see my point of view or #2 why the comment made him so upset so as to basically ruin our night.

"AITA for basically telling MIL she can't watch my son.  My(34) wife(34) is on the kidney transplant list right now. Doing dialysis at home daily. Her potassium and glucose got out of wack, which caused her to pass out. I was at work when my neighbor messaged me that my 5 year old son was at their house. I dropped everything and drove home. Wife passed out on the living room floor. I'm freaking out. So I had to get my wife off the ground, down some stairs, and into our vehicle. Then go over to my neighbors and thank them for watching my son. Thank goodness nothing happened. So drive my wife to the ER. Her sister meets me and grabs our son so I can stay with my wife. My wife is out of it right now. Can't understand alot and is confused easily.  If you have glucose issues, I'm sure you would understand.  My wife gets a room and they start giving her medicine right away after her blood work. Her mom calls her, in my opinion should have called me, and starts telling my wife that she will take my son to tball the following day and what would happen this weekend. This was Friday, today is now Monday. It was late Friday by the time she got a room. I'm stressed out big time. And my wife was not 100% understanding what her mom was telling her. Idk if her mom knew what my wife's mental state was, but in my opinion, she should have called me. As soon as they hung up, my wife tried telling what was going on, got mixed up and confused....so I told her to call her mom back and tell her I'll be taking my son to tball and I will be taking care of him/arranging someone to watch him. Now I was a bit heated. MIL was basically telling my wife what was going to happen,  not asking. And MIL didn't even bother to ask about my opinion or include me in the conversation.  With that and the fact wife was out of it a bit,  I was pretty angry. MIL and myself have clashed before. My wife has Lupas and it's been a consistent battle throughout our marriage, 14 years.  MIL is a take charge person, which in alot of cases, is very useful. All I wanted was to be involved in what was happening with my son. We havnt had an issue like this in awhile. And this was a very stressful and sudden situation.  My wife was doing pretty good this week and Friday morning seemed tired but ok.  to say, I was stressed and probably didn't handle the situation the best way possible. But I know how my MIL is and it immediately pissed me off. Now MIL is pissed at me and of course I'm the asshole. She takes zero responsibility in anything and points the finger at me. She's been bothering my wife, while she's trying to get better, about why I was an asshole and that my priority should be my wife. Now, my wife is my priority right now, but my son is a very close second. And I believe I should have been involved in any arrangements to watch him this past weekend.

"WIBTA if i deleted all my moms photos? I (15M) and my mom (50F) switched phones a few months ago. She was having trouble with her phone and gave me it instead, reset my phone, and started over on my old phone. She didn't ask for my help with fixing it, and honestly i had no idea what was wrong because she never gives me her phone for any reason, but i fixed it as soon as i got the phone. She left everything on my phone, and about 900 photos in the gallery she hasn't sorted yet. I gave her my phone to go through them, but she wound up going through my messages and grounding me. she maybe sorted through 20 photos before grounding me and stashing my phone behind her coffee. Whenever i bring up the gallery, or really anything that isn't entirely easy to think about, it becomes a fight to simply get the point across because the moment i mention the photos she starts crying and ranting about ""...i take hits"" (real quote by the way). I use my photos a-lot, and the storage is completely full because it maxes out at 1000 (or so i think.) she has pictures from the beach, pictures from her trip to New York, of the bird, me, the cat, my dad, my sister, and of herself. She had the opportunity to get rid of her photos but she hasn't. I know if she doesn't think about something for about a month, she'll forget it exists, and she hasn't had my phone for 2 months. Its not like she'll miss them, and honestly shes kinda pissing me off recently (saying she'll pay me to do things then not paying up to the point she owes me well over 2000 dollars for 5 dollar favors over the past 3 years).

"WIBTA if I complained about a cashier accusing me of having a fake ID? I (F26) live in a small town and only go to one gas station to get nicotine products for my boyfriend. When I first was becoming a regular I'd get carded a few times, but eventually it stopped because of my frequent trips there. Every time I go in the manager(F60's?) and I have a nice conversation and she never carded me after the first few times I went to her. She is a literal saint, one time she didn't recognize me and carded me just to apologize that she didn't realize it was me.

This is where I should add, my picture on my ID and the way I look now are different. In my ID I basically have a curly small red afro because my hair was at the beginning of growing back from receiving Chemotherapy. It's been a few years and my hair is about shoulder length.

Maybe a year ago I had my first encounter with the cashier(we'll call her A F50's ). I went in asked for the Newport's and A and 2 other employees were standing there who know me from how frequent I stopped in. I showed her my ID while it was still in my wallet. I didn't take it out because it took a solid 5 minutes to maneuver it out of it's slot. She insisted she needed to scan it and I told her that the other 2 employees have checked me out multiple times and they vouched for me.

The next time I was in employee A she was there alone and refused to sell me the cigarettes if I didn't let her scan it. So it took the 5 minutes to get it out as a line formed behind me and I just felt the satisfaction beaming from her. The time after was great, I went in and employee A was standing next to the manager. The manager and I had our usual small conversation and I bought the cigarettes without one mention of an ID. Since then they have hired new employees and at first they carded me and I complied no problem. They are new, they don't know. I also switched wallets to speed it up and now it's rare to get carded.

Today I went in to buy my bf a pack of his juul pods and employee A was there alone. I ask her for it and she asks for my ID. I comply because I know she's just not cool like the others. Then she gets all squinty eyed and looks at my ID and says ""that doesn't look like you, you look younger than this picture and your hair-"" I cut her off at that point and told her if she had a problem she could ask her manager about me. I told her that her manager and I have a full conversation and never get carded with her. She responded with a sarcastic ""that's good to know"" and then told me to have a great day. The only thing that stopped me from snapping about my hair in my ID was because a older man (60's probably) was standing behind me and I didn't want to look that/make it take longer.

When I lost my hair it became very triggering for me, especially with how long it's taking to grow. The only reason why I'd feel like an asshole is because I really don't want to be a pain in the ass to the manager if I'm just being too sensitive, but I feel like how employee A treats me is malicious at this point.

Edit to add 1: I am aware of law, I have no problem with being carded. I have a problem with being accused of having a fake ID due to the difference in my hair length.

Edit to add 2: In a past sale encounter with her she asked me to read my address off my ID.

Edit to add 3: If any of the employees who usually don't card me did, I would give it to them no problem. I get I gave this employee A a hard time the first time, but I know from experience going there that their ID scanner was spotty and would only work half the time.",0.07

"AITA for refusing to pack my boyfriend‚Äôs apartment while he travels? My boyfriend (30) is moving next week and has a work trip scheduled for all of next week. I know he has been stressed so I offered to help him pack this week. I live an hour away from him but work remotely so I could visit him for a couple of days and help him pack. 

He told me he doesn‚Äôt need my help this week, but next week when he‚Äôs not here. He wants me to go to his apartment and pack whatever is left. I asked him what that would be and he said the kitchen. And he has a roommate who is his cousin. They‚Äôre very close and she has been staying with him for the last one year. He has helped her out on numerous occasions, he got an apartment so far from the city so she could stay with him. He also financed her until she got a job.

So naturally I asked why she couldn‚Äôt help with that, since it‚Äôs about common spaces and I would have to travel an hour and back to get there. To that he said he‚Äôs not comfortable asking her for help, but is comfortable asking me, which I totally get. But now he‚Äôs upset because I told him I couldn‚Äôt do it. 

I clearly established that I wanted to help and I wanted to help this week. It‚Äôs difficult for me to do what he‚Äôs asking of me. But he thinks I‚Äôve forgotten all the times he has driven hours for me to help me move. All those times I was alone and he chose to help me.

"WIBTA if I told my partner I don't want their roommate to come camping with us because he drives me insane? TL;DR I planned a camping trip last month and invited my partner and some friends of ours. My partner wants to invite their roommate, who I intentionally did not invite because I don't like being around him. WIBTA if I told my partner not to invite the guy I didn't want to invite in the first place?

EDIT: My partner asked me late last night if the roommate could be invited. It's currently very early morning where I am, and I don't know yet if he has been invited. If he has, I will obviously not rescind my half-assed invitation. But if my partner hasn't invited him yet, my question is WIBTA for telling my partner not to invite him even though I said yes already.

EDIT 2: Thanks for all your help so far. I asked my partner if they'd invited him yet and they said ""I honestly don't think I'm going to. Tbh I started thinking about it hanging out with him last night and I can understand how spending concentrated time in the wild with him would be kind of an unfair ask."" I asked them to come over, and we talked about it in person. They just felt like they were in an awkward position, which I hadn't really considered initially, and I apologized for not being more aware of that. I'm still trying to figure out how to avoid this in the future, since he is the only person in our friend group I don't like to this extent, and I don't plan on inviting him to future events that I orchestrate either... but I still want to hang out with our friends and my partner. ü§î But we've figured this one out for now! 

There is nothing objectively wrong with my (29F) partner's (31) friend (26m). He just has all the traits a person could have that drive me insane. Think of all the pet peeves you have rolled into one guy, and that's what he is to me. He's a nice enough dude, but being around him is so unpleasant that I avoid it as much as possible. It's important to note that he is my partner's long time roommate. 

He and my partner are really close. My partner knows how I feel about the friend, and why I feel that way, & agrees that he can be incredibly annoying. But my partner still wants to invite the friend to outings that our friend group goes on, which makes sense to me. I'm more than capable of being an adult and sucking it up while we're out with the group for a few hours, or an evening.

I have a few days off in a row coming up, so last month, I asked my partner and two of our friends if they'd like to go camping in a group text that did not include my partner's friend. One of the people said yes!, and my partner told me last night that they feel bad not including the guy I don't like, and asked if he could be invited. I'm sorry to say that I sort of clammed up, looked away, and said something like ""I guess, if you want to invite him, you can. I didn't invite him because spending four days in the woods with him does not sound like a good time to me."" My partner seemed apologetic, thanked me, and said that inviting the guy was more out of politeness than anything. 

But I'm regretting saying yes, even begrudgingly. I was looking forward to this camping trip, and now that it's possible that he might join us, I'm dreading it. Excluding him from the original group text was intentional - I planned this camping trip, found the site, booked it and paid for it myself, and invited people I would love to have with me. I'm wondering why I feel so guilty saying no to bringing this guy along when I'm the person who orchestrated the trip in the first place. 

Would I be the asshole if I rescinded my ""yes"" and told my partner I don't want the annoying friend to come? (I will elaborate on why he is so annoying, if y'all would like me to.)",0.14

"WIBTA for not inviting my fianc√©'s distant relatives to our wedding? I am in the process of planning my wedding for next year, and I feel my mother-in-law-to-be is being a little demanding in terms of our guest list. I have a relatively large extended family (3 grandparents still living, 3 sets of aunt & uncles, 5 cousins who all have partners & children of their own), whereas my fianc√© only has his grandad, who won't be able to come to the wedding due to ill health, an uncle, and an estranged aunt who his parents asked us not to invite. For the last few months, whenever my fianc√© sees his parents without me there, his mum asks him if we can add distant relatives of hers (who I have never met) onto the guest list. She adds another request each time, and as it stands it's three or four couples. My fianc√© is not close to these people and I don't get the impression that my Mother in law is either - I think she just wants them there because she feels like their family is going to be outnumbered. I can sort of understand how she feels, but I can't help having a bigger family, and all the people I'm inviting are actually important to me - we are not inviting second cousins or great aunts/uncles from my side, because I don't know them well enough, so I feel the same rule should apply. Also, I don't understand why she only brings up the subject when I am not there. We get on really well generally so I'm a little offended and confused.

"AITA for choosing friends over his family? AITA? I need a new perspective so that's why I came here. My husband and I have been married for almost a year. We come from different backgrounds. For example, I call my family every day and we are all very close. But with his family, I have to pretty much beg him to call them just once every month because he will not call them at all. I try my best so he can maintain a relationship with his parents and siblings. His parents have extremely different views than we do (which is fine) but have openedly criticized us for the things we support. A month before we married, his mother sent my husband an email talking about why she disagrees with us and what we support is a sin. Due to this I don't feel comfortable around his parents. My husband even told his mom that she was not welcomed at our wedding if she was going to be negative. 

For a few months now, we have planned to attend this event with our friends and community. We were so excited because this is the first year my husband had the day off for it. Well 3 weeks before the event is set to happen, my SIL sent us all the invite for my husband's nieces' 4th birthday party.... on the same day as our event. This party is a 2 hour drive from where we are at. We have the money to go but will have to pull it from savings. I don't want to go because I don't feel comfortable around his parents (who will be there) and I don't want to pull out the money. He insists on going because he misses his family. I agreed to go because I believe family is important but I cant help but feel mad about it. AITA?",0.32
"AITA for not wanting to attend my step-son birthday? My step-son will be turning 3 in August, I(F26) love him dearly and want to celebrate his birthday. The things that are preventing me from wanting to attend are; his grandmother and his mother.

I do not like his grandmother (my MIL) because she called me a bully and told me to grow up after I confronted her about showing favoritism. In the past her and my husband got into arguments about her crossing boundaries and she told him she would sue him for grandparents rights and it just went downhill‚Ä¶ she choose not to come to our 1 y.o birthday party because my husband is going to be there.. so I asked her if she was going to his oldest in August‚Ä¶ she called me a bully‚Ä¶ etc

"AITA (my friends and I) for not waiting for our friend when eating dinner, and then suggesting she order to-go? My friends and I (all 20) had the day off from work, so we went out to lunch and grabbed milk tea in the city. 

My friend, Evelyn (20F), and her boyfriend couldn‚Äôt come to lunch because she was at her doctor appointment (it was a very long appointment) and he was doing chores. 

After lunch, we hung out at my friends house. Evelyn was still at her 3pm appointment, and she was still at her appointment when we later went to dinner at 5:30pm. When we arrived at the restaurant, she asked us what restaurant we went to. I told her, and went back to the table because I assumed she was on her way. Our food came, and she wasn‚Äôt there. We ate our food because we thought they were still coming. We didn‚Äôt think to slow down, we were just hungry. When we paid for our food, Evelyn and her boyfriend pulled into the parking lot.

After I asked that, Evelyn got really upset. She told me she thought we‚Äôd be decent and wait for her and her boyfriend.

"AITA For not wanting my Dad to drive my car as he pleases? I bought a car and treat it like its made of glass, to keep it in good condition for when I want to sell it at some point. My Dad uses it when he goes to workout, so as you can imagine he sweats and then sits in it. I told him to be extra careful about everything he touches, but I already see wear from his usage. He is not a graceful person to say the least. He only asks half the time and the rest of the time he tells me he's going to use it.

When I was away for 9 months for work I left my car at home and told him I'd prefer he not drive it at his leisure. Well, when I got back it had 3k extra miles and he didn't say anything when I asked him about it. The reason he uses my car is because his truck is from 1988 and doesn't have an AC, so he complains its too hot. Meanwhile he makes twice as much as I do a year consulting. He is the guilt tripping type so if I tell him I'd rather he not drive it, he will get huffy and start saying ""then don't use my house"". I feel like this is a lose-lose situation. The thing that makes me ask is that it physically pains me to relinquish the keys to him.

"AITA For Confronting My Biological Mother About Giving Me Up? I (14 M) have always known I was adopted, and was raised by a single mom.  I love my mom, but I always just wondered, you know?  Anyways I turned fourteen and one of my ‚Äúaunts‚Äù (didn‚Äôt know how she was related to me until now tbh) Aunt B pulled me aside.  She said she knew my biological mom and as part of my birthday present she‚Äôd take me to meet her - but only if I didn‚Äôt tell my mom.

I knew it sounded sketchy but I agreed went over to her place one weekend, and she drove me like two towns away.  We went to this house and a woman answered the door.  Aunt B explained I was her son and introduced me to her.  Well she tried to.  The woman started screaming and telling her to take me away and crying and saying she didn‚Äôt want to see me.  

Here‚Äôs where I might be the asshole.  Aunt B gave me her number and I‚Äôve tried calling and texting her asking if she really was my mom, and why she was being so fucking mean if she was?  Like why didn‚Äôt she want me?

Turns out she called my mom who sat me down and told me the truth.  That was her old friend from college who WAS my biological mom - who got pregnant from her abusive boyfriend.  Her dad had apparently did some stuff to keep her from terminating until it was too late.  So she left home and stayed with my mom, put her on the birth certificate as the father (my mom is trans and this was pretransition for her) and signed over custody after I was born.  Aunt B is actually my biological grandmother my mom let he in my life after her husband died.  She‚Äôs not going to be allowed to come over anymore though according to my to my mom.

"AITA for not mowing my lawn? (Obligatory ‚Äúon mobile‚Äù apology for formatting)

I‚Äôm homeowner. I have a lovely 700 sq ft fairy tale cottage on a postage stamp of land by a lake. It‚Äôs not huge or luxurious, but it is mine and I‚Äôm very proud of it. 
I‚Äôm also a bit of a tree-hugger. Even the tiniest insects are important to our ecosystem. I don‚Äôt use pesticides, don‚Äôt pull weeds, don‚Äôt use artificial fertilizers, and, well, I don‚Äôt mow the lawn. 

Constant mowing destroys microhabitats that invertebrates and small animals need to live. It kills ‚Äúweeds‚Äù that benefit pollinators and provide food & shelter for many important insects, ergo, I do not mow. 

Recently, I received an anonymous note in my mailbox telling me to ‚Äútake a machete to that jungle‚Äù and then last week, a neighbor came over with cookies to check on me and see if I was okay. Her reasoning being that I‚Äôm ‚Äúneglecting the property‚Äù and she wanted to make sure I wasn‚Äôt ill or hurt. 

I have NOT neglected my property. I‚Äôve extensively renovated the exterior of my house - new siding, a freshly painted front door, a new porch and a newly painted chimney. I just don‚Äôt mow my lawn. 

I explained that I don‚Äôt mow because I care about the ecosystem and detailed the benefits of not mowing for our bug & critter friends. She got huffy & said ‚Äúthe neighborhood is talking about it and folks are mad, I‚Äôm trying to be nice and ask you to mow so that you don‚Äôt hear about it from someone else who won‚Äôt be as friendly‚Äù 

That felt...threatening, I guess? I got a bit curt & told her I won‚Äôt be mowing, and since I‚Äôll be constructing raised garden beds all over my front yard this summer, there won‚Äôt be much grass left anyway. This was the wrong answer. She was NOT happy, pivoted and insisted I keep the ‚Äúnice grass‚Äù and asked why I‚Äôd ‚Äúruin my yard like that‚Äù when I can grow my vegetables in the back like everyone else. I thanked her for the cookies, said I had to get started on dinner, and showed her the door.

I have since received a new note saying I‚Äôm making the neighborhood look bad and inviting burglars because my home looks abandoned.

My mother thinks I‚Äôm TA and should mow to keep the peace and make it look ‚Äúnice‚Äù for the neighbors. My father, a man who is VERY proud of his manicured green lawn, surprisingly thinks it‚Äôs hilarious and suggested I put out a sign declaring my yard a private nature preserve as an F-you to the wannabe lawn cops. I‚Äôm torn, because I do think my neighbor meant well, but I have zero desire to mow for the reasons mentioned above. I don‚Äôt care if a few stuffy old folks don‚Äôt like it. It‚Äôs not hurting them and I‚Äôm doing my part to protect an oft-overlooked part of our ecosystem by giving bugs food and shelter they‚Äôre not getting elsewhere in the neighborhood. 

Before any legal types chime in, my neighborhood doesn‚Äôt have an HOA (thank god, b/c they‚Äôre evil) and I‚Äôve checked & re-checked landscaping/turf ordinances in my area, and none require that lawns be mowed or kept at a certain length.

"AITA for reacting how I did to my boyfriend going unconscious? So last night, my boyfriend and I were staying at a hotel. We decided to use the hot tub they had. We both left our phones behind, and were the only ones in the entire pool room. 

After a half hour of sitting in the hot tub, my boyfriend starts saying he‚Äôs dizzy. I try to ask him if he‚Äôs okay, and then all of the sudden his right side droops and he falls into the water. I pull his top half out, and try to carry him completely on the cement floor, but am not strong enough. I start screaming for help and no one answers.

Then 15 seconds later, he awakes. He‚Äôs very confused by what happened and doesn‚Äôt remember anything. I start crying, quite hysterically, saying he probably had a mini stroke, since that‚Äôs what it looked like. 

I kept saying we need to go to the hospital, but he wasn‚Äôt having it. Kept denying that he had a stroke. I said that‚Äôs gaslighting, because I know what I saw. And then he coldly says ‚ÄúYou wanted it to be a stroke.‚Äù 

Now today, I made him go to the doctor to get himself checked out. We were completely silent the whole time. Turns out it wasn‚Äôt a stroke after all, and that his blood pressure dropped significantly from the hot tub heat.

"AITA for not lending my sister my car So I (M23) have a sister (F17) and she recently obtained her full license, but doesn't have a car yet (just drives on our parent's car for now). If our parents are both busy, then normally she will ask to borrow my car and normally I let her.

However, about 3 weeks ago I believe we got into an argument (about something I cannot remember). I think she asked to borrow my car for a job interview soon after and because I was still pissed I made a fake excuse and said no. 

I think (but I cannot say for sure) what she thought was going to happen is that I rejected her offer out of anger (that part is true) and I will soon calm down and just give her my car. Thing is, she has been somewhat disrespectful towards me for a period of time now and I want to make a point that I'm not a free car renter. I have no intention of revoking my initial answer and did not do so.

Here's the thing, it is entirely possible for her to use public transport to get to her job interview, it simply takes less time to drive. It takes about an hour to use public transport and about 20 minutes to drive there. 

So, on the day, when its only 50 minutes till the interview and she's still getting ready, I know she thinks she's got my car so I told her I'm going to head off now and took the car. About 20 minutes later I got a call from her asking me where my car is and I told her I had something to do and I told her that weeks ago (In truth I was literally just driving around randomly). She just hangs up.

Turns out later she had to take an Uber and arrived 5 minutes late to the interview (which probably didn't help her that much). Now she's obviously pissed at me, however she cannot fault me because technically I did tell her no when she asked the first time. 

I confided the truth with my parents and they are kind of split, on one hand they agree I didn't do anything wrong on the other hand they think my behavior was a bit assholish.

"AITA in the relationship with my sister so me(F14) and my sister (F20) have a really rocky relationship. We never really spoke or had a close relationship, but when she went off to college a non existent relationship turned into a horrible one. We have strict parents and when she went off to college, out of state, she did small things to rebel and try to be her own person: she got a tattoo, her first boyfriend. and went on a secret trip but that a story for another time.

i was the first to see her tattoo. not cause she showed me but because i saw it. She asked me not to tell anyone, and i said i wouldnt. we got into a huge fight and she was snitching on me to my parents and mid fight i blurted out to my dad that she has a tattoo. i know it was super wrong, and i would never do that now. keep in mind that fight was when i was 12 and she was 18. but ever since she has absolutely hated me, and i don‚Äôt really understand why. Nothing really happened to her. my parents didn‚Äôt disown her or anything my mom just cried and moved on. She tells me some pretty brutal things. Once, me, her, and my other sister were talking about rooms; i said i wanted black walls. my Sisters went on to say it was hideous and that they could never live like that. in response i said ‚Äújust live not that hard.‚Äù 

 so for some context on this next part my sister knows about my issues with mental health.

with all this in mind she still decided to say ‚Äúsays the one that wants to (insert my mental health issues).‚Äù i kinda get that it was just a joke and stuff, but i didn‚Äôt like it so i told her i didn‚Äôt appreciate it and would like her not to not make comments like that. she then proceeded to laugh in my face and say she thought it was funny. i completely went off on her and said things along the lines of: ‚Äúyour crusty musty dusty and the only reason you get offended when i call you that is cuz you know it‚Äôs true. you‚Äôve worn the same clothes since you got back. your fashion sense is giving fashion nova.‚Äù at first she was laughing and saying it‚Äôs sooo funny how mad i get. and then later she told me that i am the only reason she hates being home and that she doesn‚Äôt miss me when she‚Äôs in college. this is definitely not the first time she‚Äôs told me this so, i told her that no one even wants her home and to go back to arizona. she stormed out of the room.

another thing that bothers me is how much she tells on me. the other day we were supposed to be coming up with ideas for father‚Äôs day and my mom was attacking my sister so i was defending her. (i‚Äôve realized that me and her could be close since our parents both tend to attack us and i feel like we could understand eachother) less than five minutes later my sister told my mom i was playing imessage games. like come on thats so dumb.

Is he going to stay with him the whole time? I told her that it wasn‚Äôt worth it she‚Äôs gonna forget about him in a month and to be realistic. She listened to me rant for a while and I could hear her crying, at the end she just said mhm and hung up the call. The next day she asked me to take our prom photos off my instagram and is ignoring me.

TLDR- I called my friend out on going to see this guy across the world and now she is ignoring me.",0.69

"AITA for yelling at my mother in the restaurant Hi I'm new here (m27)

Let me start by saying I love my mother dearly. Today, I feel like was long overdue when it comes to eating with her in public.

My mother has always been the type of ""my way or the highway"" person ever since I can remember. She's right no matter if she's the only one that thinks so. She speaks her mind but there are times when I think she being a down right Karen. She likes to nit-pick the smallest things.

Today, I met up with her and my sister at a bar and grill for dinner. I was buying and we all got a steak dinner. I'm going to get alot of flack for this but we like ours well done (to each their own). Anyways, apparently hers wasn't done well enough to her liking so the waiter sent it back to be cooked a little more. That still wasn't to her liking. 2nd time, it was cooked too much. They brought her a new one and on and on. You get the picture.

What gets me is if the tiniest little detail is off, she won't touch the entire plate. She always does the customer is always right argument which I think is a load of bull since I've worked in food service, I know how people can be. You could tell the waiter was having enough of it.

My sister and I were trying to get her just to order something else but she wanted her perfect steak or nothing. Eventually I had enough because she has always done through the years. To me it's embarrassing and down right ridiculous. I told her exactly that and that she can order something else or leave. The whole restaurant got quiet.

We ended up leaving and they let us have ours for free which I didn't want to do. I even left a little extra in the tip for the waiter and apologized to him. The entire time after was her yelling at me saying how dare I speak to her like that and being disrespectful in public. Her whole argument was based on the customer is always right. She would rather not eat if it isn't perfect to the smallest detail rather than just get something else. I get that you want exactly what you order but this is insane in my mind.

"AITA for not telling my friend she smells?? I (18f) and my best friend (19f) have been friends for about 5 years. She had moved in with me about 1 yr ago and moved out shortly after. The reason for moving out was me getting fed up with her. She was living for free (despite having a job), not cleaning up after herself, and honestly she smells absolutely horrible. She was living with me for about 3 months and I had never seen her shower, not once. She would hang out with people, have sex with people, be on her period, and still not shower. This wasn‚Äôt an issue for me personally until she wanted to share a bed with me (she had a room). I would have nights were I couldn‚Äôt sleep due to her smell, I‚Äôve had friends and family complain, and she‚Äôs stained countless sheets with period blood or just dirt.I hate confrontation and am not good at telling people things that could be upsetting, so the best option was just for her to go. Within the last few weeks we have made some mutual friends who have come forward to me telling me how bad she smells and making fun of her for it (I don‚Äôt participate). I feel like it‚Äôs not my place to tell her that she smells especially with the point it has gotten to and her getting easily offended. I feel like a total asshole for not telling her but in my opinion it‚Äôs more of her moms/ families place to tell her rather then me. So am I the asshole? Should I just suck it up and tell her?

we talk very openly about mental health as we both struggle with separate illnesses, she typically comes to me if she‚Äôs struggling or feeling particularly bad one day. So mental health could be a factor, but I‚Äôm not sure.",0.41
"AITA for refusing to wear clothes my mother is comfortable with me wearing? Hi. This is my first time posting so please bear with me. 

I (13-16f) was getting ready for school this morning. I was wearing shorts, a shirt, and a pair of ballet flats, because where I live it was a particularly hot day. My mother (age range 40-45) immediately noticed and commented on what I was wearing. I take the metro to school everyday (keep in mind that there are some weird people that will potentially make a remark, act strangely, or even be dangerous). She thought that it was inappropriate for school and made it dangerous  for me to take the metro. I argued back and told her that it was a hot day and that these were the only shorts I felt comfortable wearing, because my other shorts had gotten too small for me, and that there were bad people on the metro who might start getting thoughts. She continued to complain and argue with me, and I got mad and impulsively told her that the fact that she thought of it that way made her a  creep and that I didn't care if other people would harass me because I think people should be able to dress however they want to without getting sexualized, and went to school without another word out of both of us. This is where I now think I might have been a bit of an AH. 

Keep in mind that my mom was raised to dress modestly, walk on busy streets, and go with friends, and she believes that we should do the same. I, however, believe that people should be able to dress however they want and in whatever makes them comfortable without getting body-shamed or harassed. We've had many arguments about this in the past. 

I now realize that my mom only wanted to protect me from danger because she's my mother and she loves me, and I feel really bad for arguing with her and scaring her like that.

"AITA for being upset over something my boyfriend said? I (F15) have been with my bf (M16) for almost 6 months (our 6 month anniversary is the 4th). Overall, our relationship has been amazing. He‚Äôs an amazing guy who makes sure that I‚Äôm always comfy and is very lovey in person. Although, our summer break started a few weeks ago. 

The problem is that we only see each other once a week and otherwise, we talk on Discord or thru messages. We call each night before we go to sleep and sometimes throughout the day. Yesterday, he asked for a him day. That‚Äôs perfectly fine, I understand that sometimes he wants time alone.

I 100% respect his request and wasn‚Äôt argumentative at all. Last night, we called and talked about his day and what he did. He was mostly gaming with his friend that I‚Äôve met and showed me a funny clip from it.

This is where the issue started.

Me: So overall, how was your day?

Him: It was really good. I always love having me time and being able to be myself.

This kinda upset me, which I kept to myself. To me, that implied that he‚Äôs not able to be himself with me and that he doesn‚Äôt enjoy talking with me. I didn‚Äôt bring it up until today.

We hardly talked today; mostly because I woke up at 4 pm due to bad sleep. He understood and we talked a bit about what he did before I woke up through text. Then he randomly stops texting.

All good, I let him be alone for about an hour and a half before I noticed he was online on Discord. So I messaged him if he wanted to call. He said not at the moment, and I asked why. I wasn‚Äôt trying to be too nosy, but he replied, ‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt want to right now.

Basically then I asked if I did something and we kinda argued about how I get upset when he asks for alone time. Then, I asked ‚Äúare you losing interest in me?‚Äù

Him: No. I‚Äôm not. I knew you would think that.

Then he explained how I always ask that when he goes outside and does things by himself. Which isn‚Äôt true at all, but I digress.

I explained how his comment last night hurt my feelings and that I felt like he might not like hanging out with me because I‚Äôm not fun or anything like that.

Him: Well texting feels like a chore 90% of the time.

I again felt hurt about that and tried to explain how it hurt my feelings. I tried to put him in my shoes and he shuts down; also saying he put himself in my shoes and how he doesn‚Äôt understand the issue.

I feel defeated and just apologize if I did something wrong and again try to explain that it feels like he‚Äôs saying that texting me feels like a chore specifically.

Then I get this text.

Him: I'm not saying that I hate talking to you, or talking to you in general feels like a chore. I love talking to you. but just the act is what I'm saying. having to think and worry about it every minute feels like a chore and I hate it sometimes. that's all I'm saying.

I feel hurt and confused. Am I the problem here? I‚Äôve tried everything to explain. If I am the asshole, then please let me know kindly‚Ä¶

Edit: I‚Äôd like to mention that I am in no way expecting him to text me constantly and I forgot to mention it originally. I told him that all I ask for is an occasional text. I don‚Äôt expect ANYONE to constantly message me, that‚Äôs not fair to them and their life. 

That‚Äôs all! :)",0.15

"WIBTA If I Raised my Brothers Rent or Told Him to Move Out Since He Refuses to Act Like a Functioning Adult? My brother has been my roommate for years (Both of us are late twenties). He and I were the same level of lazy when it came to house cleaning and chores so it seemed to work. We‚Äôd clean if we knew people were coming over, but the place generally was pretty slobbish. 

Then I met the man who I would marry. He‚Äôs not a neat freak by any means, but definitely more proactive. Which actually worked really well for me. I refuse to sit on my butt when he‚Äôs working on something, so it motivated me to get up and work too. 

My brother does not have the same response. In his defense, if I directly ask him ‚ÄúHey can you clean X, Y or Z‚Äù he will. Eventually. Usually it‚Äôs the same day, but not always. 

This laziness infuriates my husband. He hides it well, but will vent to me. I‚Äôm on his side but I have a hard time completely commiserating, since my brothers behavior isn‚Äôt new. It seems like expecting him to behave counter to all experience is just a recipe for disappointment. 

We have thought of a ‚Äòchore chart‚Äô setup but honestly my husband and I are just as bad at keeping to it as he is. We just see the dishes need doing and take care of it. 

My husband and I own our home, and my brother is renting a room from us. But I have to remind him every month that rent is due. I‚Äôm thinking about adding a late fee because I‚Äôm tired of having to remind an adult that his freaking bill is due. 

He‚Äôs also unbelievably hard on things. The room where he sits and plays video games has a pile of garbage next to it the size of our golden retriever. Dishes from three weeks ago in a stack. The couch itself is stained. I‚Äôm really not being dramatic when I say anything he uses, it‚Äôs a coin toss on if he‚Äôll break it. 

When we bought our home, he got a dog. To be clear, we knew the breed he wanted. He asked. He bought a MASSIVE breed. (Think St. Bernard or Mastiff). My husband and I have a dog already and we‚Äôve got a giant yard, so thought it would be fine. 

But he hasn‚Äôt trained it. I‚Äôve worked with it a bit, at least to try and get it to mind a little better. But it‚Äôs not mine and I really don‚Äôt have the time to work with a third. It chewed a literal hole in the wall. My brother never mentioned it (it‚Äôs right by where he sits to play video games.) my husband finally got tired of looking at it and repaired the hole. My brother saw him working and just seemed upset that he couldn‚Äôt sit in his usual spot. Never offered to help or cover the cost of materials. 

Basically having my brother as a roommate has become a constant stressor. Between laziness, breaking things and a huge mess, my husband and I are at our wits ends. We‚Äôve tried talking to him. And he‚Äôll usually improve. For about a week. 

We‚Äôre seriously thinking of either evicting him or raising rent to help with the stress he brings. 

Am I the asshole for expecting my brother to suddenly learn how to be a functioning adult, when he‚Äôs never shown that capacity before?",0.02
"AITA for asking for payment from my uncle when he asked me if I could clean his playstation?

Today, my uncle asked me to clean his playstation out, something I have done for him several times for him for free for him in the past. I asked for payment this time because I'm tired of him leeching off me and my household and I'd need to buy new things to clean it with. When I asked for a reasonable payment of $20, he got offended and started chastising me and saying how he house sat for us while we were on vacation a few weeks back and didn't pay him.

"AITA for being mad at husband's family? Me (37F) and my husband (39M) are together for almost 10 years. We have two sons (6M and 8M) together and I have a daughter (12F) from a previous relationship, but my husband takes her as his own. 

My husband's family lived close so he often visited them. I always stayed home because his family didn't like me. I didn't have a problem with that, but it bothered me that they always preferred our two sons to our daughter because she's not biologically related to them. My husband and I talked to them about it a few times, and they promised to stop, but they still do it. 

Seven months ago me, my husband and our kids moved really far from my husband's family. We sent them a lot of photos for the first two months and often called them, but they were always only interested in our sons. Although my daughter wanted to talk to them, they only wanted to talk to our sons. When we sent them photos of things other than our sons (such as photos of the sea, our dogs, or us with our friends), they said they didn't like these photos and that we should send photos of our sons. 

Yesterday I wrote them a message saying that I am really mad them because I cared about the mental health of our daughter and they should stop rejecting her and because I do not like how they reject other things than photos of our sons. 

This morning my sister-in-law texted my husband that I was acting stupid and that it wasn't that bad so I texted her that if she don't like how I act she should tell me and not my husband. She didn't replied.

"AITA for setting up baby monitors without telling my babysitter? (Throwaway account because many of my friends use reddit)

I recently hired my friend's 20 year old daughter to babysit my 3 year old son while my husband and I went out of town to celebrate our anniversary. About a month ago my friend mentioned that her daughter was looking for side jobs to save for an apartment, so I hired her to babysit for a couple days. Before she came my husband and I set up baby monitors in our sons' room and in the living room/kitchen area. We did not put cameras in the bathroom or guest room where she would be sleeping. I trust my friend and her daughter entirely, but I set up the cameras as a precaution to ensure my sons' safety. If he got hurt or anything I wanted to have a clear record of what happened since my son has a limited vocabulary and can't tell me himself.

The trip went great, husband and I had a wonderful time and when we occasionally dropped in on the cam to check on our son he looked like he was having fun as well. Friend's daughter was great with him and reported no issues when I called each night to check in on her. 

Here's where it went downhill. When my husband and I returned home, I mentioned the baby monitors and she asked why I'd put them up. I told her it was just a precaution, in the event our son got hurt we wanted a clear picture of what had happened. She asked if we thought she would abuse our son, which we replied of course not, but it's best to be prepared for any possible situation. She got angry and said this was a massive invasion of privacy, and asked why we would hire her if we clearly didn't trust her. Husband and I tried to explain multiple times but she wasn't interested in hearing what we had to say. Later, I got a call from her mother calling me a paranoid asshole for putting cameras up.

"AITA for telling my ex housemate to not come over without asking beforehand? I live in a shared house with 4 other people, one of which is my girlfriend (we were already together when we both moved in to the shared house). In general the house is a very social place, we enjoy having people over and playing boardgames, watching films, cooking together, etc. 

One of the housemates moved out a couple of months ago to an apartment nearby, so he still joins for established plans and is a good friend. 

However, today he decided t hang out in our garden with his girlfriend and another friend (who we don‚Äôt know), without asking beforehand what our plans were or if it was okay with us. His friend is actually renting the house next door on Airbnb for a month, and has its own smaller garden. 

The rest of the housemates already had plans (actually out of town), so my gf and I were really looking forward to having the house for ourselves, which is very rare.  Mind you, as much as we love our housemates and spending time with them, we are mostly introverts and really cherish the opportunities when we can be alone. So it was a very ungrateful surprise when we woke up to the noise in the garden and a text message from the ex housemate saying he was coming over to our garden with his gf and friend and that we could join if we wanted. We expected to have the house and maybe even use the garden ourselves in peace and quiet, but it was taken from us without even asking if we were okay with that or had any plans, changing the whole outcome of how we envisioned our day that we had looked forward to the whole week. 

We then felt even hesitant to go into the kitchen as it has big windows to the garden (they were right outside) and didn‚Äôt really feel like engaging in conversation or activities. He also went inside our house to get cushions for the garden chairs and they also went inside to use the bathroom. After being very anxious on how to deal with the situation (especially as we do have a nice friendship) and taking it over and over among ourselves, we sent him a text message explaining how we thought he was overstepping our boundaries and that we expected to be involved/approve if any plans were happening in our house, not just giving notice that they will happen. 

They eventually left after several hours (until late afternoon), but then the ex housemate sent a message saying how he felt hurt about the situation. Also important to note he basically decided he would keep a key to the house, he caught us in a weak/emotional moment when he was leaving for his new apartment and then we failed to address it afterwards as he went through several personal issues and though it was not a good timing for what we think is a sensitive topic (he is very attached to the house as he lived here longer than any of the other current housemates).

"AITA for not being ""supportive"" of my sister and her mewing? My sister *Lily* has been told by two different doctors that she needs jaw surgery. Lily refuses to believe this. She has gotten into something called *mewing.* Mewing is an Internet trend with no scientific proof behind it, that you can change the shape or appearance of your jaw by being aware of your tongue posture, keeping your tongue in your mouth a certain way all the time. It's completely junk science and won't do a thing for Lily. She needs surgery in order to change it.

I honestly don't care if Lily had the surgery or not. She's a 30 year old woman and not a kid. She can do what she wants. It's no skin off my nose. However since Lily has discovered mewing she will not shut up about it and she thinks it is the holy grail. I thought it was bad enough to hear about it in all of Lily's texts or emails. When I returned to my hometown after my exams were complete my parents told me this is really important to Lily and I need to be supportive and encouraging of her mewing. Our sister got the same speech. I refuse to support a delusion that mewing accomplish what the jaw surgery will. I didn't say anything until Lily told me I need to try mewing myself. At that point I told her it was bunk and she's wasting her time and she was not happy and we've had a big fight about it because Lily has evidence from the internet that mewing works.

"AITA for not splitting the visitation driving with my ex wife? My ex wife lives 2.5 hrs away, has every other weekend visitation with our two children, and per our parenting plan, is responsible for all of the transportation. She wants me to start splitting the driving duties doing the Friday night run.

Some background: We‚Äôve been divorced for several years. Lately, she‚Äôs been complaining about money more than usual. She pays a modest amount of child support and her share non-child support expenses based on the ratio of our incomes (5:1). Her wages have been stuck since The Before Times, her rent is skyrocketing, and lately gas is up as well. I get it, everything is more expensive.

I‚Äôve said no for a few reasons.

The distance is her choice. She moved back to her home town because she was having an affair with her high school boyfriend.

When I was fighting her attempt to relocate with our children, she fully intended for me to be the parent who was 2.5 hrs away, have every other weekend visitation, and do all the driving. She repeatedly told me ‚Äúit was no big deal‚Äù. The plan she got was the one she intended to stick me with.

I have no doubt that if I asked for assistance, the answer would be no.

I don‚Äôt have a lot of child free personal time, and driving Friday night (the half she wants me to pickup), would pretty much kill off any Friday night activities for me.

When confronted with a divorced parenting question that is not want, I try to see if there is a ‚Äúbetter for our children‚Äù component. For example, I‚Äôd rather not see my ex or her idiot boyfriend, but it‚Äôs better for our children if we get along, so I invite them to all kid events like birthday parties, and we get along just fine. Turns out her boyfriend is a likable idiot and we both have made questionable choice when it comes to women. ;). I just don‚Äôt see how me driving Friday night is better for our children.

I‚Äôm leery of a thing that requires too much coordination, like meeting her half way. I‚Äôve tried versions of that in the past getting her some extra time if I was in her area with our kids and she‚Äôs left me waiting with no communication. I‚Äôm leery of driving on occasion. She‚Äôs always been the take a mile when given an inch sort of person.

Reasons I could be the Ahole. I make 5x what she does. I feel it‚Äôs important that she does her part, but I don‚Äôt need the money. If I don‚Äôt want to drive, I could just waive some or all of her payments.

I tend to look at her requests and my initial reaction is ‚Äúwhat fresh hell is this‚Äù. I‚Äôm long over her affair. I‚Äôm actually much better off without her, but I do still hold a grudge at her attempt to relocate with our children. If she was smarter, it easily could have gone the other way.

I don‚Äôt have the skyrocketing rent issue. I owned my home, free and clear (inherited from my late uncle) before we married, and she didn‚Äôt get any part of it in our divorce.

I‚Äôm sure there are other reasons, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm posting. In the end, I‚Äôll do what‚Äôs best for our children.",0.17

They get excited about things they‚Äôve done together and their dad asks how they‚Äôve been, so of course they smile and talk about all the fun they‚Äôve had. They do the same thing when I ask and they tell me about their dad or their soon-to-be stepmom. 

When he responds sarcastically their whole demeanor changes and they feel bad about saying anything. So, I‚Äôve gotten into the habit of telling them they probably shouldn‚Äôt bring up their soon-to-be stepdad to their dad. 

Father‚Äôs Day is coming up, and they‚Äôre celebrating with their dad the weekend before because his fianc√© planned a getaway for him on Father‚Äôs Day weekend. So, I‚Äôll have them for Father‚Äôs Day. I have no issue with this, and they‚Äôre excited to do something for my fianc√©. Well, our middle child (f10) brought up in front of her dad that she was going to make my fianc√© something for Father‚Äôs Day. Of course my ex got that look on his face and I immediately intercepted and said she didn‚Äôt have to. Which is true, we (my fianc√© and I) don‚Äôt push the kids to do anything with/for him. But she said ‚ÄúI know he said he doesn‚Äôt want anything, but I want to.‚Äù Her dad‚Äôs expression was a mix of anger and being hurt, but he never said anything in front of me. 

I told my friends about what happened and they said I need to stop protecting my ex‚Äôs feelings. That caught me off guard. I didn‚Äôt think of it as protecting my ex, but protecting my kids from the snide/sarcastic comments my ex makes. But they have a point. So, should I stop saying they shouldn‚Äôt bring my fianc√© up to their dad?

ETA: there seems to be some confusion with the title of my post. So to clarify, I know I‚Äôm somewhat of an A H for telling my kids they shouldn‚Äôt bring up their stepdad to their dad. I was asking if I‚Äôd be an A H if I stopped telling them that and let them speak freely.",0.25

"AITA For pushing my 30 something son to grow up So my son is in his 30's with 2 beautiful kids. In 2017 his wife decided she wanted a divorce. He came to live with me. He also had his kids every weekend. He was really tore up about the divorce and I didn't want to push him. I made sure he got to work and back. He rarely paid for gas. I made sure his kids were taken care of. I bought a trundle bed for my office, they used when they were over. They had everything I could give them. I bought groceries, I entertained the kids. My son started drinking and it got progressively worse. 
Fast forward to January 2020 my own marriage was falling a part and we moved out, they came with me. Money got tight because I was starting a new business. I no longer had the money or the time to spend out with the kids. So we stayed home more. My son's job fired him. He was collecting unemployment plus the stimulus money, which I thought he was saving. 
I was still paying for everything which was ok because again I thought he was saving money. 
Suddenly there was some big ticket items purchased,  he got a new desk, computer, Xbox, king size bed, clothes and a bunch of other stuff. The kids wanted pets, I said no I didn't want to take care of them during the week. He bought them anyway. 
I was still driving him everywhere, to work, to the Dr, to pick up his kids. One day his oldest didn't come for the weekend. I asked why? He said she didn't want to come because I was mean. She was 11, so she was mad I made her clean up after herself and do household chores. I also think she didn't want to come because I was no longer taking them out to spend money.
We had a big fight. I told him he couldn't spend his time off drunk and high 24/7, he need to save money he couldn't live with me forever. He got pissed off and the drinking got worse. I still made sure he got to work and home everyday, but otherwise he ignored me.
He met someone and they moved in together in May of 2021. I organized his move, got people to help and paid for everything. That's the last time he spoke to me. He lives in a gated community so I can't go to his apartment. He bought his own phone plan, he was on mine. So I don't have his number. On birthdays and Christmas I have dropped gifts and cards at his job. Forgot to mention he found a job the end of 2020. I have heard nothing. It breaks my heart after everything I did to help he turned his back on me. Was I wrong to push him? AITA?",0.01

"AITA For letting my friend's tinder date for sleeping in my room? I'll try to make this as short as possible, but for starters I'm in the navy for some short context so anyone military (specifically navy) will understand. On Friday my friend (We'll call him James) shows me a girl he matched with on tinder, she's into anime, games, and cosplay stuff like that. I tell him that's a cool catch and good luck. Later that day he goes to pick her up and throughout the entire time he's texting me things like ""I don't know what to say"", ""she's on her phone"", ""I feel really dumb next to and talking to her"" and while he's saying all this, I'm trying to be a good wingman and give him advice.

Later they end up back in his room here on base and so James tells me they're doing nothing but watching anime. They did this up until around 3 or 4am and James texts me ""I have duty in a little bit and she hasn't left"", so I asked him if he would kick her out or something and he didn't know what to do. Now before he goes to duty he drops by my room and gives me his room key to make sure she hasn't stolen or broke something after she leaves and I just say sure. At around 11 to 12 I go up to check and I see her still there. I just simply said hi and notice nothing wrong so I leave to get food.

Long story short she tags along with me and asked if she could stay in my room since my James was cautious about her and it's not my place to say ""go home"", plus we talked for a bit and she seemed cool enough to crash. We didn't do anything sexual or something like that, I tell him she would be with me until he comes back the next morning he stops by, I give him his key and then he asked if she was still in my room and I say yes. He walks off pissed at me for it even though I told him and he never bothered to text her the whole time. There's still a lot of context missing but I need to know am I really the asshole here.",0.4

"AITA for not paying the full bill of my software development team? As a side ambition, I started a mobile app company a couple of years ago that has yet to get off the ground. In my regular day job, I work with software engineers and designers as a product manager. Founding a mobile app company had a lot of transferable skills. After spinning the wheels with a couple of developers who left the company to pursue other, more stable work, I turned to a consulting firm. 

I went to this consulting firm and gave them a set of requirements - a statement of what I wanted to be built, why, and the order I wanted it built in. The firm reviewed my request (August 2021) and existing files and suggested it could complete the entirety of it by October 1, 2021 for $3850. I quickly realized there were a couple of bugs that existed and were not in the scope of work and immediately reached out to the owner of the consulting firm. He noted the team would be happy to fix these bugs for free. 

Around November 10th, 2021 (more than a month after the expected project delivery date) I received a message from the owner suggesting we do a refactor (a reworking of the existing code) so that they could complete the agreed upon scope of work. He mentioned the refactor would take around 40-80 hours and suggested we switch to an hourly model to account for the unknowns that come with refactoring code. I agreed. The hourly rate was $98. 

I paid all of my invoices up to $12,834 - nearly $9,000 more than the original estimate. The calendar turned to May and I had $5,000 in additional invoices. I was also quoted $2,000 to fix known bugs (which were previously working), and another $3-5,000 for the rest of the features in the original statement of work. The owner is unable to list one feature I have asked for outside of the scope of the agreement. 

I understand that software development is expensive but continue to anchor my expectations against the original estimate provided by the consulting firm. I decided I was not going to pay the $5,000 in outstanding invoices and sever ties with the company entirely. They have responded by disabling all code they have introduced since my last payment.

"AITA for getting mad at my boyfriend who took a joke too far? This was on our monthsary, and we wanted to celebrate by playing a game because we are long distance.

We queued up and met randoms who were really nice. We had so much fun as they started doing the weirdest things that made us laugh.

It was then when one of them started hitting on my boyfriend as a joke, saying things like ‚ÄúCall me after‚Äù and whatnot. I laughed at it and said ‚ÄúEyy he‚Äôs mine.‚Äù Continuing the joke, the random was like ‚ÄúOh she won‚Äôt know.‚Äù and my boyfriend played along, saying that the random was hot and spicy or whatever. 

It was then when he started joking about leaving me for the random was where I drew the line. I know I can be sensitive but that‚Äôs just who I am and he knows it. I told him ‚ÄúBabe, it‚Äôs our monthsary.‚Äù with me telling him that he should stop. He didn‚Äôt and I waited for the game to finish because I didn‚Äôt want to ruin his fun. During then, I stayed quiet. 

Nearing the end, he noticed my lack of presence and asked me what was wrong. I didn‚Äôt respond because if I talked then, I would just cry and he would feel bad so I wanted to have some time. He got mad at me and was upset saying ‚ÄúWe both promised to tell immediately if something is wrong‚Äù and left the call without giving me the chance to talk. 

When I explained why I was quiet he just got mad even more, telling me that I ruined his fun. I told him what was wrong and then he suddenly started bringing up problems from the past that I took the blame on that was already solved. He keeps hiding behind my mistakes and made me feel bad for feeling hurt over a joke that was too far.

"AITA for not cooking dinner? I'm a 15 year old guy that suffers from depression and body dismorphia(the dismorphia is important I promise). The backstory: I went with my dad on what I thought would be a short trip to go and get a counter top from a craft shop. Now it was blazing hot and I was wearing a hoodie because, y'know, I thought it would be a quick 10-20 min trip and since I suffer from body dismorphia I usually wear a hoodie to hide my body mostly. We were about to leave from the craft shop because the place didn't have change and we could only pay in cash so we went to leave in our old truck and the wheels won't turn. Turns out the power steering fluid was leaking and we couldn't get home without tearing the pump up. So we were stuck in this blazing heat for about 1-2 hours and all the while I have my hoodie on. Now I didn't have anything on underneath my hoodie and because of my dismorphia my brain wouldn't let me take it off. And the heat saps all my energy away.

After we got home I immediately went to my room because I keep it cold and flopped down on my bed. A little while later, my depression kicks in and I just want to sink into my bed and disappear. Then my dad starts hounding on me that I should cook dinner and I say I don't want to because I have no energy and I'm not in the mood to cook. My dad didn't want to cook because he was busy working on his truck and my mom would be tired when she got home from work and wouldn't want to cook either. Now, we do not have the money to eat out currently because we are dealing with 2 semi broken vehicles and bills. My dad was grouchy from the heat which could've been a reason for it. So, reddit, AITA for refusing to cook dinner? If I missed any important details just ask for them.

Details I forgot to add in: we had leftovers in the fridge and my dad was the cause of the depressive episode I experienced. I don't know exactly how he caused it I just know something he did caused it.",0.71

"AITA For Not Specifying Gift Amount? Hello! I am seeking some advice on a wedding gift. My friends (long time friends but not extremely close) recently got married and I traveled across the country to their wedding, stayed in a hotel, etc. Anyhow, I was of course happy to do this. Also note that I am currently a graduate student.

The couple went to Puerto Rico for their honeymoon and for their present I offered to treat them to a bottle of champagne for their room. (Initially I tried to order it myself, but the hotel made it very difficult to do so, so I just told them). They were very excited when I offered this.

I realize this part was ultimately my fault, but I looked at the room service menu and saw there were several bottles of real champagne from around 100-130 dollars, and then the price jumped to around 200+. I assumed they would choose one of the less costly bottles, however they did not. They sent me a message that the total came to 250, which is about 100 dollars or more than I was planning to spend.

Even though 100 extra dollars might not a ton of money to most people, it is a significant amount for my student budget. I also feel kind of strange towards them that they did purchase one of the more expensive bottles knowing that I am not rich and from what I have read/heard, 100-150 is a pretty standard wedding gift for friends. Again, I know I probably should have said something to begin with, but I really figured they would select one of the ""cheaper"" bottles.

I currently cannot afford 250, so my options seem to be to either just wait on sending them money without saying anything, telling them that I will need to wait a bit to save to send them the 250, or explaining that the amount is more than I had anticipated sending and send 150.

"AITA for refusing to mediate a beef between my sons and their mom? I was married for 25 years (married young) and have a few kids. I divorced a few years ago but still live together. 

My eldest sons (21 and 23) have been fighting with their mother over money. She bought me out and received a couple of properties. Our two eldest sons have kids of their own and want to rent two of the properties because they're in nice areas. 

They do have a trust from their grand parents that they just access to and wanted to out right buy the houses from her. She offered a price that is beyond what they can afford. She suggested they rent and that upset them because they feel like they're just wasting mortgage money on rent.

Why she's being a stickler is because she is cash strapped after our divorce and wants to sell before the market cools. As a result, they feel utterly betrayed.

Now they're making a conscious effort to not see their mom and withholding their sons from her. That really upsets everyone. I've been asked by both sides to bring everyone together.

"AITA for choosing a card in Cards Against Humanity that wasn't the best choice, to prevent someone from winning? So I played Card Against Humanity last week and it was my second time playing it.

It was a really good night filled with funny moments.then came a down-to-the-wire moment where I was tied with someone else. We had 6 points and we needed 7 to win.

I'm looking at the cards after having someone else shuffle the responses so it's fair(those of you who dont play, the one picking the winning card doesnt participate that round and can't get points). I'm looking at the cards and putting them down as I am reading them, laughing really hard at them. Then when I read one card, as I'm chuckling, I noticed the person I'm tied with, ""Gina"" starts smiling and balling her fist. So I knew it was her card.

I also estimated that the least funny card belonged to ""Carl"" because his sense of humor isn't on the same page with everyone else, and he has 2 points while everyone else has 4 or 5.

So to keep Gina from winning, I chose Carl's card. Gina was freaking out like, ""what!? Are you serious right now!?"" And her thoughts on the matter were reciprocated by everyone else.

I won the game shortly after.

She demanded to know why I chose Carl's card and everyone else did too, albeit Gina was the only one mad.

My explanation is paraphrased as such:

*""The object is to pick the best card, and that's a matter of perspective; the person choosing the best card has the perspective that matters most. To be fair, the responses were shuffled so I didn't know who submitted what to begin with. When I read your card, I knew it was yours based on your reaction as I read it. And if I chose that one, I would lose and I don't want to lose. So if you think about it, in my perspective Carl's card was the best whom I guessed [because his sense of humor isn't on the same page] that way I could still win.

So it may have been the best card to you, but it wouldn't be the best card for me.""*

She called me an a****** and has been pretty salty about it. Even our friends that night are shocked by her (me as well but more about her).",0.91
"AITA for telling my girlfriend she's unhealthy? We're both 19, we've been dating 4 years. We both just finished our freshman year of college. We obviously dated in high school, but, the challenge with us for college was that we were long distance. I went out West, she went out East and, up until getting out for summer, we'd really only seen each other like during a couple days of overlap during the winter for X-mas break.

When I finally got back home for the summer, I texted her, asked if she wanted to hang out, we decided to hang out at her parent's house. I get over there and, I know it sounds bad, but the first thing I noticed was really how much heavier she'd gotten since the previous August. I'd noticed it a little bit at Christmas but, it wasn't so obvious as it was now, if that makes sense. Christmas break was like a blur.

So, we're just talking about our respective years and she was telling me about how often she went out and she goes "" oh my god I put on like 40, 45 pounds"" , giggles it off, and just keeps going. Even in high school she was someone who was describing herself as "" proudly not a size 2"" so, I started doing the math. 

All I said was that putting on that kind of weight in a year is unhealthy. I never said diet, I never took any uncalled for digs, but she took that as me calling her fat. I reiterated that all I said was, putting on 40 to 45 pounds in not even a whole year isn't healthy.

"AITA for telling my roommate's brother that porn is fake? So this is a dumb situation and I don't think I can possibly be the asshole, but my roommate's brother says I am so I'm coming here for judgement. 

Long story short, I (29M) have a roommate Dale (26M) who spends a lot of time with brother Caleb (22M). Normally Caleb will come over and drink beers with his brother and sometimes I'll join them. Caleb is really, really gullible. To the point that Dale is protective of him because he's the type of person who can be easily persuaded to do anything. He was almost talked into quitting his full time job to join an MLM scheme by someone. When he was younger, he was convinced to say something vulgar in Spanish to his mom by a cousin who told him it meant ""I love you so much"" when it really meant something hideous. Everyone warned him not to do it but his cousin swore it wasn't vulgar. Needless to say, his mom was pissed and his dad was even more pissed. 

Last weekend I had a late night at the office and when I got home, Dale and Caleb were throwing back shots and playing dominoes. So after my shower, I broke out a bottle of Scotch and joined them. At some point, Caleb was shitfaced and his brother cut him off. Caleb wandered to the couch and we figured he'd pass out there. Instead, he started watching porn on his phone and when we noticed it, I jokingly called out, ""You know it's fake, right?"" Caleb called bullshit, but I was persistent and he asked me what I meant. I told him, ""It's like pro wrestling. It's not real."" 

With that, Dale and I cracked up and we dropped the subject. Caleb passed out and we eventually went to bed too. The next day, Caleb asked me, ""Did you mean what you said about it being fake?"" Not thinking that even he could be that naive, I sarcastically said, ""Of course, everyone knows."" 

Unbelievably, he didn't doubt me because he brought it up with some buddies and they roasted him. He sent me a text calling me an asshole and saying he trusted me. I told Dale what happened and after rolling his eyes, he said I probably shouldn't have told him that because we both know how gullible Caleb can be.

EDIT FOR CLARITY: when i returned home i did call him racist and told him i would not tolerate his behavior even when he said ‚Äúi had a black friend im not racist‚Äù. i‚Äôve previously told him not to say the N-word around me and even forced him out of my car when he‚Äôs said it while i was driving. he SHOULD understand that that is why im upset and not speaking to him, but he thinks it‚Äôs disrespectful that i dont verbally respond to him.",0.32
"AITA for blocking my friend because she's poor and doesn't pay me back? i've (27f) been getting closer to my ex coworker, Sally (32f) since last year.  we often had lunch together and talked about a lot of things. She's a cool person and fun to hang out with. Here's the problem. Sally owes me money. Sally's family is actually quite well-off and could help her with whatever money problems she possibly had but she refused to ask them for help because of their difference in beliefs. The first time she borrowed money is because she was out town and needeed money for food and transportation. I felt sorry for her so i lend her some money. She paid me back the following month. Then she borrowed money from me again. Idk what's the money for but i guess it's for her bf. I  lend it to her but it's been almost half a year and she hasn't paid me back. At first, i was understanding because she was jobless and still lived with her parents. But then i become  upset because she still doesn't pay me after she got a job with good pay. She shamelessly bragged about her new lipstick and eyelash extension. And even asked me to treat her to dinner!!

Three months ago, she had a vacation and i told her to pay me back by buying me four small boxes of cakes. She agreed at first but then she got covid and had to stay for more than a week in that town. The cakes would go bad so i just gave them to her. I asked her to get me something from the airport as replacement for the cakes but she refused because she already had many stuffs to bring into the plane. She ended up not buying me anything. We didn't meet and talk much after that. Few weeks ago, i decided to block her after i heard that she got married to her bf. They are poor.

"AITA because I want my kids to be healthy? I was married for seven years. We've been split for two years other than a brief two month attempt to reconcile. We're now in the final stages of divorce with a five year old daughter and three year old son. 

California is expensive. Even making decent money, cost of living is insane here and so we're each struggling. She has family nearby, I do not. For the past year I've been working two jobs and busting my butt to give everything I can to my kids. I cook almost every night even when I'm tired. I do it for cost, but also to try and give my kids different types of meals. I've never wanted my kids to only eat Mac and cheese or chicken dinos. They're little but they will eat thai, Chinese, indian, Mexican, Vietnamese and more because I try to find new recipes so they try everything. I like feeding my family. But, my ex sees nothing wrong with giving the kids fast food three or four nights a week. 

We're on a weird 2-2-3 schedule, so if I have my kids two days, then I don't two days, then I have them three days and it starts again in reverse. We made this decision because since the kids are so little, a week without them just feels sad and too long. My ex has decided it's okay for her to feed the kids fast food if she has them any weekdays because she doesn't get home with them until 5pm and doesn't ""have time"" to cook. 

We've fought about this previously. She rarely cooked while we were together. She can't cook or doesn't want to cook that's fine. For a while she had started feeding them frozen food heated up, or Mac and cheese with broccoli on the side, which is still better in my opinion. A can of green beans with dinner is still green beans. More often, her mom (who isn't an amazing cook but tries) would make large batch dinners of soup or meatloaf, and the kids would eat that. 

We each had weight problems when we were younger. My ex was over 350 pounds in high school. I don't want my kids to have the body image issues I had growing up. I get that a once in a while happy meal is a great treat, but every time I forget to pull something out of the freezer for dinner or if we're running errands and it would be convenient for lunch, I have to find an alternative or feel terrible since I know how much junk they're eating with their mom. 

I just picked up my kids and the first thing they told me was they had taco bell one day and McDonald's the next. My ex has them the weekend coming up, and I know from experience one if not two of those days will involve fast food, with the other probably Mac and cheese. It's terrible for the kids in my opinion. I went off via text message about giving our kids her weight issues, and told her if she can't feed them a decent meal then give them to me I'd happily take them during the week. She hasn't responded.

TLDR; is fast food fine for a five year old and three year old to eat for dinner three or four days a week? I don't think so.",0.45

Backstory: I (F24) recently cancelled my membership (yesterday i.e. Tuesday, today is Wednesday) to a local gym because I have been doing aerial yoga more consistently (and, quite frankly, wasting money I do not need to be spending to not use a service). My s/o (M25) also recently cancelled this membership, and was in fact the reason that prompted me to look into it since it‚Äôs been over a year and I can cancel without a larger fee. He‚Äôs also relatively active, but by no means is he the pinnacle of fitness. I also want to note that his concerns don‚Äôt come from a place of malice, but because I‚Äôve expressed that I would like to be healthier and look a certain way, but *diagnosed* ED and ADHD have made it difficult to keep the exact aesthetic I would like. 

We were recently having a discussion, and he asks ‚Äúpanda, you‚Äôve cancelled your membership, what are you doing to be active?‚Äù I explain, ‚Äúwell I‚Äôve been *proudly* sticking with my aerial yoga class AND even though I cancelled I went on the elliptical for 30 minutes straight yesterday.‚Äù Immediately, the conversation shifts to ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not enough time, only 30 mins?‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs always excuses, the minimum recommended is 45‚Äù 

I try to start explaining, honestly things I shouldn‚Äôt have to explain at this point but whatever, that I just cancelled yesterday and I surprisingly even went to work out in our humble little home set up?? I ask him, why does everything have to Immediately resort to something negative, why can‚Äôt you just hear me say ‚Äúoh I did aerial Monday and the elliptical yesterday *after cancelling*‚Äù and offer ‚Äúgreat job, keep up the good work!‚Äù 

He immediately goes into, ‚Äúwell you always give excuses for things, so I was just offering that it‚Äôs not enough time; you know I don‚Äôt mean -‚Äú and I just hang up, because it felt pointless to try to explain that I feel like  what i do isn‚Äôt good enough, or my efforts and actions aren‚Äôt going to lead me to the results i want (because I‚Äôm not pushing myself every single day) I didn‚Äôt even offer this conversation up, this was just said out of the blue for it to immediately go left. AITA for just abruptly  ending the conversation and not hearing him out further?",0.25
AITA for lying to my friends online about my gender? [deleted],0.14
"AITA for putting my husband through my make up routine? I (28f) like many women have learned due to the pandemic that I don't have to dress up to societies ridiculous beauty standards, before I use to dress to the nines and made sure I always wore heavy make up (James Charles, Nikki Tutorials level of make up) and made sure my skin was as unblemished and smooth as a baby's skin and were not even gonna get started on my hair situation 

Well my husband (30m) is annoyed by this, he said he liked my old look and he's embarrassed to go out with me now that I've decided to be a lazy slob, I told him I still dress up when we go on dinner dates, when we have important occasions I just don't feel like wearing make up and heels to go to the grocery store or clean the toilet anymore 

He said it wasn't that hard to out on some make up and shave, so I told him if he thought so then to prove it, go through the same treatment I go through to look Good as he put it, he agreed because if I've been doing it for years how hard could it be 

He learned how painful waxing is soon after, he learned how long it takes a woman with long thick, waist length hair to wash, dry and style it, he learned how uncomfortable wearing certain outfits everyday was for me and since he wanted me to wear make up he had too as well (he was in too deep so he let me do his make up, I didn't go full drag I only did some stuff that would enhance his features yet show him how much effort goes into make up) 

Needless to say after a full day of this he told me he was sorry and he didn't realize how much work I put into my appearance, I told him to now imagine the woman who go around getting lip fillers and botox and he laughed and said thank God I wasn't that high maintenance, we both had a laugh about it and I felt I proved my point 

Issue, he was talking to his sisters and told them what I did which they found hilarious because they too also feel it's about time men understood how much work some women put into their looks, well he told his mom what I did and now she's been calling and texting me about how I abused her son

How it's a woman's duty to look good for her husband and how I'm going to drive him away by being a lazy slob and to not be surprised when I end up divorced or cheated on, I ignored her but my husband's now defending me from his mother and she's mad that he's defending me, anyway did I mess up? I was just trying to prove a point

(My mother in law hates me, she wanted her son to marry a tall white, blonde, blue eyed Instagram model who she could be besties with and instead I'm Latina, short and don't agree with her views)",0.1
"WIBTA for continuing to make corny jokes about my sexual identity even though my mom doesn‚Äôt like it? I‚Äôm nineteen, aromantic and asexual, and Christian. I‚Äôm also a bit of a joker- I like to make people laugh. 

I don‚Äôt make a big deal out of my sexuality. I‚Äôm Christian and conservative, and my mom is both Christian and *very* conservative, so I don‚Äôt make a big deal out of it or get into arguments. My mom knows about my sexuality, and she (somewhat) supports it. She does have a slightly weird unfounded fear that I‚Äôm actually a lesbian- I recently got a pixie cut, and she‚Äôs very worried about me looking masculine. But my asexuality she‚Äôs mostly okay with, as long as it doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúturn into‚Äù me being a lesbian. (I am definitely not a lesbian, by the way- I am very firmly happy staying single my whole life and never dating, girls or otherwise. No hate to lesbians, y‚Äôall are great.) 

The problem is, she doesn‚Äôt want me talking about it. At all. I found this out on a recent vacation. We were all stuffed in close quarters- I have three siblings who came with us- and jokes were flying thick and fast. A couple of mine leant into my sexuality- nothing dirty, just dumb little puns with the word ‚Äúace‚Äù or me making jokes about our GPS knowing who was in the car when she said to ‚Äúturn straight.‚Äù I noticed my mom not laughing, but figured she was just focusing on driving. 

For some reason, even though I‚Äôm not legally of age to drink, I own a set of socks with various cocktails/bottles of alcohol/wine puns on them. I don‚Äôt know where I got them. But the last day of our trip, I pulled out a pair of socks that had a glass of wine being poured and read ‚Äústraight chillin‚Äô.‚Äù I had no idea what that meant (still don‚Äôt) so I held up the sock and said ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got the chillin‚Äô part down, but not the straight!‚Äù

This time, no one laughed, and I quickly changed the subject. A few minutes later, Mom abruptly burst out with ‚ÄúYou need to be careful saying you‚Äôre not straight around other Christians, it gives the wrong idea.‚Äù I was kinda taken aback. I don‚Äôt mention my sexuality unless I‚Äôm asked- the corny jokes are only around my family. I like making stupid jokes about it- it helps me feel better about being Christian and ace, since those are both really heavy subjects and I like to lighten it up when I can. 

I do want to be open about who I am. I‚Äôve made my peace with God about my sexuality, although I do still have doubts. I‚Äôm happy being asexual and aromantic, and I like having words to describe my identity. I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm hurting anyone with my dumb, corny jokes. But I can tell that most mentions of my sexuality make my mom uncomfortable. I don‚Äôt want to intentionally make her uncomfortable, but I don‚Äôt want my sexuality to be one of those clandestine family secrets that never gets mentioned. I like who I am, and I like joking about it. But would it make me an asshole to keep doing it if my mom isn‚Äôt comfortable with it?",0.24
WIBTA if I ask my gf to stop bathing with her friend? [deleted],0.95
"AITA for having a girl reprimanded and possibly fired because she kept ignoring me? My (22M) gf(21F) and I went to this local restaurant near our campus two days ago that's pretty well known in our university, right now is empty-ish because most of the people are away with their families.

So, my gf and I went there by 8 pm, the things on the menu are pretty basics; pizza, burgers, fries, etc. This girl came to take our orders ( she was 20-ish? maybe younger than me) and she talks to my gf first to take her order, no big deal, when I think she's going to turn to me she just says ''and what he'll have?'' while asking to my gf and not me, my girl just look at me confused and I answer for myself, the girl writes it down and then says ''something else?'' while still not looking at me. My gf says ''no, that's all'', she leaves and we're like wtf was that, a few minutes go by and then she comes with our orders, she ask if we need something while looking at my girl and we both say no.

She comes by a few times to check if we're good but she doesn't engage with me at all, she doesn't even look at me and I'm starting to feel uncomfortable, I ask for some napkins and she brings them but gives them to my gf, then when my girl goes tot he toilet and I call her to ask for the bill she just ignores me. Straight out ignores me. I just got up, go to the counter where she and a few other girls are taking some orders and I ask what her problem is, she now looks at me, and before she can speak I ask for her manager.

She brings an old lady and I explain what just happened; that while the overall service was good, she didn't even look at me once, pretended I wasn't even there and ignored me when I called her for the bill. The girl mutters something but the old lady says they'll talk later and offers me to cover the bill. I say ''nah, just bring the check'', which she does, I pay and wait for my gf outside. When we go back home she asked me what happened because she saw the girl being reprimanded and I tell her, she calls me an AH because the girl might've some trauma regarding men or idk and that she might get fired. I was okay with my behavior until that point, AITA?

**ETA: Answered some comments, came here to say that my gf went to the restaurant to pick some food and found out that the girl was indeed fired**",0.42
"AITA for losing trust in my boyfriend over a garden? My B/F (31M) and I( 32F) have been together for almost five years now. A year and a half ago we bought a house together mainly due to my efforts. Once we moved in I ended up purchasing almost everything for the home- all the furniture, new flooring, groceries for the first few months, cleaning supplies, bathroom supplies, etc. Basically everything the home needed I bought myself. I was alright with this because my B/F had to recoup his money and I had a lot more reserves after the home sale.

The only responsibility my B/F had was the garden.

When we moved in, everything was clay. There was no grass, plants, nothing. My B/F promised me he would take care of it since I had basically paid for everything the first 6-8 months in the home. Well, months passed by, and still no garden. (We have a dog and it broke my heart seeing him struggle to walk over that clay just to go potty). We got into many arguments about it. After every single argument, we both end up apologizing (me for getting angry and him for procrastinating). Eventually, after a lot of hair-pulling, he got around to the garden.  
Except....the grass he planted died because he never watered it and never set up the sprinkler system.  
He bought a bunch of potted plants and then never put them in the ground or watered them so they died.  
He dug a giant trench to remedy the soil and now we have a giant clay mound in front of our house that hasn't moved in over six months.  
The flowers he did put in the ground died because he installed too many drip lines and they flooded the area and he never went back to fix it.  
Literally, the only thing still living in the garden are the two trees I PLANTED! Everything he planted or was in charge of has either died or is in the process of dying due to his own procrastination.

It seems so unfair that I spent so much money on the house and the one responsibility he had he just gets to shuck off. Now, whenever I look out on the yard I am resentful. I have tried asking him nicely, offering him help, telling him how it makes me feel, to finally getting angry and blowing up on him. I hate arguing with him but it always comes to that when I see no progress and watch as he wastes money on plants and grass that just end up dying.

So today, I went outside and started weeding and realized I am doing everything for this house and I've had enough. When he came home today I snapped at him and told him if he can't even handle this one responsibility how can I ever trust him with future responsibilities like children? He claims that kids and gardening are completely different things and that I'm blowing it out of proportion. I responded that I can't trust him anymore.

Did I go too far? Was it wrong to feel like my trust in him is completely broken over this one thing? He's great in other aspects- caring, patient, and a good listener. But it's so hard hearing him promise me over and over again how this will get done and knowing it's a lie.

AITA for getting mad that my neighbour isn‚Äôt parking in a handicapped spot? [deleted],0.87
"AITA for going to game night once a week? Once a week (usually Friday nights) I get together with some of my buddies to play board games and card games. Wife and I have 2 kids, 4 and 6, so I don't want to leave my wife hanging so I set up some ground rules. 

I cook dinner on that day. We split who cooks dinner based on whose more stressed out, but I gurantees cook dinner on game night. 

Kids have to be in bed and at least 80 percent asleep before I can go. Usually around 8ish.

If she wants me to stay home then I stay home. 

Start heading home at 12:30. 

Been doing this for about a year but lately my wife has been making more and more comments about me doing this and how I'm leaving her. She says it in a joking way, but she has said it so often that I know she's not joking. we're moving into summer so the kids are out of school so more time with her while I'm at work. 

I think the ground rules I set for myself are pretty reasonable. Just wondering if I'm being dense by still going to game night and if im being the asshole",0.27
"AITA for denying my dad quality time with me? My (17M) family is pretty well off: we live in a nicely sized house, and money hasn't been an issue throughout my childhood. I'm not saying that to brag cause none of it is due to my own personal accomplishments, but I just want to clarify that money doesn't at all play a part into our current situation. A year ago, my dad (46M) divorced my mom (46F). She was totally in love with him, and they'd been married for about 20 years. His only reason for leaving her was because he ""didn't like being married anymore""; he didn't leave her for another woman or cheat on her, just to be clear. He hasn't moved on to another woman, but has made it very clear that he no longer wants to be married to my mom. Obviously, this devastated my mother. She went into a very deep depressive episode, which she still struggles from. She is a very smart and driven woman who works as an oncologist, but she had to have her sister call her to motivate her to get out of bed every morning so she wouldn't lose her job. I listened to her cry herself to sleep every night for months, as her room is right next to mine. This was agonizing to watch. I hated every minute of my mom's mental torture. My dad's departure from their marriage didn't mean he loved his kids (I have a 15F sister) any less, but only lost love for his wife. He now lives in an apartment a few miles away from our house, and we see him a few times a week when he comes over for dinner. Nowadays, my dad has been making a significant effort to spend more time with me, often trying to get me to go on hikes or beach trips or even grocery shopping with him (not that he was neglecting me before, he's just making a very noticeable effort now). He tells me that he wants to be able to spend time with me before I go off to college next year, cause he's rarely ever gonna see me when I'm hundreds of miles away from him. However, I've often responded to his invitations/demands to do bonding activities with, ""Maybe you should've stayed with us if you wanted to spend more time together."" I feel like it's a valid point, and he should've considered the repercussions of his actions before leaving, but it also feels harsh towards an aging man who wants to be there for his kids' last few years of childhood. This really upsets him, and I feel a little guilty for doing it, but I also can't forgive him for breaking my mom's heart beyond repair. AITA?

EDIT: My mother was an excellent wife to him, she always catered to his needs and supported him emotionally, and at times was even too nice. I personally thought she let his lack of effort slide a few times because she loved him too much and didn't want to confront him and make him start to hate her. She did everything she could to stop him from wanting to leave, but he did anyway.",0.16
"AITA for telling my friends to stop trying to be friends with my mom My (17F) mom (41F) is a ""cool"" mom. For as long as I can remember, everyone has always thought of her as such. I mean, I have memories of being like eight and having everyone who came over to our apartment tell me how jealous they were because my mom just let us do whatever we wanted. I have never been grounded in my life, even though I've definitely pulled some shit that warranted it. 

It's the kind of thing that seems really fun when you're like six and being allowed to eat candy for breakfast, but it's just become aggravating the longer time goes on. I love my mom, and I know she loves me, but I also know there's not much I can actualy go to her for. She's one to reply to just go with the flow to anything ever which isn't helpful when you're like nine and trying to understand homework.  The point is, my mom is cool with me and my friends doing just about anything at our place, and is out of town every other weekend so we often have the place to ourselves, and is also a generally charismatic person, so my friends (Mike and Liz, both 18) like her. A lot. 

Since school is out for the summer, we've been spending time hanging out at the apartment and it's just gotten annoying how often my friends will try to just go make conversation with her when she's home. Like not polite conversation but straight up head over to the kitchen when we're somewhere else to try to get some fun story out of her and stuff like that. And I feel annoying and petty for it but I do not want my friends to try to make friends with my mom, or to spend the time we're meant to be hanging out making conversation with her so they can later tell me about how cool they think she is. So I told them as such and they started joking around about how I'm ""gatekeeping"" her since she's so laid back and I told them that I was serious and that it's not actually fun to have a mom who doesn't give a shit what you do. 

So we're kind of in an argument right now over it. Mike wants me to apologize for getting mad over it in the first place since it's ""really not a big deal"" if they want to make friends with her and Liz has just not spoken to me since.",0.75
"AITA for wanting a better deal on a gift? Ok, the title makes it sound horrible but hear me out;

Short context: I am very soon moving into my own home. I am finally getting out of sharehousing and moving in by myself to a brand new house. I'm using this as an opportunity to update and upgrade all my furniture and homewares, now that I'm not in a bachelor pad with two other younger blokes. 

Yesterday, my partner surprised me by buying me a four piece pot set ($180) and a 9 piece knife set ($110) \*seperately\* (this is important) on sale as a housewarming gift.

I was honestly floored; she has just finished Chemotherapy for breast cancer, and has been on benefits for the better part of a year, so her funds are minimal, to say the least. She explained that she's happy to have bought me the $110 knife block as a gift, but that I can take my time paying her back for the $180 pot set as she knows I need it now but can't afford the full cost. 

Now here's where I'm not sure if I'm in the right. I've been eyeing the exact same sale online, and they are selling an identical knife set, and an identical pot set with two additional pots as a package for a total price of $260, thirty dollars cheaper than what she has spent. My partner didn't know this as it is an online only deal, and she went into the store itself.

I made sure I spent a good 5-10 minutes thanking her and showering her with affection for the impromptu gift, before I mentioned to her the better deal online. I casually suggested that for the sake of the better deal, we could return the set she has bought, and we can get the online set with the two extra pots for the cheaper price. Essentially paying $30 less for two extra pots.

She seemed pretty upset about this, and although she didn't outwardly say anything, I got a strong impression that she felt I was being ungrateful. I'm honestly over the moon that she went out of her way to do something so nice for me, but I just feel it's a bit silly to spend more money on less when there is a better option out there.

So, AITA for wanting a better deal?

TL;DR - Girlfriend bought me a pot and knife set for $290. The exact same set is available with extra pots for a cheaper price online, and I want to upgrade for the better deal.",0.32
AITA for throwing their yard waste back on their lawn? So the homeowners of the corner house in front of me like putting small piles of yard waste on the street with cones at either side they spread them so far apart that it takes up quite a big chunk of potential parking space given the fact that there is very limited parking space on our street. Currently there is a single piece of 2x4 on the street marked off by cones. They have a yard waste bin that they do not use and could easily put their yard waste in. On one particular I punctured my oil filter because I drove over what I thought was grass trimmings but was actually  hiding old fence board with nails sticking straight up. (How it happened I had no idea just my luck) it‚Äôs more a concern because there are children that walk around and I worry they would do something like that again and cause injury to someone. Am I the asshole for moving their cones and moving whatever is on the street onto their yard?,0.03

"WIBTA, if I started to comment on how much friend eats? I(F19) am on the heavier side and my friend (F19) is taller and skinnier. Recently she started to throw these weird comments at me when we are out eating. When we order food, and finish my plate. She always says things like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand how you‚Äôve finished everything‚Äù and ‚Äúhow did you eat all of it?‚Äù
Recently we went to a sushi buffet, I took approximately 8 sushis at first. And she straightaway started to comment on how I always Finish everything on my plate and eat a lot. I right away lost my appetite and didn‚Äôt go back for second round. She also does this in front of people but never alone. It got the point where I start to leave food on my plate when I‚Äôm with her. 

Would I be the Asshole if I throw similar remarks at her, to show how uncomfortable she makes me feel?

EDIT:
I‚Äôm sorry causing a misunderstanding but I forgot to mention this has been going one for weeks now. And I have actually discussed with her few years ago, how I feel uncomfortable finishing my food when people around me don‚Äôt eat as much.

I‚Äôve tried for years to see her before (she‚Äôs pregnant with his baby now), but she always put him first before they got engaged, and now I would be flying all the to Western South America from Western Europe for only three days. I don‚Äôt think IWBTA because it seems odd that she placed him on a pedestal for so long when her friend who lives in another continent is only given three days when they would visit each other for three months and they lived closer in distance.

"AITA for kicking my cousin out of my birthday party? TLDR at the end.

I have not seen my cousin, who we'll call Courtney, in about three years. She is currently 16, I am 17. She became an attention seeker at around 12-13, which was the time I went no contact with her after she started spreading rumors about my favorite cousin.

I also came out as pansexual during one little comment at a family dinner we both attended around a few months ago when things were starting to open back up. Seeing this, Courtney decided she wanted the same treatment.

In August, I had my first birthday 'party' in a while after the pandemic started to cool down. By 'party', I mean a celebration with more than just my parents, sister, and dog. I decided to invite her, as she might have changed.

Skip to the party. we were all having a great time. However, Courtney wanted her *own* spotlight. So, she stood up on a chair and clinked her glass. She already requested everybody outside to come inside for her announcement. She told everyone that she waited for months to finally come out of the closet, as a member of the LGBTQ+ community. I, like all the others, showered her in applause. I internally questioned why she would do it on my birthday, but I was happy to share my birthday with her coming out of the closet in hopes of mending our relationship. A little later, I came over to her by the present table and congratulated Courtney on coming out, asking her about her sexual orientation. All of a sudden, her attitude completely changed. ""I'm straight. Why would I want to be like you freaks?"" Quote.

I cursed at her and yelled at her to get out of my house. By then, all eyes were on us. She faked some tears, as a piece of human garbage, and threw her cake on the floor as she left. The party had pretty much been over at that point, presents had already been opened and people were starting to leave, but this really screwed the mood.

It became sort of a 'family drama' for about two weeks, and then it cooled down. Until now.

My family and I have a lot of birthdays in June, including my sister's. So, we usually all get together at a nice restaurant, have dinner, and celebrate. We were all notified Courtney would not be attending due to how rude I was to her at my birthday. She would only attend if I apologized to her. I did not apologize and would not apologize, her comments were unforgivable on top of how she treated me and a few of my other cousins like shit. I start to feel bad because I may have insulted her harshly at my birthday. I don't know what she went through at home or why she acted the way she did. Even then, I still won't apologize for a homphobe.

TLDR; Cousin comes out of the closet for attention at my birthday, I kicked her out, now she won't come to our June birthday dinner unless I apologize.",0.03
"AITA for telling my parents they can‚Äôt see their future granddaughter if the can‚Äôt follow certain rules I‚Äôve expressed over and over again? Hello, I am a 26f who‚Äôs about 30 weeks pregnant , due date on august 21st. Even before I was born my parents have been drug addicts (crack cocain) and refuse to get help because they don‚Äôt do it everyday, but they cannot handle their own money or even pay bills on time (they are always 1-2 months behind on all the bills) this has lead to us moving from home to home and being homeless twice. I am the oldest of 4 children and if I‚Äôm not handling the money then one of my siblings is. I have tried countless times to help them stop but they always make the excuse that they can‚Äôt and that I don‚Äôt understand because I‚Äôm not a addict etc. I have been in a long term relationship about 10 years with my bf (m27) and we moved in together last year and I found out I was pregnant mid December 2021 . When I found out I had already told them that they need to get there shit together and stop or I will not let them see my daughter when she‚Äôs born , they told me that they would and wouldn‚Äôt do anything to risk not seeing there first and maybe only grandchild. 


Well just recently my mother has been diagnosed with stage 2 breast cancer and has been going threw chemotherapy treatments and im the only one that has been able to go with her and drive her home. Last week was her last treatment and I was talking to my sister who still lives with my parents and took her to the side and asked her to be honest with me and asked have they still been doing drugs. She told me yes and that they never actually stopped. Well that pissed me off and I went threw my mothers text messages on her phone and they also confirmed that my parents just recently done drugs. So today I called her on the phone and explained that I know that they are still using and she tried to lie and say it‚Äôs been awhile and I said there‚Äôs no need to lie , my sister has already confirmed it and I went threw your phone and the messages date  earlier this week. I then said you guys know how I feel and I told you before if you can‚Äôt stop then I cannot bring my daughter around you guys, that‚Äôs when she got quite and told me she would call me back and she hasn‚Äôt. This was earlier today and I just kept thinking about it and thinking maybe I‚Äôm being to harsh , do you guys think I was being a AH?

EDIT: I should have been clear but it‚Äôs not just about my mother it‚Äôs my mother AND father they both are still using and have blamed one another for the addiction for years and also blame one another on why they can‚Äôt stop. Both my mother and father have been physically and emotionally abusive to me and my siblings all our lives and even after my father having congestive heart failure and my mothers resent diagnosis of cancer they both seem to disregard there health and continue to use and lie to doctors saying they stopped years ago when that‚Äôs a bold face lie.",0.23
"WIBTA If I Filed a Noise Complaint Against My Upstairs Neighbor? Hi guys, I (22F) recently moved into a new apartment on Tuesday with my two roommates. We heard some light stomping the day of move-in but were too worn out to think anything of it. However the next morning, I started to hear heavy stomping and what sounds like banging against the floors, and this continued from around 7am to roughly 9pm. I‚Äôve also heard children yelling from upstairs too. 

On Thursday the banging was so loud it sounded like the kids were body-slamming themselves into the floor. I did go upstairs to try and talk it out with the neighbors, and even gave them cookies as a peace offering but she was very unhappy with me and gave me the answer of ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt get to go outside so you‚Äôre going to hear stomping.‚Äù From what I saw, there are 4 children in the apartment, with the oldest looking no older than 12. I want to be understanding because they are just children and probably don‚Äôt know how loud they are but this goes on all day long and makes it hard to get homework or cleaning done when I can‚Äôt concentrate.

If it was light walking around or even just some stomping here and there, I‚Äôd understand but they rough-house very loudly and I‚Äôve even heard their mother screaming at them from upstairs. This goes on for at least 8 hours a day with hardly any time between where they‚Äôre quiet.

I might be an asshole if I file a noise complaint because it is just children playing and I can‚Äôt force them to be quiet all the time (Which isn‚Äôt the case at all, I just want the banging to stop), and she could get reprimanded by the office if she gets too many complaints. I feel like there are solutions to this because our complex offers a playground which is right next to this building, but I can‚Äôt force her to take her children outside to play. 

At the same time, I do think I deserve to be able to do my homework without all the distractions. I‚Äôve had no other issues with my other neighbors, only this specific one. So WBITA if I filed a noise complaint against my neighbor?",0.04

"AITA for not wanting to name our 2nd baby after my husband‚Äôs dead brother when I chose our 1st child‚Äôs name? Me (29F) and my husband (32M) are expecting baby number 2 and recently found out he‚Äôs a boy. When we had our first child (4F), I wanted her to have a French name because I am French. My husband agreed to this and we both made lists of French girl names until we agreed on one of my suggestions.

Three years ago, my husband‚Äôs older brother sadly passed away. They were extremely close and his death hit my husband hard. When we found out the gender of our baby, my husband was ecstatic because he could honor his brother by naming our baby after him. I don‚Äôt really want to name our baby after his brother. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, his brother was an amazing person, but his name was somewhat old-fashioned and not appealing to me as our child‚Äôs name. I‚Äôd also like our baby to have a name of his own, if that makes sense? When I told my husband I wanted to think of other names, he got upset and said it would mean a lot to him and his family and that I wasn‚Äôt being supportive. He then said that I got to choose our first child‚Äôs name so why couldn‚Äôt he choose our second‚Äôs.

I argued that I chose the theme of the name but we BOTH decided on the name together. I suggested his brother‚Äôs name could be the baby‚Äôs middle name, or we could choose a name that started with the same letter, but he shot down the suggestions and went to his parent's house. It‚Äôs been two days now and he‚Äôs been pretty short to me. He also told his mother about our disagreement and she‚Äôs been sending me messages about family and selfishness since then. Her texts and my husband‚Äôs silence have started to make me doubt myself and I‚Äôm wondering if I‚Äôm in the wrong. AITA?

"AITA for cancelling my trip to see my best friend spontaneously? So, my best friend moved out like 5 years ago; before that, we were living together. She moved across the country (which is around an 8 hour drive here). We see each other around twice or three times a year. 

This year, we were supposed to meet two times. And two times I cancelled practically the day we should've met. The first time, we should've met for a weekend at a friend's, but I had a positive 'rona test, so it didn't work out (and I really hated that, too). Turns out I wasn't positive at all either, the test was faulty.

Then, this weekend, again. On Monday there's a concert of a huge artist in her city. I got the tickets (luckily!) and we were both extremely excited for it. Thing is, my boyfriend is mentally ill, to a very severe degree - he isn't able to work right now because of that, either: his therapist doesn't allow it until he's better. 

My boyfriend was supposed to tag along for the trip. But he did feel very bad the last weeks already (which I didn't tell my best friend). Today, he had constant panic attacks and cried a lot. He knew he was incapable of going and I knew I couldn't leave him alone like this for a couple of days. 

So I told my best friend, and she seems to be mad about it; I, again, am cancelling something last minute. I also think she in general thinks I don't care about her, which isn't true at all - I was extremely excited to see her and go to the concert, but I can't leave my boyfriend alone like that in good conscience. It's not even putting him above her, I just don't want to leave him alone when he's mentally ill.

But should I have handled things differently? Told her sooner that that might happen? (I honestly didn't think it would, but maybe I should've?) AITA?",0.39

"AITA for cancelling a vacation for my sister‚Äôs surgeries? I had planned a vacation a month ago with a really close friend of mine. I was excited to go. My sister got into an accident the Wednesday before we were supposed to leave (we were leaving Saturday). 

I texted my friend explaining my situation Wednesday night when it happened and that my sister needs surgery. Found out the next day my sis needs 2 surgeries on her leg. Was on ‚Äúwait‚Äù with the hospital until Friday for the first surgery. Was at the hospital Wednesday-thursday nights til 2am waiting for her to be ‚Äúwheeled in‚Äù any second. Didn‚Äôt happen til Friday 2pm.

I officially canceled the vacation Friday at noon when my sister hadn‚Äôt been called in yet. My friend got upset and told me I‚Äôm inconsiderate since she can‚Äôt go any other time. She offered to wait a week to go, but not knowing any surgery dates I told her I can‚Äôt promise her and if she‚Äôs willing to wait and see then yes but I can‚Äôt book for a certain date right now.  
Am I the asshole for cancelling even though it was booked and wanting to be here for my sisters surgeries (not life threatening but not easy ‚Äî quoting the doctor ‚Äúthe second surgery will be tough both to do and to recuperate from‚Äù) ?

EDIT: 
- she wanted to wait until Friday noon to decide. I told her I‚Äôd have to cancel (or postpone if she could wait) on Thursday. She insisted on waiting until Friday to see if my sis would have had the first surgery at least. (I had told her if the 1st is done and we have a date for 2Nd surgery and it‚Äôs not while we‚Äôre away then I can go)
- she couldn‚Äôt be gone after the 28TH of June as she starts a new job and wanted to be home one week before she started.
- we had cancellation insurance, no money was lost
- my dad is having surgery the same week, my mom is taking care of him so I would be primary caregiver for my sis.",0.12

"AITA because I screamed at my bf for being addicted to video games and saying he was a bum So I called him a manchild, near homeless bum(lives with his parents), jobless bum, and such. I feel as I have gone to far for too little. Maybe I should have tried couples therapy before casting judgment. Also screaming and hurling insults was childish and idiotic from me so I want to know if at least it was justified.

So here is the context.

So usually we meet on the weekends, and when I have part-time uni (I'm European) every other weekend we meet during the weekday since he doesn't work or study. I love martial arts and classes are usually during the weekday it helps relieve the stress and helps me get through being bullied in middle school for being kinda gayish.

I missed too many classes as of late and really wanted to be on Monday's class so I proposed that we meet during a national holiday on  Thursday, he refused so I naturally said why I would not bother him too much if it was something important like family dinner.

He proudly declares that Lost Arks patch is coming out and he will spend hole 2 days gaming. I kinda lost it at this point since it recently became a big problem after he quit his shift manager job at Mcdonald's and didn't get a new one to date (its been 1 and a half years now) . He was gaming on weekends around 1 to 2 hours a day when we would meet ,and around 12-16 if we didn't .

I begged him to get therapy and a job and to keep up his minimal exercise routine (2 days a week for an hour and a half) , he had to go to therapy to get his sick leave as an employee extended anyway so he went to it and at least exercised. He told me he needed a break from working I understood that and only started talking about another job after half a year of doing nothing , earning nothing and not being on sick leave (he was half a year on mental sick leave before quitting) .

I felt so powerless that I couldn't convince him to get a job which would be a must at his age (24). He tried to convince me that he would make money through streaming on twitch, and he quit that around a month ago saying that this time he was going to become an Instagram influencer while starting with 0 followers. And what he said today was the last straw i called him an unmotivated bum who is addicted and said many mean things after.

He countered by saying I'm addicted to exercise? and that i wouldn't last a month without it which isn't true because when I was injured i didn't exercise for a whole month , and i then told him i dont work out while im with him. I then said he should quit gaming for a month or 3 weeks he said that i should go fuck myself. We have been together for 3 and a half years and i feel as if I had fallen in love with the wrong person which could be true because he was my first love and we started dating when i was 17 and he was 20 or 21.",0.38
"AITA for being angry I am a college student ""home"" for the summer with a step dad I have extremely mixed feelings for. Just recently I was venting to my mom about something stupid that he had said that had gotten me angry. He turns out to come around the corner yelling at me for talking shit and at her for letting it happen. He proceeds to ask that this is how I act after ""all the bullshit I've put them through"" and to never ask anything of him ever again and then slams the door to go inside. 

I was upset over the other day when he had come into my room wondering what was up with me. (I just like to keep to myself, especially at home to avoid trouble). He said everything pretty nice compared to how he usually does, but he was saying things like nobody likes living in a pig sty or to have to clean up after me. His examples were that fact I had made crepes the other day and the kitchen (dishes washed, dried, then put away, counters wiped off) wasn't completely taken care of, which I get but I wouldn't called the place a pigsty because of it, and then about a vacuum in the middle of the hallway.

This vacuum had been sitting in a small hallway where it had been taking up half of the walk space. It was still plugged in and I didn't know what the hell they were doing with it. I kept stubbing my toes on it until I eventually put it back into their room. Now his point here is that I should have just taken care of the vacuum and not put it in their room. I told him I kept stubbing my toes on it and he said that he didn't care. Also, the fact that it seemed completely hypocritical to the cleaning up after each other thing made me kind of angry. So I was just venting to my mom about it. I also had brought up the ""nobody likes living in a pig sty"" and then compared it to the rest of the house. We literally have walls of boxes, the kitchen table is never cleared of his shit, and the whole garage is just a massive pile of tools and shit he doesn't use.

An important thing to note is that my step dad is handicapped. He got easily angry and everything started to kinda revolve around him. I would understand this reason more if it wasn't the only one for more than 12 years.

I am writing this post because I don't want to believe that I am ""an asshole"" or ""manipulative"" or ""delusional"" or have ""lost touch with reality."" I am so tired of this fucking environment. It is so subtly controlling and demeaning I'm going to lose my mind. I feel guilty that I've hurt his feelings, but I'm also pissed that I've just been so emotionally ignored for so long. I don't want to experience this guilt to learn that he doesn't really care much about me (which I've been told is a possibilty by friends), but I don't want to hold onto this anger if it turns out I'm actually delusional.

"AITA for picking up a shift & ruining my ex/roommates date night? Some backstory before I get into why I'm posting this.

So I (30M) dated the mother(32F) of my 2 kids since 2016. Things have been on a slow downward spiral for some time, & in March, she suggested we seperate, & I agreed. It was a mutual split & things have been fine. In April, she got a boyfriend & has been spending time w/ him when she gets the chance. Every time she texts, calls or asks me if it's cool if she goes to his house, I tell her yes. I have no problem watching the kids.

Friday evening I picked up a shift on sunday night. We got into an argument today b/c I picked up a shift & she had plans for them, but never told me. I asked her when these plans were made, & she told me w/in the last few days. She argued I should've asked if she had plans in advance, however, being that every single time she has made plans to be w/ him she talked to me, I assumed she didn't. During our argument, I told her it's not my business to be involved between her & her boyfriend, & I told her this b/c every other Sunday is the only day she can spend the day w/ him. I never put two & two together until she mentioned it, but b/c it's not my business when or what plans she has for them, but to only know ahead of time so I don't have plans also & don't need to find a babysitter.

I should further note that every other Sunday is also when I get free time to spend time w/ my family also. I work Thursday through Saturday for Amazon, 630 PM to 7 AM. I've worked this shift since October, & have done nothing since then since everyone is working on the workdays that I have off. I wanted to reiterate before there was assumption I was doing things & not letting her have her time w/ him, which I do every other sunday. I typically keep our girls & spend a few hours at our grandmothers when the ex is w/ her boyfriend.

"AITA for telling my mother why she expects me to give help her become a US citizen after the way she‚Äôs treated me? I (18F) got into an argument today with my mom (F50) right before I was supposed to go to work. My mom gives me rides to work everyday because neither her or my dad has taken the time to teach me how to drive. I don‚Äôt even have a car I could practice or learn on or even my own car for that matter. 

She started telling me to get ready for work at 3:30 when I was supposed to be at work at 4 and it‚Äôs only a 10 minute drive at most. So I held off on getting ready till about 3:40. Once I was done getting ready my mom started scolding me, telling me that she‚Äôs tired of my attitude about not caring enough about my job and that she doesn‚Äôt want my tardiness to reflect on her since we work together. We work in the food industry so I told her that it‚Äôs not that serious and we‚Äôre not saving lives here, I would also still be on time today anyways. She said that she didn‚Äôt care. 

As we were now in the car we kept arguing and she was yelling at me. That‚Äôs when I told her why she expects me to help her become a US citizen if she treats me this way. Both of my parents are immigrants and are not legal citizens. 

She got out of the car refusing to take me to work after I said that and started saying how she was no longer going to help me get a car like she promised as a high school graduation present. She started yelling at me saying that she doesn‚Äôt need to depend on me for her citizenship. She told me to get an Uber but also told me to just go back to my room missing work. She refused to give me the number of the manager I would need to call to tell that I wasn‚Äôt going. Making me no call no show. She also said how she was no longer going to give me rides to work and that she was going to take my job away. 

Luckily my dad was home so I told him to give me a ride to work and he did. But my dad is not reliable because he can‚Äôt hold jobs is an alcoholic and has called me slurs over small things and doesn‚Äôt help my mom pay the bills. Him and my mom have hated each other since I was a kid and my mom has been trying to get separated from him and can‚Äôt because they‚Äôre not legally married.  

This is not the first time my mom has threatened to take my job away. She used to force me to pay everyone‚Äôs phone bill even though I did not make enough and took me off the phone plan as a result. When I was 15 my mom refused to pick me up after school one day because we had argued over me not doing a chore.

"AITA for saying my classmate her personal problems are not our fault and she needs to work harder? (firstly I want to apologize for any mistakes, English is not my first language. I am also writing this on mobile, so there might be formatting issues)

I (22f) am a journalism student. I'm about to graduate and one of the courses I'm taking right now it's radio, for that class we had to create a program for the college radio station so it's kinda serious. I'm in a work group since day one and we're actually doing okay! Our professors have said we're getting better. But there's one girl who just doesn't seem to get it together, if our professor has any criticism about our program, then it's probably her section (we all have gotten corrections al least once, but there's something wrong with her part every class) 

We all have actually tried to help her, some of us have had ""real"" radio programs before so they have more experience. But she is just always the same, she doesn't pay attention to what we're telling her and then does everything wrong again. I've actually tried to kick her out (i know I was a asshole for this but it was when she didn't attend to class two times in a row and she didn't even notice us) ans my classmates agreed but our professor told us not to. 

We're ten people in total and divide the work (so we choose whos the locutor, journalists, weather, and production) production has to write the whole program and has a lot of stress. We try to tell whoever is in production that day what we're gonna talk about early so they can plan everything and have some sleep (our program is live on Mondays morning kinda early) but she never does her part unless you keep pressing her (and still she usually sends it late). I've been in production a lot of times (i am kinda good at it) and have been sleep deprived because of her. 

I confronted her last week because she was just staring and not doing anything, so I kinda yell at her and told her to ""get up and work because she never does anything"" (i said that, I'm not proud of it). After our program was done for the day, she apologize and told me she had personal issues and that's why she doesn't contribute that much to the group. I told her that wasn't our problem and that we all probably have issues but still do our work. She said she was gonna change but I told her that we couldn't even to be early (because she's always late) so she shouldn't make promises that she can't keep. She said nothing more and neither did my classmates.

I didn't think any of it until today, that same classmate sent in the group chat that she can't go to class next Monday because she has some family issue. I was then talking to another classmate (who's in the same group) and she told me I probably scared her and that's why she won't go to class next Monday.
I then told what happened to my sisters and they said I was right to call her out if she was lazy ans didn't help but I was an asshole because she said she had serious issues and that's why she couldn't help that much.

"AITA for feeling my boyfriends sisters anxiety is self-centred? This could be a long one‚Ä¶

I (19f) and my boyfriend (21m) both come from privileged households with a similar income. 
To ensure I knew the value of money etc, I‚Äôve worked part-time since I was 11 and had three part-time jobs at one point so I could afford to pay for my own car. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôve still grown up very privileged and appreciate how lucky I am- but my parents did their best not to spoil me crazy etc. 
I might also add that my family have had and still do have major issues regarding physical health. For example; my mother has a brain tumour, 3 uncles have cancer, last year I underwent major spinal surgery and took months to learn to walk again etc (the list could go on)- but none of us ever complain- we just get on with it and fight it with all we have. 

My boyfriends family on the other hand have always spoilt him and his sister (18) which is fair enough, their choice how they raise their kids I guess.
His sister has never worked a day in her life and is constantly demanding (and immediately getting) anything she wants. This wouldn‚Äôt bother me that much if she showed any sign of appreciation but she treats her parents (and everyone else) like rubbish. 
Here‚Äôs a few examples;
‚Ä¢Her parents went away on a holiday and left her at home (she refused to go anywhere else), she then threw a massive party and people smashed the place up. Their holiday was ruined and they had to come home early. There was never an apology. 
‚Ä¢ After her parents ordering her her first car ( a brand new BMW worth around ¬£30000) she changed her mind and got a brand new mercedes worth even more. 
‚Ä¢ She decided she wanted to move out on her own, so her dad bought her a flat where she was able to design every spec of it‚Ä¶ she then decided she didn‚Äôt like it and wanted one elsewhere. 

She seems to get off with everything due to her ‚Äúanxiety‚Äù but it honestly seems she only has it when at convenience to her (i.e not wanting to go to school etc). There has been a countless amount of times where she‚Äôs left the family broken as she will refuse last minute to go somewhere (i.e a family event that has been planned for months) due to her anxiety but then will go out partying the same night. 

I just struggle to understand how you can seemingly pick and choose when to have anxiety? 
My family have had struggles with mental health as well- my cousin has it and I‚Äôve seen how detrimental it‚Äôs been to her life but it happens all around not just when she can‚Äôt be bothered to do or go somewhere, and my grandfather and I both suffer from PTSD (him due to war and I after an event that happened when I was 13) but idk. 

AITA for feeling like her ‚Äúanxiety‚Äù is more her just being self-centred and spoiled? and WIBTA if I told my boyfriend my thoughts on this?

"AITA for taking my son home from my MIL's dinner table before supper is served? My mother in law is always late. Whenever we go over for supper, it's usually served an hour later than she says it will be. One night I had my 2 year old over and supper was extremely late (as usual). It was so late that it was past his bedtime (in her defense, he goes to bed really early, like 5:30 or 6pm because he's an early to bed early to rise kind of guy). 

Everyone started to sit down for supper (finally), and the food hadn't even come out of the oven yet. That would mean we'd need to wait at least another 10 mins for it to cool enough for him to eat. He was already cranky and starting to throw tantrums from being hungry and tired.

I said that this was ridiculous, and I grabbed him and headed home to feed him and put him to bed (we live only a few minutes away, and I had leftovers that I heated up). I made it clear how mad I was over dinner being over an hour late and still not ready to eat.

I left my husband there with our 4 year old (I figured she could stay up later than usual because she's a bit older).

I apologized the next day to my MIL over text, and explained my frustrations. She didn't respond. I'm just so sick of my time and schedule not being respected. Since this happened I usually opt to be the one to host supper so that it gets on the table at a decent time. Am I the asshole here?

EDIT: to clarify it was Sunday and she was not working. She said dinner would be served at 4:30. We arrived at 3:30. I grabbed my son and left at 5:30.

Also a lot of ppl are saying ""just don't go anymore"". Can you imagine your spouse never going to your parents house again? That would ruin our relationship.

"AITA for calling my bf out whilst he was drunk? I (18f) and my boyf (20m) have been together for a couple of months now.

Last night we went on a night out with a few of his work mates. My bf had drank half a bottle of vodka before and I knew that this would not turn out too well as I knew when he drinks a lot he joking starts poking me, which I‚Äôve told him multiple times that it hurts, or starts swearing at me. We were in the queue for the club and randomly made a comment about how me, him and one of my gf should have a 3some. I shrugged it off but it upset me abit but he had fancied her awhile back. He has asked me to have one before I have told him that I am not interested but if he wants to he can have one with other people but not in our relationship. I am his 1st relationship and this is my 3rd so I‚Äôve done the ‚Äúexperimenting‚Äù when he hasn‚Äôt yet and I know he wants to.

My bf was denied entry to the club due to him looking ‚Äútoo drunk‚Äù but I wasn‚Äôt. However, I wasn‚Äôt going to leave him whilst I went and had a good time so I left as soon he texted me. 

We were told to come back at midnight so we both went and found a bench to sit on. Something was said that sparked a stern tone in his voice whilst we were walking to the bench, I told him that he hasn‚Äôt been nice to me all night and that he kept on telling me to F off. He replied with ‚ÄúYou can go back in the club if you want I will be fine‚Äù I didn‚Äôt want to go back in the club I had the keys to my flat which he was staying in and I didn‚Äôt want to leave him because he was clearly drunk. He asked for my keys and told me to go back. He had also sent me money to get some drinks for us throughout the night as I knew people who worked at the bar. He demanded the money back saying ‚ÄúI want to see you send me then go‚Äù I was slowly starting to get wound up from his tone of voice but I just got up and helped him home.

On the way home I said I didn‚Äôt like how he asked me for a 3some and told me ‚ÄúIt was a joke‚Äù. He has jokes like these when he‚Äôs around his work mates which I understand. I reminded him I don‚Äôt joke about these thing and said ‚ÄúRemember I am your friend but I am also your gf I am not one of your work mates, I do have banter with you, I can joke about with you but it‚Äôs not something to say to me‚Äù.

We got home and he went to the toilet and he kept on telling me to F off because I wouldn‚Äôt leave him to be sick yet I felt responsible if he needed help but I left him. 15 minutes later he came in to my room more sober and sat down on my bed, he apologising saying ‚ÄúThis is my first relationship and I don‚Äôt know the full boundaries of a relationship yet‚Äù We worked everything out. When we woke up the next morning he said that ‚ÄúDrunk him is a different person and sober him does not take responsibility of drunk him‚Äù

"AITA For turning off the water on the tub when it was at the overflow valve? My wife has continuously left the water run in a bath until it's at the overflow valve and has twice caused leaks in the rooms below doing this at our old house (flooded) and my parents house (very small since I saw it early on the ceiling tiles). Tonight she's getting a bath (in the slightly oversized tub at our new house) while I'm brushing my teeth. I see the water is at the overflow and then she mostly submerges to rinse the soap out of her hair which raises the water higher, so I just go over and turn off the water. When she comes up she looks surprised and asks if I turned the water off. I say ""yes, it was at the overflow and you were underwater"" she immediately gets pissed and says ""I'm not a child, I know how to turn the water off"". I say ""I know, I just thought I was helping since it's at the overflow and you were underwater"". She's still mad. I don't get what I did wrong. It seems so dumb, so I had to ask Reddit. AITA?",0.06
"AITA: For Going To A Sporting Event Instead of My Cousins Wedding? I am a 24M who grew up 12+ hours away from my extended family in the southern United States. My family lives in a Midwestern town that is a long drive and long flight away from where I currently live.

My cousin who is a few years younger than me (21M) got married to another man a few weeks ago. I am decently close with my cousin who was getting married, but only because we are close in age. I would only hang out with him the one weekend a year I would spend with my family,but I wouldn't call it a ""close relationship"".

Due to the fact that it is an LGBTQ+ wedding, some members of the family skipped the celebration due to personal beliefs and biases. Personally, I am happy for him and support his decision as it is what he wants. I have reaffirmed my beliefs several times with him and the people in the family. Due to cultural divides and opinions about ""the south"" rumors began to surface among family members that a potential non-attendance by me was due to ""bias"" and ""homophobia"".

My extended family has not been at anything big for me like graduations, and I've always understood because the distance has always been far and the cost and commitment to a trip have always been substantial. I have never expected them to be here simply because of the challenge associated with making a cross-country trip.

As the wedding grew closer, gas and travel prices spiked substantially and it was clear it wasn't possible for me to go financially. To add to it, I work in an extremely competitive industry and only get a handful of days off a year, so it wasn't going to work to get the time off. After the decision was made, rumors swirled that it wasn't financial but ""selfishness"" that made me skip the ceremony. Over the past few years, I have also missed many straight weddings and other big family events due to distance.

Anyways, the wedding arrived, I wasn't there, and I decided to go to a sporting event in the city I live in (I can literally walk from where I live to the stadium) on the day of the wedding. I took my girlfriend, had a great time, and posted a photo of us at the game on social media. My family saw the photo and I was immediately ridiculed. ""how could you skip the wedding to go to a game?"" ""That was a selfish choice"" and other things were thrown my way. The message I sent him on the wedding day was left on read with no response, and many rude texts filled up my inbox. Accusations and assumptions that I skipped the wedding and instead opted to go to the game became common.

While I understand the frustrations with not making it happen, I literally went somewhere in my hometown and the tickets were 1/6th of what it would've cost to fly or drive to the wedding.

AITA for refusing to visit my In-Law until they put in some effort [deleted],0.05
"AITA for being upset at how often my brother visits our house? I am currently living at home with my parents. My brother has moved out, several years ago, but one of the major reasons is how abusive he's been toward me. I don't really want to go into long and agonising detail about it, so for the context needed, it was physical and verbal and sustained over many years, getting worse up until the point that he moved out. There have been isolated incidents of abuse since then, but his access to me is much more restricted, so it is less frequent. 

He is emotionally unstable, so my parents allow him to visit the house on a regular basis, as long as he doesn't leave the kitchen/living area at the front of the house, aside from using the bathroom. Having him in the house makes me incredibly anxious and fearful, but I try to understand that he is still their son, even if I no longer want to associate with him, and I am living in their house. 
This has been going on for maybe two years at this point, I'm beginning to notice a pattern where he will only come once or twice a weak and follow the rules, only for him to gradually get more and more confident breaking the rules and my parents will bring him over more and more with less and less warning. In the past this has resulted in me having emotional breaks where I express my fear and frustration, they will argue with me and eventually listen, and things will go back to the way they were. 

Recently this has been building up again, including my mum insisting that he's been coming over 3 days a week for ""years"" now, but when I wrack my brain, I just can't tell if this is true. I don't know if I'm just blowing things out of proportion, or if he really hasn't been coming over that oven, but I had a severe panic attack the day she said that which was prolonged by hearing him talking loudly in the other room. Since then, I've gotten more anxious and jumpy, being scared by my mum walking around behind me or my dad closing a door, and they're starting to get frustrated with me. They don't like when I ask if he can come over less, and they say that if I don't want to see him, I could leave the house, but he comes over at dinner time, so I feel like that's a little unreasonable. Am I wrong? He's their son too, so I understand that I have to be willing to make a few compromises while I'm living with them, but it feels like they're not respecting my feelings and trauma.

I asked them if we could have a piece of paper on the fridge where they could write down all the days he's coming over so I can feel a little more secure, but they haven't done it, even though they agreed to. They text me minutes before bringing him over, instead of the day or more warning I used to get. I feel like I'm going insane. They say nothing has changed and I just need to calm down, that I'm being sensitive and stubborn. Am I being unreasonable?",0.18
"AITA for making my brother spend his money So some background my brother is old enough to drive and has a job at really busy restaurant that pays well. I‚Äôm not old enough to drive but I have a electric bike. This happened like 1 hour ago.  

Story: I rode my electric bike up to this country club that my family goes to, this was because there was practice and I had to walk 18 holes with a bag in 100 degree heat (I was tired out from this cause it‚Äôs hard). I changed out and got into normal cloths to get back to my house which is 3 miles away, but I realized that it was dead cause I was running around in the morning (working out, getting food, getting groceries, getting a haircut, and doing chores). So I called my brother pick me up (he has a truck) he groans say he will do it and get there in like 15 minutes. When he gets there he complains that I could have rode it back (it‚Äôs like 30 pounds) and it‚Äôs 95% uphill it‚Äôs Colorado so if you know you know. Anyways he says if he keeps doing this I will have to pay 5 bucks to do it cause it‚Äôs draining his gas which is sort of fair but it is still bad to think about because I would rather ride my bike right? 

When I said I would rather ride. He said it was ‚Äútoo late‚Äù and I would have to pay up. Also fair but danm kinda cheap to not tell me on the call. I didn‚Äôt want to do that so I called my dad told him everything how my brother wants me to pay for a ride and is demanding payment. My dad sort it out but I feel bad now that he has to pay money. 

So Reddit AITA btw I think I‚Äôm sort of a jerk here so I‚Äôll give myself like 2/10 of being a asshole

I see why I‚Äôm the asshole I‚Äôll try to not ask for a ride unless I have no way home and I‚Äôll pay him the 5 bucks and time I need a ride",0.99
"AITA for playing video games with the guy who tried to get with my best friend‚Äôs gf? so i‚Äôve[18F] been friends with sean [M20] for like 12 years, we are super close and always play video games together and stuff like that. a few months ago, he started dating this girl kylie [F19]. they were happy together for a while but there were a couple bumps in the road. 

one of me and sean‚Äôs mutual friends, jorge [M20], who sean actually introduced me to, turned out to actually have feelings for kylie. he told kylie about his feelings, claiming he just wanted to get the stress off his shoulders and didn‚Äôt expect anything to change. i don‚Äôt know if kylie was planning to tell sean about this, but he ended up finding out when looking through her phone. honestly, i was upset with jorge because i thought this was really selfish of him, but i am a forgiving person so i still remained friends with him. i even convinced him to reach out to sean and apologize. after this, we all started to become friends again.

flash forward a month or so later, sean and kylie break up. jorge resumes talking to kylie barely a week after their breakup and they play video games together and start hanging out. sean was extremely hurt by his lack of following ‚Äúbro code‚Äù and dropped jorge once again. i talked to jorge about this and he claimed he no longer has feelings for kylie, but he was friends with her before sean and kylie even started dating, and he wanted to remain friends with both of them. 

i was not a fan of the way jorge handled things, but i still remain in contact with him occasionally. we are not as close as we used to be, but one night i played video games with him and sean saw. he was extremely upset that i was still friends with someone who hurt him and said i shouldn‚Äôt be friends with him nonetheless playing games with him.

"AITA for not listening to my Dad about my future career? My Dad (50m) with previous military history always gave me ‚Äútough love‚Äù as a child. He‚Äôs always tell me how spoilt I am and how his way of ‚Äútough love‚Äù would help me stand on own my 2 feet. But it didn‚Äôt. In 2021 at the age of 17 I was in a dark place, where I was prescribed meds to help me with my low moods and anxiety as mine and my Dad‚Äôs relationship worsened. 

I expressed ,as a child aged 13, that I wanted to join the military and he was over joyed by that, but the constant ‚Äúyou‚Äôll never make it if you live like that‚Äù for having a messy room or ‚Äúyou‚Äôll have a shock once you get in there‚Äù for having an attitude made me sway my career choice and move on to university instead, which he hates the idea of because apparently ‚Äúdegrees never get you anywhere in life‚Äù. I was lost, I wasn‚Äôt able to ever make him happy with my career choices, where he would compare me constantly to my older brother (20m) who worked for a manufacturing company of some sort and would say how he‚Äôs been a ‚Äúgrafter‚Äù all his life and never spoilt. 

Aged 18 (my current age) I joined University to study modern languages and hopefully progress into a translating career. My Dad‚Äôs first thought ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs never get you anywhere in life‚Äù. I dropped out after 4 months and now I‚Äôve applied to join the armed forces but not for him. I‚Äôm doing for me now. 

I do feel like an AH sometimes because all along he was right in the end. About Uni about how my life would turn out. I should‚Äôve listened to him from the start. Maybe mine and my Dad‚Äôs relationship may have been a lot better if I had just listened.",0.05
"AITA for taking a shower at 5 AM? I (21, F) live in Italy with my parents and go to university. It's rather normal here to live with your parents while studying and it's pretty common to *not* move out even if you have an hour or more of commute. I mean, some people do, but we don't have campuses so it could be an hassle. Not really relevant but just pointing out for context.

So I have *way* more than an hour commute. It takes me almost two hours to get to class, and this is not accounting for the fact that I can't just conjure trains up to my convenience as a live in another city, sometimes the right train I need to take would take off even 3 hrs before class. No big deal, as I have time to study, read or watch TV shows in the study rooms.

This semester I started mandatory internship Which is...hard, logistically and I didn't expect it. I plan on moving next year, but for now I can't. I need to be there before 8 AM, which mans I need to take a train at 5.45 Am, which means...I need to get ready at 5 am. By night I have class *and* a job as a waitress during weekdays, so I am home around midnight. Now, this doesn't happen every day, but now with the semester coming to a close it's pretty common. Sometimes I can't help but taking a shower in the morning. I know. It's rude, especially because I live in an apartment.

My neighbors threw a fit because my hair dryer wakes them up in the morning. I replied that it's hard for me to fit a shower by night because I am tired sometimes, and they replied, more or less literally ""skipping a shower sometimes won't kill you."" Also they threw a fuss two years back because my sister was watching tv loudly at 11 pm...which means they would probably be annoyed anyways if I took a shower when I am back. They brought it up with my parents too, calling my mom a b*itch for rising me without manners, and threatened to key my car lol

I don't know, it all feels so silly but they called a meeting for all the apartment in my complex to discuss the issue. I promised I'm going to move in September and anyway August won't be like this, but they say I need to be taught a lesson. So AITA? Am I really being unreasonable?",0.08
"AITA for getting angry that my friend wouldn't come to my last school concert for me? My (16M) final orchestra concert of the school year was a few weeks ago. I was super excited to be playing for this since I was now a first violinist and I was able to play in the pit section of the auditorium. I asked my friend (15M) to come to the concert and see me, but he said that he wasn't going and that he only went to see concerts if his twin brother was performing. I told him that was fine, and I understood that.

Fast foward to the night of the concert, I was getting ready to preform and I see...my friend's twin brother (15M). I forgot he was part of the younger orchestra. I asked him if his brother was in the audience and he said that he was. I nodded, said ok, then wished him luck, but I felt kinda heartbroken. Why had my friend said he wouldn't come when he clearly was coming? This was so distracting I was barely able to focus on my music.

I feel selfish for thinking this, but why didn't he come for me? Don't get me wrong, it's nice thar he came. But why didn't he say he'd come? AITA for getting angry at my friend for saying he wouldn't come to my concert, even though he clearly would?",0.75
"AITA for spraying sunscreen over on another man‚Äôs arms in front of my bf? I was given a ticket from my brother to go to a music festival. My brother is going with his friends and had bought one for his friends gf. She ended up not going so he offered me it. I decided to go but also bought a ticket for my bf to join me. So we decided to go with my brother and his friends. My bf and I got there first and my brother and his 3 male friends showed up later. Earlier that day my brother had asked me if i had brought sunscreen which I had said yes. I brought a small bottle of sunscreen spray. When we met up with my brother‚Äôs friends and hung out a little and then sat in a small circle on the grass, my bf and I was reapplying  sunscreen by me spraying my arms and my bf arms. I asked my brother if he would like sunscreen and he said no. It felt rude of me not to offer to his friends since I had asked my brother and his friends were watching me. So I offered his friends sunscreen and they said yes. I also didn‚Äôt want to hand my sunscreen over to them because I wanted to control the amount of spray since its an expensive small bottle and also I didn‚Äôt want them touching my bottle. So i sprayed my sunscreen over their arms as they showed me their arms and then they rubbed in their sunscreen themselves. My bf particularly didn‚Äôt like that one of them who is on the further side leaned in and stretched out his arms toward me and Since i was farthest from him I leaned a little to spray his arms. But nothing happened. No physical contact, friendly conversation or interaction, just spraying his arms like 5 pumps as i did for everyone. my brother then wanted sunscreen too since im already spraying everyone so i sprayed his arms too. My bf considered my behavior as an act of submission or flirty/leading this one guy since i leaned in since i sprayed their arms and didn‚Äôt give them the bottle to spray themselves. I gave him my reasoning and to him its still me being submissive/flirty/leading on towards that one guy and he doesn‚Äôt want a submissive woman to anyone but himself. I looked at just me being courteous of offering sunscreen but i don‚Äôt want them to touch it. If anything im being controlling of my stuff thats it not submission. He would then compare and say i wouldn‚Äôt like it if he offered girls to spray. But the honest truth there have been situations where he would offer help to women who wouldn‚Äôt ask for it but states he‚Äôs trying to be kind because he sees they need help. I would just brush it aside but if i happen to ask he would get upset that thats different and the fact that im bringing it up.

"AITA for not wanting to go to my cousins quince? I (18f) was recently involved in family drama. I am not used to being put on the spot or do I even like it but in this situation someone from my family exposed me to my parents with my lifestyle in college. I come from a very religious group of people and there is 0 tolerance for any ‚Äúsin‚Äù like matter. (Even though I stopped being religious years ago)

This family member has yet to reveal themselves because they used a burner number to send the pictures to my dad‚Äôs personal number which only family has (due to him having a 2nd phone for work). I have MAJOR suspicion to believe it was my aunt and another one of my cousins since they have been trying to get on my ass for months now.

They live in a different state and I‚Äôve been avoiding the past few months to go visit for this same reason.

"AITA for committing fraud? I (16) have a best friend (15, whom I'll call Sarah) who adore inconditionally. We've been attached at the hip since we met 6 years ago and I seriously doubt I'll ever find someone whom I feel as deep a friendship as I do with her. Despite that, people around me (my parents) are quite wary of Sarah, because of our polar opposite dinamic. I'm the typical timid, autistic, weird kid and she's really outspoken, has some temper and is constantly in trouble for defying authority, but generally gets along with everyone nicely. Because of that, my parents seem to think that she's manipulative, sneaky, a brat, etc, which isn't really the case, but I can understand that her sassiness can be unnecessary sometimes.

Now, the actual dilemma starts a few weeks ago. Finals season is coming around and we're both shitting ourselves because our grades aren't the best, though I have way less shit to do than her, and since I know she has a lot on her plate and I have some time to spare, I tell her to ask me for help if she ever needs anything. 

Days later, Sarah takes up on my offer, asking me if I had time to do a stupidly simple art project for her. I had no problem whatsoever with what she was asking and accepted, since it was also literally just coloring out printed sheets.

My mother finds out and goes absolutely insane, calling Sarah all sorts of names and warning me that she's taking advantage of me and that I have to set boundaries because if not, she'll keep using me for her benefit and when I prove myself useless she'll leave.

Fast forward a couple of hours and we're at my house, she stayed over for lunch and she's getting ready to go, but I remember that she still has the arts worksheet at her house & offered her to keep some paints that she bought for me to just do the project. She gives me a weird look and suddenly goes up to my mother and asks ""Hey, do you happen to have a problem with OP doing this project for me?"" and so, hell breaks loose.

They end up arguing pretty heavily. I chimed in whenever I could to remind my mother that it was my choice to help her, but it was no use. She insisted that I'm being tossed around and bent to my best friend's will. 

My mother kicks Sarah out and sends a text explaining the situation to her parents, and I apologized profusely for my mothers words, but Sarah wasn't buying it. Amongst everything said about the situation, the stuff that I want to highlight is that she says that: 

I don't do anything to change my mother's view of me and that I purposefully adapt myself to be the innocent kid.

By choosing me, she puts up with absurd critiques that have nothing to do with her all for the sake of our friendship.

That this falling out had been a long time coming and that it's not just my mother.
 
I told Sarah to take her time and that whatever she sees best for our friendship, I will respect, and that I'll wait for her, but she thinks I'm saying that to look good. After talking a bit more, she then blocked me.

"AITA for not caring that my mom stole money from my dad? My parents divorced when I was young and since then my parents have had quite the rocky relationship coparenting. Growing up I preferred my moms over my dads as I had a lot of family on that side that would visit and other kids I could play with. And to this day I still prefer my moms. 

Anyways since as an adult (I am in college but living at home over the summer) I still prefer my moms and see my dad less (also considerably less after I went LC but have been recently seeing him more to repair the relationship) he‚Äôs gotten quite bitter over it. And to mention that I still don‚Äôt like being at my dads because everything‚Äôs exactly the same before I went LC. 

But he recently told me that as I spend too much time with my moms side and they influence me too much he told me the real reason they divorced was because she stole money from him and he could‚Äôve pressed charges but didn‚Äôt want me to grow up without a mother but has started to regret that decision since I have been too influenced as he says. 

And honestly, I don‚Äôt really care. I have known for a while that both of my parents are deeply flawed in different ways and will always have issues that won‚Äôt be fixed. And because of the way I grew up I have a hard time understanding myself,  my feelings and go to therapy for it.

"AITA for telling my step-dad that it'll be his fault if my brother ends up dying? I (21M) have two younger brothers, Diego (20M) and Irvin (17M), Irvin is from my mom's second marriage to my step-dad, Diego and I are pretty involved in Irvin's life and we visit him whenever we can, right now, both Diego and I are attending college and we both live with our dad around 1 to 2 hours away from mom and Irvin, since we live with him, we usually spend summer and winter break with our mom (we only rate Christmas and New years eve). Our dad is an ex-military, he never stopped working out and when we were old enough, Diego and I began to have the same lifestyle as him, he later on became a nutritionist and recently got his masters in health.

My step-dad's side of the family is, for the most part, morbid obese, we don't judge and we've never made any bad comment towards them, but Diego and I were pretty concern for our brother because most of my step-dad's relatives has either died from heart failures, diabetes or things related to obesity, Irvin has never been a small guy, but he could still keep track with us on our morning run and small workouts we did at home, then we both left for college and he began to get from bad to worse; he had a hard time with long walks, didn't last during our runs, hard time breathing, had to stop when speaking, you get the drill.

The worse thing was that my step-dad never took it serious, he swear and swear that Irving is okay and it was just ''a boy being a boy'', how food was important, that he'll ''grow the weight out'' and things like that, at **17**, Irving weights 230 lb (almost the same as our step-dad, and he's **42**) and is on the verge of getting diabetes, and since he doesn't take it serious, Irvin doesn't do it too. This is not about appearance or anything like that, my brother comes from a family with a bunch of weight diseases and we only want him to be safe and healthy.

Diego and I decided to sit our mom and step-dad down and lay out all of this facts, we even asked our dad to give us some things to prove our arguments and we offered (*begged*, actually) to let us take Irvin to our dad so he can valuate him and made a diet and a work out set for him, for free. We will accompany him to the gym, we will teach him how to make his own food, we will take care of it. Mom was on board, but our step-dad called us ''bullies'' for ''calling our brother fat'', Diego tried to explain him calmly that it wasn't like that but I had enough and snapped, I got up and called him a horrible father for not taking this seriously and that if Irvin ends up dying, is his fault, he called us AH and kicked us out and said we are not allow to come back until we apologize.",0.47
"AITA: I paid more rent than my former roommate ‚Äî now she won‚Äôt give me back some of the money I feel I‚Äôm owed of the security deposit Around the time we moved into our apartment, I fell into a deep depression bc I lost some people very important to me. I was honestly pretty quiet and more socially anxious. Which means I didn‚Äôt hang out with my roommate as much, didn‚Äôt really bother me because 1) I was choosing not to hang out with anyone 2) I was more focused on myself admittedly 3) she was fully aware of what I was going through. I never thought we had a problem. 

A few months in our lease, she‚Äôs asking me if I can pay more in rent. I was already paying $200 more than her at this point. She said, I had more space. There was a third room in the apartment that initially we were supposed to share as an office space, but then she backed out a bit after we signed the lease. My concession on the office was to pay $200 more. I was annoyed but could afford the difference & didn‚Äôt wanna be hard on her bc this was her first time living without her parents & I felt kind of guilty for some reason. 

I tell her my absolute max price & I‚Äôll need time to save up for this. 2 weeks later she‚Äôs asking me was I able to pay X amount this month, and I say no, I‚Äôm still saving. Eventually I pay this difference for about half our lease before I tell her I really can‚Äôt afford it anymore and that we should stick to what we originally agreed to. I regret not getting it in writing that I should receive X amount rather than Y for my security deposit (Y= my original rent)

She holds a grudge after this even tho I‚Äôm still paying as much more than her as I possibly can. Annoying but I try to deal w it bc we both came to the mutual understanding that we would just be operating as roommates until the lease ends. 1 day, her bf comes to visit and he just leaves the place a mess. Trash all over the kitchen, 0 respect for our place. I call them out for this (over text) and suddenly her bf is at my bedroom door yelling at me and cussing at me and threatening to physically harm me and berating me. I tell her he needs to leave. She ignores my texts and doesn‚Äôt leave with him until the next night. I never ask *her* to leave, just bf. 

Then she completely moves out. I record her confessing to everything with her bf. 

Security deposit time. I ask my landlord to divide up the rent so I receive X back, my landlord acknowledges my payment of X. But eventually decides to send Y and says I should ask former roommate for the difference. Obviously, she says no. 

It upsets me that she refuses to pay back the difference of one month‚Äôs rent bc this is a lot of money for me. I do feel taken advantage of and I know better than to agree to something like this now. 

AITA for asking for this? All I have is a text from her confirming what I‚Äôd pay at the start of those higher rate months.

"AITA‚Ä¶ Holiday with friend turned weird Me, (f20), have gone on my first holiday without my parents to Nice, France with a close friend of mine (we‚Äôll her P) (also f20) and her friend from uni (we‚Äôll call her J) (f19). Both J and I are minorities, whereas P is a white - i‚Äôm only mentioning this as it‚Äôs been a hot topic of our holiday. Me and J have caught a tan, as expected, i‚Äôm mixed race and J is indian, whereas P has burnt. Me and J don‚Äôt really bring it up, but P has made it a topic of multiple conversations etc. 

P has always been an advocate for any social causes, especially racial, I feel like that‚Äôs why we‚Äôre such good friends - because she‚Äôs always empathised as best as she could with anything i‚Äôve experienced. 

Anyway, tonight has been the 4th night of our holiday and both J and P have been bickering the whole trip, kind of like siblings. I haven‚Äôt really said anything because it‚Äôs just their friendship dynamic but tonight P has really been at me as well. Anything that I said at dinner, she‚Äôs either been pessimistic or has disagree with me‚Ä¶ for example I made a joke about a guy I used to talk to when we played snog, marry, kill. All i said was I‚Äôd kill said guy because he was toxic and that was the only way I‚Äôd truly get rid of him, which she then replied by saying ‚Äúbut you won‚Äôt though, because you‚Äôre pathetic, so don‚Äôt act like you would.‚Äù I get that under the right context that would be funny, but she was taking a dig, like she was the whole night. 

I‚Äôm not really too fussed, i‚Äôm a big girl however J is younger than us, especially mentally & tonight P was being mean as fuck to her, to the point it was cringe. Like telling P was telling J to shut up every time she said something and calling her a bitch unprovoked. 

anyway when we were walking home and me and J were talking about a racial issue, trying to include P in the discussion, but instead she kept interrupting and tried talking about the order that she thinks the month should be ordered in‚Ä¶ (for even more context, P trauma dumped while we were at dinner and i just sat, listened and reassured her.) I can‚Äôt help but feel insulted.


On top of everything else, both J and P assured me that the trip I had nothing to worry about and the trip well organised - it has not been. I‚Äôve had to pay for our groceries, which hasn‚Äôt been the cheapest & both J and P have been unhygienically messy. I‚Äôm not sure if tonight has been the icing on the cake or if i‚Äôm just looking for something to complain about.  I‚Äôm a bit of a people pleaser so I haven‚Äôt said anything up until this point. 

I don‚Äôt know if i‚Äôm being an overdramatic asshole, that just needs to enjoy the trip or if I should say something (not asking for advice btw, just unsure of my current perspective). I don‚Äôt want to ruin a trip by ‚Äúmaking a mountain out of a mole hill‚Äù or causing an issue where there isn‚Äôt one. I‚Äôm really scared i‚Äôm being dramatic but at the same time I‚Äôm not sure if I want to be friends with P after this trip because of how she‚Äôs acted.",0.67
"AITA for making a girl cry on her birthday? There is this one girl that keeps insulting me (calling me fat, ugly, saying I have an ass haircut, calling me dumb, etc) under the excuse of ""your friends do it so why can't I?"" It got to a point where it pissed me off so much where I called her a twig and went off at her. This situation died down for a bit until she found out about what i told my friends and started going off at me for ""making her look like a bad person"" and how I was spreading B.S. Instinctually, I retaliated telling her that she shouldn't have messed with the wrong person, to realize how the world doesn't revolve around her, and insulting her back until she got mad and stopped. This was the week of her birthday, and she got her friend to reach out to me who started threatening me, insulting me, and said she cried at her birthday party because of how hard I insulted her. (I did make fun of her body and her looks.) Her other friends teamed up on me asking why I said what I said, not listening to my side of the story and spreading the sugarcoated version to all of my friends to get them to turn on me. My friends that went to her party did say she cried, but they also said she spread some of my personal business to everybody there, which just crossed the line. After this, I went off at her again and she blocked me saying that she didn't want to talk to an asshole. AITA?",0.83
"AITA for being upset at my vegetarian friend for spoiling the night over food? Quick background info, one of my girl friends is leaving us for a long while and we all wanted to drink together before we see her off. My guy friend was raised a vegetarian. Granted I sometimes don‚Äôt understand how to live with dietary restrictions, but I do understand health problems and restrictions, religious convictions and moral convictions. My guy friend doesn‚Äôt base his vegetarianism on any of that, and has told me that he simply hasn‚Äôt ever craved meat and is generally indifferent, like a ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt miss what you don‚Äôt have‚Äù kind of sentiment.

What happened now: 3 of us are hanging out when we all get hungry, so we look around for a place to eat. We live in a place where restaurants and kitchens close late, and it was already 22h00 on a tuesday, so we were on a time crunch. A half hour later we find a place that sells pre made pizza right next to a bar, so we go only to find out the vegetarian options are all sold out. We were disappointed, but my girl friend and I were indifferent on ordering so we can stick around and drink nearby while there was still time, and if we really wanted to we could just go home to eat.

Well our guy friend was adamant about eating out somewhere. The best we can find for him is a cheese pizza with chunks of sausage sprinkled on top that‚Äôs easy to remove without ripping any cheese off the pizza. We suggested that, but he was even more adamant about not picking out the sausage chunks, all while emphasizing if he doesn‚Äôt eat now he won‚Äôt eat for the rest of the night. We try looking for other places and thinking of solutions, like going home and making of fetching food for him and hanging out there, but we couldn‚Äôt come to a consensus, all while he‚Äôs on about how the night‚Äôs going to end if we go home and stuff. This goes on for about an hour.

It‚Äôs almost 23h, My girl friend and I are both a bit distraught and tried finding another place, only to see the nearest one was thirty minutes away that closes at midnight and the last metro runs at 00h20. She really wanted to stay and drink before she had to leave, and I just wanted to hang out, drink. We insist on the dude to pick out the meat, knowing his indifference to meat, but he does not budge and insists we head to the place 30 minutes away. My friend was really bothered by this and stressed about getting home, and the whole situation bummed me out. 

In the end we all went to the food place and grabbed take out before it closed, and by then spirits were dampened, and pubs were closing. With full stomachs my friends wanted to finally find a place to hang out in even though the last metro was soon, but I was so annoyed at the guy that I just wanted to go home, and despite the begging my girl friend did and the teasing my guy friend gave me, I went home in a pout. I feel bad for my girl friend who is sad to go and wanted a night out before her flight tomorrow, I felt really annoyed at my guy friend for making a big deal out of the food options and spoiling our mood, but i felt really bothered by my annoyance with him and having ended the night because of it. After all, he is vegetarian, and I‚Äôd respect that in any other circumstance.",0.91
"AITA for telling an unhoused man I‚Äôm not homeless and he needs to get out of my face, mind his own business or I‚Äôm calling the cops. I work and live on a (public) college campus. I am currently sick with the flu so my head is a little spacey. Therefore, I took my dog out to relive himself and he pooped. I realised I had forgot a bag and had every intention of going up to my apartment (I was literally right outside of it) getting a bag and picking it up. Don‚Äôt worry, I did in fact do that before I wrote this. 

Anyways, as I realised I forgot the bag I turned around to see a unhoused man Don‚Äôt worry, I didn‚Äôt just assume he was unhoused he told me. His words were, ‚Äúhomeless people like you who do that disgusting shit (pointing to my dogs poop) make other homeless people look bad. 

I was kind of spooked especially because he was so close. I backed off a little and said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not fucking homeless. I‚Äôm going to pick it up but you need to mind your business and back the fuck up before I call the cops‚Äù

He replied ‚Äúthis is a public university. I have every right to be here, jackass.‚Äù

I said ‚Äúand you are causing a disturbance so I have every right to call the police.‚Äù 

I don‚Äôt know if that spooked him or he just was done with the situation because he just walked off.

Edit: sorry I thought I mentioned he was literally in my face yelling at me. (Flu Brain) 

Also I would like to add. This is literally is a disturbance as we learned in training. I wanted to give him a chance to back off before calling the police.

Edit: also since it keeps getting a asked, this man was clearly not a student. He was older and looked severely disheveled. Also, my residence hall doesn‚Äôt currently have any students staying in it.

Edit: also since people keep questing my training, whole homeless people are allowed to be on our campus since we are public, in most cases them engaging with students, staff etc usually counts as a disturbance since there have been frequent instances of homeless people harassing people and pandering.",0.95

AITA for being sceptical about essential oils with my mum? This isn't really that big of a deal it's not like my mum hates me for this or anything but just wanted to know if you guys think I'm an asshole. My mum is into all those essential oils which I believe are bullshit as there's not really any scientific proof they work so I think they're just a placebo kind of thing for the people who use them. So whenever my mum offers me some or tells me it'll make me feel better with whatevers going on I tell her I think it's bullshit and that it actually does nothing especially for someone like me who doesn't believe they work. I know she's just trying to help me out and make me feel better but sometimes especially if I'm already in a bad mood I can't help but call out that I think it's bullshit and that it's foolish of her to spend so much money on them.

"AITA for insisting my tenant clean up after herself upon move out to get her deposit back? I, F28, having been renting rooms in the home I purchased in 2020 since I moved in. My first two tenants were great but have moved on to other living situations in a natural manner/left on good terms. My boyfriend moved in and shortly after we got a new roommate. My most recent tenant/roommate was great to start off with, but quickly turned hostile and one day just snapped and said my boyfriend and I were bad roommates because we took over the downstairs space and she felt like she couldn‚Äôt ever just have time to herself. We were confused because we‚Äôve asked her to play board games with us, watch movies or shows with us, and have also offered the tv to her when she gets home from work. She says, because we wfh all day, she should have the right to her own time to rewind. She basically implied that we get to relax at home all day even though this is not the case - at home, I am in my office all day working and I am also in graduate school and take night courses so several days a week I‚Äôm also not even home but at campus  in class for the entire evening. We shrugged this off and told her she had never brought it up before so how could we have known? And told her it was unfair for her to broach the subject in such an abrasive way without ever having given us the chance to make some compromise where everyone could feel like they were getting what they needed. She decided she was going to move out. 

Fast forward to move out day I had given her a months notice for my expectations for cleaning up before turning in her key. We have a chore chart for weekly and monthly chores and before she moved in I explained in great detail that I had high expectations around cleaning and that if it was going to be an issue for her that it would probably not be a good fit. On move out day she brought 8 family members over to harass, intimidate, and threaten me and my boyfriend after I told her that she needed to clean properly before I could return her deposit because her bathroom was disgusting. They backed me into a corner and sat me down and forced me to pay her back her deposit without even doing a full walk through and refused to leave my property. When they left I immediately called the police and filed a report for harassment. 

Me and my boyfriend were never anything but kind and giving and communicative to her so we are trying to understand where we went wrong and why she was so hostile throughout this situation. Also why did she bring her family over?

"AITA For Calling My Best Friend A Mormon? Ok, so, I'm sure this sounds a bit strange at first, but I just gotta know. So a little context, I (26M) and my best friend (25M) have joked around about different religions for years. We keep it to ourselves and make sure that we dont reign in people who are uncomfortable with it. We think some pretty offensive things can be funny when joked with eachother. But I was aware that my best friends family was infact Mormon.

&#x200B;

Ok. This takes place in a discord call with me (David), my best friend (William), my other friend (Olivia), and her boyfriend (Billy). Me and were doing our usual joking around, I was talking about having to stay at a hotel due to my airconditioning going down for a few weeks. And William started to start up our long running joke again. He called me a ""Bible Thumping Christian"". I laughed of course and we went on with our joking insults. Olivia decided to join in, and Billy was just playing Smash Bro's or something. I happened to mention that William was a ""Mormon"" and William assumed that I was continuing the joke. He left the call in anger, and I just didn't know what to do. So me and Olivia continued our joke.

&#x200B;

I later left, and noticed I got a notification from William. He was telling me that he was uncomfortable with me calling him a mormon in a joking manner. I thought he was being a little sensitive, so I called him out on it. He ended up freaking out on me, leaving the group chat, and blocking me everywhere. I don't know if he still has my reddit though.

AITA for wanting to report my neighbors for child endangerment So I(f20) noticed that since school has let out the neighbors kids down the street have been playing in the streets unsupervised. I'm talking kids probably 10 at the oldest. And there's about 4 kids and a puppy just running around and there doesn't seem to be anyone home. There's no vehicles in the driveway at least and one day when I went to return their puppy because the puppy ran up to me and no one was out side watching it. a little boy opened the door and took the puppy. Probably like 4/5 years old. I feel like kids shouldn't opening doors to strangers. Especially not one of the youngest ones. I've talked to my direct neighbor and she says that she's tempted to call too cause the little girl like to cross the road without looking. We live off a really busy road that connects to the highway and I've seen the kids chase the ball pretty close to that busy main road and I'm worried about them but I don't know what to do in this situation so would I be the asshole for reporting them? If yes then what should I do,0.15
"AITA for giving my daughter a nicer car than her brother? I feel a little silly coming to reddit for this but i‚Äôd really enjoy your feedback. We recently celebrated my daughters 17th birthday and graduation, my husband and I decided since she graduated top of her class we should do something big for her birthday. So we got her dream car which was not cheap I won‚Äôt lie. She was very happy but her brother wasn‚Äôt so happy about it. 

Although I love my son (22) very much I won‚Äôt deny the fact that he has had many issues in the past. He is sober now but during his high school years he was an addict. He did bad in school and didn‚Äôt get the achievements like his sister did. With all that being said he obviously didn‚Äôt get his dream car. We did get him a nice 2011 Toyota Corolla though which at the time he very much appreciated. 

My sister sent me a tik tok of him the other day and it was basically him complaining I favored his sister more because she got the nice car and he didn‚Äôt. Now i‚Äôm normally not one to try to invalidate my children‚Äôs feelings but this felt off to me. He is well aware how different his sister and his high schools years were. I called him earlier explaining I didn‚Äôt do this out of favoritism but that I just couldn‚Äôt trust him with an expensive car at that time. He was still upset with me, he said no matter what your child does you shouldn‚Äôt give one sibling more than the other. 

Honestly I don‚Äôt know how to feel. My husband is on my side and he thinks our son is being childish about the situation. I agree but at the same time I do see how it could be hurtful. My daughter has worked so hard in life and so has my son but how many parents would give their child who has major addict issues a brand new expensive car? I don‚Äôt want him to feel like his sister is more favored but it‚Äôs not like I gave her the nice car all because she was my child.",0.13

"AITA for causing my sister to lock herself out of a hotel room? When this happened, I was 16F and my sister was 14F. At the time she did have undiagnosed ADHD. Every time this story gets brought up I get so mad because to this day my family insists I was in the wrong.

We were on a family vacation and stayed in a hotel on the way to our destination. The next morning we packed up to leave and continue the drive. Different family members were eating at the hotel breakfast bar at different times and it was not a very coordinated exit. My sister and I were the last to leave the room. My family had 2 hotel key cards for the room and they were both in the room at this point while my parents were putting their suitcases in the car.

I grabbed the last of my stuff, including one thing my mom had told me to carry, and told my sister that everything left in the room was hers to bring out to the car. This included another bag my parents had told her to carry. I didn‚Äôt take a key card with me because I wasn‚Äôt going back to the room. My sister met us at the car a few minutes later, minus the extra bag she was supposed to grab. When we told her to go get it, she said she left both key cards in the room. Somehow, she managed to convince my family that it was my fault that she let a bag get locked in the room because I should have known better than to not take a key card with me. It was a running joke that she was very forgetful and often did things halfway, now we know it was the ADHD. The more I tried to defend myself and say she was responsible for her own mistake of forgetting the bag, the more my family yelled at me. I ended up crying in the car and felt extremely bitter and angry.  The only reason I might have been TA is that I was her older sister and I probably should have realized there was a nonzero chance she would forget something. We were able to get someone to let us back in the room so all was well but I still got torn apart in the car for defending myself.",0.05
"AITA: Abusive ex wants dead grandmas stuffed animal back, refused to trade me for my game system, believes she should get to keep both. This is really messy so I‚Äôm going to sum it up. Me F(21) her F(20) I told her that I was moving soon and to come get her stuff. So I put what I thought was all of it in a closet. I asked her to bring my video game console that I bought while we were together and after playing mind games with me she said she would. 
When she came she did not have my game, she left half the closet full with things she did not want and left a dog bed on my front porch as trash. After a couple of days I asked my sister, as she was on better terms with my ex, to ask about my game and she said she wanted her dead grandmas stuffed animal. 
Apparently, it was in my other closet. I told her that I wanted my game console back if she wanted her stuffed animal back. She got angry and said that it was wrong of me to keep it because it is sentimental to her and that I should‚Äôve just asked for it when she came and then confessed that she let a friend borrow it, so she never had it in the first place. 
  She then had the audacity to tell me it‚Äôs not about the stuff it‚Äôs about the principle. She said that she thinks I kept the stuffed animal on purpose and that because I left her and kept the apartment, I owe her everything back and more. 
So am I the asshole for keeping her stuffed animal until I get my game back?

"AITA for telling my sister I don't want to hear about her experiences with boys? First of all, I love my sister. I really do. But she really needs to be quiet when it comes to run ins with boys. I've been struggling for a while now with insecurities about how I think something must be wrong with me because no guys seem to take interest in me at all. I've been trying to push through, but its really hard. Every time she talks about it, I respond in a monotone voice so the message may get across that I'm not interested, but she just. Keeps. Coming. Back. Its really poorly impacting my self esteem because she always talks about how guys at our school are following her around and she finds it strange. She seems genuinely oblivious to the fact that they're interested in her and that makes me a little upset because I would kill to have at least one guy show interest in me. Just today, like literally 20 mins ago, she told me this kid we saw earlier while competing against each other saw her later during lunch and he approached her and they talked for a little bit, he said he hopes they run into each other again. They were flirting, but my sister doesn't see that. She's telling me while I'm trying to hold back tears. I thought he was cute too. 

She asked me one night why I seemed so uninterested in her stories, and I told her it was because it was mentally painful to listen to, knowing that nobody found me that beautiful. She said it was unfair that she had to listen to me when I talk about guys I think are cute at school, but I didn't want to listen to her talk about guys flirting with her and following her around. I said there was a clear difference here in the situations. I even said it was negatively effecting my self perception, but she said there was no way and she keeps telling me about the events. 

I understand that I'm her sister, and I'm supposed to be supportive, but how am I supposed to be happy for her all the time when we're in the same school and grade? Yeah, I forgot to mention. We're twins. Which really makes it 2x worse, since I have to see her everyday and people are constantly comparing me to her. I also have to see her getting flirted with in class which really really sucks. So now, she's saying I'm selfish. Idk what to do. I feel like ITA, because I understand what she means when she says she wants someone to listen to something she finds amusing or strange, but i told her it hurts me to hear, and she still doesn't understand and is calling me selfish.

"AITA for not wanting to buy my mom a $900 speaker for her birthday? My mom wanted to have this $900 speaker for 5 years. The thing is that me and my three siblings are working but we don't make much money. We wanted to buy a $700 speaker instead. She was absolutely against that idea. I want to make clear that this is an enormous amount of money where I live. And the difference between them is not much. She would still get what she wanted.

My mom offered that we should pay only $700 and she would pay the rest. Since it's a present for her, we didn't want her to put any money.

She got mad at us for this, saying that we buy wherever we want for ourselves.
This is not true. We spend almost all of our money contributing to the house. We are all in our twenties and we don't own a house. We want to save up money to hopefully one day live on our own. I should add the economic situation in my country is the worst.

EDIT: I am aware satellites are put into space using rockets. I know humans do not wear jet packs and put satellites into space or whatever other theory you had‚Ä¶. That seems like a given considering humans would probably explode. I assume we need humans to perform maintenance on satellites, right? A human would have needed to go to space at some point for us to know where to put a satellite, how to get it and/or keep it there, etc‚Ä¶. I‚Äôm not an astronaut, but I‚Äôm pretty damn sure helium balloons don‚Äôt carry satellites into space.

Edit #2: He thinks the NASA videos of people in space could all be fake because we can see stars from earth, but we never see stars in the NASA videos when looking at earth or through the windows in their videos, even when people wearing white aren‚Äôt in the frame.

"AITA for not paying my friend for my plane ticket when he‚Äôs the one who refuses to go. My friend and I planned to go abroad for a couple of days. I asked him to get plane and hotel tickets and that I would transfer him my share of money. There was an issue with a hotel room because I preferred to get a separate room from him (I‚Äôm female and he is is male). 

He persuaded me to book one room to save money. He asked me to think about it ultimately letting me know that it‚Äôs my decision either way. 

I said yes at first but I knew I would be really uncomfortable to stay in the same room with him (history of him confessing his feelings in the past) so I changed my mind next day and asked him to book two separate rooms.

His reaction was that he‚Äôs not going anymore and that I should find someone else to go with. 

Now, the problem is that he already purchased the plane tickets. 

Am I The Asshole for not paying him my share of the plane ticket because I have no one else to go with and because he‚Äôs the one who backed down?",0.47
"AITA for asking my mom to have my dad leave so I can work alone? Hi, I'm a 15 male that lives with my mom (43) and my dad (turning 51). Me and my dad don't have the best relationship. While growing up we got more and more estranged and it's really taken a toll on me. For instance, we would sometimes have a small argument which would turn into a shouting match, or him just getting angry for little reason (such as leaving a light on). Another thing is I have ADHD/aspergers syndrome which also plays in effect to this story.  Now onto the story.

Earlier me and my mom went out to get new mower blades because my brother suggested it since our mower wasn't cutting the grass right. We got the blades and everything went smooth. 

Now I personally prefer working alone, I like to be alone with working on things because I also get frustrated easily. I got the mower deck off and everything and when I went to get the blades off, none of my sockets fit on the bolts. I asked my dad if we could go out and get more, which we did. But after we got them he started fiddling around with them, which isn't the issue here, not at all, it's just that when I went to get a screwdriver I asked my mom if he could ask dad if I could work on my own, since it's easier for me to do so.

 My mom asked me why and I told her it's because I work better alone, and I get more frustrated with my dad than anyone else, due to our estranged relationship and the fact that we would end up arguing. She asked ""what if I needed help"" to which I replied with ""then I'll come get you"". Then she said ""why can't you just work with him"" and I responded ""because I don't work well with others and I want to do this alone"".

 So we go out to the garage where he's standing, waiting, and she calls him inside to where I started working. I can't get the mower blades off without the use of power tools, so I headed inside and closed up the garage. When I got back inside however, he was sitting on the couch looking rather sad and he didn't say anything to me, and now I'm feeling like the AH. 

So AITA in this or am I justified?

Update: earlier today my grandpa (dads stepdad) brought over his impact wrench and we changed the blades together while my dad was out. As I also had originally thought, the blades weren't the issue, plus it'd have been easier to just sharpen the old ones without getting new ones. The issue was the mower decks alignment, so on Monday (tomorrow is Father's day) I'll ask him if he wants to help me realign the mower deck together.",0.2

"AITA for joking that a girl is making people attracted to her because she is doing witchcraft ? There‚Äôs a relatively new addition to our friend group, who in the span of six months has made everybody in the group (except a married friend and me) have a crush on her or some type of infatuation, I‚Äôll refer to her as S. I would get this if she was some sort of supermodel, but she is very plain looking if not a bit on the odd looking side, like a discounted version of the singer Lorde if you know who that is. Granted she is very funny and holds conversation well, and her upper body is nice looking, but I‚Äôm talking about even a guy friend of mine who is incredibly superficial and has rejected girls over chipped nails having a crush on her, and even my best friend who is a straight woman who has never had any interest in women suddenly gushing about her and wondering if she should ask her out. 

And just to clarify, no I am not jealous I am just stupefied. I have 0 attraction to any of the friends mentioned and I am not jealous she is getting their romantic attraction as I do not want it, I am just in disbelief. 

Well yesterday we were having drinks and talking when the conversation turned to nationality stereotypes: like being expected to watch manga when you are japanese, to like cheese and wine because you are french... and S said that a popular stereotype about women from her country is that they do witchcraft to make people fall in love or to succeed. I laughed and said ¬´¬†oh that explains why you have so many admirers¬†and why people are attracted to you you witch¬ª and that was it, the mood wasn‚Äôt weird and nothing was said as the conversation continued.

After we were done and I was leaving a friend approached me and said I was rude, then two texted and told me what I said was not funny and I need to apologize. I don‚Äôt think I said anything offensive, I don‚Äôt even believe in witchcraft even though it would be a pretty good explanation. I think my friends are a bit biased because of their varying levels of infatuation, which makes them see this as some great transgression instead of just joke when we were laughing. So am I the asshole for making a very obvious silly remark ?",0.99
"AITA for saying ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not her fault she‚Äôs beautiful‚Äù about the woman my friend‚Äôs fianc√© tried to leave her for? I have 3 childhood friends and we were all super close even in adulthood until Emily‚Äôs fianc√© broke up with her because he though he and Alice were in love. Alice was horrified and said she didn‚Äôt have feelings for him and she was only being nice to him because of Emily but it still destroyed the friendship between Emily and Alice. 

Emily completely refused to be around Alice, and while she claimed not to care if me and Julia continued being friends with Alice, it caused a strain on all of our relationships.

Now I‚Äôm getting married and both Emily and Alice agreed they could be civil around each other as I wanted both of them in my wedding party. We all went bridesmaids dress shopping and Alice, who is naturally very beautiful, looked great in everything. Emily didn‚Äôt like anything and kept making passive aggressive remarks about Alice and how I should be careful having her around my fianc√©.

Her fianc√© left her 3 years ago and I know it‚Äôs completely destroyed Emily‚Äôs confidence so I usually try to be sympathetic but I could see her words were getting to Alice. I finally had enough and I snapped at Emily that it wasn‚Äôt Alice‚Äôs fault she was beautiful. She said whatever but I could see my words had hurt her and she looked teary eyed. She ended up leaving early and Julia told me she‚Äôs considering not coming to the wedding because of what I said and how I said it.

"AITA for pushing my mom away. Am I the asshole for not wanting to talking to my mom? I (m21) have been away from family and friends for nearly 3 years. I visit them about once a year for the holidays because it's easier to apply for the PTO. My mom likes to communicate with me almost on a daily basis via text, wheather it is something she saw that day or something. She wants to call me every Sunday to talk about the week but I can only go so far into detail about my job for security reasons. Sometimes honestly I have nothing to talk about because nothing interesting happened. I have let calls ring out for several reasons. I also post less then I want to all because I don't want my mom to comment or text me about it.

1.) I am playing video games with my friends back home. 2.) Quite often she has called while I'm on the phone with my dad that I haven't called in a month or 2. (Side note: they are divorced almost 20 years.) 3.) I'm on the phone or with a woman that I with. 4.) I've honestly let the phone ring because I do not want to talk to her. 

I have gone days where I don't reply to her texts or even look at the links she sends me. There have been times she shared me links to extremely skeptical conspiracies like Chem trails and 5G brain melting tech. I love my mom with all my heart. I wish she was the person she is now when I was growing up. My brother can definitely vouch for me. 

I have tried to tell her that the quantity of the calls doesn't matter to me. It's the quality. I've also told her to message me if I'm available to call so I'm not being interrupted while in a game or in the middle of a video with a woman. That hasn't changed. I've reminded her to ask if I'm able to talk and then 2 days later she calls me while I'm watching yt. No warning. 

I'm just trying to live my life but it's really inconvenient to hault a conversation because my mom is calling. Holy shit she asks a lot of questions about the smallest things. I think that's what is the kicker. She asks so many fucking questions that I don't know but she keeps asking. It's even worse since I'm currently overseas and she wants all the pictures in the world and knowledge. In all honesty with my position any info I was given can be found on the internet. It can be confusing. I just feel like I've been smothered for almost 3 years because I moved away, and this is her way of still to be mom when she doesn't need to dress me anymore. Also, for some readers can you guess who i work for? So am I the asshole for pushing my mom away for just trying to talk to me.",0.14

"AITA For not wanting to clean up at the same moment my boyfriend was? My boyfriend is 20(M) and I‚Äôm 22(F). For background context he does have anger issues and he‚Äôs called me lazy multiple times before. So basically I do everything around the house. I‚Äôm talking scrubbing walls, floors, tubs, you name it. Is it every single day? No. Do it do it when it needs to be done? Yes? I also never let it get bad. I‚Äôve stayed up until midnight to cook him meals that I really don‚Äôt want to cook. Always give him what he wants basically. Mind you I cleaned the entire kitchen and cooked him 3 meals yesterday.


 So today he decides to have a little attitude. Great. I‚Äôll give him his space. That‚Äôs what I usually do because there‚Äôs no point in talking to him. He always ends up yelling at me and putting me down. Anyways the house isn‚Äôt even messy but of course there‚Äôs some dishes in the sink. He leaves and comes back and I‚Äôm still in the bed. He left for about 20 minutes. I hear him turn the faucet on and get to work. I‚Äôm in the room minding my business on my phone. He comes in the room once he‚Äôs done and I glance at him and can tell he‚Äôs upset. Ok. So I ask him what‚Äôs wrong. Why isn‚Äôt he talking to me. And he says 

‚ÄúNothing. Nothing at all bro.‚Äù 

And I knew in that moment I must‚Äôve did something wrong. He gets in the shower, comes out, and  blazes up a blunt. He asks me if I want to hit it of course I say yes. He lays down in the bed and takes a nap and wakes up when I get up to make a snack. I can hear him fumbling around in the room from the living room and he comes out dressed. I ask him where he‚Äôs headed and he says


‚ÄúTo the store to get the shit I want to eat.‚Äù 

I don‚Äôt understand why he talks to me this why all I do is treat him with respect. He leaves and I call him ten minutes later to check if he made it. Long story short he tells me he got mad because I didn‚Äôt clean at the same time as him. Or ‚Äúhelp him out‚Äù while he‚Äôs cleaning up. Like he wants me to get up and sweep and do that extra shit just because he made the choice to clean up the dishes I could‚Äôve easily done myself.


Please guys please tell me if I‚Äôm trippin or not. I‚Äôve never had a problem with him chilling while I clean. Never once even brought it up that‚Äôs not something that crosses my mind. Where does logic like that come from. We kind of get into it over text and he texts me yea well I just live my life different I‚Äôm not about to sit around and waste my time when there‚Äôs so much to do.

"WIBTA for not telling my parents the cause of my brothers seizure? Sorry for the long title and it sound bad but hear me out.

I (19f) have a 16 brother, about a month ago he had a seizure at school in the hallway. The seizure lasted about 2 min and the friend he was with called his mom, who‚Äôs a nurse. 

My brother is fine now, but they couldn‚Äôt find anything immediate that caused the seizure (this is the first one that we know of). He set to go to a neurologist at the end of the month, during the wait he hasn‚Äôt been allowed to drive, work long hours, or really go out with his friends since we don‚Äôt know the cause. 

About 3 days ago, he told me he had drank four highly caffeinated beverages in a row around the time of his seizure. He told me that half of these drinks can keep him going for about 8 hrs, and he chugged 4 of them. Too much caffeine can cause seizures according to google.

I don‚Äôt know whether to tell my parents or not due to other issues we‚Äôve had at home, but I feel like that could have been the cause.

"AITA for pointing out an acquaintance's grandfather was not a ""war hero""? Throwaway because of how specific the situation is.

I'm a 34M. An acquaintance of mine (a friend of friends; 38?M) is part Italian. His grandfather moved to the US in the late forties, remarried to an American woman who is acquaintance's grandmother, and lived to a pretty old age as far as I understand it. He's my acquaintance's absolute hero. I see this acquaintance quite often through my friends and he often talks about how his grandfather was a war veteran because of his service in the Italian Army during WWII. At first I was like whatever, but lately I've come to know him as a pretty liberal guy. As such, it struck me as odd that he was so proud of his grandfather, given that he had served in the fascist Italian Army under Mussolini before WWII even started (so way before Italy switched allegiance - according to the acquaintance himself).
One night, the acquaintance referred to his grandfather as a war hero. Not a veteran, a war hero. Kind of drawing the line at dubbing the axis powers ""war heroes"", I said, ""Well, I don't know about hero"". He asked what that was supposed to mean. I said, ""Well... I get he's your grandfather, but just don't feel comfortable with you glorifying Mussolini's fascist army like that."" He got upset and said his grandfather wasn't a fascist. I crawled back, saying, ""I'm sure he didn't really have a choice. But he did fight alongside the Nazis, that's just a fact."" He kinda fell silent after this, so one of my friends backed me up.
Turns out, HE DIDN'T KNOW WHOSE SIDE ITALY WAS ON DURING THE WAR. He thought it was just Germany and Japan and therefore just assumed Italy was an allied power. Idk why honestly. I learned this in school, and I'm not of Italian descent. I just assumed he knew. So now I had inadvertently wrecked his whole image of his grandfather. He started denying it at first, saying it couldn't possibly be true. I admittedly rather superfluously tried to drive my point home be saying, ""that's probably why he moved to the US after the war."" Looking back, I think that was a bit uncalled for because I have no idea if it's true and he was clearly just processing this revelation. So that's where I'd say I definitely was the asshole. However, I heard from my friend the other day that the acquaintance has been pissed at me for the entire month since this happened, and blames me for ruining his view of his grandfather. I didn't mean to, but I also don't think I was in the wrong. AITA?",0.38

"AITA (or was my mom TA) for asking my dad to come help with a flat tire? It would take too long to explain the entirety of the situation, so for context, my parents divorced about 3 years ago. My dad (47M) acted very abusive toward my mom before and me after the divorce, and let his girlfriend‚Äôs dogs live at his house when she visited despite my allergy to dogs. After trauma, allergy-filled stays, and a few rounds of failed family therapy, I don‚Äôt stay at his house and our relationship is strained and kept to a surface level. My younger brother still goes 50/50 with both my parents. 

Today, my mom, 50F, took me, 16F, to a dead end road to practice driving (I‚Äôm going to end up getting my license a year late at 17 by American standards, but it‚Äôs by choice). Like an idiot, I accidentally took a curb and flattened our front passenger tire *really* badly. My mom called roadside assistance and it would have been $95 out of pocket, which she doesn‚Äôt really have at the moment. Her hours have been cut at her job, our rent went up a couple months ago, and things haven‚Äôt been the easiest. So, she called my dad. Keep in mind, my dad is a cop and drives an unmarked car from work, meaning he can‚Äôt take me to practice driving. Furthermore, my mom is responsible for pretty much everything else for me as well because I stay with her 100% of the time. The only thing my dad does is take me to medical appointments because I‚Äôm on his insurance. 

When my dad got to us, he said that he, ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt be this person for my mom anymore‚Äù as he was changing the tire. He elaborated and said this was causing problems with his girlfriend. He basically implied that my mom shouldn‚Äôt have called him. My mom was really confused and upset that he said that, because she called for me, not for her. She made it clear that if she had been by herself stranded on the side of the road and I wasn‚Äôt with her, she wouldn‚Äôt have called him. If we had been further away from his house she wouldn‚Äôt have called either (he didn‚Äôt have to drive more than 10-15 minutes). My mom knows how to change a tire, but the jack was stuck in a really weird spot since it‚Äôs still a fairly new car. She tried, but she just couldn‚Äôt get it out. The bottom line is, she called because both of us were stranded, and I was the one who had been driving and flattened the tire. My mom was flabbergasted and upset because of how nasty he acted, and she knows that if I had been driving by myself or with my friends and gotten a flat, he would have come to help me. But it just got her wondering if she was in the wrong and I don‚Äôt think she is, but I‚Äôm biased. She only asks him for help with things that relate to us, but did this cross that line? We need some insight because my poor mom thinks she‚Äôs going crazy and was crying earlier. The only other person she‚Äôs talked to about it was her niece, and she said no.

"AITA for causing a scene at GF parents' party?  So, I'm not from the US. I moved here at 13, went to school, graduated, went to college, the works. I met my GF almost 2 years ago. We've been dating for a just about that long. Over the past year, she introduced me to her parents and we've been getting to know each other better. Me and her dad are getting pretty close, he called me to rant about basketball constantly throughout the season. So yesterday, Saturday, they're having a BBQ in their backyard, they invite the neighbors and the whole family.

I live in a very blue part of a red state. Their parents neighborhood is out of central casting. All the en vogue lawn signs as far as the eye can see. Think of all the slogans, hashtags and organizations you can associate with an area like that, its all there. I don't know if this is important, it was just my observation. We're there for about 30 minutes, going around, introducing ourselves. We're standing in a circle with pretty much everyone else there, because they're all eager to meet me, for some reason. Eventually, it comes to where I'm from. I tell them, no problem. This lady then says in an overexaggeratedly nice way, Wow, your English is very good. Now I hate when people say things like, i find it incredibly condescending.

Like, even in high school, few years into the country, I was in AP English. I got an 800 on the SAT's in the writing part. Back when they had a writing part, they eliminated it now, because no one can form a coherent sentence. Like my command of the language is better than most native speakers, I don't need people telling me this. But the way she said it got me even more, so I replied: So is yours. Your diction can use a little work, but it'll get there. I smiled when I said it too, making it look like compliment. This lady's face froze, I could see her brain trying to work out what I said and what it meant.

Several people spat out their drink. GF's dad and brother were shaking, trying to contain laughter. Her mom quickly changed the subject and everybody dispersed. We stayed away from each other. At the end of the evening, her mom got on me about being rude to her neighbor, when she was just trying to complement me. GF defended me, the brother was all for. Dad didn't say anything, but nodded to me behind her back. I apologized and said I'll smooth things over next time I see her. AITA?",0.11
"AITA for telling a lady at my church that the donuts my church had out for Father's Day was for fathers before she could take one? So, this morning my church was having a Father's Day celebration where they were handing out free donuts to the dads, and one lady was about to take a donut and I asked her if she was going to get a donut for her husband, then I informed her that they have the donuts for fathers, and she took one anyway saying ""I'm a dad"". 

And I was like ""Okay, sure""üôÇAfter that one of the pastors came to me and was like ""I know you wanted to specify, but if someone wants to get a donut, let them get a donut."" I know he wasn't yelling at me or anything, but he still singled me out in front of everyone by talking to me after about what I told her, when I was just following orders. 

Like, is he serious? He made me feel like I did something wrong when our team leader told us to let people know, and that the donuts were for fathers since it was Father's Day. Usually when not enough donuts are being served by the end of the first hour of church service, *that's* when the team leads bend the rules and start letting everyone have donuts.

 So, I wouldn't have minded if that were the case, but they told me for the first hour it was ""Dads only"". I get it if there are single moms who always feel like ""they have to be the mom AND the dad"" in their households, but we already have a Mother's Day to celebrate them and their efforts. Thing is, I felt singled out by the pastor for just trying to do my job for the hour and let people know like I was told, and it bugs me that he came to me after she left and while other people started coming to get donuts. 

It made me feel like I did something really wrong when I was just letting people know like I was told. I wasn't trying to offend anyoneüò¢ Once he told me that, I was like ""Oh, okay"", and tried to stay chipper throughout the whole hour, but the entire time I felt like crying because I felt a little embarrassed and already got reprimanded by my aunt for being a little late to the car that morning.

 It's already been a little hard at my new job, too lately because I'm trying to keep up with my new co-workers in a fast-paced environment. So, I think this morning just made me feel like I was making mistakes all over the place even though I was trying to just serve people and get through a busy morning.

One day he invited me to his father and step mother‚Äôs house so I could meet everyone and hangout with him. I‚Äôm very shy especially around people I‚Äôm supposed to make good impressions on. He introduced me to his half siblings and they played xbox with each other while I watched quietly. 

I was exhausted from an all nighter and working the morning shift at my job. Since I wasn‚Äôt doing anything, I got comfy with my bf on the couch. When his stepmom came home my bf said hello to her. It‚Äôs important to note that I am young, skinny, and flexible. I should also mention I was wearing a snug tank top (not see through) and baggy sweatpants. I came out of my doze and had a big, satisfying stretch, and quietly groaned. 

His step mom did not acknowledge my presence and I was much to shy to open my mouth in front of her. 

The next time we came over we brought pizza for everyone. Step mom comes home from work and asks to speak with my bf upstairs. When he came back he said step mom didn‚Äôt like how I ‚Äústretched sexually and moaned.‚Äù Also that I shouldn‚Äôt behave or dress so suggestively bc it was inappropriate for her eight year old girl and 13 boy. I was so humiliated and confused bc this was not my intention at all. I left with tears in my eyes because I had embarrassed myself so badly without realizing it till days later. Boyfriend later told me that after I left he was upset with stepmom and laid into her for judging me as a slut. 

After the shame and sadness passed, I felt angry that I had been judged and slut shamed. I feel that what I did was harmless, at least I definitely don‚Äôt behave suggestively on purpose. Seems to me she just feels intimidated by younger women and sexualized me for almost nothing. 

Months have passed and bf and I visit frequently. Usually playing with the kids outside. I have become close with the girl and like to visit, except when we come inside and step mom is there. We don‚Äôt speak to each other and neither of us break the silence. 

It is so awkward and I feel like an intruder. I know she talks smack about me bc her little daughter tells me. I also say very hateful things about her to my boyfriend. I keep making a point about not wanting to be near step mom, but he wants to visit and I relent.

"AITA For Not Supporting My Ex I really had no idea how to title this because of how messy it is, I made a whole throwaway account for this so if he does see this he can't really get to me on my main account.

&#x200B;

I'm not gonna give specific ages but we are both in school (not college).

So yesterday (Saturday on the 18th) I was at a graduation for my friends who are graduating as I am going to be graduating too next year, he texts me upset which I have no idea what he said nor remember but apparently he told me he failed school. For a third time specifically. Now I personally don't know how to react as I never went through it but I told him I'm at a graduation and I'll talk later and that I was also going to a grad party (if anyone wonders it was a great party). I told him later on that I was really upset they were graduating n such because I had completely forgotten that he had said anything (I don't even think he had said anything).

Cut to today, he is mad at me because I didn't react the correct way (this is all my thinking on this) because I didn't immediately emotionally support him. I told him that I basically have 0 idea how to emotionally support him because I myself have never failed school. He said he won't be able to finish school or anything so I gave him options. He then got mad at me for trying to understand his school system (it was a long distance relationship from the way way past) and that I shouldn't try to help when I don't understand the school system. I told him that I didn't know what he wanted from me at all after that because it confused me and a few of my friends who I told this situation to.

I am still confused about this all because I don't know if I am the asshole since I don't know what I did wrong. I could be ignorant by not knowing what I did wrong which he even went as far as to call me self centered for not knowing what I did wrong and that he was baffled about it.

She seemed okay with it till she noticed I had frozen fruits in the container and asked how did I get them; which I told her the back of the freezer. 

After this response she seem determined to get a taste of my shake. Saying that I used her stuff so she deserved some. I tired to make it clear that I didn't even put enough ingredients for more than one serving since I was just *trying* out the recipe. After I made the shake her and my dad were still shell shock that I was not sharing and were saying that I was mean and selfish jokingly. 

My mom then asked again if she could just try some and I removed the blades of the blender so she can just taste that , I knew she wasn't going to like it so I didn't want to waste any by pouring her a cup. This action caused her to be mad and she has been giving me the cold shoulder all day. I eventually did let her try some it in a cup , she didn't like it, but by then it must of been too late because I just had a conversation with her about taking me to grocery store so I can switch up some of my dietary choices. She said I can but from now on anything I want I have to buy. I don't make that much since I am only 16. 

The thing is the main reason why I didn't want to share with her is because I didn't have enough to share. Even after sharing just that little amount in a cup for her I barely have enough for tomorrow. 

So I am asking if I am the asshole because to be honest I am confused where I went wrong if I am.",0.68

"AITA for not doing as much around the house as my mom does My mom is currently in the middle of a divorce, I was very close with the man she's divorcing, I also have really bad experiences with past divorces my dad (who I no longer live with). I have a half sister who's three. My mom and step-dad are sharing 50/50 custody of her. Both of us are going through a really hard time, I've just been trying to process stuff, and I'm mostly home alone, I have trouble with motivation, and have a really hard time getting out of bed, but I have been trying really hard to keep the house in order but nothing seems good enough for her. Just today she yelled at me for using up 2 gigs of data while taking my sister to the park, (I had to or else I wouldn't have been able to text my mom) but she yelled at me that she is sick and tired of no one caring about her feelings. Just today I had a full on mental breakdown IN FRONT of her, because I know she's struggling and I want to help but I don't know how, my feelings were constantly pushed away or just denied when I used to live with my dad so I have a hard time expressing emotions. I have been working on that alot but it's still really hard to open up, not only that I also have a really hard time comforting people because I was never showed/taught how to deal with those types of emotions. She knows this. BUT for some reason when shit goes sour she thinks that no one cares about her, it's taken a toll on my mental health, and I feel like I'm not good enough for her. She constantly criticizes me about how I do the things she asks me to do, for example; the dishes, I was never taught how to properly do them so now I struggle with them, still haven't been taught how even though I ask her for help. So I have been struggling to keep up with household chores when I'm home alone. She's also upset at me on how my daily average on my phone is 7 hours, my friends are my biggest support system and I go to them whenever I'm struggling, but she's upset because ""if I wasn't on my phone all the time I would be able to do the tasks she asks of me.""

"AITA for telling a coworker friend that other colleagues were gossiping about her behind her back? I (f28) overheard most of the other women at work gossiping about my coworker friend (f27). They were saying how they didn‚Äôt like her, thought she was annoying and was sucking up to the manager in order to get ahead at work (not true). 

This friend is generally a very outgoing, upbeat person. She would not be sensitive and takes criticism well. She asked me why some of the women seemed to be giving her dirty looks that day. I decided to tell her what I heard, thinking she‚Äôd rather know the truth.

When I told her looked clearly upset and taken aback, and said ‚Äúso none of the girls like me?‚Äù. I immediately regretted telling her and tried to backtrack by saying that they probably didn‚Äôt mean it seriously etc but she was obviously hurt. 

The rest of the day she was laughing and joking as normal but quieter than usual. I could tell by her eyes she was trying to hide how upset she was.

when he cooled down and we stop playing I looked at him and smiled because it was awkward and I didn't know how to respond. my brother called me weird and I responded by saying it was awkward.

"AITA for refusing to care for my family's dog? **TL:DR: Sister never cared for her own dog, so parents assume I will drop everything to take care of him and tonight I said no and stood my ground but now I don't know if I was the asshole or not.**

&#x200B;

Background: My sister always plagued our parents for a dog, I didn't want a pet and I always made that clear to our parents. They decided to give each of us a guinea pig when we were kids and my sister never did anything to care for them and our parents refused to help because it was our pets and therefore our responsibility. So I ended up caring for both.

&#x200B;

I knew that would happen again, so when in 2017 our parents got a Bernese Mountain dog and named him Aslan, I told them this wasn't my dog and he was NOT my responsibility. I would ONLY agree to care for him if ABSOLUTELY NOONE else was able to and I needed to know at least 1 day in advance. They agreed and told my sister he was her dog alone.

&#x200B;

Timeskip to today, and when he lost his cute puppy-look she basically threw him away. She was supposed to take him with her when she moved out, but she didn't so he stays with my parents full time and they always asks me to take him. My mom will text me ''You take care of Aslan tonight, yes? Thanks!'' 1 hour before she leaves him alone, and get furious if I refuse and try to guilttrip me.

&#x200B;

And usually it works, because I feel bad for Aslan. He gets very lonely and will be outside in the garden, howling for my mom and annoying the neighbors. But tonight I refused, I just got home from a trip yesterday, haven't even unpacked my bags yet and my mom just started spamming me with texts telling me to walk and feed him. I asked her why my sister couldn't ever care for her own dog, and she said ''She's at work''. I told her that she always assumes that I will care for him and that I'm tired of it, and she just ignored me and kept going on about me caring for him. She then told me to call my sister and ask her if she could care for him tonight, and I told her to call her herself and that it wasn't my problem.

&#x200B;

She then asked me if we couldn't help each other, and I said we usually could but that I'm sick of taking care of my sisters dog. She then wrote ''You're right, but thank you so much dear'' to which I responded ''What?? I didn't say yes to care for him, what do you mean with thanks??''. No response, so I sent another text that said ''Why do you assume I will just say yes?'' and then a text that said ''Does that mean you DIDN'T call Sister and that Aslan STILL haven't gotten fed or walked tonight??''

&#x200B;

Still no response, and I'm sure my sister won't take care of him tonight or tomorrow. And when my mom finds out I will be labeled the asshole by her, my dad and my sister. I told my boyfriend about this and he said he understands me, but I might be the asshole for not just doing it. And I feel terrible for Aslan but I am just so tired of having to drop everything to go take care of him.

"AITA For me and my friends getting lashing out at our 2 other friends? So this happened like yesterday. Me and my 2 best friends V and L came up with an idea that we all go to the beach. So we texted in our chat with our other 2 friends S and M (they are sisters) and asked them if they wanted to come. Radio silent. Ok so we wait a few more days. 

Still no response but they have read our messages. This is not the first time this has happened. But here is the thing if we don‚Äôt invite them and post us 3 having fun they get all butt hurt about it. So since there was no response my friend V came up with the idea to say some fake gossip in chat and see if they said anything. As soon as it was sent boom. 

S answers and says what happened. We took the opportunity while they are answering (S and M use the same account to talk to just us) to ask them why they can answer to gossip so quickly but to us asking to hang out it‚Äôs silent. They used the EXUSE they are just busy. So we try to compromise and they are just giving us one worded responses. To where we just get fed up and lash out saying they always have an excuse and we always try. 

So I said to V and L we should just drop them. Since they don‚Äôt even wanna talk or hang out with us at all. I told my bf about this and he said me and my 2 friends were being mean to them. So are we the assholes for wanting to drop them/no longer wanting to be friends?",0.5
"WIBTA for telling my supervisor where to stick her uniform policy? A few months ago, I (20F) started working in an ice cream parlour in my college city. The uniform is supposed to be a t-shirt with the store logo (which they provide, obviously), jeans, and smart trainers or other shoes. That is to say, casual and comfortable, but presentable.

In the months I've been working there, I've never been provided a uniform t-shirt and I admit there's been times I've gotten... Lenient with the uniform. I consider myself a stylish young woman, and since I don't have a uniform yet even after requesting one, I've been letting myself sprinkle my personal style into some of my work wear. Nothing untoward or inappropriate (in my opinion) but I guess some of it is not technically uniform policy. As a few examples, in my last few weeks at work, at different times I've worn: a black cami top and skirt, a pastel rainbow cardigan, with opaque tights covering my legs; a black t-shirt and pink jeans; and a black and white pinafore dress over a white long sleeve, paired with knee socks. As I say, nothing offensive but definitely my own style.

A few days ago, my supervisor (23?F) (who I have had multiple problems with in the few months I've been working there) took me aside when I was wearing the latter of these three outfits to lecture me about the uniform policy. Initially, I thought the socks were the issue, given I could see why knee-highs could be viewed as unprofessional. But she had an issue with, apparently, my entire work wardrobe.

Given my issues with her, I stayed silent and nodded along when she explained the store policy, told her again I had no uniform t-shirt, and resigned myself to not wearing skirts (the skirts/dresses I wore were always around knee-length at least, given I'm short af lol) as I understood that wasn't policy.

However, I heard some of the other girls gossiping another day, talking about the uniform policy and after what happened, it felt directed towards me. They were saying as the face of the business, front of house staff had to be presentable and professional and it got me thinking.

Technically, I guess I WAS breaking policy wearing what I was. But when my supervisor took me aside to lecture me, she herself was wearing an orange hoodie over her uniform top, and also a pair of black cargo shorts. Other members of staff wear sweatpants, yoga pants, and shorts to work too. Personally, I'd say a pair of pink jeans or knee-length skirt is more presentable than any of these.

It should also be noted I wore some of my ""controversial"" work outfits in front of the actual store owner, and he never raised a concern.

Would I be the asshole if I told my supervisor she should get off her high horse, given that I arguably looked more presentable than her and other staff members? Or even to suck it up until she gives me my damn uniform?

EDIT: I thought it was important to note I'm currently looking for another job due to issues with my supervisor way above what I wrote here, which is why I think I come across so rude when I'm talking about her. I take on board everything everyone's been saying though, and I think I've let past conflicts, attention-seeking and a misguided sense of hypocrisy cloud my judgement. Thanks guys!

EDIT #2: I don't expect this to change the judgement, because I've pretty much accepted I'm a petty AH but someone mentioned adding extra context behind my conflict with the manager so I'll copy-paste what I wrote: I got along super well with her at first, then she started to get frosty with me after I told her I was bisexual (notably[? maybe?], another bi girl at work reported the same to me in private), and on Tuesdays when it's just the two of us on together, she takes hour long personal phone-calls or goes to chill in the office playing on her phone, leaving me to pick up her slack and prep kitchen stuff, which isn't my job to do. 

Other co-workers have pointed out she treats me differently to others, and the ones I'm closest to have even encouraged me to take it to the owner (he's the only one with the power to hire or fire, I use the term ""supervisor"" liberally because it's more of a shift-supervisor so there's someone in charge than a literal manager-supervisor).",0.94
"AITA for Getting Mad at My Husband for Puking in the Kitchen Sink? Long-time lurker, first-time defendant.

Background:  We have a 2-compartment kitchen stainless steel sink that was stupidly designed to have 90 degree bottom edges and corners. There is drying rack insert that fits into one side, and the disposer in in the other.  In general, it is difficult to clean; the rack has to be removed and you have to get into the corners with a brush.  Also, when you run the disposer, pieces of food spew up into the side with the drying rack.  Maybe you can see where this is going.

Yesterday my husband got food poisoning.  He is a relatively big guy and likes his food.  Over a couple of hours, he started with nausea, had some chills, then was standing by the sink.  I asked him if he was feeling better and he said that he was nauseous.   I walked over to the bathroom (less than 20 feet away) and opened the door so that he could make a dash.  Instead, I heard the freight train of vomit going into the sink.  I was horrified.  This went on for a while, he ran the disposer, rinsed out the sink, then happily declared that he felt a lot better.  I must have had a shocked look on my face because he couldn't believe that I would be mad about it.  He started yelling at me that I should be happy that he feels better and the other option was TO PUKE ON THE FLOOR.  He said that he would clean it up, but he has sort of cleaned the sink maybe twice ever, and based on previous experience, he would not be very thorough.

I got him out of the way, loaded the rack and whatever else was in the sink (including my granddaughter's sippy cup lid) into the dishwasher then cleaned up the spew that was now under the rack.  He's furious.  I got up this morning and sanitized the sink.  He was still furious.  At the same time, maybe I was not very empathetic and should have been grateful that he made it to the sink. AITA?

Clarification:  He didn't run to the sink and immediately puke; he was standing there for a couple of minutes before he actually got sick.  That is why I was surprised he didn't head into the bathroom.

Update: I learned that there are a lot of kitchen sink pukers.  We talked about it today, and he said that he tried to walk it off by taking the dogs outside.  He hung out by the sink thinking that it would go away then it suddenly hit.  I'll take the YTA for not being more empathetic.  He admitted that he was ready to clean the sink at some point but when asked, could not confirm that it would have been truly sterilized.  In his words, ""We'll never know""  haha.

At the same time, all that I could think of was my food safety training and the germs that made him sick residing in our sink.  I could have been a little more helpful in my tone when I offered to clean up.

And for anyone who thinks that I have never had food poisoning, yes I have had it multiple times, but I'm a toilet puker.  I have also had intestinal parasites a couple of times and would argue that it's worse because everything randomly bubbles up and out, so it can be hard to diagnose.  ",0.18

"AITA for thinking my friend should apologize for shrinking a shirt I lent her? I (26f) lent my friend (27f) a shirt for her to wear a few days ago. She specifically asked to borrow it and I thought nothing of it because we're close and I thought it would be fine. The shirt is handmade and 100% rayon and has a (albeit small) tag on the inside that says to handwash in cold water only. I didn't expect her to wash it since she wouldn't be wearing it for very long. I got it back a few days later and she told me she washed it, which made me nervous because she never asked me beforehand and I knew it had to be washed a certain way. It seemed fine at first glace so I didn't say anything at first. However, when I got home that day I tried it on and realized it had shrank considerably and was warped. I messaged her and asked her how she washed it and told her it had shrank. She told me she wasn't sure how to wash it so she just washed it with her regular clothes but that none of her own clothing shrank. She stopped responding to me after that and I left it for a couple days. 

I then messaged her and told her that while I understood it was an accident and I wasn't angry, I thought she should have apologized and that I thought she should have asked me first before washing my shirt. She responded very angrily and told me point-blank that I was mistaken about her shrinking my shirt, and that I was ""in the wrong."" I told her it definitely shrank, I tried it on before and after I gave it to her, but that I knew it was an accident and I didn't think it was unreasonable to expect an apology for not asking me when she admittedly wasn't sure how to wash it, and that I was disappointed with the lack of respect she was showing me. 

She told me I was unreasonable for coming to her and blaming her and that she was upset by it, and she was disappointed that I didn't have ""confidence in her to not just blame her."" She then told me, verbatim, that she ""only apologizes when she's in the wrong, not to appease anyone especially when they upset her."" I told her she was in the wrong because she should have asked first and my shirt is ruined and not replaceable, and that in the future she should ask people. In her defense, I never explicitly told her not to wash it or how to wash it, but I didn't think I needed to and in my opinion I think it's common knowledge to ask before you do something like that.

"AITA for not taking my phone out of my ex's name when he didn't pay the bill for months? My ex and I have been on a joint account for our cell phone service for some time now. We broke up years ago but I didn't know I was able to separate my account from his. So I've just been sending him money for my phone bill ever since then. Several months ago (maybe even a year ago) he got fired from his job. He has not found a new job since, although he has been doing DoorDash. DoorDash wasn't enough to pay his rent (we were roommates for about a year until recently) so I had to cover his portion of rent multiple times. Usually he paid me back but not for the last month's rent. Well a couple months ago, my phone got shut off. Mind you, I've been taking my portion of the phone bill out of his rent. Turns out that he hasn't been paying the phone bill for months and we owe close to $600. I can't afford to pay even half of that bill with my current financial situation. So I just financed a new phone after a month of not having one. Now he is insisting that I take responsibility for the old phone and the balance that is on the account, even though his portion of rent was so much smaller than mine due to the fact that the cost of my phone was coming out of his rent. I can't afford to do this either. I offered to give him my old phone so that he can pay the balance on the account and cancel his line and just use the one on the phone that I have (the phone is not paid off so the line can't be cancelled once the balance is paid). So am I the asshole here?

She has recently went on a vacation for a long while, and before she left things were a little bit rough. Given our circumstances things are always easy but I do hold a deep love for her.

With that said it has come to me attention lately, that she logs into my Instagram because I can see the location.

"AITA for yelling at my sister cause she told our parents i'm dating my former teacher? me (19F) and my sister (18F) are irish twins. last february our bio teacher got sick a month into the term and we got a substitute (24M), who ended up teaching the class for the rest of the year (which was like 50% online school). so me and my sister graduated and that summer I ended up meeting him again at a soccer camp we were both coaches at. we became friends and then something more and now we've been dating for almost 9 months.

my sister and parents know i've been dating someone, but i haven't introduced them and i'm not one to really talk about my relationships so they don't know he was once our sub. i planned on letting my parents get to know him (and like him) first before i told them, for obvious reasons. i didn't bother telling my sister, as i don't like talking to her about my romantic life after she told a girl i had a crush on in middle school that i liked her.

so today my boyfriend and i had a date by the waterfront. a couple hours later when i'm back at my dorm i get a ton of messages from my mom freaking out and asking me a million questions about my boyfriend.

I called my sister and started yelling at her, saying she should've talked to me first before going and telling someone something she knew nothing about. she told me she thought telling our mom would be the right thing to do because she didn't know if i was 'in trouble.' i said that was bullshit because  she completely misrepresented our relationship to our mom, as she seemed to think i was dating some 40 something year old weirdo since HS. my sister knew he was young and knew i was 18 before he even started subbing for our class, so even if she thought we got together in HS, it's a completely different situation than she let our mom believe. she said that she was just doing what she thought was best and that it wasn't her fault our mom had a different idea. she called me an AH for not seeing that she was just trying to help. i can somewhat see her point, but at the same time, i see no reason she couldn't have talked to me first.

"AITA for accusing my (now ex) partner of using me for a baby? I‚Äôll try to make this as brief as possible. There is more I would like to write but unfortunately limitations means I cannot. 

She lost a child a couple years before meeting me. I have a daughter (8yo) from a previous relationship. 

When we first met, she showered me with love and affection. I was a bit freaked out at first and tried to take it slow. Over time, I fell in love with her. 

Fast forward 4 years, I got diagnosed with anxiety and depression. 
At the height of it, she suggested a baby might help my depression - that I‚Äôd feel more me again. I wanted another child myself so we decided to try for a baby. 

Around a month or so before our son was born, we had an argument (bare in mind this was our first ever argument‚Ä¶really it was) I can‚Äôt recall what it was about but during the midst of us arguing, I said ‚ÄúI feel like you used me for a baby‚Äù. She told me ‚Äúdo you think I would have been with you this long just to have a baby?‚Äù  I felt awful and apologised. 

We have had a lot going on these past several months involving court and I have been accused of domestic abuse, manipulative behaviour and harming our child.

"AITA for not having any kid friendly beverages at my house? This situation involves me (28nb), my husband (40m), our 2 year old, my SIL/my husband's sister Wendy (27F), and her 4 kids ages 3 to 11




My husband and I don't drink anything aside from water, tea, and coffee. We also have whole milk for our toddler. We don't stock soda or juice, but allow our kid to have juice/soda on special occasions like birthday parties or holidays. This is where the issue arises.




Wendy and her kids LOVE juice and soda. She started giving her kids juice before she started them on solid food. Her pantry and fridge are constantly stocked with Costco packs of various sodas, juices, and sports drinks that the kids are allowed to grab as they please. I've seen her kids go through 2 12 packs of coca cola in one afternoon and idk if I've ever seen Wendy without a bottle of diet coke in her hand. We don't tend to visit Wendy since she lives in a 2 bedroom apartment with her kids. Our place has  more room so they visit us, but Wendy rarely tells us if she's stopping by. However, we constantly get into arguments over us""denying"" her kids things to drink when they're over. To be clear, we always offer them water, milk, or decaf tea - they refuse to drink them.



It came to a head last week when she dropped by unexpected. Her kids tore through my living room to the fridge and the 11 year old threw himself on the ground and started screaming ""YOU PROMISED AUNTIE HAD RAINBOW JUICE FOR ME!!"" (Does anyone know wtf rainbow juice is?) When I asked Wendy why she told her kids we had juice when she knows we don't she said she figured I couldn't say no to a crying child and that I'd go out and get some. At that point I had enough and I admit I was an asshole in how I spoke to her. After years of having to put up with 2-3 tantrums per week from her kids getting upset at not getting sugary drinks. I said, ""Wendy, it's not my fault you got your kids addicted to sugar. It's not my fault your 11 year old still throws tantrums because you refuse to parent your kids. You're on time out. If you drop by, I won't let you in. In the future if you want your kids to drink liquid sugar at my house bring it yourself. I'm tired of you using your kids to manipulate me and the rest of our family. Now get the fuck out of my house."" She looked at me like I had 6 heads, grabbed her shit, and dragged her kids out, kicking and screaming about rainbow juice.



She went on social media rant about how hubby and I are giving our kid an ED for denying her sweets and that we'd rather see her kids suffer from dehydration than give them something to drink. Her friends started dogpiling on hubby and I and we started getting angry calls and texts because SIL ended up leaking our info on social media. I didn't doubt myself before, but now I kind of am, especially because one of SIL's baby daddies who *never* agrees with her is saying were assholes for not providing anything other than milk or water at our home knowing her kids wont drink either.

"AITA for Not Saying 'Thank You' to My Brother for Cooking Dinner? I (15F) have a younger brother, A (15M), who is a jerk, to put it lightly. We used to get along, but that had since been broken for about five years now. I don't like to admit it, but all sibling love I had for him is now gone. I don't love him, and hardly actually consider him family.

Now, I cook often. My mom works until late and my dad is usually out working too, but only comes back to check on us and to see if we need anything, and for his breaks. I cook all sorts of different foods, and need minimal help.

Due to the pandemic, my mom lost her job, but recently got a new one, so I was cooking for the first few weeks of it. Not once did I get a 'thank you' from either of my brothers. Only my parents thank me.

Tonight was different, and 'A' has considerably less cooking experience than I do, so my dad helped him (AKA doing the majority of it while A watched and handed him stuff). And, because I never got a 'thank you' from my brothers, I turned to my dad and said 'thank you for the meal.' I was accused of ignoring the fact my brother 'cooked' the meal, and was yelled at by my dad and mom. I wanted to point out how A has never said any of that to me, so I thought it was fair I didn't say it back, but I kept my mouth shut, and will probably defend myself later.

AITA for being upset that my friend won't trade concert tickets with me? [deleted],0.94
"AITA for getting pissed off with my (30F) BF (30M) telling me his mums opinion on our plans? Just to preface, I get along well with my MIL and we always talk freely :)

My BF and I made plans for this weekend for me to visit him (LDR). Well, sort of. He thought we had because I'd suggested a plan, I thought it was still undecided because he dismissed planning until 3 days before my trip. I made an error in calculations due to a new public holiday and the lack of buses which resulted in us scurrying to plan an alternate way of me travelling as I cant drive. We eventually resolved it with him offering to drive me there and back. I wasnt keen as that's a lot of driving but we had planned to spend the weekend together and the only alternative was postponing (AGAIN) which I personally wasnt up for. Sorted right?

Well, I thought so until the next day when he rung me and stated that his mum had told him that he had to tell me that this was just a one off because of the circumstances and that he wouldnt be doing this often as it was too much driving. Now, I would never assume this was going to be a thing, heck I was against him driving that much if we had an alternative that didnt involve postponing and voiced as much. I got irritated and told him that if he wants to say something to stop hiding behind ""my mum said"" (it's not the first time) and actually voice his opinion not hers and I didnt appreciate being spoken to like a child nor did I like his mum (whos a lovely lady and I wonder if she really even said it like this) telling him he HAD to tell me something. He then said he didnt actually agree with her and he thought we had already sorted it and couldnt fathom why I was upset as he always just repeats what people say verbatim and assumed i wouldnt think it was his opinion and he shouldn't have to say he doesnt agree with what the person said. I snapped and told him I wanted to date him not his mother and if we had resolved it how was that information relevant or helpful? He thinks it's normal to just repeat what everyone says within a family and no one taking issue with it. Considering his mum is super tactful, i doubt this is a thing. I'm now also worried anything i tell him will be shared around the family. I'm also his first GF and so hes still learning the ropes of navigating relationships so i do try and cut him some slack.

So, AITA for getting mad and feeling very uncomfortable with this?",0.1
"AITA for being upset that my family is burying my grandma on my birthday? Update: a couple of things. I‚Äôm a grown 32 adult, I know this sounds ridiculous to others, and that‚Äôs fine. I needed a place to go with my feelings, as some of you assumed I was throwing a tantrum around my family. I haven‚Äôt made any comments to my family about it being on my birthday other than my original ‚Äúas long as it‚Äôs not on Monday‚Äù comment. Because regardless of how this post reads, I do understand my dad and his siblings are going through it much more than I am. The comment thread has helped me spin it in a more positive direction in my own head and I appreciate all the people who have given me amazing ideas on how to get through the day. So thank you. ü•∞


My grandma was 92yo. She was ready to go, she was my most favorite person in the entire world. She was literally MY person. My best friend. Without giving too much family history away (because god forbid this finds any of my family), it was my fathers mom, he has two siblings, a brother and a sister, sister is the youngest, his brother is the oldest. My aunt and I have a very‚Ä¶strained relationship. My grandma passed on Monday, they wanted to give everyone time to make the trip to the funeral if they wanted. Ideally they wanted it to be Saturday, Saturday didn‚Äôt work out because the funeral home was booked. I made the comment ‚ÄúI mean as long as it‚Äôs not Monday.‚Äù Because it‚Äôs my birthday. Literally any other day. Tuesday. Sunday. No they chose Monday, my birthday. And I‚Äôm the one who‚Äôs being unreasonable because ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs thinking about your birthday. Our mom just died‚Äù and fair. There‚Äôs zero reason it couldn‚Äôt have been on Sunday or Tuesday. So now for the rest of my life my birthday will always be the day I buried my best friend.",0.03
"AITA, my narcissistic bro uses daughter as bargaining chip Apparently grandparents will do anything for the grand baby. Even go as far as paying bills and leasing an apt. My brother has had every opportunity I‚Äôve had. I stuck my neck out for him twice, got him hired on where I work. He couldn‚Äôt make it on time or stay the whole shift, poor attitude and mouthy with upper management. Same story everywhere he‚Äôs worked. Only lasts 3 months and off to the next. Him and I had far too many fallouts and I no longer care to have him part of my life. Sucks because I feel like I lost a niece. I confronted my mom about enabling and wasn‚Äôt as nice as I could have been. I believe she‚Äôs choosing to be deaf dumb and blind to the situation, because he dangles his daughter in front of her. So I went no contact, and have been for awhile now. AITA?",0.05
"AITA for blaming my friends for not inviting me to parties when they‚Äôre not the host? I‚Äôm young (17F) and believe that my worries are less important than the problems said on that sub. It's just that this situation affect me and i don't have anyone to talk about my worries so i use reddit lol.

In middle school i was bullied, didn't have a lot of friends and wasn't invited to any parties, the situation got better with time and by the end of middle school i had a pretty great friend group.

But it stopped quickly after i entered high school. I was alone all the time and my old friends stopped minding me. But this year,it was different,i've made so many friends and it was so weird because i've always thought that i wasn't made to attract people to be my friend. 

Through the year they asked me multiple times to do parties at my house considering the fact that i have
a big house and my family is NOT poor. I accepted every time. I even accepted to host a party for the birthday of one of my ¬´ friend ¬ª when it was supposed to be at her house. I was used a lot for my money,because i thought that the way to have friends is to be nice and say yes to everything i even paid for some stuff that they asked me to buy for them. Recently i paid for the ticket of a friend to an amusent park (v expensive),restaurants,uber,paid them holidays to residences that my family own,cinemas,drinks,etc.

But this week i started to see some insta stories with all of my friends having a party together. Any friends that i could think of, they were there. One specific party were they were all invited except me and it was enough, i started to blame two specific friends for never including me to the friend hangouts and parties.

The thing is that they were not the ones hosting the party and i start to feel guilty for blaming them when
they are not the ones hosting it and for not speaking to them about the fact that i wanted to be invited. I'm worried that i make them feel guilty for something they can‚Äôt control. But one of the friend that i blamed told me that i ¬´wasn't close enough to the person hosting the party¬ª which i understand. After some investigation i realized that this friend was there because a guy told him to come. And now i don't know if i'm wrong for blaming them for not including me because in a way they were already invited by someone else than the host and it could look mean of them to invite other people when they were already included by someone else.

It's not an important post and sorry if it's polluting the sub i'm just loosing common sense with all of the anxiety this situation has created in me and i don't have anyone to talk to. This post can help me confronting my friends or not and maybe preventing me from ruining friendships over unjustified anger.

Another friend asked me to host a party at my house in a couple of days should i refuse to host it or it's mean and not justify to say no because she didn't do anything? If you think it‚Äôs interesting enough help me pls!

"AITA for being cold to my friend So context: my friend (f17) has been going through a lot recently (cause of school and academic stress) and I usually try my best to be there for her but i feel like I can‚Äôt do that anymore because every time we were to hang out the conversation would somehow become one about her partner or this guy I liked who liked her? I know I will probably sound petty for tis but i just cannot stand how she knows that i liked that guy a lot and how he affected me mentally, yet she continues to casually bring him up in convos. (They‚Äôre not even friends or anything rn) my last straw was last week when she suddenly sent me a 15 screenshots worth of account from his friends about how much he liked her‚Ä¶.. i don‚Äôt like him anymore and he‚Äôs te last person i want to speak about so I decided to just ghost her. She‚Äôs been coming to me about her issues recently as well and I haven‚Äôt been responding because i just can‚Äôt stand it anymore.

"AITA for not wanting to listen to my friends problems anymore? My best friend and I have known each other for 3 years and we have been best friends ever since. We have all our classes together and thats how we became best friends. We are part of a friend group now and I have always been the therapist friend. 

I was fine with listening to everyone rant to me and ask me for help, but these days I no longer wanna listen to anymore problems, especially from my best friend. Every day, she comes and rants about the stupidest subjects like how she doesn‚Äôt get a lot of sleep because her mom wakes her up when she leaves for work. She keeps whining about the same problem and I try to give her solutions like how she should fix her sleep schedule and not stay up late so she doesn‚Äôt end up getting 3-4 hours of sleep. She always ignore my advice and continue whining about problems that are so easily fixable and she makes a totally big deal out of them. I am so tired of hearing her whine about easy problems while others have bigger problems than this. 

Another example is that she always whines when she gets an acid reflux after eating and makes a fucking big deal out of it as if she is dying. Everyone experiences that you are not dying. 

I used to be okay with her whining and I never had a problem with it ,but now I am so sick of listening to her problems and how she makes a big deal out of them. Does anyone know why I feel that way? AITA?",0.1
"WIBTA for calling dcfs? my brother(19) and his girlfriend(18) (33 weeks?) used to sell weed and mushrooms.. they also used to drink heavily on occasion.she hid the pregnancy until she hit 20 weeks while she still smoked heavily, vaped heavily, smoked cigarettes, drank and consumed mushrooms and lsd tabs. i know she still smokes weed and nicotine and drinks hard liquor.

"AITA for being upset because I couldn't take a joke? I dated this woman for about 3 months. One night, we got high at my place and began reminiscing about our first few dates. At first, she was misremembering little things such as which high school I went to. town name east. town name west. town name north. Honest mistake. I shrugged it off. 

The deeper our conversation got, she began misremembering bigger things. I never worked at xyz. I never lived at abc. I didn't do 123. It was clear that she at the very least she didn't know me as well as I thought she did. I never flat out told her that. I was trying to be as polite as I could by letting her know that I did not do any of that and chalked it up to being too high to function, but I was upset enough that when it was time to head to bed, I slept on the couch. A little dramatic, but I needed my space. I didn't get angry. I was sad and disappointed.

I woke up in the middle of the night and went to bed once I felt better. Within minutes of getting to bed, she told me I should have stayed on the couch. I laid there for a bit, but she was persistent,  physically pushing me off. Not wanting to fight, I went back to the couch. The following morning, I didn't process what had happened yet. We went about our morning routine and parted ways.

Once I had time to process everything, I got upset. Once I was ready to talk about it, I told her it hurt when she kicked me out of bed. Don't ever kick me out of my own bed.

She said it was a joke. I told her even if meant it as a joke, it still hurt my feelings. 

Then, she said she's going through a lot of stress. I told her yes, I understand she's going through a lot of stress, but that doesn't give her a hall pass to treat me that way. 

She said I'm making a big deal about something so small and how if it was truly a big deal, then I would've said something earlier. I told her that it may not be a big deal to her, but it's a big deal to me to set clear expectations on how I want to be treated. I also told her I didn't bring it up right away because we had things to do in the morning, and I wanted to make sure we had time to discuss things. 

She complained about how I snore too loudly.  I acknowledged I do snore, but I am working on it. I wear those breathe strips whenever she sleeps over. 

She complained about how it felt like I was attacking her and how I need to learn how to let it go. I told her I never meant to attack her. I wanted to let her know how I felt about that night and what I need moving forward which is never kick me out of my bed every again. 

To that, she reiterated her points. She never apologized nor acknowledged my perspective. So I broke up with her. 

AITA? Did I completely misread a joke? Am I one of those uptight people who can't take a joke?

NOTE: I wasn't upset about her not knowing me as well as I thought she would have once I had time to process it. We only dated 3 months. I added that back story to illustrate why I was on the couch in the first place.",0.12
