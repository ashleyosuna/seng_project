"AITA for telling my mom we shouldn’t live in filth  Me (16 y/o male) and my Mom (45 y/o) and my brother (10 y/o) all live in a somewhat small townhouse together as my parents have separated. 

The house is very messy BESIDES my room which is the only clean and organized room in the house, not hoarder level messy or anything but in general just way too messy for my liking and I often tell my mom as such. I am the cleanest one in the house and am often going out of my way to clean up the mess my brother and mom make for them. 

For some context my brother is pretty much on his iPad all day and leaves wrappers and crumbs everywhere in the living room all over the floor and couch, and my mom works or sits at her desk almost all day and leaves bottles, papers, wrappers, and crumbs everywhere on the table and dining room. In general the whole first floor is a huge mess with things scattered everywhere and nothing being organized. The basement is also a huge mess as it’s mainly used for storage and nobody really goes down there to clean it often. 

I spend a lot of time in my room on my computer doing graphic design for some money or playing games, and I take pride in my clean room. When I go downstairs for a while, I notice just how messy it is compared to my area, and I comment on it somewhat often. 

I’ll usually talk to my brother and tell him he needs to clean the wrappers up or something general, and if I tell him that he should start learning better habits with cleanliness, my mom says “your being mean to him” or “your belittling him” and if I DARE say anything about her mess she deflects it onto me, talking about when I occasionally forget to put the clothes she folded into my drawers or how I take a while to do the dishes after she asks (she usually takes care of laundry and loading the dishes).

 Recently when we were in the car it got brought up and I was being a little more assertive about how we need to clean up, when eventually she said “I don’t want to talk about this anymore” after she kept deflecting it back onto me. I said okay and calmly said to my brother that he should also try to be more clean around the house and I’m willing I’m help him with that, when she lost it and started screaming that she’s having an anxiety attack about it.

Eventually we argued for a while and she said something along the lines of “I grew up in a messy household and I can’t help it, and you make me stressed when you say things about it” which I understand, she has a very stressful job and is a single mother, but I don’t think it should constantly be shot down whenever I suggest that we need to be more clean and I also don’t think being messy because you grew up that way is a valid excuse as I’m an example of someone who’s not messy but was raised in a messy household. I don’t think it’s good to constantly deflect it and especially teaching my brother who’s very young that it’s okay to be a slob. 

I love my mom and we have a good relationship otherwise, but I’m just curious how everyone else sees this.",0.25
"AITA for helping my sister in law with a breast issue? Hi. Changing names for privacy issues. I (32F) was invited to my brother's (I'll call him Harry - 35M) house for my nephew's (3 y/o - Ben) birthday party.

I was busy with work so I arrived towards the middle of the whole thing. Afterwards, I stayed behind to help clean up. My sister in law (Amber - 30F) and I spoke as we gathered the plates. She told me about a discharge she had been having from both of her breasts. And said she was quite worried. For the context, I am an OB/GYN. 

So I asked her if I could take a look at it and examine and also asked to see if she was taking any medications, etc. She was more than happy to ""finally have it checked out"" as she put it. So she took me to their bedroom for some privacy. I took a general look, gave my opinion and the issue ended there for me.

Later, my brother confronted me saying I was such an opportunist jumping at the chance to see his wife, and accused me of being a sneaky AH. I am bisexual, and Amber used to date me in the past. She got with Harry after she and I broke up. I told Harry I just tried to help the way I did with nana's knee or uncle Mike's rash. He told me I was fooling no one and said I should stay the F away from his wife.

I genuinely would like to know if I was the asshole here.

"AITA for saying I won’t stay with my stepdaughter unless my husband is there? I (f32) have 4 kids(f12,11,9, m8) from a previous relationship, married my husband (m33) who has a 10 year old daughter, 3 years ago. She lives with her mom but I stay with her whenever her mom asks or she wants to stay with her dad. She is usually a pretty chill kid and I almost never had a disciplinary problem with her. 

I absolutely love her, although I couldn’t say she loves me back. She was never disrespectful and understood whenever I put my foot down during any petty fights the girls might get into. But lately, she’s been openly disrespectful, lying to my face, and down right mean. I spoke to my husband and her mom about this and both have spoken to her to knock it off but today I had enough. 

She spent most of her spring break at our house. The first day she got into a fight with my 11 year old over a chair. Apparently, she was sitting in a chair outside and went inside. My 11 year old came outside and sat in that chair without knowing that’s where my stepdaughter was sitting. She sat on top of my daughter and wouldn’t get off until my daughter started screaming my name. I repeatedly asked her to get off her sister and she wouldn’t and it wasn’t until I threatened to tell her parents that she got off. I told her to go to the room and give me her phone. She decided she didn’t want to and sat on it. I asked for it a couple of times before I picked her up and grabbed the phone. 

The 1st thing I did was tell her mom and my husband which were both very surprised as she is never like that with me but said they agreed with the punishment I gave her. After that she calmed out a bit but I would catch her in lies when she tried to get her siblings in trouble. Last night, after I sent them all to bed I would catch her trying to sneak out of the room to which she said that she couldn’t sleep. Now she says she can’t sleep without her phone which is not true as at night she would give it to me to charge since she got here. Now today is Easter Sunday and we were going to church. She said her mother wanted her to keep her hair down. I told her I found that weird because her mom always asks me to do her hair nice specially for church. So I texted her mom and she told me absolutely not, that it was she that wanted her hair down but she asked me to pin it up nice for her. She refused. My husband was really upset with her for lying and wasting time. 

And a little while ago my 9 year old that is close with her confided in me that she told her she didn’t need to listen to me because I am not her mom. That her dad and I aren’t really married because we didn’t have a wedding ceremony (we had a courthouse wedding during Covid) and that we got married on the day her mom and my husband got together on purpose (we didn’t because I had no idea and my husband literally forgot). I texted my husband that if he’s not here that I won’t be staying with her if she is going to be behaving this way. AITA?",0.6
"AITA for how I told my ex that my wife is pregnant? Context: Back in 2015, I (M now 35) had a major mental breakdown and a short stay in hospital after my ex-wife Lauren (F now 36) abandoned me and took our 5 month-old baby son, James (M now 9), 250 miles away, under the pretence of ""getting more help"" with caring for him. After finding out she wasn't coming back, and several weeks of very weird discussions and therapy, I said I wanted to separate, and Lauren started a very, very messy divorce, including false accusations (threatening behaviour against her and James) against me that still hurt to this day. It has taken YEARS, child contact centres, and a lot of compromising to get to a stage where Lauren and James (and her partner) are all happy for me to visit (I always travel up to them, as they refuse to meet in the middle). We have reasonably open lines of communication and plan these visits together. It's also very important to know that James is autistic, and finds change very difficult and anxiety-provoking.

Current Day: After rescheduling two visits (one after Christmas (James felt too overwhelmed), one in February (James was ill)), I finally went up to see James! He even asked if my wife Kathy (F 35) could come with me, which is a huge deal because he decided a couple of years ago that he'd rather it just be me. The visit went so, so well! James was very playful and more affectionate than ever, he got on well with Kathy, and I have some wonderful memories from it!

A couple days after the visit, Kathy and I messaged Lauren and partner to tell them about how we're expecting a baby. We didn't tell them before the visit because I wanted the focus to be solely on James and I. They have also always expressed that visits should be as positive as possible. We asked if we could discuss the best way to give this news to James and started talking about planning the next visit.

CHAOS. Lauren and partner replied, saying how disappointed they were in how we'd handled this. Lauren broke down in tears due to anxiety of what this could mean for James, and James figured something was up and basically put 1 + 1 together. He is furious and extremely upset, thinking he's being replaced. He doesn't even want my name mentioned. Cue Lauren accusing me of not doing enough to visit (I have sought counselling and have been told I have a form of CPTSD from the abandonment at my weakest time, and not forgetting the amount it costs to travel and stay where they live), the partner (who typically goes above and beyond and is an excellent role-model to James) telling me it wasn't the ""courageous thing to do"" and that we should've brought it up on the day (why would I spring that on them with zero notice?!). We've been told to leave them alone for a while.

I can't see how we could have approached this any better than we did. When messaging, I also asked when a good time to message would be so that James wouldn't be using Lauren's phone for games etc.

"AITA for telling my wife to learn how to control her temper My(25M) wife(25F) and I have an 8yo son. Earlier this week at a parent-teacher conference, his teacher told us that he was still acting out in class and disrupting the class. I say "" still"" because she brought this up to us last fall and we said we would fix it, nip it in the bud. At the time, we sat him down, we talked to him, told him that his behavior was wrong, and told him to stop. He said he would, so, to hear that it continued was disheartening to say the least.

On our ride home, my wife was seething. She wanted to throw away pretty much everything he enjoys, from his video games to his basketball. I told her that I thought being calm about this was the best way to proceed. She argued that we were calm the last time and that calm didn't work. I argued that going all scorched Earth on him probably won't help.

She said I was an ineffective parent. I asked her why this has her so riled up. She explained that she doesn't want to be seen as a former teenager parent who didn't turn out as a good parent. I told her that I understood where she was coming from, but that's still no reason to throw his stuff out.

We got home, and without talking things through with me, she just started screaming at him, telling him that HE is not going to embarrass HER like that ever again. She proceeded to demand he go to his room.

I told her that she handled that completely wrong, and that she needed to learn to control her temper. She claimed she did was needed and said I shouldn't be arguing with her about this.

"AITA For expecting my granddaughter to at least have the respect to wish me a happy Easter?  My 64f granddaughter 19f and I got into an argument on the phone once again two weeks ago because I just spoke my feelings, and now she told me off and hasn’t wished me a happy Easter. All because I suggested she forgive my daughter, her mother, Anne. 

My daughter Anne has issues and a lot of horrible qualities. But she calls me every day and needs my help with basic tasks because she doesn’t have anybody anymore. No friends, partner, anybody. She had a daughter young. Her name is Sara. She didn’t treat Sara well and it caused problems within the family for years. She would isolate Sara from us the second we said something she didn’t like. But she treated her horrible. I supported her financially by buying essentials, foods, and clothes for her because Anne couldn’t be bothered.

Anne has struggled with mental illness since she was a teenager and I had to get her hospitalized twice. When Sara was growing up, it took over her. She was a neurotic control freak. Controlled how often she showered (Not letting her every day) Hid and monitored the food in the house. And we got into multiple arguments and screaming matches about Anne being odd about things. Such as not letting Sara sleep on her bed or eat at the dinner table because of her OCD fear of messes. She made her sleep and eat on the floor for years.

Every time I saw this, I yelled at my daughter and asked her why the fuck she’s treating her like that. I came over their place one evening when Sara was about 10-11, and she was screaming on the hallway floor scratching herself saying she can’t take her mother anymore. I took her out of the house for a week, and my heart broke for her.

As a toddler, I heard Sara screaming for somebody to help her. We all lived together. She would put Sara in dark hallways, closets, scare her with the dark when she’d get frustrated with her. Sara told me that she’d say things like “The aliens are coming to get you. Goodbye” and lock her bedroom door so Sara can’t get in. All I heard was screaming all the time. My daughter screams daily.

She tore her down about her looks, body, everything. When she moved out at 18, she came to my house insecure and lost.

I told her since Easter is coming up, she should come to my sons house. She said no. I explained how her mother won’t be there. Still no. So I told her “Sara, I had to forgive my mother and it freed me. You have to forgive her. For yourself. You never know how you’ll feel in the future” and now she wants to stop talking to me. I’ve never excused what my daughter did. I condemned her all the time.

I did everything for her. Bought her what she needed. Took her out of the house growing up when I could. Fought endlessly with my daughter. But it’s never enough. She’s taking it out on her grandmother. I did everything I could for her. I would never excuse what my daughter did. But I remind her sometimes that life can change, and she won’t know how she feels years down the road. And now she hasn’t even called.

"AITA for not wanting to get a second job So I currently have a good low stress job. It's honestly the best job I've ever had. Its a work from home job with a chill manager that manages the workload so that there are never crunch moments or need for long hours

I finish the work arround 2/3pm almost every day and have the rest of the day to myself.

I feel like a new person I have started living again I read books started drawing again started making weekend plans almost every weekend (usually I will just rest and try too feel human again on the weekend + do some housework that's been neglected over the week) and I feel like even my work has gotten better now that my brain is well rested

So my gf who I've started living with has a very shitty job shes coming home every day stressed and tired. She just wants to lay down almost all the time now which I 100% understand as a person who had those types of jobs before

But now she began pastering me about getting a second job ""to make our life easier"" and tbh my job pays well and there is no need for this

We are living well even just on my salary (she has to send most of her money to her parents for reasons I won't disclose) and even in a hypotetical where she was to lose her job and take some time getting another we could make it work with a smaller budget plus we have savings

To clerify we share the budget its just that the amount she makes is about the amount she has to send just saying it like this bc she says to me often how she feels like shes working for nothing

And I get it to have a job sucking the soul out of you for cash you will not see only to come back home to your partner who makes more then you be like ""I've tried painting today during work hours"" probably doesn't feel good

But I just do not want to get a second job I do feel like an ASH about it bc it feels like shes struggling a lot and I'm just not helping her but just thinking to going back to that routine of only work and sleep is making me wanna die (a routine she is doing right now!!! See why I feel like an ASH)

I feel like her request is unreasonable because I feel like she's more motivated in me feeling the same as her and not actual reasonable solution to our living situation

I feel like she just wants us to feel like we're on the same page and fighting together in life but I feel like it's a bit much to work until I drop just to make her happy when I dont have to and there is no financial need to

"AITA for yelling at a kid for letting his dog poop on my lawn? I've recently relocated my home office so that it's facing the road, which means I get a good view of the people that walk past each morning as I'm working. Every day at around 10-11am, I've noticed that this kid (probably a 14-15 year old boy) comes past with his two dogs (a German shepherd and a golden retriever). Both of them are on leashes, however I've noticed that he lets them sniff and walk into other people's properties. If they walk into someone else's yard, he'll just follow them in absent mindedly (he's often on his phone) to the point that he's literally completely inside my property line and his dogs are a good 10+ ft in. 

He always lets them have a sniff around, and most of the time the dogs will pee in a few places (the golden has a habit of peeing on the wall of my house, which is really annoying). They then become disinterested so he walks off. 

However, the other day, one of the dogs popped a squat and began taking a dump in my yard. The kid was pretty nonchalant about it and didn't seem to try move the dog on when it started squatting, but he did pick up the poop and take it with him. 

This morning, he came by again, and of course let his dogs into my yard. They began doing their usual peeing ritual, but the GSD popped a squat so I immediately went downstairs to go confront him about it. I basically told him that it's disrespectful to keep bringing his dogs onto my property, and that he should leave my house alone. I may have raised my voice but I didn't swear or anything. He seemed visibly upset, took the poop, and left. 

Anyway, that night his mother came up to me and gave me a piece of her mind. She called me a ""f\*cking twat\* for yelling at a kid and said I hope I feel good about myself. I said that he's been doing it for a while, and that it's annoying and he needs to learn. I apologised for raising my voice but said I don't disagree with the principle. She said that if the poop is cleaned up, it doesn't really matter and that I'm just a twat.

When my mom got home I asked her if she got me a basket and she laughed and said “no, you’re husband said they were lame so I didn’t get them for the older kids”. This broke my heart. My husband and my sisters fiancé never ever said anything to my mom directly, so one of my younger sisters must’ve said it to her. However, she saw I was crying.

"AITA for get tired of trying not to snore when I'm asthmatic? I love my partner, and before her, no one had ever told me that I snored. She is a person who is very sensitive to noise, and at the same time very hardworking, I don't think it's fair that she should sleep less or have a hard time because of my snoring. So I do what I can to avoid it. 

I try to put my pillow higher, sleep on my side even if it's uncomfortable for me, tell her she can wake me up at any time of the night if I snore (which she does), move to another room if I can, or sleep on the floor if I cannot (like right now that we are in vacations in an hotel room). 

I am also a person with an asthmatic condition since I was a child. Which has meant many trips to the pulmonologist during my life to learn to live with it. As an asthmatic person for certain triggers I know, I try to take anti-allergy medications, spray myself with my ventolin, and drink hot things before going to sleep to guarantee as much as possible that I will breath well.

Despite all this, the last 2 weeks it seems that none of these preventions are working.  I started a new job that requires me to travel 3 hours each way to my office, which has meant that I leave the house very early and arrive very late. Yes, I will eventually move closer to work, but right now, I have to commute. The cold is actually one of the triggers for my asthma, and no matter how much I dress warmly, I have been having constant allergies, cough, runny nose, etc.

With that I also want to say that despite the precautions I take, inevitably these weeks I end up eventually snoring. My partner is tolerating it less and less, and I'm getting frustrated because I don't know what to do anymore. I have a doctor's appointment in a month, but I feel like the appointment is too far away. 

My partner tells me that I am fat and should lose weight, and that it doesn't matter to her that I am asthmatic, that she hates the sound of snoring. And for me, it becomes increasingly difficult, with my new job. I sleep little and it makes me feel bad that it is a situation that I cannot control 100%.

"AITA for making my son eat all of his food and arguing with his great Aunt that disagreed? I (36m) adopted my wife’s two son’s and we have two of our own.  Our oldest son is 11 and has always had special meals made for him.

I proposed that we try my families technique, we put the food out, if they don’t want it they can go and play, but that food gets put away for the next meal.  This meal will be there for when they get hungry.

My in-laws and wife were opposed to this.  So I suggested that he goes to therapy. They diagnosed him with ADHD and ODD, gave him medications.  They gave my wife instructions for healthier eating strategies and she just didn’t do any of it.  

Two years later I was fed up as a stay at home dad of 4 and battling the food thing.  I told my wife I was taking over.  After a rough couple months where once a week I’d put a meal that wasn’t what he wanted, he’s eating whatever is put in front of him.  He’s having vegetables and feeling proud that he’s overcoming the anxiety he’s had around food.

We went to his great grandparents house for lunch.  I told him he’d need to have a spoonful of everything and as much of whatever he wanted.  My wife made him a plate and she served less than a spoonful, but hey, not gonna fight that.

After eating most of it he complained that the salt was burning a cut on his lip and I told him to finish the last bites, it was a couple spoonfuls of cheesy potatoes and a tiny piece of ham.

I then went outside to check on my other two boys.  When I came back in I overheard my son’s great aunt bragging to my mother-in-law about how she just ate his food for him.  She saw that I overheard and shut up real quick.

 I then pulled my son aside asked him about it and he said that she said “you don’t have to eat that” he tried to to tell her that he had to and then she proceeded to eat it anyway.  I told him we were gonna go back in there and I’d give him a similar portion the small amount that he was supposed to eat. 

Of course they got huffy, but didn’t say anything.  When he finished I sent all of the kids outside.   The adults were all talking, so I waited until there was a lull and said, “I didn’t think I’d have to say this, if you disagree with how I’m raising my son you can come talk to me, but I will not tolerate(looking at great aunt) you encouraging my son to disobey me”.

She just outright denied doing it. I told her to shut up, that I heard her bragging about it and my son told me. It went off the rails.  Her daughter yelled at me not to talk to her mother that way.  My father in law yelled at me for being an atheist. My mother in law yelled at me saying my son’s ADHD and ODD are my fault. 

My wife and her whole family is upset with me, but my son isn’t.  My wife thinks I should have waited to bring it up or I shouldn’t have said it with my “tone”.  I took time to calm myself, I got the kids out of the house and tried to set this boundary.

"AITA for wanting to hang out with my boyfriend ?  OK so I 21 F am in a poly relationship with 22 F Jessica  and mark 23 M. Jessica and I usually hang out while mark is at work which is around 9-10 hours a day. and this is whenever i’m staying the night. jessica and mark live with each other so i’m only there for days at a time. but usually when i’m there i’m spending most of my time with Jessica. we cuddle , sleep , play video games and she likes to cook for me when I ask for it which I absolutely love. 

 Mark and I don’t really get much alone time, we see eachother when he gets off of work and that’s only for a couple of hours before we all go to sleep. when he and I try to go to another room to be with each other we feel extremely uncomfortable. 

he and I both feel as if there are two eyes burning in the back of our heads whenever we cuddle or pay a little more attention to each other. and if we do try to leave the room she follows us for most of the time or we get like 10-15 minutes alone with eachother before she comes into the room. 

 recently we were finally able to convince her to let us hang out alone and she agreed. her only restriction was that we couldn’t do anything sexual. although I found it odd I let it be. so he then picks me up after work and we go get something to eat and drink and we sat in a walmart parking lot and just talked. but we never got 10 minutes of talking to each other why ? because she was blowing up his phone arguing with him saying she’s sad and asking why couldn’t we hang out in the house or hang out in the parking lot in front of the apartment (he parks in front of their bedroom window).

 he was getting frustrated and I would hug him to help him calm down and it would work and then she would start texting again. she then got upset when he took too long to text back. from what I saw he took 5 minutes to respond. 

 3 hours into our hang out she starts texting him asking him to come home and we weren’t ready because we simply do not get the chance to be by ourselves and she and I do and like he and her does. he tells her he isn’t ready she then starts to call him and tries to argue with him and saying that she wants him to come home and that she’s lonely and she’s been alone for 2 days and can’t handle it anymore. 

  I grabbed the phone and asked her why couldn’t we hang out after she said it was okay. she said it’s okay but it’s just that she didn’t want us to hang out today because she was sad and lonely. I was confused and had an attitude and it was obvious and he took the phone and hung up. 

 jessica is now saying we’re showing her no compassion and that we don’t care for her emotions and that she was sad and lonely and no one really cared and ignored her. but all he and I wanted to do was to get slushies , eat , listen to music and talk.
 
  oh and did I mention the parking lot we were sitting in was 4 minutes away from the house ? 

so AITA ? ",0.5
"AITA for telling a girl what her crush calls her behind her back? I just graduated from high school a few days ago. There was a girl in my class, she is so sweet to everyone and pretty. I have a crush on her since the last 2 years. We are good friends and she is the only one I am still in touch with after school has ended. 

The guy she has a crush on is her bestfriend, they know each other for a very long time. He is a bully, the goon of our school, he doesn't deserve such a nice girl. 

A few months ago I saw him and a few of their mutual friends write her name on the last bench in our class (anybody rarely sits there) and insulting remarks like THICK B*TCH and S*UT/WH*RE. I couldn't do anything about it right then and there (he is a bully).

Yesterday, in the evening, I texted her asking her what she would do if a guy she likes called her these names behind her back. She replied that she would never fall for such a guy and she will get to know this by just looking at his eyes (quite ironic, right?). She asked why I am suddenly asking such ques so I told her that I know a girl whose crush calls her these names and asked her should I tell the girl about this and told her I am afraid that my friendship with her might be ruined as she trusts that guy more than she trusts me. She said I should definitely tell her and save the girl from that guy. 

So, I told her that she was the girl I am talking about, she thought it was a prank and started laughing but I told her that I was serious. She didn't believe me at first but then I gave her the exact position of that bench and told her she could go to school and check. She then believed me. She said she doesn't care about this and that we shouldn't talk about this anymore. She assured me that we are still friends and forever will be.

I would have done this for anyone, even if I didn't have a crush on her. I can't stand somebody dis-respecting a girl.

"AITA? My [21F] mum called my degree ""nothing"" and then pretended she never said it I'm a 21F female at a top 10 college in the world. I was recently admitted into a an even more prestigious college for grad school. I was talking with my mum about reasons to accept the degree offer and decided that I'd give up work experience (which I really wanted to have) because it's kind of worth it for the grad school offer I have. She agreed, and said, ""Of course, I mean, a degree from \[current Ivy\] is kind of nothing."" In the moment, I didn't react to this because it didn't sink in. She immediately corrected herself and was like ""It's not nothing, but a degree from \[better Ivy\] would mean so much more.""  
When I realized her words, they hurt me a lot. It has not been easy to study here. I'm from another country, have no family or friends in this place, and had to build a life here on my own. So for her to say it's nothing, just because I got something more prestigious, is kind of annoying -- even if it's said by mistake, I guess.   
I confronted her and she said she was tired and didn't know what she was saying. Fair enough, but I was hurt so I took a few hours to call her back neutrally. I don't know why I was being sensitive about it -- maybe I was getting pissed off with this cycle of overdelivering for my parents approval. When I called her back, I apologized for my sensitivity. She said ""I don't even remember saying that, so you need to quit imagining and overreacting to things in your head.""  
What? Why were my feelings being invalidated like this? I took my stance and corrected her. She told me to get over it again.Sorry if I sound like a broken clock. I'm just reaching a point where I feel that no matter what I do to make my parents happy, they will never be satiated. After my grad admission, my dad suggested I apply to Harvard for an additional master's (Harvard is the only school above this one in terms of prestige). I wish they could try studying here and give it a shot instead of throwing around huge expectations. 

I'm 21 but I feel like I don't even know who I am anymore, I've been living to make my parents happy for so long. I've never had a relationship, never had a solid friend group or a solid best friend (just fleeting friends for 2 years max) because everytime I start getting close to people my parents point out flaws in them that subconsciously play on my mind and cause the relationship to crumble. I have a very distinct personality and interests though which I have kept and make me happy.  
What do I do? Please suggest me steps or activities where I can slowly start to take back a feeling of control and self happiness and assertion in my life without the whole unhealthy rebellion; and a feeling of frustration which I currently feel.",0.06
"AITA setting boundaries with my family while I'm at the gym? Working out is my stress relief and it's my main way filter out the negative of my day. well, my family doesn't respect the boundaries I set for my gym time. My wife and my daughter who's twelve constantly call or text me to pick up something from the store, they need to be picked up from school or they just call to tell me about their day. I like hearing about their day, but just not during my gym time. 

well last week, my daughter called me to pick her up from her ballet class. My wife was in an accident, just a fender bender so she was fine, and was waiting on police and didn't know how long it was going to take. I told my daughter to either take an uber with my account and pay me back with her allowance money or walk home. The dance studio is only about a mile and a half or so from our house. I can jog that in under 20 minutes and I hate cardio.

she whined she didn't think it was fair to spend her money for this, really it's my money, and she said it would take too long to walk. I told that she doesn't respect my gym time, so I don't care that'll take her half an hour to walk home and hung up on her.

If there are any similarities, me and that person are friends with children the same age. I, (38F) have a son, (13M,) that has been boxing for four years now. Well, more or less training like a boxer. He's not allowed to spar or fight, but he can jump rope and shadow box and things like that. I'm good with his hobby, it keeps him out of trouble, considering I'm a single mom of two and can't always watch him. However, since he turned 13, he's been interested in competing. When he first started asking, I said no I am worried about brain damage. But there is a local competition that he said he wants to fight in. I told him I'd think about it, because I'm still worried about brain damage, but I've said no to him the other times, and I don't want to disappoint him. He's a great kid, and has been through hell when he was younger, so I feel like he deserves to do something he wants. I also don't want to hold him back, because he's told me he wants to be a professional boxer, so I don't want to seem like I'm crushing his dreams. But I'm worried about him getting seriously hurt. When you're judging me, please consider that I'm not a doctor and the most I know about boxing comes from the Rocky movies, which I've heard aren't accurate, so I don't know how quickly he'd get brain damage.

"AITA cause I won't leave my dog at home to work Very Cheaply for my aunt? I am a cleaning lady under the table. I've been helping my aunt (mom's sister) with her housework as of late. Been there like 3x. All 3 times, she's had no obvious issue with my dog (on the surface). But every time her son comes up after I leave, he's got his knickers in a bunch. 

Lucy (dog) is a mid-large (40lbs+) lab/pitbull mix. She's not mean, not stupidly hyper, listens well, but has BAD separation anxiety. It's so much that she will go nuts in her crate (which I have reinforced with hose clamps and lock with carabineers and clasps) after 5 minutes in another room. It's worse if I leave her alone in the house. She chews up stuff and knocks things on the floor and scatters small items about. Nothing really bad but it's a pain in my arse to clean it up. 

My cousin called me this evening and said no big dogs. After I've brought her out there. She's not gotten into anything or knocked anything over, but she did bump him when he opened a coffee cup and caused him to slop some on his $150 shoe. She just wanted attention and bumps with her nose when she wants yours. He yelled at me and said she shouldn't be there cause of that and  bitched about it since. 

Ever since the call, I can't seem to get hold of my aunt and I'm rather miffed. 

Who is really having an issue with Lucy, do you think? I can't crate her and leave her all day and I don't have anyone to watch her. If you have an issue with my dog, fine, but I can't work for you either. I'm not going to stress her in a crate all day to work for cheap for you, sorry.",0.48
"AITA For starting a fight over my husbands relationship with a coworker I (F,32) got mad at my husband (M, 31) after finding messages between him and his coworker (F, we’ll call her Sarah for confidentiality). A few weeks ago my husband came home and stated that he and a few coworkers were going target practicing after work in April. I felt a little uncomfortable about one of the coworkers (Sarah) as he had worked with her at a prior job and brought her over to this job. Later when I put our son to bed, husband handed over his phone to put on soft music to help our son fall asleep. Due to the gut feeling in my stomach, I went through his phone. I found messages between him and sarah that seemed like normal friend conversation, no flirting… until I scrolled up further. Sarah had just dumped her boyfriend and my husband said “well darn I was going to ask you to go target practicing after work but I forgot my pew pew.” They then worked out a time to go in April after work when she wouldn’t have her kids. This made me uncomfortable and I confronted my husband the next day. He claimed nothing is going on and they were going with other people, so not a date. 

Fast forward to Thursday night, I put our son to bed again and my husband gives up his phone for soft music to help our son sleep. I then go through his instagram messages where he and Sarah are messaging on 2 separate accounts. He compliments her on her eyes and she heart reacts his message and replies something like, “thanks I didn’t do anything different”. He heart reacts her message and says “idk they just really popped”. She hearts his message and leaves it at that. There are messages of funny videos and memes that they both heart react back and forth for close to 2 months. I also fine nudes of another woman that we both know that he’s had “hidden” since 2020.

"AITA for doing a quick spray of the perfume (for quality check) my friend asked me to buy for him? My friend asked me to buy a bottle of perfume for him because his credit card kept declining.I'm okay with helping him with this so I placed the order to be delivered to my place.

Today I received the package and quickly wanted to check if the shipment was good or not, so I did 1 spray to test the tip of the bottle. After that, I texted my friend to let him know the shipment was here and the bottle was in good condition and not damaged.He got very upset, cursed me, and told me that I was not allowed to open or touch the bottle at all.

To be noted, there was no communication or expectation about this at the beginning. If I had known how upset he would be, I wouldn't even care to open the shipping box at all.I told him the packaging was still intact, and I put everything back in the condition it arrived in, but now he kept cursing me and saying we should no longer be friends anymore.

Am I in the wrong here?

===============================

Edit Notes: Some of the comments were raising the question of why would I do such an intrusive thing. To be honest, like I mentioned in the OP, had I known how upset he would be or if I knew he would react like this, or if it was him directly placing the order using his credit card and had it shipped to my place, I wouldn't care to touch it at all...

But I had to use my credit card (without him paying back me yet), place the order myself, and have it shipped to my place, it was my natural thought to check everything I bought with my own money right away and deal with the retailer and initiate the returning process as quickly as I can. 

I had some bad luck purchasing items online & shipping before so these days I'm very careful and stingy about inspecting stuff that I bought online with my own money.  The order was under my name and since I did the whole process, I just want to make sure when I give him the bottle and request him to pay me back, he won't be coming back with any issues and put the blame on me or refuse or pay for it and I had to deal with it further. 

Another thing is the packaging box is a simple slide-in and slide-out type of box and there is no seal or anything of the type on the bottle, so it was very easy for the user to open, do a quick test spray, close and put everything back as if nothing had happened. If there were a seal or a stamp that I had to tear out, I would 100% text him and discuss it with him beforehand.",0.91
"AITA for saying my best friend settled for her husband because she was desperate? My bff Mia and I, both 32F, have known each other since we were 12 but only become close at university. We're different in many ways, like our views on marriage/kids. I never want to get married or have kids. Mia has had her wedding planned since she was 10 and always told everyone that she’ll be married by 27, travel for a year before having her first kid by the time she turned 30. Mia always tells me I’ll change my mind one day, she brings it up often and it's annoying.

Backstory: In 2015 Mia reconnected with an old classmate on FB, Pete, from our home country and they started dating long distance. Four months later she visited Pete and told everyone they were engaged. I asked her if she was sure and she said they were in love and can’t wait to be married so she can sponsor him and be together in the same country. I’m ashamed to say my first thought after she told me was that he was using her to get a green card. Their wedding was planned for summer 2016 but in early 2016 when it was revealed Pete had been cheating with his ex and she had DM’d Mia pics/screenshots of their texts because she found out about the wedding and felt guilty. Mia confronted him and they argued for hours with him admitting he was using her for a green card and would’ve divorced her later. In 2018, Mia again reconnected with another classmate, Jay. So Mia, Jay & Pete all went to primary school together and Jay & Pete are friends and Jay knows about what happened. Mia and Jay got married in our home country in late 2019 and I was her MOH. The immigration process got delayed because of Covid but Mia and Jay were finally reunited in 2021. Months later she announced she was pregnant and gave birth to a boy in Feb 2022. Everything was moving super fast but Mia was happy to be a mom at 30.

I recently started a new remote job that gives me a lot of freedom so I decided I would solo travel. I have a close group of friends and we do a weekly girl’s night. Mia gave birth again in October and haven’t been able to join us so last week she invited us to her house for dinner. During dinner a friend asked me about my travel plans (at this point only this friend knew). When the others found out they were happy for me. Mia was quiet and seemed annoyed. One friend said she was envious of me and wishes she could do the same. Mia scoffed and said anyone could do it if they were irresponsible. It got quiet and I just stared at Mia. I asked her what she meant; I said I'm spending my own money and I'll still be working so how am I irresponsible? She said I haven’t grown up yet and only wanted to have fun when I should be settling down. I told her I don’t want to settle down and just because I’m not married with kids doesn’t mean I’m not a grown up. She said my life is meaningless so I said “At least I’m not desperate enough to fly to a different country and marry the first guy I saw.”

"AITA for telling my (22M) that I'm beginning to lose respect for her (21F)? Sarah (22F) and I (22M) have been friends for about a year now and it's been fun. Thing about Sarah is that she's been in several different situationships throughout the year. She tells me about some of them from time to time but there's one she's particularly the most fond of who I'll refer to as Jake (21M).

Compared to most of her ""hoes"" (as she calls them), Jake is by far the most normal and actually treats her like a human. Based on the few interactions I've seen, he's clearly in love with her but Sarah has went out of her way to clarify on several different occasions that she doesn't feel the same way and never will. Which is ironic because she will consistently reciprocate his advances.

At times she can't stand him and he's the absolute worst usually over something minor like him not texting her much and sometimes he's the love of her life. This is the same person that refuses to share anything about herself to him because he's ""too dumb"" and just ""wouldn't get it"".

A month ago, she caught feelings and wanted to pursue something real with him (this isn't the first time). She went through with it this time and they made it official. I asked her if she's gotten rid of her roaster to which her response was ""wait, I have to block them?"". After some back and forth, she agreed.

A week into their relationship, one of her ""hoes"" hit her up saying that he's in love with her, how she's the one and he'd fly out to meet her and all that.

My reaction when she told me this was ""why tf is he still in your life?"", she says she doesn't know. I asked her if she mentioned she has a boyfriend to which she said ""no, and I'm not going to"". I was very disappointed because I've been cheated on twice in the past and I know how terrible it feels. Told her if she's not going to take the relationship seriously she should end it to which she agreed.

The next day, she tells Jake this weird lie about how her mental health cannot handle a relationship and they should just go back to the way things were and he agreed. I didn't care much because she did the right thing and ended it. Now they back to their usual antics, she texted me yesterday saying that Jake seems so uninterested in her that it's hurting her ego which rubbed me the wrong way but I just laughed it off and said he's probably just been busy.

Today she's went on about how he's so amazing and funny and I don't why but I basically snapped and told her that the way she treats Jake is fucked up and it's making me lose respect for her. I brought up all the above points and more. She brushed them off and said she doesn't think it's wrong and doesn't have to explain herself to me. Friends should hold each other accountable to which she said ""fine then we're not friends so shut up"".

"AITAH For Not Letting My Friend Dorm With My Roommate and I?? I (18f) and my roommate “stacy” (18f) just met a couple months ago, through an online roommate app. we got introduced because we will both be attending the same university in the fall. We started texting through the app and eventually started facetiming too. Stacy and I instantly clicked, I felt like I knew her for years and I can gather that she feels the same way. We even hang out in person time to time. About two months ago we decided to make it official and sign up as roommates. We got approved and got a suite. Now we just have to look for roommates.

My friend “cam” (18fm) has also been accepted into this university and was looking for roommates as well. This is where it started to get complicated. She thought that she could just dorm with my roommate and I. For context, she is a friend of a friend and she is also on my high school cheer team, so we are not super close. I told her “maybe” and I thought we would just leave it at that until she found someone else to room with. 

A couple weeks after that the university has a fair that Stacy, Cam and I all attended because it was a great opportunity to understand what life will be like out there. While being there Cam visited the resident life booth and was able to get them to add her to our dorm, without our permission. I really do not know how she did this, before this I thought you had to have all parties agree. Stacy and I were a little stocked but stayed polite, understanding that she was just excited to start in the fall. 

Stacy expressed to me later that night that she really didn’t want Cam to be our suitemate. She had felt no connection with Cam and is worried about what next year will look like. I reassure her that it cannot be that bad and we should just try it out. She agrees with me and we leave it at that. 

About a week later, Stacy hosts a little get together. She only invited me and a couple of friends but I asked her if I could invite Cam so the two of them can get to know each other better. This could hopefully change Stacy’s mind about Cam and we would be able to all room together with no issues the following year. Stacy agrees and I invite Cam.

 Not going to lie we did end up pretty intoxicated that night. Long story short, Cam pukes all over Stacy’s white carpet, leaving a drunk Stacy and I to clean it up while Cam was blackout drunk. The next morning Cam leaves early without helping clean her mess. On the carpet and in the bathtub. This made Stacy upset and told Cam over text that this will just not work out. Cam told me what Stacy said and I told her she’s my roommate and I have to respect her wishes. She felt betrayed and told me that she never wants to see my face again. Am I the asshole??

"AITA for not being overexcited about my best friend’s pregnancy? I (36f) have been friends with “Janice” (fake name, also 36f) since we were toddlers. We went to the same schools, college, etc, we are practically inseparable. It didn’t change after I got married and had kids.

Janice always struggled with fertility issues. She tried practically everything, IVFs, treatments, went to clinics overseas, but nothing worked. Eventually, she had a divorce because her ex wanted kids, and moved on.

Now, she called me, sounding absolutely joyful, and announced that she was pregnant. I congratulated her and told her that I’m incredibly happy that her dream will finally come true. I wasn’t overly excited, though, and that’s why.

1 - Janice is unemployed. She was never a working type, never worked a day, financially depending on her husband then ex as she sued him out of alimony payments.

2 - The baby’s father isn’t exactly the most reliable person. He’s 53, ex-convict, unemployed, on disability after he crashed his car blackout drunk.

3 - They live in his trailer off the ex’s alimony and her boyfriend’s disability benefits. They have enough money to get through, but it won’t be enough to feed a baby, not in this economy.

That’s why after I congratulated her, I asked her if she really wanted to have a child, considering the situation they’re in. Janice was furious, as if a switch flipped. She said that having a baby was her lifelong dream and that she and her boyfriend are thrilled to welcome a little one into their family. She said that I never understood her struggles and never could and that I could’ve been less practical and more excited when congratulating her, and also that she didn’t ask for an advice. I told Janice that I was always the more practical out of us two. She said that what I said still didn’t feel right in the moment like this one.

So, I wanted to continue my life as is, doing stuff with my gf after uni and going to museums on the weekend or just staying over at her place as always.

"AITA for not going to wife's event My wife (35f) and I (37m) have been married for 8 years. She has always been a big drinker but things have got really bad after a bunch of personal problems the last 3 years. 

I've tried to be there for her. But the drinking (and her behaviour) has got really bad. I've had to cut down hours at work and make personal sacrifices which have caused a lot of stress for me.

We have a son (6), and her behaviour affects him as well. Sometimes he gets up in the morning and his mom is still drunk from the night before. I have always tried my best to be there and to keep him insulated from it all. (The reason I've cut down my working hours is to ensure I'm always there for school pickups/drop-offs, in case my wife is unable to do it. I had to do this after a recent incident where she drove him to school while intoxicated).

All through these few years, I have tried to get her to stop drinking but in the end there isn’t much I can do if she doesn’t do it herself.

At the start of year, things were looking pretty bad with our marriage. We had a proper talk and she said she would change. There were a few things I asked specifically for her to stick to - the main one of these was not to drink-drive with our son in the car. Things have been good and she’s had fewer binges. 

This week, she had a major blowout:

**Thursday:** she drove our son to her friend's, drank 3 large glasses of wine, then drove back home. She brought two more bottles of wine home with her and drank through the night. ( I took over childcare once she came home and I realised she'd been drinking). 

**Friday:** BBQ with my family. I caught up with my sister, my son played with his cousins (who he hardly sees), and my wife continued drinking through the day.  

**Saturday:** she went ""shopping"" at 8am and came home at 9pm. Stank of alcohol and confessed she'd been in a pub all day. 

Then yesterday (Sunday) we were due to go to my wife's boss's wedding. She has been looking forward to this months. I don't know anyone from her work and I didn’t want to go (social anxiety issues) but of course I was prepared to go with her. 

After the blowout, however, I told her I wasn’t going. I could not face another day of watching her drink herself into a stupor - while at the same time taking responsibility for our son and then making small talk with people I didn't know, trying to keep a smile on my face and pretend that things are good. The thought of it nearly made my head explode. 

She tells me I'm the AH for cancelling on her and ruining her day and making her look stupid in front of her work friends. She says I wouldn't have done it if it was my family/friends and that I'm only doing it as revenge for being out all day on Saturday. I've thought about and I think there might be a bit of truth in there; however, in all honesty, I simply couldn't face the wedding and putting a brave face on things. She says I should have gone to the wedding regardless and we could sort it out after. I’m not sure.

"AITA: Unfunny April fools prank on my parents?  When I was 16 I almost died of alcohol poisoning and my parents found me half dead lying in the road.  Due in large part to them, I was super depressed at the time and in a bad place.  We never developed the communication skills to address our feelings and issues in our family before or since.  Fast forward 11 years, I moved away, excelled in college, got a masters degree, have begun my career and am doing very well with my mental health after lots of work and self care.  In spite of that, my parents frequently bring up my childhood and tease me about being such a bad kid who traumatized them…I feel it was the other way around and at this point I just try to laugh about it.

My parents came to visit this weekend and I thought it would be a funny April fools prank for my partner to wake them up in the middle of the night to find me lying in the road faking like I was  passed out.  I haven’t had issues with substances since those early days so I didn’t expect them to take it seriously.  I was hoping it would be funny and cathartic and allow us to bond via humor.  They had brought up the childhood situation earlier in the same day over lunch so the timing felt right.  Ha ha…😬

Anyway…they were pissed as fuck and are possibly packing their bags and leaving.

"AITA for not telling my wife I traded something?  I run a YT channel that uses single use items. Not that I throw them away but the nature of the items means I can't film with them again. 

Well, I'm part of a Discord for people who like the same items and I negotiated a trade with someone. I sent mine out and they sent theirs back. 

The package arrived on Friday, I brought it in, and my wife asked what it was. So I explained it to her. 

I was then accused of hiding things, not telling her every little thing I do, and lieing. The person I traded with was female but our conversation was truly innocuous and I even offered for my wife to read them.

"AITA for kicking out my best friend after 3 months of him paying no rent? In December of last year, my best friend from high school (M24) had been fired from his full-time job and only had a part-time job at the time. He was living with his parents and was supposedly fed up with his parents' strict rules and tired of the city he was living in. Hearing about this, I offered him a place to stay with me and recommended he apply to the state agency where I worked. I guided him through the hiring process and he was offered the job in the same department as me and ended up moving in.

When we initially talked about him moving in we were supposed to split rent and bills 50/50, but since I knew about his situation I told him he didn’t have to worry about paying anything until February. That being said While I wasn't expecting rent payments, I did expect him to help out around the house. He did buy groceries a couple of times but not once did he clean the house take out the trash or even offer to do anything for that matter. He would wash his dishes but never any that were already in the sink.

Fast forward to the beginning of February and I told him that things weren’t working out and that he would have to find somewhere else to stay by the end of the month. He ended up getting approved for a mortgage and asked me if he could stay until his move-in date which was March 15th. 
Despite me already being very unhappy in my own home I allowed him to stay until his move-in date. At this point we weren’t even speaking to each other at home or work. 

Fast forward to March and his move-in date got pushed back again then again. At this point, it’s March 24th and I could no longer stand him being there so I texted him that he had a week to move out and that I needed his key. The only thing he texted me back was ‘understandable, thank you’ that same day. When I got home on March 26th I saw he left his key and had moved all his things out his room. Now when I see him at work he won't speak to me or even look at me…AITA?",0.09
"WIBTA if I told my BF's friend to stop asking him for money? My boyfriend keeps sending his ""friend"" money every month, anywhere from $10 to $50 because they are unable to budget appropriately. This month it was because ""he didn't have the gas to go to work"". Mind you my boyfriend is his boss. I don't know anyone that would ask their boss for money, and he ends up disobeying and disrespecting my BF at work all the time by not listening and telling him how the job should be done. 

I am thinking about reaching out to his wife since she's the one that keeps reaching out to my BF, and asking her to stop asking for money. My BF won't do it and I'm fed up with them using him. We have our own bills to worry about, $50 is a lot now a days and I don't feel like being a personal piggy bank for people. At the end of the day if my BF is short on money I'm the one that has to cover the shortfall so I'm the one that's also feeling the repercussions of their budgeting failure. ",0.5
"AITA for finally telling my BF the truth about why I'm a crazy b and why we don't f So I 25f and my 27m bf have been together for 6 years, and we've been going through a rough patch for the past couple of months, both in regards to our relationship and work / life wise. Today all hell broke loose, and I'd really like to know if I am the AH on the basis of how shit went down.

For some context (skip this if you can't be fed): my bf is the kind of person who HAS to work to stay sane, mostly because of him having to just figure shit out all by himself from a very young age. He has high aspirations in life, and I love that about him, since his mindset inspired me. Obviously, it is not easy to make money, go to uni and all that during all the crazy times we've gone through, so we've both been broke and leaning on each other for support at times. So when I was broke for a couple of months, I'd do the grocery shopping, the cleaning and the planning because I had the time. This is the kind of relationship I want, since I want to be able to provide / support when needed so that I can lean on his support when I need it. And yes, we've decided on going 50/50 on everything, but as we know, that rarely TRULY means 50/50... Also one more relevant thing: we have a rescued cat (3m, my baby).

Our standard of cleanliness / hygiene have drastically changed during the years. Nowadays I find a dirty house to be quite the stressor, because I work from home a lot of the time. I did not use to find a mess as disturbing as I do now, but I would consistently be the cleanlier one in the relationship and I've been very vocal about it. It's just my personality to be. I've also had a lot of compassion towards my bf in regards of this issue, because of the fact that he had to survive by himself since such a young age. 

So, to the actual problem: the beginning of the catastrophe that was today happened, when my bf decided to quit his job (>1 yr ago). The job was a disaster, and I fully support and understand why he left. All valid and fine for me, since he had saved up a nice amount of money before quitting the job. The first couple of months went completely fine, he'd search for jobs, but we all know what the job market is like nowadays. This slowly lead to me being the sole provider financially + the main cleaner. Now he has had a job (which he doesn't really like) for 3 weeks. 

Today I found our cat's litter all over the floor because he had not closed the lid properly. I told him about the issue and got a 'chill, it's my free day' as an answer and I absolutely flew off the rails. I told him how I acted when I was broke vs. him, which only made him more defensive and angry. I ended up telling him that it's actually his entitled, unorganised, unhygienic, arrogant, cheeseball smelling breath ass who makes me into the crazy b I am and that I find him unattractive and don't want to f when he's like this. I can tell you I was the loud one, even though he started the yelling, and I wasn't very nice with my words either. Is this valid? Am I  a 50/50 slave?

"AITA for getting sick of my wife grieving her ex-bf Last week my (m35) wife (f40) got news her ex-boyfriend had passed away unexpectedly. She was understandably shocked and upset as they were together for ten years. She cried a lot, we spoke about him and she vented all her feelings. He never treated her well. They’ve been no contact for over 15 years. 

I expected her to be upset and sad, it’s totally normal especially someone dying totally out of the blue at a relatively young age. I tried to be supportive as best I could. She said some things that bruised my ego a little (how handsome, intelligent and wealthy he was back in the day) but I just sucked it up and said nothing cos this isn’t my moment, it’s hers. 

However she’s been crying over him everyday. Saying things like she doesn’t know why she’s so upset, but things don’t feel the same now and stuff like that. If I’m honest it’s starting to grate on me. She fully admits he treated her like dirt, she was the one who left him, we have a very strong and healthy marriage now, and they’ve not even exchanged a text in 15 years. Do I just give her more time and keep being supportive? Am I an asshole for not caring about his death in the slightest? Am I being selfish by just wishing she’d get over it? ",0.26
"AITA for kissing and cuddeling a girl who visited my friend? AITA and am a bad friend? 
This weekend, I visited a friend who had a girl visit him. They both were in New Zealand 6 Years ago during a exchange year. They did not have any contact. Now she stays one year working in a close country to mine. He invited her to spend four days here. Unfortunately, the weather was terrible, and she was „sick“ so they basically were just staying at his place even do she would have been fine with going out. She was also bored af as she told me. My friend and I had previously planned to go out for drinks on one of these days, and she joined us.

As the evening progressed, we ended up having a great connection, and after my friend decided to head home early (he said that he did not feel well), she and I continued our night out. We had already shared a kiss when my friend went home, and when I offered for her to stay at my place, she agreed. My friend seemed okay with the arrangement when I explained it to him, and he left. She and I spent the night cuddling and kissing but didn't take it further. I found myself developing actual good feeling for her not just like one night stands. she was incredibly sweet, and we clicked instantly, sharing a good and open connection from the start. She said for her it was the same.

The next morning, i had to help my sister move, she asked me of she could come too bc she did not want go back to his place (i guess she was just too bored). i had to decline because of my friend. So later that day my friend called me, upset, claiming I had behaved terribly. He revealed that he had tried to kiss her a few days before meeting me, which made her uncomfortable, and she suggested they remain just friends. (fyi he is a virign) I hadn't told him about us kissing, only that she stayed over, that she stayed over made him question our friendship. I now it was bad from me to lie to him but i also dont want to loose that friendship.

"AITA for cursing a guy out to get his dog?  I have a small 8 pound dog who triggers the prey instinct in a lot of bigger dogs because of her size. We've had both leashed and unleashed dogs lunge for her while on our walks. For that reason, I am very cautious and aware of my surroundings when I walk her. Today, we took our usual route around the neighborhood when a man in his driveway opened the trunk of his SUV to let out his large  (Pit mix?) dog. The dog runs out before the man could grab his leash and starts sprinting towards my dog. I was able to pick her up before it reached her but I was obviously still startled and panickedly shouted, ""GET YOUR FUCKING DOG!!!"" The owner grabs his dog and starts cussing me out and saying, ""FUCK YOU! I was right fucking there, you didn't need to say that shit you fucking asshole. It was two seconds so fuck you!!!"" I was shocked at his reaction because I really thought the normal response would've been to apologize. Also, while he was cussing me out his dog was still lunging and trying to get away from him to attack my dog. I thought the dude was obviously an unhinged asshole but there were other neighbors standing outside and they gave ME dirty looks so AITA???",0.07
"AITA for preferring to travel around my spouse's period? I (31m) and my spouse (32f) were recently planning a trip to go see a Detroit Tigers game about 7 hours from where we live. I feel some important context for my side of this disagreement is that we have 3 kids, (1F, 3M, and 6M) and finding time to be together intimately can be a challenge. One thing we do however, perhaps 2 to 3 times a year, is find an event that we want to go to, get the in-laws to watch the kids, and do a 1 night hotel stay. If I'm being honest, I don't really care about baseball, and I'm much more of a homebody and I'd be just as happy having the in laws take the kids and stay at home and have a break for the night, however my wife very much prefers to go and do things like baseball games, concerts, or other events.

The part where where I might be an asshole is last night we were planning our trip to go see a Detroit Tigers game and we were picking which weekend we wanted to go. My wife suggested that we go April 27th, get a hotel that night, and return the 28th. I however wanted to go either early April or around mid May. She thought it was odd that I expressed this preference, asking if it was because the Tigers were playing a specific team that I'd like to see, but I told her that I'd sooner not go during her time of the month as my favorite part of the trip is hotel sex. I am still kicking myself for not being a bit more tactful with my explanation but, while we've never discussed it point blank, I assumed she would realize that's one of my primary motivators. 

Now she is pissed off at me and doesn't want to go on the trip anymore and I'm afraid if I try to explain to defend myself to her that I'll just come off more skeevy. However, I am definitely too close to this situation and would appreciate some outside perspective. So AITA?",0.14

She demanded that I tell her who, bc she was planning on bringing him (sold out). I said no. This is the second time, and I consider myself someone who gives a few chances, but then I am done. I just despise this guy. He's totally suspish, I know she can do better. I told her that I gave her plenty of time to figure something else out, and IMO she should have bought him a ticket initially.

"AITA for not standing up for my daughter? A little bit of background: in middle school my daughter (16f) was bullied by one of the girls. The girl is the stereotypical mean cheerleader, who is insanely popular for some reason. I’ll refer to her as Marcie (17f). It became so bad I had to intervene, but luckily the situation got resolved.

Fast forward to high school, this year their class had a new girl. Her family immigrated from the UK. I’ll refer to her as Janie (16f). Janie kept to herself for the most part and wasn’t really interested in talking to anyone. My daughter has her own friend circle, to be honest their school is pretty cliquey, everyone is keeping to their small groups.

My daughter and her friends started picking at Janie. It got out of hand pretty quickly to the point there were xenophobic slurs thrown and a video of my daughter mocking Janie’s accent and culture was made and shared. I was horrified. I had a very serious conversation with my daughter and grounded her for that. I also had a very long and shameful talk with Janie’s mother. She is a proper British lady and I felt humiliated confessing to her that my daughter is a disgusting bully.

Turns out, Marcie is friends with Janie. When the video leaked, Marcie doubled down on the bullying. She turned half the school against my daughter and her friends. My daughter is now known as “the racist” and Marcie made it clear that she would make sure to make my daughter’s life a living hell. Hell, half the town now knows that my daughter is a xenophobe. She posted an apology video, but it didn’t really help.

My daughter came home in tears. She asked me to stand up for her like I did in middle school. I don’t want to. First, I think that she should get a taste of her own medicine. She was extremely xenophobic towards another girl who wasn’t even talking to her. Second, I don’t want to deal with Marcie’s mom any longer. I contacted her and all I got was “I’ll talk to Marcie alright, but don’t expect me to stand up for an open racist”. Marcie’s mom is friends with Janie’s mom, so her reaction is understandable.

Now my daughter is calling me an asshole for not standing up for her. My husband thinks she learned her lesson and that I should be more protective of her. I’m now thinking that my behavior is assholish.",0.56
"AITA for refusing to sleep on a single mattress on the floor and leaving two friends in an uncomfortable situation?  My group of friends and I decided to travel during Easter week. In total we are 7 people, 3 couples and me. 

When we considered this trip (3 months before), a couple, Logan and James (both 30ish) said they wouldn't go, so we looked for a house with 3 bedrooms and not 4 as usual. I have no problems with them btw. 

With 3 weeks left until the trip, they said they would like to go, we even tried looking for other houses, but the good ones were already occupied and the rest were bad. We told them that it only has three rooms, but it is possible to go with 7 people (I checked with the host and he said that 8 people can sleep in the house). It would be a 4 day trip. 


When we arrived at the house, there were 3 bedrooms as expected, a single mattress and a sofa. We were deciding who would sleep where and when I saw that James and Logan would have a room, I made it very clear that I would sleep in a room with a bed not on the floor. 

They started saying that they were a couple and they didn't have a double mattress for them, so I was being irrational in wanting to have a double bed when I don't need.

 I replied that I didn't take the road for 6 hours to sleep, wake up with back pain and I paid to have a room, but that one of them is welcome to sleep with me in the bed, I don't care.

They said they paid more than me, so they also have the right to a room (they didn't pay, they just paid for each one). 

I agreed, but they confirmed it was only 3 weeks before, so that's what they got and I didn't want to sleep on the floor. 

In the end, I kept my ground and James slept on the mattress and Logan on the couch. 

The trip was good, apart from some snide comment or other saying that I was being incoherent and that I could sleep on the mattress peacefully. The rest of us remained neutral, taking advantage of the discussion to entertain themselves. 

I don't think I was wrong here, they had the chance to have a room to themselves. but they refused and then went back, I may have paid ""less"", but I paid for a room just like the other two couples and if they arrived later, I don't think they necessarily should have the double bed (aka room) to my disadvantage .

I still paid my shit but my ex had to pay more of the rent. We agreed she pay more of the rent just cause with unemployment I could barely afford to live.

"AITA for unfollowing my ""potential"" sister-in law on Instagram I (23F) have been with my fiance (23M) for about 7 years (high-school sweethearts) and have known his family including his older brother (27M) for close to a decade. In the last 1-2 years, my fiance's brother (Jim) has gotten a new girlfriend  (Jenny) who neither my fiance (Dan) or I have really gotten close with over that time span.We also moved (Dan and I) even farther from their family and therefore from Jim and Jenny. 

We probably talk to Jim about almost everyday as us three (along with  friends) play video games together online. Neither Dan or I are close to Jenny and it's always been a pretty surface level relationship where we ask how she's doing when we talk to Jim sometimes and of course invite her to come with him to visit, go on trips, etc. I've always been nice and we have never really talked except those superficial conversations. We probably text once every 6 months and that's only for discussing a present.

Recently since Jim and her have gotten together, he's gained a lot of weight. Although I'm ""practically family"" I don't feel comfortable bringing up weight to him as I've never had an issue with my weigh. It's not just a few pounds. It's probably (no exaggeration) close to a hundred. He was in great shape before they got together and from what he's said, she loves to eat out and doesn't cook or clean at all. She's also bigger, but not close in comparison. 

I was scrolling through Instagram and I saw Jenny had posted a photo of them two and captioned it something along the lines of ""Wouldn't want to look like a couple that meal preps with anyone else,"" which instantly made me think of weight. She's ok to post whatever she wants, but it made me uncomfy since I'm already worried about his weight. I just went to unfollow her since we aren't really close anyways and I don't like seeing her posts. 

A month passes and Dan gets a text from his brother Jim about why I unfollowed Jenny. Dan told him, Jim didn't get it, saying that Jenny's really hurt by my actions. I was a bit confused why she didn't just text me instead, but I get going to your partner. A few days pass and Jim calls Dan, saying that Jenny is really upset about it and he's on her side, implying that I should apologize for unfollowing her. 

Then Jenny texts Dan, asking if them two are alright. He's nice about it and just says that he wants everyone to be happy. I thought this was the end of it until I get a huge text from her days later. In her text, she accuses me of having an ""outward opinion"" on their weights (including hers?) and says I misunderstood and took it out of proportion. Along with that, she tells me their weight none of my business and that it hurt her that I unfollowed her without talking to her about the post. It was a pretty petty and passive aggressive message. At the end she said that I was totally wrong for doing that (which it's just instagram?) and that as future family she thinks we should have love for each other (they're also not engaged?).

One of these friends moved in this year and we’ll call her Kate (22). I didn’t know Kate very well as she was a friend of one of my housemates but we had a space and she needed a house, so it seemed perfect.

When Kate first moved in, we got on very well and other people in the house started to think there was something romantic going on between us. I did find her attractive but also liked Jessie. Jessie eventually reciprocated the feelings and we have now dated for around three months.

On Saturday, we all went out to a bar and one question that popped up was what colour people look best in. When someone asked about Kate, I immediately said “orange” without a second thought. Everyone kinda looked a bit weird about it, then just laughed. I just said it’s a colour that suits her and one she wears often.

When we got home, Jess was really upset with me. She said it was disrespectful to not say anything about her and to say that publicly about Kate when people had already had suspicions about us. I apologised but also said I meant nothing by it and was just being friendly.

The issue is the foster dad “Jim” scares the living daylights out of me. I won’t even go into the living conditions because while they’re unacceptable to me I may be looking at it with a degree of privilege. But Jim is, for starters, a creep. He has been told more than once by my husband to back off from me (his other kids (teens) are also extremely creepy). He frequently seems under the influence, though I’ve never seen him drink. I don’t like how he talks to my daughter. I don’t like how his wife just ignores the way he acts. My husband always comes with me when we go over there because I’m so anxious. 

Recently, my husband’s business has expanded which has him travelling more for work. Because of his irregular schedule he won’t be able to come on the visits with me all the time anymore. He’d maybe be able to manage one a month but even that’s not for sure. I’m not comfortable going over there on my own, so we are thinking we will have to reduce the visits to weekends he can be there, even though that’s less frequent. 

I’m getting pushback from my daughter’s bio family (her mom’s side), saying that I’m being crazy and prejudiced by being too “snobbish” to go there on my own and that’s the girls’ relationship will suffer. I don’t want the girls to drift but at the same time I genuinely don’t feel safe going there alone. 

Wibta for going ahead with reducing the visits? ",0.35
"AITA babysitting for free? AITA: Earlier this year was my birthday and my in laws picked a fight that they wouldn’t attend my birthday due to the presence of someone else that they didn’t like attending my birthday. It had nothing to do with me. We are all in our 30s, I felt it was childish so I ignored it and my sister and brother in law just did not attend my birthday or even reach out to me on my birthday. We didn’t speak for weeks until one day my sister shows up at my house with my nephew without warning to hangout. I was annoyed because I felt like she used her son just to get in my good graces because she knew I wouldn’t talk about everything in front of him and would let it go. I ended up saying something to her about not saying happy birthday and she said she simply forgot but she thought she did. Annoying. I let it go. Before leaving, she asked if I could watch him for spring break and I said I could help but probably not all of the days. I let her know a week later I could only do these specific dates. She said OK. I have never had an issue watching him here and there. He is generally a really good kid with a great attitude but that wasn’t the case this time. 

Fast forward to spring break, I ended up having their son the ENTIRE week from 8am-6pm including the days I said I was unavailable. On the days I said I would watch him I planned fun things but on the other days, that I said I couldn’t, I had to cancel my existing plans to essentially stay imprisoned in my own home because my nephew refused to leave the house and was pouting due to missing his parents. He was being a brat and said he would only go to places if I bought him a toy. I tried to offer fun activities to him but he just wanted to play on his phone and watch tv. I also worked on these days as I have a flexible job and can work from home. I had to come up with ways to entertain him and get my own things done but couldn’t even go to the grocery store because he was in a funk and refused to do anything or leave the house unless it was a bribe. I couldn’t get him to go to the park, go for a walk, go ride a bike, the public pool, play a board game… nothing. He just turned 10. I cooked him 3 meals every day, Paid for activities and my sister didn’t offer me even a penny for my time. I could tell my nephew felt like he was dumped on me and no matter what I did I couldn’t fix it. I was relieved the week was over as it was just so stressful. 

Fast forward to the week after spring break, I am awoken on the following Monday by my sister and nephew, dropping him off AGAIN, this time on a day not at all discussed, ever. She said sorry I thought you knew. I told her I couldn’t watch him and her response was that they were already here and she has to go. I am furious. My parents think I am over reacting. My sister said She said she knows my husband and I do well and we should be happy to spend money on our nephew since we don’t have our own kids. I feel used. Am I the asshole?",0.02
"AITA for asking my FIL to not introduce new girlfriends to my children? I (33F) have two daughters, 7 and 3 years old. My FIL (around 55) has been divorced for about 7 years. He is constantly bringing new girlfriends around to family events, my daughter's sports/school events, holidays, etc. without first introducing myself and my husband. These relationships don't typically last long. Some have been 6+ months, most less. One relationship lasted about a yr. and a half. There have been roughly 7-9 girls he's brought around since his divorce 7 years ago. Upon finding out about a new woman we asked him not to introduce her to our daughters and not bring her to our daughters' events until they had been dating a number of months (6 months is preferable) which he got very offended about, but ultimately he obliged. He did end up bringing her around the family shortly after and with no surprise just a few months later the relationship was over. 

&#x200B;

FIL has a tendency to act different when girlfriends are around. When he is fully single he doesn't come around. Barely visits the girls, always out partying. Constantly says he's broke, but always spending money on alcohol and going to bars with friends. He will go in with family members on birthday and holiday gifts so it looks like he got them something, but he never actually pays his share. When he has a girlfriend, he is constantly visiting, telling the girls to say how great of a grandfather he is, buying gifts for them and putting on a show of ""look how great I am"". It feels like he's using my daughters to look good for the girlfriends. 

&#x200B;

This week my daughter had a dance competition. My FIL brought yet another new girlfriend to the competition without mine or my husband's knowledge. We had no knowledge of a new girlfriend thus we did not meet her prior to this event. She was then at our family Easter two days later. Myself, my husband, SIL, BIL, everyone is fed up with the girlfriends and constantly bringing new ones around. They couldn't have been dating more than 2 weeks at this point. We all have taken a stance to ignore them. While it's not her fault, we see it as his actions have consequences and sometimes consequences affect other people. Grandma (FIL mother - my grandmother in law) tends to baby FIL and thus she doesn't have a problem and often defends him. She also babysits my children while I work and hosts many of the family gatherings. She is upset with our behavior and feels we are being too ""harsh"" on FIL. FIL is also upset with all of us. 

&#x200B;

So, are we the assholes for asking FIL not to bring new girls around until they've been dating at least 6 months? Also, are we the assholes for being upset and ignoring FIL and new girlfriend? How do we get this to stop? My oldest daughter's birthday is coming up and new girlfriend will not be invited. Also, I don't want her attending upcoming school events. I don't feel comfortable with strangers knowing where my daughters attend school, where they attend sports activities, where they are while my husband and I work, etc. ",0.04

"AITA for refusing to help my dad's wife with their baby and saying I am not her helper? Dad and I (17M) do not have a good relationship. When my mom was sick with cancer my dad was out cheating on her and he left me to take care of my younger siblings (12F and 11M). He even let me catch him with two different women during that time and my mom was on hospice so it was really difficult not to say anything but I was so overwhelmed and scared that saying the wrong thing would take her from us sooner. This was 4 years ago and I never forgave him for what he put me through. I told him before that I never want to be like him when I grow up and he's no role model for me. I also called him a failure as a husband and a father. He was pissed at being called a failure as a father. But when his three kids needed him the most he wasn't there, instead he was screwing women on the side. He also said he loved my mom and never wanted me to say he was all bad as her husband. I said I found it so hard to believe and he would never convince me he actually loved her.

I was still mostly in charge after mom died but eventually my siblings started to pick up some skills so I wasn't basically doing it all. It really helped and made us regular siblings again instead of me being almost a dad. But it was also tough because they're really young and I hated that they were forced to grow up so fast. Losing mom did that anyway.

Dad met someone a couple of years ago and he introduced her to us last year and it took only a few weeks for her to move in. Then suddenly she's pregnant and they race to get married. My dad's wife tried to involve my siblings and me in her pregnancy excitement but I wasn't excited and I don't think they were either. I'm pretty sure we all avoided her as much as we could.

The baby was born in December and she has been reaching out to me to help pretty often. But I don't help her. I check in on my siblings where I can but other than that I focus on me. I know biologically that baby is my half sibling but I don't care. I don't see them as a sibling and I'm not planning to bond with them or keep them in my life once I'm in college. I won't speak to dad either. Just my siblings.

Recently dad's wife has been pressing more for my help and the other day she asked me why I could be such a great big brother to my younger siblings but I have never even held her baby or cooed over her baby. She told me she sees me do so much for my siblings and knows I was the person who helped them through when mom was sick and then when she died. She told me she figured I would want to be the same for her baby. I told her it wasn't my job to help and to get her husband to help if she needed it. She told me she wanted her baby to be accepted and none of us had accepted the baby yet. None of us had interacted with the baby yet. She said it's not fair and she needs help. I told her I'm  not her helper and she needs to hire someone if she wants the help, or again, get dad. But I won't be doing anything for her or her baby. She called me disgusting.

"AITA for getting mad at someone who backed out of a personal business deal? I’m in the process of selling my 2005 Chevy Impala and had it posted on FB marketplace. It’s in decent shape with only 80k miles and no rust, just had some clearcoat peeling and a few other small cosmetic issues. I was only asking $4400, and had a guy and his elderly father show up to look at the car. After they take their time looking around it they seem to like it and offer me 4k I agree and shake both their hands. Being it was Sunday and the banks were closed we agreed to meet on Monday and he’d pay me in full. I made sure to verbally explain this several times and he agreed multiple times. We shook hands on it and left, I then mark the car as sold and move my schedule around to be able to finalize the deal. Now Monday rolls around and he sent me a text saying that he no longer wants it. I have his number and I call him albeit with a bit of an attitude and ask him to explain himself as I’d thought his word meant something especially after he looked me in the eye and shook hands on it. He kinda rambled a bit about how his plans had changed and his kid probably didn’t want it, couldn’t really get a straight answer out of him. Guess my idea of how business deals should work out are a bit jaded. Kinda mad right now but not sure if my reaction to this wasn’t warranted. Either way just wanted to vent on here…",0.85
"AITA for not moving out of the way for a runner  Son thought I should post here because we were discussing and were really not sure who TA is here…

Every morning after walking my dog, I have to return home on a narrow sidewalk to get back to my house. A lot of runners use this path in the early morning as well.

Usually, I will step off the sidewalk, into the grass, and move over for these people. This morning i decided to hold my ground and not step off, just to see if he’d move around me. He saw us coming and we locked eyes but he chose to run very closely beside me. 

My dog turned to look at him because he was very close and the man backed off as if disgusted or something with me or my dog. 

My dog is medium sized and I’m likely  20 years older than this. 

I think I could be the AH because my dog could have jumped on him if he wanted to and I wouldn’t have had much time to get to stop him, given how close we were since he chose not to move over when I didn’t.

"WIBTA for missing my best friends brother’s funeral? My long-time best friend’s sister recently died. I did not know her. 

I sent food to the family several times both before and after the death (which was expected although the decline was rapid), watered my friend’s plants, cleaned, and brought in mail while she was away, and left flowers. I’ve been checking in and sending words of support daily.  

The funeral has been scheduled for a bit over a month after her passing. It would be a significant and complicated trip requiring at least 2 days, but usually I would do it. There is, however, a catch: it’s scheduled for the day after I am moving to a new house, the first home I’ve ever owned. 

Unfortunately, I can’t change the move date because of childcare issues. I don’t feel right leaving my husband to fend for himself with an infant in a house full of boxes, and I want to be part of settling into our first home together. WIBTA if I miss the funeral?

"AITA for feeling deceived by my friend's mum's hotel discount? Here's the situation: My friend's mum has a fantastic staff discount at a hotel chain. Recently, my wife and I suggested that we all spend a night at a hotel together to enjoy some quality time. My friend arranged it with her mum, who quoted us £60 per person for the stay. We went ahead with the booking and spent the night at the hotel.  
Upon checkout, I decided to verify the room rate directly with the hotel, only to find out that it was actually £25 per person instead of the £60 we were told. When I confronted my friend, she revealed that her mum adds a commission, hence the higher price. I was upset because this detail wasn't disclosed to us, and we were led to believe we were benefiting from a staff rate.

"AITA for not supporting my boyfriend??  For context, my boyfriend (M35) has a hard past with his parents (absent, alcoholic and lack of stability). 

This Easter Sunday, we had a beautiful day!! We went dirt biking and ranger rides with his friend. The day ended later than expected and we rushed to our separate homes to shower for Easter Dinner with his parents. 

As he was dropping me off (around 5:00), I told him to txt his parents. Saying we would be over around 6 for dinner. 

I pick him up and arrive around 6:10. He did NOT tell them when we were arriving. As arriving his parents, they already started dinner. 

 This beautiful risotto with morel mushrooms, shrimp salad, cheese plate, wine,  Easter Eggs and chocolate scattered across the table. BUT hasn’t put the  Prime Ribs in yet, as they didn’t know when we were coming.

Small talk started, my BF started feeling sick and hungry so he wasn’t contributing much. He ate the cheese plate and his mom served him hot tea and offered Tylenol. His parents and I (F24) have VERY little in common so conversation is hard. 

Around 7:30 we sit for the appetizer, aka shrimp salad. As we wrap up the appetizer, my BF takes my plate and says we are leaving. I express my appreciation, and we left instantly.

We start driving to the grocery store (to get him some soup) and he is very upset. He “couldn’t continue to sit there and listen to their version of his childhood”.  I was SILENT. 

We go to the grocery store and they were closed. Dairy Queen was our next best option.
As we are in line, he changed his order 17 times and was getting mad at me for having judgemental eyes. As he constantly complained that he “just wanted to be fed, he didn’t have time to sit there for hours, waiting for the food to be ready”. Once again, I was SILENT. 

At this moment, all I could think about;  is how I wish my parents knew me enough to make me my favourite meal. That I was hungry and tired from our long day of adventure. I thought he was acting like a child for not waiting an extra 30 minutes to get fed. Since I had nothing nice to say, I shut the fuck up. 

Shortly after we arrive back at his house, he started telling me I only like him when he spends money on me (aka buying me lunch and snacks when we went dirt biking). Tell me that I’m not supporting him, blah blah blah. 

After a couple of tears, I finally told him my opinion. That, I never had the privilege of being able to walk away when I’m upset. That, all of these could have been resolved if he would’ve told them when we were arriving.  That, he was acting like a brat for not being fed when he wanted to be. 

Afterwards, I gave him a hug and told him “I’m sorry if you didn’t feel supported. I didn’t mean to come off that way, I just had nothing nice to say and figured you needed to vent”. After that, we chilled out and watched a movie. He passed out on the couch and I passed out on the floor cuddling the dogs. (Not complaining that was my own choice)

"AITA for Not Accepting an ""Apology"" Gift That Seemed...Racist? My husband and I were at his family's annual giant egg hunt. We're talking 300-400 people, friends, family, the works. Nora, my husband's ex, known for never missing a beat to mention her Irish heritage and for being, let's just say, overly enthusiastic about giving kids Easter gifts.

This year, she gives my daughter, the only biracial child (I'm Black, my husband's White), a monkey stuffed animal. Meanwhile, every other kid is getting bunnies, ducks, chicks, you name it. Except one kid who got a monkey because he asked. Everyone knows she always tries to play Santa Claus at Easter, but this felt off.

My husband, bless his soul, confronts Nora, asking why our daughter got the monkey. Nora, wide-eyed, pulls the ""You don't think I'm racist, do you?"" act, even turning to me for the first time ever, looking for sympathy or validation, I guess.

I was like, ""Why are you crying? You're the one who gave my daughter a monkey."" And in the midst of this, Nora has the audacity to tell me I should be grateful my daughter got anything at all. That's when I lost it. ""If you actually cared about her, you wouldn't have been so thoughtless with your gift choice.""

Nora then turns this into a sob story about how she can't have children, calling us selfish, right in the middle of this drama. My father-in-law, who's usually the embodiment of chill, steps in and tells Nora she's acting like a lunatic and needs to leave.

But Nora didn't stop there. She left, alright, but not before calling me every name under the sun as she's escorted out by my husband and his dad. She started screaming at me that I’m a terrible mother! And basically, making a scene.

Later, she messaged my husband, trying to guilt-trip him about choosing me over her. His response? ""I definitely didn't make a mistake marrying my wife.""

The next day, Nora launches a social media post claiming she's the victim of a racist accusation. She tried to paint herself as this angel who was just trying to give out cute gifts but was ""yelled at and kicked out.""

She even started harassing me over Facebook Messenger, calling me names, to the point where I had to block her. But the friend requests and strange messages kept coming.

So, Reddit, AITA for standing my ground and refusing to accept what I saw as a racially insensitive gift? Am I overreacting? Maybe I came off to headstrong.

"WIBTA if I called off a party my roommates are planning? I (20F) live with 3 other roommates (all 20F). I turn 21 in two weeks, and the week after my birthday my roommates want to host a party. This would not be a birthday party, as I have no interest in having my birthday celebrated that way.

We've thrown a handful of parties before and they were all great; I'm not a huge party person so I never had the best times but my roommates always have a blast and everyone who attends also talks about how great our party was. Each time we host it seems to be a little bit bigger than the last one, and I've been starting to worry about getting a noise complaint.

This was never a big deal to me when we were all 20, but now knowing that I'm going to be 21 when we have this party makes me uneasy, because I know if things are to go wrong I'll be the one facing major consequences.

However, I gave my roommates the okay to host it a couple weeks ago. I didn't want to be a party pooper and wasn't really thinking too much about the risk vs reward. Now that I've given it a fair amount of thought I'm feeling pretty bad about it. I want to tell my roommates and ask if we could cancel, but I feel wrong to go back on my word, especially because they've already started telling people about it, and one of my roommates is already planning for their partner to come. I considered just going somewhere for the night or locking myself in my room and having nothing to do with it, but honestly neither of those options are preferable to me.

"WIBTAH if I dropped out of my best friend’s wedding? I’ve known Lily since high school, we’re all mid-late 20’s. I met my partner Dom in 2018, and she started dating his best friend Carl 4ish years later. They got engaged within a year, their wedding is at the end of this year. I’m a bridesmaid. Dom is best man.

A few weeks ago I went to hang with Lily, and then we decided to hang out all four of us at my place. Carl asked if I knew our mutual friend’s big secret, I didn’t. He and Lily were acting like it was a big deal, even though I’m not close with this friend. Carl said Dom didn’t know yet so he’d tell us once we got to my place. 

I made a joke that Lily and I were about to be alone for the drive, and Carl looks at her with a serious face and says “I will be upset with you if you tell her without me.” The last thing Lily said (jokingly) before we left was “if you tell him before we get there I’ll be so mad.” She respected his wishes and didn’t tell me, which I respected.

When we got to my place, we ran in and said he had to tell me now. He gave us fake news first, and then revealed the actual news was that our friend was in a relationship. I didn’t get why that was a big deal but figured it was news to Dom, who is way closer with this friend.

I later found out Carl told Dom weeks ago. Carl also told Dom before we got there that it was a surprise to both me and Lily, and tried to get him to make a big show of telling us. I do get easily triggered by being left out or feeling like I’m being singled out, so maybe I’m just being sensitive, idk.

A week later, Lily and I were talking about an altercation I had with Carl’s mom in the beginning. We used to hang in Carl’s mom’s basement a lot, at least once a week. One day we were hanging out and his mom came home and went absolutely postal immediately upon walking in the front door.

She was yelling upstairs about how I was “indecent in her home” and how she was angry I was there. It doesn’t make sense here because it didn’t make sense then, the last time we saw each other she was asking when Dom was going to propose. I didn’t realize she was talking about me until Carl told us. I stayed in the basement with our friends until I heard her telling Carl she was calling 911 and we all ran out. When we passed her on the stairs she was on the phone with the police, telling them I had been asked to leave multiple times and was refusing.

Apparently she’s known for this. I stopped going over, but Dom and the rest of our friends continued for around a year after that.

During the hangout with Lily, she said his mom told her I made fun of their home and that’s why she blew up. She said Carl supported his mother’s version of events. She laughed it off and said she knows I couldn’t have instigated that, she’s had her own issues with Carl’s mom, it just hurts that he’s lying about me to my best friend and she’s ok with it.

"AITA for not being receptive to my Christian mother’s ranting? Today after I finished my college classes, my mom picked my girlfriend and I up from campus. It was normal conversation at first until she suddenly started talking about how she doesn’t like how schools today are starting to “lean left”.
It only got worse because she started being transphobic and homophobic, saying how schools are “brainwashing” students and “turns them trans”. I go to college and obviously that’s not happening, so it just rubs me the wrong way that she says that. On top of that, my girlfriend is bisexual and her mom is dating another woman, so was she silent the entire car ride. 
She continued saying how elementary schools shouldn’t teach about sex ed when I don’t think they do? I went to a private Christian school and they taught me that in elementary but my girlfriend went to a public one and said they taught her that in MIDDLE school.

Personally I don’t really care much about the LBGTQ+ community, they can do whatever they want as long as it doesn’t affect me and I love my girlfriend regardless of her sexuality but it was just so embarrassing how bigoted she was.

Even if I don’t care about the topic that much, I tried to correct her but she was set in her beliefs no matter what way I explained it. I just ended up not responding as she continued to make right wing jokes that poked fun at leftists. Once we got home it was obvious she was upset because she slammed the car door closed and went straight to her room.

He agreed to go to the game and I said ""I'd ask others"", and he knows me well enough to know that I could ask and one of probably 4 or 5 other people. When I asked a second friend he replied ""yes and can I bring my fiancée?""  I didn't think twice: of course. It's a baseball game. The more the merrier, plus I am the one organizing it. I said I'd bring my wife too and had a couple others in mind that l'd extend the invite to.

The original friend then said it was a ""double date"" and backed out, irritated with the situation.

 It was never stated that it would be just he and I, and I told him ahead of time I was going to “reach out to others” and left it open ended. No complaints. I could understand if I asked him to dinner or something more intimate, but baseball games usually includes groups going out together.

We went to a massive mall in Pennsylvania today, and when we were leaving, we took the wrong exit, but there was a hill heading down where our car was parked: therefore we decided we could just walk down the hill to our car instead of hunting for different ways to get to that part of the parking lot. My daughter is going down the hill just fine, but then she falls at the near end and is completely covered in dirt. I come running down to her aid as my wife (47F) is COMPLETELY in a different universe while I’m trying to help my daughter.

My wife puts on a shocked face, but she’s been on a call with her friend this whole time as my daughter is on the verge of crying and trying not to break down in tears since she doesn’t want to embarrass my wife while she’s on the phone.

My daughter has already started crying, but she’s crying silently in between pleading for my wife to drop the call as she ignores my daughter. After she is done calling her friend, my wife yells at me and my daughter. She screams at my daughter for how clumsy she was and at me for not helping my daughter get down, even though I did volunteer to help her, which my daughter refused to take my assistance in. My daughter is still crying, so the rest of the car ride is silent except for when my wife says how much of a disappointment me and my daughter are as she leaves to go to our final destination, her mother’s apartment. 

During the car ride, my wife had asked me to turn on the conditioning because it’s “too cold” (it’s literally 52 outside) and that it’s my daughter’s fault that she didn’t take my assistance when going down the hill and she should be ashamed. I got mad and refused to turn on the conditioning as my wife flipped me off while leaving to her mother’s place.

Right now, me and her are in the car as she’s silent and just watching TikTok on her phone. I asked my daughter how she feels and she can be honest with me since her mom isn’t here, and she said she feels awful, not because of falling and being covered in dirt & other grime: but because she made her mother upset. I feel like a horrible dad, but I don’t know what to do, or if I should’ve turned the conditioning on or just in the first place not let my daughter go down that hill alone. AITA?

"AITA for calling my sisters boyfriends an ignorant POS? I’m actually still super upset but I’m not sure how to handle this. 

I am 21 years old and my sister is 24 and her boyfriend is 30. Her boyfriend’s family and my family come from the same small village in Mexico. My parents love him because his family is upper class in the town and are very light skinned. They pressure my sister to marry him and have kids so their kids will be lighter skinned. The problem is he’s such a walking stereotype of a machismo misogynistic asshole. He’s also an anomaly in that he’s pretty smart and nerdy and works in tech. And despite being Mexican he likes to jokingly make white supremacy jokes that I don’t always think are jokes and plays up the fact that he’s white. 

My last boyfriend was Asian and all he ever did was mock him. Making fun of his “lack of masculinity” and called him a bunch of racist names. It was actually one of the reasons my ex broke up with me. He hated being around my family. 

Anyways this past Saturday I was at my parents house and of course he and my sister are there. He and my dad are drinking tequila. He yells at me saying hello and I kind of ignore him. Then he mentions that he has a colleague he’s like to set me up with. It’s an Asian guy. And he describes him as a f word and a pussy. It made my blood boil. I told him he was an ignorant racist piece of shit and that my sister could do so much better. My dad was trying to calm me down but I was so heated. I ended up leaving. 

Later my mom and sister both called me and asked me why I was so angry and aggressive. And said I should apologize. I said fuck no and that my sisters boyfriend is honestly the worst person I know. I thought about it more and now I feel like I might have gone too far. My sister and parents like him a lot. Maybe I am the asshole here",0.01
"WIBTAH If i grow my hair/beard out? I (M23) have been experimenting with how I present myself, dress, etc. and have been adapting my style over time as one does. For a while now i’ve wanted to grow out my hair or try a beard.

My wife (F26) has made it very clear that she does not like beards or guys with long hair. Any time i bring up that i want to try them out she pushes back alot. On the beard one specifically she has threatened to stop kissing me. 

On one hand i want to go forward regardless of her opinion because it seems like overstepping boundaries and she has no right to tell me how to groom myself the same way i cant tell her how to style her hair, shave, etc. 

On the other hand, I don’t want to needlessly invite tension into our marriage and while she doesn’t have the right to demand I shave, what kind of husband does that make me if I just disregard her opinion? She is entitled to her opinion after all.

I knew plenty of single women who wouldnt date men who had beards and that felt fine then because everyone gets to choose their type, but if i change my ‘type’ now, how can i justify that when i know that if i had tried this before we met we probably never would have dated? 

I know i can die on this hill, but someone can be right and still an AH. Right or wrong, WIBTAH if i don’t take my wife’s opinion about one of the most visually defining grooming features a man can have?",0.09
"AITA for giving my husband an ultimatum between his daughter and our newborn and me? I (27f) and my (36m) husband have been married for four years. My husband has a daughter, ""Jen"" (9f). from a previous relationship with, ""Tina"" (36f) and lives with her most of the time, during the school week, and stays with us on the weekends, certain holidays, or breaks from school. My husband and Tina have a cordial relationship. Tina and I are nice to each other.  Jen and I get along well and enjoy cute dates together.  


 I became pregnant with our first child in March of 2023. Everyone was beyond thrilled, including Jen whohase always been ecstatic about being an older sister.  I started noticing shifts in Jen's attitude toward me around August. She began refusing my hugs and our usual interactions like cuddling during movies and doing her hair in the morning. I dismissed it as her having a bad day, as children usually do. However, I began noticing that her behavior only worsened after stays with her mom. My husband and I discussed this, and he asked Tina if anything was going on in Jen's life that we should know of. Tina assured us that nothing was wrong and that Jen was ""a temperamental kid.""   


In December 2023, we had our baby, ""Lily."" First day back, I cared for Lily and fell asleep with her in the bassinet next to me. I woke later to Lily's gurgling noises, with Jen next to the bassinet, with her stuffed bunny to Lily's face. I got up and told Jen that she couldn't put something on Lily's face, since she is a newborn and it might hurt her. She said she wanted to share her toy. I told her that the gesture was nice, but this was dangerous. Jen apologized and left the room. Similar things began happening through the next few months with Jen being uncomfortably close to Lily without supervision. 

Jen came over for Easter break. My husband and I set up a mini-Easter egg hunt in our backyard for Jen. It was around 11 in the morning, and Jen was watching a movie in the living room, with Lily napping there too. After 30 minutes I checked the baby cam, with Lily crying hysterically. I rushed inside, picked her up, and soothed her, and the day went on. That night I checked my baby cam. I scrolled back to when my husband and I were outside and saw Jen had CHUGGED a remote at Lily when she was making fuzzy noises. Horrified, I showed my speechless husband. He agreed to talk to Tina about disciplining Jen. The next day, he called Tina and told her about Jen's actions. Tina defended Jen and blamed me for leaving my baby alone with a child. I recanted and said that her daughter should not act violently no matter what. This set Tina off, stating she would pick Jen up today and move them away. My husband backtracks and tells Tina that we will set up new boundaries in the house instead. He tells me that he can't accept his daughter moving away and I should keep a closer eye on Lily, so nobody gets hurt. I was beyond enraged and gave him an ultimatum: either discipline Jen or Lily and I move out to another apartment until he solved the problem.

"AITA Because I left my girlfriend and didn't text her for hours while I went out?  So me M23 and my girlfriend F21 got back together not too long ago after years of knowing each other, but we have dated in the past. 

She has severe abandonment issues and im not sure on the name of the disorder but it's something extremely serious. I can't be bothered to search for it either.

(don't want to sound horrible there) 

She hadn't told me until a few weeks ago actually that I was the person helping her stay  around and I had no clue what she meant but assumed she was just being nice. 

Today I went out for a while (about 5 hours) and I hadn't texted her due to lack of time and as her friend was with her I thought she would have been fine. 

When I finally came back home I noticed she was crying on the floor and having a severe panic attack saying I'm going to leave her and  other things. 

Her friend (Belle) was trying to help her out but couldn't do anything. 

It took a good hour for me to help her back up. 

Im currently writing this while she's sleeping but I just needed to know if I'm am AH because I do feel extremely guilty...

"AITA for not wanting my sister to live with me? Hello. I (25F) just got married 3 months ago and I’ve lived in my house for 2 months now. My husband (25M) and I have been together for 4 years, but we just got married at the end of December. My sister lives with my mother, but doesn’t like it there. Recently, she decided to pack up & bring her belongings to my house. She didn't really say much, just dropped her stuff off in my garage. She never really asked to stay with me, she just said she had no place to live.   
I live in a one bedroom home, so she’s been sleeping on my couch for a week. I’m trying to be accommodating, but at the same time it’s a small home. There’s nowhere for her to put her stuff or to sleep other than in my living room. She’s moving states away in 6 months for a job opportunity, but I don’t think I can last that long. I feel guilty complaining, but I want time with my new husband & time to just relax in my own living room without her being there all the time.   
Between the tight quarters, my husband and I being newlyweds, and the fact that she has a place to stay that she just doesn’t WANT to go to, all makes me think she should be told to go back to our mom’s or find another place. I deal with a lot of guilt & usually turn on myself, so I’m struggling to see if my thoughts are valid or if I’m just being selfish.  ",0.02

I don’t have a good feeling about the wedding in general and honestly feel like I would be bad energy at the wedding and I don’t wanna do that to her. this is a couple I don’t even see working out in the long run they have a ton of issues to work through and in my eyes it’s a disaster.

overall i’m not supportive of their upcoming marriage and don’t even wanna be involved at this point I just don’t know how to verbalize it without coming off as a complete asshole. mentally I can’t do it, i’m not in the right headspace and I think she should only have people that are actually happy for them in their wedding and I know too much about them as a couple to be happy for them. sooo WIBTA if I said I can’t be a part of their day because of my mental and financial state?

"AITA for not buying my teenage son an adult meal? Hello. Today me, my 5 kids and my husband went out for dinner at a fancy restaurant with my husbands parents, brother, and two nephews. My son (using a different name for privacy) Max is 14 years old and is the same age as my older nephew. Heres the thing though, Max is a very picky eater. 

He has an extremely small appetite and only eats certain foods. He is autistic and he has suspected AFRID. I was very worried when we booked this restaurant because I didn't know if it would cater for Max's very specific needs. He only really eats pizza, certain soups, plain noodles and rice, chicken nuggets, fries and steak. 

I was very relieved when we got to the restaurant and realised that they had a kids menu, which had a lot of foods Max would like. The main menu was a lot of foods I know he wouldn't touch. Plus my brother in law was buying his kids a meal of the kids menu, and his kids are Max's age. My other kids are aged 4, 7, 8 and 11 and they were happy with picking a kids meal so I asked Max to pick something from the kids menu and that's when the problems started.

Max said he was feeling hungry and ""brave"" and said he wanted to try something else from the adult menu. I was reluctant because he has said this before and then not been able to eat the meal he ordered and then we would have to buy him another meal. I said that I didnt think he'd like the adult meals so he should choose something from the kids menu. He got upset and started having what was probably the start of a meltdown. My husband got annoyed and basically told me to just let him have it. This made my mother in law upset because she thought I was restricting what Max ate. 

Anyway, he ordered something random and as I predicted, he didn't like it. And as I predicted, we ended up having to order a chicken nugget meal as well. I told my husband we probably should stick to foods we know Max likes IN RESTAURANTS but at home he could try the new foods. That made him angry because he thought that Max should be allowed to explore new foods and we should encourage it. 

So now my husband is annoyed at me and my mother in law thinks I'm restricting Max's diet. So AITA?

"AITA for latching the door chain? I (f,30) share an apartment with my boyfriend (m,40). Our apartment door has a keyed deadbolt, as well as a one-way deadbolt (can only be unlocked from the inside) and a door lock chain. I get nervous sometimes when I'm home alone, and one day I locked the one-way deadbolt and forgot to unlock it before my partner got home from work. I heard him at the door and instantly ran over to unlock it, but he was upset that I had locked it to begin with, saying that it felt ""beyond shitty"" to feel like he had been locked out of his own place. I tried to explain that I was nervous and felt more comfortable locking the one-way deadbolt (one reason being that our Landlord and apartment maintenance both have keys to the other locks) and I told him that it was unreasonable for him to be mad at me for this. This just made him angrier and he told me that I wasn't taking into account his feelings, and that I had no right to tell him what he was or was not allowed to be upset about. He went on to say that additionally, what would have happened if there had been an emergency e.g. fire or ""if I was choking"" and he couldn't get in to help me? I said that this was a hugely hypothetical situation and nothing like that had happened...his response being that my scenario of someone coming into the apartment/breaking into the apartment was just as hypothetical. I told him that I didn't think he understood how it felt being a woman alone, and that I wasn't going to stop locking the door. He then asked me to at least just use the door chain in the future and not the one-way deadbolt to which I agreed. This all happened a few months ago.  


Flash forward to yesterday, I was home alone all day and decided to take a nap in the afternoon. Before I laid down, I latched the door chain, but forgot to unlatch it when I got back up. My partner came home a few hours later and opened the front door, which didn't open all of the way because it had stopped at the chain, and I again ran over immediately, saying ""sorry!"" and unlatched the chain. Once again, he was angry, and we more or less had the exact same argument as before. The last time, I had tried to remain as calm and quiet as possible, but this time around I was in tears. He told me again that I was minimizing and disregarding his feelings on this, and not thinking about him at all, and I told him that I was thinking of him and that I actually stopped using the deadbolt because of our last conversation and only use the door chain now. He said that he didn't remember that conversation and that it didn't matter because if he had said that, he must have just been ""stuffing his fucking feelings down because it was a no-win situation.""

"AITA for not letting my daughter get an iPhone? Hi everyone. 

My (32F) daughter (we'll call her Parker)  is currently 11 yrs old. When Parker turned 10 yrs old I gave in to getting her an iPhone. Her biodad and I are divorced and remarried on both sides and I needed a way to keep in contact with her while she's with her dad, when shes with her friends, and or when I'm traveling for work. Parker is a really good kid. She has straight A's in school and is very kind to everyone. She's just very ""forgetful"" when it comes to chores and informing me about where she is going or what she plans to do with her friends (hence the phone). When I gave Parker the iPhone my rules were very clear and I explained them all to her.  **1.** No instagram, facebook, youtube, or any other social media without my knowledge and or say so. **2.** The phone can be taken away for punishment while she is at her week with me or taken away completely. **3.** If something happens or if something is lifethreateningly wrong, I need to check her phone (i.e. bullying issues, school issues, what have you) 

She understood the terms and agreed. After about 4 months I recieved a call from her dad. He told me our daughter and his step daughter have Youtube channels.He said Parker has disturbing videos of her dancing to scadalous songs in sports bras and skirts with her friends. My heart sank... He then proceeds to tell me one of these videos have 1.7k views. I started to panic. I told him to take her phone and I would get it up when I came to pick Parker up. Parker was visable upset. She wouldn't look at me. I didnt scold her anymore her father did enough for both of us. I closed all her social media accounts and took the phone, but I reviewed the videos first. They were not great but not as bad as her father stated. I told her she broke my trust, the agreement we had, and it was going to be a long time until she recieved another one. She asked if she was going to get another phone and I said yes and that I bought a Gabb phone for her. She's hated it from the minute I got it for her, but she understood why. I told her when she is older and can afford her own she can get an iPhone. I wasnt going to buy her another one, she got what I provided. She was silent about it until Christmas time 2023. Parker started to argue with me about getting her iPhone back. I would quickly remind her that she broke my trust, lied, and broke the agreement. She would then try to talk her stepdad into talking to me about the iPhone. This kept going for awhile, and Im out of patience. Its been a little over a year and Parker has become emotional about it. My husband has told me I need to rethink this as she is being ostracized by her friends and feels this is holding her back, but I am standing firm. This is starting to form a riff in our family now. Normally I tell her to make an arguement and I will listen, but this I wont. Social media can be dangerous and I dont want to expose her to those dangers if she isnt ready.

"AITA being blunt while househunting This story is from a while ago, I am no longer connected to these people. I am just interested to see what the verdict is.

So I (25M) was looking to move with a girlfriend (29F) and after some discussion decided that we would move in with one of her Jill (27F) and her bf, Joe(27M)

Before we started looking at houses we decided we needed at least 3 bedrooms, and enough extra space for me and Jill to work from home. Joe also wanted an extra room for themselves for space. 

We took a trip together to go househunting. On the first day of the trip the first place we scheduled a walk through, it was this amazing house on the top of a hill with huge windows everywhere. The city has mountains all around it and it had amazing views. It was not practical at all though because there were only 2 bedrooms, a small basement, very small kitchen and a nice living room connected to a courtyard. Only one bathroom upstairs for everybody, 4 ppl.

While we were having the tour, Joe was joking to the  owner about how he would be a great landlord, pretty much joking how we are renting the place already. It was really annoying since we had not discussed anything. I might have messed up a little, but in front of the owner I made some comments that it might be a little small, everybody else immediately went crazy like I said something insane. We discussed it in private again and I repeated too small, but they were all stuck on the view, with everything else being “we will figure it out”

We continued the day and at the end we discussed the houses we saw that day. They would not stop with that house though, like the view would fix the lack of space. I straight up told them this is a waste of my energy discussing this house we won’t fit in. Not to mention I specifically requested I want a place with a decent kitchen since I love to cook and we have 4 people. This place had a mini hallway that only 1 person could comfortably use at a time. There wasn’t even a third bedroom like Joe wanted so I was taking his criteria into account also. When I asked them more they would only say the view, refused to elaborate what they thought worked in that house. 

That soured stuff a bit, I did not for my life understand their aversion to be realistic. AITA?

My grandmother treats her the same way her parents did growing up. Belittling her and making her feel like she’s worthless. Treating her like she’s the maid for the house because shes a stay at home mom with our 4 year old daughter. Not only that making rude comments and mentally and emotionally abusing her. My fiancé does plenty during the day while I’m at work. Staying home with a 4 year old and keeping the house clean is tiring enough. I’ve tried it on my days off. This abuse has been going on for a couple years since we moved in. My grandmother keeps saying she’ll change and she hasn’t made any effort to improve. Blaming it on someone else other than herself. She is very narcissistic and likes to see people break down until they can’t take it anymore. Then when they explode she blames it on the other person. My grandmother also does not respect our wishes when it comes to our daughter. She gives her things when we say no and also has taught our daughter to be very very defiant towards what we say. Teaching our daughter to look at us and say “f*** you guys.” My grandmother does pay bills I cover most of it. She also acts like the house I purchased is hers. It’s fully in MY name. Tries to tell us what we can and can’t do in MY house. I’m sick of the way my fiancé and I are being treated. My fiancés sister is about to be homeless and would be moving in my grandmother place with her daughter and her boyfriend. She has agreed to pitch in on bills.

The first day I went to my new school I just knew it was gonna be a fucked up year because I got in trouble the first day I went there. I wrote about it on reddit too and everyone was telling me I was the fucking asshole.

But anyway, some people were nice to me and told me that if I wasn't happy I should try and graduate early and that's what I did. I went to my counselor and she set me up on Edgenuity and I'm taking all my junior classes in hopes of graduating early.  

I did not tell my mom or her husband about this as I've just been struggling trying to balance doing my actual work and my online classes as I started late in the semester and my classes are due on May 17th so I'm kinda behind. But with Edgenuity I can kinda find some of the answers on the internet so it's been getting a lot easier for me.

They asked me what I meant and i told them that I was graduating early as I was taking my junior classes online and I was planning on taking the other half during the summer. They got upset with me and asked me why I never told them and I just said that they never asked and I didn't think it was a big deal.

I told her that I wasn't doing that to get away from her I was doing that so I could be closer to my friends and family as I missed them.

"AITA for Ruining my Friends Birthday Dinner? So, here's the deal. I (33 F) have been friends with Sarah (31 F) since high school, and we've always had each other's backs. But recently, things have been a bit rocky between us, and I can't help but wonder if I'm the one in the wrong.

Sarah has always been a bit self-centered, but lately, it's like she's taken it to a whole new level. She's been canceling plans last minute, showing up late to everything, and constantly talking about herself without ever asking how I'm doing.

Last week, she invited me to her birthday dinner at a fancy restaurant downtown. I was excited to celebrate with her, but when I arrived, she was already halfway through her meal and barely acknowledged me. I felt pretty hurt and ignored, but I tried to brush it off and enjoy the evening.

Then, towards the end of dinner, Sarah started talking about her plans for an extravagant trip to Europe next month. She went on and on about all the amazing places she was going to visit and all the expensive things she was going to buy. I couldn't help but feel a pang of jealousy and resentment.

But what really pushed me over the edge was when she turned to me and said, ""You should come with me! It'll be so much fun!""

I was taken aback. Not only could I not afford such a trip, but I also had other commitments that made it impossible for me to drop everything and jet off to Europe for a month. I politely declined, explaining my situation.

But instead of understanding, Sarah scoffed and said, ""Well, it's your loss. I guess you just don't know how to live life to the fullest like I do.""

That's when I snapped. I told her that she was being incredibly selfish and insensitive, and that her constant self-centeredness was driving a wedge between us. I may have raised my voice a bit, and things got pretty heated.

After I finished venting, Sarah just stared at me in shock before storming out of the restaurant without saying another word. 

To be honest, I don't regret a thing, even if I may have ruined her birthday party. Am I the asshole?  (Sorry this is long) ",0.23
"WIBTA if I don't pay my friend for broken furniture? Recently I attended a housewarming for a close friend. During the event I accidentally broke a shoe rack that was near the entrance (the shoe rack had two shelves and was quite small, the top shelf broke as the wood connecting one set of nails was broken). My friend then jokingly said that I should pay for it. Later that evening, I received a Venmo request for $50 - apparently, the shoe rack was from Target and cost this amount. I did a quick search on the Target app and found (what I believed to be the shoe rack) for approx $30, and sent it to my friend - as I was just going to pick up a replacement shoe rack and take it to his house. He replied that the shoe rack was actually $50 and he would actually be using the money to buy a different ""piece since the \[previous\] one is breakable"". Personally, I think that the shoe rack could have been repaired with some wood glue, and I am bothered by the fact that my friend was so quick to request the money and use that money to purchase something better (rather than either attempting to repair the item or taking up my offer to replace the item).

"AITA for cutting my hair two weeks before my play? I, 15(M) cut my hair over the weekend when we didn’t have any rehearsals. I cut it enough that it was noticeable. Our play, that takes place in the 17th century, is in two weeks. I didnt tell the director, 60ish(F), my plans to cut my hair, but I feel more confident and imo it looks more like a 17th century haircut anyways. I didn’t assume she’d be mad and she never said anything about physical changes needing to be shared beforehand. I came to rehearsals today and she made a comment about it. I thought she was joking, as all she said was “You chopped all your hair off?” Which is a huge over exaggeration because, although it’s short, only the front and back were cut. I still assumed it was a joke until I was sitting behind a bench offstage, where I heard her complaining to the costumes lady (who hadn’t even noticed my hair) that I had cut it without telling her. They acted like I kicked a baby. I’ve been doing theatre for 3 years and this has never happened even if I’ve done so. Side not, I have 7 lines and I’m only in 3 scenes out of 13.",0.29
"AITA? Cooked bday dinner for husband, he ate it with kids while I was still working now he’s mad that I’m upset I work from home 11-7:30. Today was my husband’s birthday so I cooked him dinner in between meetings and on breaks. We have 4 grown children, 23-29, 2 are in school and 2 work full time. 

When our son got home at 5:30 he asked my husband if dinner would be ready soon, otherwise he was going out to pick something up for himself. My husband told him I had made dinner and they would eat at 6:30. So he and all the kids ate his birthday dinner while I worked and were long finished when I was done. 

My husband says I’m too sensitive and my feelings shouldn’t be hurt, but I’m the only reason he had a dinner or cake or anything - am I the asshole because I feel they should have waited til I got off work to eat so I could be part of the celebration? This is not the first time…",0.14
"AITA for telling my husband he's wrong to leave everything to his ex-girlfriend in his will? My husband (44M) and I (30F) have been together for 6 years and we have been married for 2 months. 

My husband is a businessman he started the business together with his ex-gf. They were together for 20 years. Together, they own the company and some properties. The assets value is about $4m.

I didn't know about his assets until we were 5 years into the relationship and we had agreed to a prenup that says we both won't have any claim on each other's assets in case of a divorce which I was fine with. The prenup was supposed to be between us and it was confidential according to our lawyers but my partner had shown the content of the prenup to his ex-gf to make sure she was happy with it. I was a bit upset when he did this.

I found out that my husband and his ex-girlfriend had done a mirrored will before our wedding and the content of the will says that in the event of his passing, everything will go to his ex-gf, and vice versa. 

I confronted him furiously about it and I told him how I was upset by his action and it didn't make me feel like I was important. He told me that it is his wish that his ex-gf gets everything because they built everything together and I shouldn't feel like I am entitled to anything since I wasn't a part of their empire. I explained to him that I don't feel like I am entitled to it but I just can't understand why he'd leave everything to her since she's already gotten 50% of everything. He said she deserves it all because they worked together to build it when times were hard. He also said it's to ensure the continuity of the business by her when he's gone because he wants to make sure that his employees have jobs.

I would be ok if his 50% goes to a charity etc, but the whole thing being left to ex-gf upset me. Also, 10 years ago, my husband had an affair behind his ex-girlfriend's back and she found out. I think he feels guilty and wants to do right by her but is this fair to me? 

He said he had only had done and updated their mirrored will before our wedding just for the sake of the process and soon when we buy a house, he will update the will to say that our joint house will go to me in the event of his passing. I think that's fair but I am upset about him leaving his assets prior to meeting me to his ex-girlfriend. He mentioned he will think about what I said and probably change his will, but not soon. 

I don't have a will right now but I am going to do one. Before, I have always had the thought of leaving 50% of my asset to my husband and the rest to my family but now I am not sure. My asset value is about 300k. 

I just want to reiterate that I wasn't angry about the money, but more of where he placed me in terms of importance and priority. I feel he was thoughtful about the wellbeing and livelihood of his ex-girlfriend, company, employees but did not think about me and that upsets me a lot.

At the moment, I am a bit wary of him and angry and I feel like I can't trust him fully and I am still hurt by his actions. AITA?",0.69
"AITA because I don’t to give my dad a graduation ticket? Quick run down, my parents are divorced, they have been since I was a year old. My mom and her side has had primary custody over me and the agreement was a weekend a month and every other holiday except summers which was always his. He moved and now I really only see him for when he comes down for my school plays, or the odd holiday when he can make it from Ohio(cali resident btw) or I fly over there. 

Now graduation talk has been coming about and we only get 4 tickets per family, now those have the names of my mom, her brother/my uncle, and my grandparents who all have helped me out tremendously and have been much more involved and apart of my life. My father hearing this and the trouble I was having securing any extras from my friends exclaimed that I should reserve one for him, which I promptly ignored. This was about 2 weeks ago btw 

Fast forward to today and he asked how I was doing, and if I was offended by the ticket talk, I was like I’m not offended because those tickets are going to my mom, my uncle, and my grandparents for xyz reasons and if I can find or buy an extra it’ll go his way. 

He didn’t respond or say anything yet, but I am feeling bad as I felt it was rather passive aggressive but I fear I made it worse by answering how I am and wishing my half-sister a happy belated birthday. So am I the asshole?",0.36
"AITA for giving my son's teacher a gift? My son is a 2nd grader and he really doesn't care how I dress him. I saw a bunch of vintage rock shirts on sale and bought a few. I sent him to school wearing a Kurt Cobain, GnR, The Doors and Janis Joplin shirts. 

His teacher, Mrs. M, sent me an email to tell me the shirts were inappropriate because those bands are associated with drugs and violence. I thought she was kidding. She said don't send him to school wearing them or she'd have him wear his shirt inside out.

Being a rebel dad, I sent him in his Kurt Cobain shirt but put masking tape over Kurt's face. That pissed her off and she asked him to wear his sweater all day.

She left for maternity leave on Friday so I dropped off some gifts in her class at the end of the day. They were baby clothes with the Nirvana and GnR logo on them. Apparently she complained to the VP who told me it was insulting. Oh well. Today my son wore his Big Brother and the Holding Company shirt and no one said anything.",0.88
"AITA for not respecting my boyfriend’s parents? My (nb17) boyfriends (m16) parents don’t support me and his relationship. I’ll call my boyfriend “Grey”. I identify as nonbinary, and bisexual, Grey identifies as a bisexual cisman, and me and Grey got together October of last year. We’re nearing our 6 months soon, but that doesn’t apply to this completely. 
My boyfriend’s parents don’t support me because of my identity. Saying to Grey that I’m not good enough for him, and how I’m going to go to college and leave him behind. He told all of this to me over text shortly after being yelled at. Somehow, I always become the center of why they’re angry at their son. After hearing this, I instantly began thinking I was never going to be accepted by them. Slowly, I processed my feelings and decided I’ll be respectful to their face, even if I know his mother is talking crappy about me behind my back. Right now, I don’t feel they deserve my respect and they made me uncomfortable to come over any more because of the tension with knowing what they actually think of me. 

Anyway, small recap. Grey’s parents do not like me, my identity, or my friends. they think i’m manipulating my boyfriend until I go to college. I feel they don’t deserve my respect after saying this behind my back. But, should I give them the respect they won’t give me? They’re his parents, and I love this boy. I want to marry him but they won’t support us behind my back. Am I the A-Hole for not respecting my boyfriend’s parents anymore? ",0.1
"WIBTA for asking my husband to reduce contact with his father? First time poster and on mobile. TLDR below.

I (F28) want to ask my husband (M30) to cut/reduce contact with his father (M62). For  context, I’ve been married to my husband for 5.5 years and it’s been weird from the start with near daily phone calls lasting hours where he acted like I was interfering with their relationship. When we moved within visiting distance 3 years ago, he would come over almost once a month for a long weekend where he expected me to wait on him hand and foot. I put a stop to it after many rude remarks about my MIL (his ex-wife), insults about me, trying to force my husband to drink when he’s sober, and general misogyny paired with insults on my home. I have a dozens of examples of this but won’t get into all of them here.

After that he was just visiting once a month but only for a day trip. I ended this in the fall of 2022 when we announced that I was pregnant with our 2nd child and asked him to keep it to himself because we weren’t far enough along to share with the whole family. He promised he wouldn’t say anything and the next day told his side of the family (shocker I know). I told my husband at that point that I was done and he was no longer welcome in our home and that he needed to lay down boundaries with his father.

My husband completely understood and did try to establish some basic boundaries over text expressing, politely, how upset we both were with him announcing our pregnancy, asked for him to stop being disrespectful towards me and my MIL, and to stop pushing him to drink. This grown man called my husband BAWLING and acting like we were cutting him off completely. He guilted my husband and started yelling saying this isn’t his son, it must be your wife making you do all of this, she’s horrible, she treats me poorly and is rude and cruel to me etc. etc. my husband was so lost and so new at placing boundaries that he didn’t know what to do. We only saw my FIL at family gatherings after that until this past fall. Again, brief visits every few months and things were going ok.

Yesterday we went to Easter dinner, everything was fine until we sat down to eat. I was feeding our two kids while my husband made a plate. My FIL said “it would be the dream” for me and my husband to get divorced so they could move in together and have the kids to themselves. Then he looked at me and said “oh, no offense.” We were a bit too shocked to say or do anything at the moment and handling two littles was more important. On the way home we talked a little bit, but haven’t discussed a course of action on what to do but are planning to when we get some time to sit down and really talk.

So, WIBTA if I asked my husband to cut contact with my FIL, or should I just suck it up since we really only see him at family events now.

TLDR; WIBTA if I asked my husband to cut contact with my FIL due to years of insults, disrespect of boundaries, and ultimately saying “it would be the dream” for us to get a divorce so I’m out of the picture?

"AITA for not wanting my roommate to just walk into my room to pet my cats? I (19m) live with my roommate. I have two cats, one who’s a little over a year and another who I just adopted, she’s about 5-6 weeks now. Everytime I’m not home, I always keep my door open so my older cat can roam around while I’m not home and so she doesn’t feel locked in when I’m not there. I kept the younger kitten in my bathroom for a little while because she was so small and was recovering for a URI. 
Anyways I notice that, when I’m cooking for example, and my older cat stands at my doorway, my roommate will walk towards her to pet her. And it’s not always just at the entrance, he’ll go deep into my room and stay in there for like 5-10 mins. It’s the same thing when I’m not home, he’ll go in without me there and just play with her. I noticed that he goes in there more often now with the new kitten and just pop in the bathroom to play with the kitten. Today, I got home and he was on the floor in the middle of my room playing with the kitten. I had left her in my bathroom earlier with the door closed bc I’m trying to wean her off the bottle and I want her to start getting used to using a plate for wet food. 

It’s not like I’m hiding anything but it’s just boundaries, like I wouldn’t want ANYONE to just walk into my room and if it wasn’t for my cats, I’d leave my room closed and locked whenever I would leave home. He leaves his room locked and I never attempt to just walk in when he has the door open even when he’s in there. So AITA?",0.11

"AITAH for asking my girlfriend not to wear a revealing top to a concert AlTA for expressing to my girlfriend that I didn't feel comfortable with her wearing a very revealing top (a lingerie top) to a rap concert that I would not be present for. I explained to her that I have no issues with how she chooses to dress or how anyone chooses to dress for that matter, but that this top in particular I didn't feel comfortable with (having experienced for myself how many men can act especially in a concert setting where drugs and alcohol are involved) and that I wouldn't be there to protect her/be with her.

l also expressed how I felt as though certain parts of her body (private and personal parts) I wish to only be for me as I see our relationship as being sacred. I acknowledged that she is her own woman who can take care of herself and I don't mean to be controlling in any matter - and I know I can't always be there and I have to release myself from that expectation. I was also in an abusive relationship previously for several years in which the woman I was with was hell bent on making it known that she was desirable to everyone else and needed constant validation to satiate her ego and keeping me dependent on her approval amount other things such as having physical and emotional affairs. I was left with some unresolved trauma from that relationship that I am consciously working through and communicating to my girlfriend openly about.

She thinks that my feelings on the matter are conservative, doesn't agree with my feelings and that l'm being insecure, and that she should be able to wear what she wants. I agreed with her and told her she should feel free and comfortable to dress however makes her happy and comfortable and apologized. I told her after hearing her perspective I understand where she's coming from and that she's right and that I just had to process.
Though she's mentioned it a few times since and I can tell she's still upset.

"AITA for overreacting a a ""harmless"" prank on April Fools? I (19F) have been dating my boyfriend (21F) for around 8 months. We've always gotten along pretty well and I've started to think that I even loved him. He's always been playful and that's one of the things I like about him. Don't get me wrong, I'm playful too but today, he took it too far.

We know each other's phone passcodes and can access each other's devices almost all the time. He's not the kind of person to always check my phone and suspect me and I have never done anything disloyal.

Today, he asked for my phone because ""he wanted to download an app and give himself some coins for a game."" I didn't think anything of it and gave it to him. Keep in mind that I live in an apartment, with myself and two other girls.

The girls were out, and I was in my room with my boyfriend. But around 45 minutes later, I hear a knock on the door. Without thinking much of it, I leave my boyfriend on my bed and head out to open the door. To my very unpleasant shock, it's my dad.

They did not know I had a boyfriend and it was so sudden I had nowhere to hide him. My parents have been extremely strict and conservative growing up, and I have genuine trauma and anxiety from them. I didn't know what to do as I didn't want to seem suspicious in front of my dad.

Lucky for me, my dad had only come over for a few minutes because he was in the area and stayed in the living room. The entire time, I was barely maintaining a calm composure. As soon as he left, my boyfriend steps out of bedroom and screams ""April Fools!""

I burst into tears, having a full blown panic attack but he claimed that I overreacted and that he would never let himself get caught by my parents. Obviously, I know it was a prank but the entire situation was so stressful that I don't know how much further his pranks might go and him belittling my feelings isn't making it better. I haven't talked to him since the incident and he keeps texting me. Honestly, I'm seriously considering breaking up with him. I'm not sure. He's starting to claim that I'm being the A-hole for taking his joke so seriously. AITA for reacting the way I did? ",0.82

"AITA for accepting an offer from a check-in agent to take a direct flight home from vacation instead of the flight with one connection that would have added about 2 hours to the trip when travelling with a friend? I (37m) travel often with a friend (40m) I have known for about 5 years and we usually get along great and are basically perfect travelling companions with the same interests that complement our strengths and weaknesses.   


We just did a city long weekend international trip that was perfect. In the past we have been on standby with the possibility of being separated in order to fly home faster and it wasn't an issue. We booked our flights separately and rarely end up sitting together, as usual. On this trip both ways, I had to see a check-in agent to have my travel documents verified, which my friend didn't have to do for some reason until being called at the gate. We had had a low-stress last morning and as I visited the check-in agent this afternoon to get my boarding pass, they offered to put me on the direct flight home that was departing slightly earlier and would shave off about 2 hours of the trip getting me in about 8pm as opposed to 10pm. My friend immediately came up to the desk too and asked the agent if there was space for him, but it turned out there was only one seat left on the direct flight. The agent asked if I still wanted to be on the direct flight and I jokingly said yes thinking it wasn't a big deal.   


Well it turns out, it was and my friend furiously stormed off swearing at me a bit (which the check-in agent and I thought was a joke at first). Shortly thereafter the check-in agent told me the system wouldn't actually allow me to change flights. We flew home (not seated together) and my friend hasn't spoken to me since except to say that he didn't want to uber to our respective homes together even though we always do as we live in the same area and that he would text later to settle up our expenses.

after being one of the women this guy absolutely loved to pick on for almost 5 years, i felt like someone needed to warn this poor girl of his behavior. now keep in mind, this girl lives like 3 states away and they’ve met like twice, so whatever she sees of him is what he LETS her see, which is why i assumed she’d be ignorant to the truth. after talking to some other girls who have been personally attacked by this guy, they agreed i should send a text. so i sent a long couple of paragraphs to her public social media account explaining my concerns as objectively as possible with as little loaded language as i could, because i wanted to seem like i was coming from a genuine place of concern (which i was of course) and not like a pot stirrer or something. 

not even a minute within texting her THE GUY texts me from an account i don’t follow cussing me out and accusing me of ruining his life and just kinda blowing up, which kind of led be to believe he’s logged into her accounts which is a whole different level of crazy. but anyway i argue with him briefly and wait for her herself to respond. she follows up with the worst attitude possible and calls me stupid and tells me i don’t know what i’m talking about, so i tell her that i hope their relationship works out and that i’m sorry for overstepping. most of my friends think i did the right thing by trying, and a lot of us agree that we could’ve used that kind of text (that i sent) in some of our own previous relationships. but one of my friends and a family member told me it was none of my business and i was way out of line to text her, which i also understand, but i’m not sure if i’m being 100% an asshole and should never consider this kind of text as an option moving forward in future similar situations. and this girl’s reaction is kind if leading me to believe i’m just projecting and assuming, but i genuinely can’t tell.

"AITA for not wanting my fiancé to go on a big bachelor party after we agreed to keep it small? So my fiancé (M30) & I (F29) are planning our wedding. We are having a small destination wedding to save money as it would be more expensive in our city.

He then came to me and said that if his groomsmen book a trip for him overseas, as 2 of them work abroad, I would have to be fine with that. I took it with a pinch of salt first but did show some discomfort with the idea. 

Then last night he was drinking and we were talking about plans. He then started to say that if he wants to do a week with the boys the week before the wedding that I should be fine with that. 

I just responded saying that his groomsmen all work (my fiancé works for himself) and that probably won’t happen. Then we started to get upset. He then said that it doesn’t matter, I his groomsmen plan that or a trip abroad, he won’t be telling them that he can’t go because of me.

(I don’t mind having a small one night celebration close to home, for my bachelorette as I don’t want all my bridesmaids to spend all that money traveling.) 

I was upset at how he was saying this to me. In a drunken shout. So I did do something I should not have and as he got more heated when I was just saying I don’t even think that would happen. I had enough and I exploded and threw his drink at him and said he has had enough. We were at home during this incident and I know I’m in the wrong for that. But I still can’t help but be upset. 

After that I stormed to bed and he was crazy upset and we have not spoken since.

"AITA For yelling at my sibs daughter for acting this way? AITA?: So my (m25) sibs (f20) daughter (5) was playing with another relative (10) at home. They usually cause a lot of messes, yell all the time, and act as a 5/10 year old would do. But my sib and our Da (m49) never punish her or tell her from right and wrong. All they do is tell her stop and that’s it. Most the time she says okay but ignores it and still continue on doing it 100 more times. 

So today I come home to them playing, running around, the usual stuff. Go to my room for a bit then come back out to get something to drink/eat. When all of sudden I see our new puppy (2m) in her little bed eating a lot of peppermints and candy. Which I quickly snatch away! I was getting upset and telling my da. That the puppy just ate a lot of candy how did he not notice this!

All he could say was aw man these guys left all this candy probably. Which I was getting more upset saying how can he not keep an eye on their activities and what they leave behind. All he could do was scold the dog. While I ,enraged, go to my sibs room. And yell at the girls on why they didn’t pick up after themselves. Which the relative understood but my sibs daughter has a bad influence on the relative. Her daughter saying it’s okay to copy what she does most of the time.

All they did is stare at me and not say anything. Which I proceed to yell at them saying to stop leaving all their food, candy and toys out. Cause someone could trip and/or the dog could eat the food they leave and possibly die! Which made my sibs daughter just smile! Which pushed me over the edge! All I could do was yell and cuss at her! Which made my da upset. Yelling and cussing that if I ever talk to her like that I was going to be kicked out or worse.

I understood that yelling at a 5 year old is wrong but her smiling while I said the puppy could die. She understood loss though. We lost our old dog from age. She cried about that. But just seeing her smile after that made me just lose it. I feel horrible for yelling and cussing but her mother lets her get away with too much. Since she always out in the streets doing god knows what all the time. My da all he does is lay in his bed watching movies telling to stop and nothing more. 

Like I said they let her do way to much without punishment all because she’s 5 and a little girl. But now I’m just gonna pretend she doesn’t exist  that this point since they hate me for yelling/cussing at her

"AITA for telling my best friend to communicate with me like before? My best friend and I live in different states, so we used to text everyday and video call regularly. Especially her, she would send me random messages about her day, rants and so on. 

Communication has been much less now since she has a boyfriend. She would still text me, but much less. She stopped talking about her days that often and she doesnt rant anymore to me about daily things. Also she takes longer to reply, like a couple of hours. Before she would really often reply within an hour.

I asked her if there was something wrong between us because of the lessen communication and that I felt that since she has a boyfriend, she spents much less time with me.

She said that since she moved in with her boyfriend, she has new obligations now, plus life in general with work and everything, she find less time to be on the phone. She still make the effort to reply to me everyday, even if its less. And she mentioned that this is normal that contact will be less because we start to grow up. 

I honestly still feel kinda abandoned.

"AITA for not wanting to help my sister with her wedding prep anymore? My one and only eldest sister is getting married in a month, her & her fiance have decided to do things a little modern due to wanting to buy their first home. Scaled down wedding -  60 guests, no bridal party & thrifting a lot of wedding small bits & bobs. Although I was a little gutted I wouldn’t be by her side as her MOH, nonetheless I was happy to help her with whatever she needed, wedding dress fittings, organise a bridal shower & flowers, hair & makeup ideas, built their wedding website, etc. Shes my only sister, least I could do for her.

However, Sticking with modern theme, I recently found out she had asked my brother if he could be a “flower boy” on the wedding day. Obviously I’m shocked by this news, given she specifically wanted no bridal party due to their limited budget & supportive of their decision. Now I feel completely blindsided & unappreciative of everything I am doing for her. She hasn’t mentioned this to me & my brother politely turned the idea down. 
At this rate, I’d rather not help with anything anymore & say no to anything she asks. Am I being unreasonable?",0.79
"AITA for telling my sister she is being unrealistic with her wedding? My relationship with my family is strained. My parents were emotionally neglectful, and my dad had a drinking problem. We argued so badly that I was made homeless at 18. Now, I support myself, attend college part-time, and have a strained relationship with my sister. My parents favour her, showing more involvement in her life than mine. Despite being with my partner for three years, my parents still claim that they barely know him, and my mum has always criticised and nitpicked him, unlike my sister's fiancé, whom they love.

My sister is organizing a destination wedding, and while I appreciate her kindness and support in general, her wedding plans are causing me a bit of stress. She's expecting everyone to cover their own expenses, which is reasonable on one hand—it's her special day, after all. However, the financial burden of around £1200 is quite significant for me. I'm currently working part-time on a zero-hour contract, and with bills to pay and food to buy, saving up for such an expense is proving to be quite challenging.

Adding to the complexity of the situation is the fact that I'll be starting university in September. While I'm excited about this new chapter, I'm also anxious about managing my finances effectively while studying. I'm not sure if I'll be able to secure a job during my time at university, and although I'll receive a maintenance loan, it will barely cover my basic living expenses.

During a recent conversation with my sister about the wedding, I tried to express my concerns and limitations honestly. I mentioned that saving up for her wedding, given my current situation and upcoming university expenses, was going to be tough. I even highlighted the uncertainty regarding my ability to work while studying. However, instead of understanding my perspective, she dismissed my worries and insisted that I must attend her wedding, threatening to sever our relationship if I didn't comply.

Feeling frustrated by her response, I expressed my opinion that she was being unrealistic given my circumstances. I even proposed alternatives, such as staying at a different, more affordable accommodation option, but she rejected the idea, emphasizing the importance of me being present at the villa with the rest of the wedding party.

Now, I find myself questioning whether I was in the wrong for standing up for myself and expressing my concerns. While I want to support my sister on her big day, I also need to prioritize my own financial stability and well-being. Am I the one being unreasonable here?",0.11
"AITAH for refusing to let my inlaws take family photos with my baby? My inlaws have a tradition where they take photos of their family, but these photos only include blood relatives, so I, the father of the baby would sit the entire thing out.

The other married in spouses put up with it, but I stand up for myself. In fact it makes me wonder what the point of the marriage is if they don't see me as equal to a blood relative.

When they asked to do pictures which would include my baby, but not me, the father at all I told them it was never going to happen the way the wanted it. Any professional pictures they took would be with me in it too.

My wife is crying because of the drama and my inlaw side is accusing me of trying to ruin their family bond or some other bullshit. They said it all could be avoided if I just let them take harmless pictures and chill out.

Also for more context my wife doesn't want me out of the pictures, but she even more doesn't want me to cause a fight with her family. She isn't actively trying to support either me or her family. She is just upset at the situation.

"AITA for Rejecting Intimacy with My Wife, who already Opened the Marriage? Sorry for my grammar,  English is not my native language. 
I'm in a complicated situation and could really use some perspective. My wife (27F) and I (29M) have been married for 4 years, and lately, we've been having issues in the bedroom. I've been dealing with some personal mental issues and haven't been as interested in intimacy as I used to be. 

My wife is feeling disappointed an  frustrated , she started acting cold around me . One day,  she suggested that we open up our marriage to explore other options for fulfilling our needs. At first, I was hesitant but eventually agreed, hoping it might alleviate some of the tension between us. 

However, I haven't pursued any other relationships outside of our marriage. I've been focusing on sorting out my own issues and trying to be there for our baby boy . My wife, on the other hand, has started seeing other people , (I didn't mind about this) 

Things seem to be back to normal within 2 months of the deal.  Now, she suddenly want intimate with me again , I said i still not ready.  She became upset and yelled at me that I'm asshole for making her feel like she was cheating on our marriage by not proactively looking for another partner and that I'm not meeting her needs ruined our marriage.  We have heated arguments and then she leave the house and  stay with her sister. 

I love my wife and want to make things work, but I'm not sure if I'm ready to dive into a non-monogamous lifestyle and my issues is not improved much. At the same time, I don't want to lose my family over this. 

So, am I the ah for rejecting intimacy with my wife and not actively pursuing other relationships in our open marriage, or am I justified in taking things slow and prioritizing my own well-being and our child?",0.14
"AITA for asking my partner to drive? Long story short - My partner has a driver's licence. That being said - she came from Czech Republic, a country where the public transportation is so good, that you don't actually need a car, or even driving to get easily and comfortably where you need to go (in/outside major cities as well).

Where we currently live, the driving characteristics are sometimes so overwhelming for her - Speeding, cutting from the slower lane, signaling cars to move, you know the drill, road dicks.   
Sure, you can find the ""slow"" drivers hanging around as well, but we live in a ""pressure pot"" when it comes to roads etc.

Her driving experience is just ""ok"". She used to drive, but not anymore. Like, hasn't driven a meter in the past 6-9 years, at least. 

Although I recommend her just to experience it on her own and get back on the horse, keep to the right lane (the slower lane) and just do her thing - She just can't seem to feel confident driving.  
Even offered her some ""wreck-the-gearbox"" free pass to get used to driving again, but nothing.

I just need a break from being the designated driver lol - Plus, the worst part is - she doesn't even drink alcohol! So it turns out that I'm always the designated driver but I'm also always sober! F\*\*\* me I just want a couple of shots and a pint instead of counting my sips when going out.

"AITA for trying to take my friend(28F) out for lunch/dinner and give her gift on her birthday? She got upset when I (30M) said that I wanted to give her something for her birthday and take her out for lunch. I know we haven’t talked like friends in a long time and things have gotten weird between us. I waited for her for many years, hoping she would reciprocate my feelings. I hung around. Yes sometimes I got too enthusiastic about my feelings for her. But now I’ve accepted that we just need to be friends and this is my way of starting our friendship again. So am I wrong?

I like doing things for my friends so why is she upset? It’s like I can’t do anything without irritating her or annoying her.",0.94
"AITA - I ""shoved"" my husband and didn't ask if he was ok This morning my husband (42m) and I (40f) were bickering. Our 9th anniversary was yesterday. It wasn't a happy one. I worked, we had to raincheck lunch that he ""planned"" by asking me that morning if I wanted to have lunch. (None of our kids were in school yesterday, going to lunch with all of them isn't pleasant for me. It's a ton of work.) I declined and asked to do it another time. He said ok. 

He did nothing. No gift. No card. No letter. Nada. I don't much care about gifts. He usually gets me stuff he likes. (Case in point, he bought me a Ryobi tool for Christmas that I'll never use... At least he said it was a gift for me when the kids asked him why he didn't get me anything) I'm more of an acts of service/words of affirmation kind of person anyway. Oh wait, he put a load of laundry away last night. So I guess that's something. 

Anyway, he was trying to get out the door to take the kids to school and I followed him into the garage  to get something out of the car. I didn't realize he stopped and I opened the door and bumped into him. As I leaned in, he pushed the door hard and it smashed my head. I pushed back on the door screamed something, slammed it and went inside. 

I came back to apologize for opening the door into him. It was an accident. I did react rather big when the door slammed into me. He said I shoved him with the door. I apologized again and he said that I shoved him and knocked him into some shelves. I apologized again and reiterated I didn't mean to. I asked if he was sorry for smashing my head in the door. He said it wouldn't have happened if I didn't shove him. 

He said ""everything isn't about you."" I told him I genuinely didn't mean to bump him with the door. He asked if I was ok. I said I'm physically fine but I'm hurt. He said I was selfish for not even asking if he's ok. But that he knows I never will bc I only care about myself. 

I feel like I'm NTA but maybe I'm delusional and actually selfish. I am so overwhelmed with many emotions. But I did feel badly for bumping him, ""shoving"" him with the door. I went to apologize. I wanted him to apologize too. Maybe that's where I'm TA. I was expecting or hoping for an apology too. And when I didn't get one I said something.

"WIBTA - House mate has had 5 months to move 3-4 boxes A newer house mate Johnny has moved in from another place with kitchen supplies. I have been here with old house mate Ringo for 4 year we have almost everything. Johnny has been asked 4 times to move his boxes of unused kitchen utensils/supplies into cupboards or their room. They only acknowledged that they will do something about it once.

I want to do something that will let Johnny know they are being extremely disrespectful to the other house mates and myself by leaving boxes in our communal area.

My current options are stack infront of their door but pull it all out of the boxes and packaging, putting it stacked against the door (so when opened creates a mess) or trash it/pretend the dog pissed on it.

Some advice would be super useful, I have been nothing but respectful to them. Driven out to bring them home and have already broken down some boxes they never put in the bin.",0.75
"AITA for finding it incredibly annoying my parents are always home? I (17f) live with my parents, I’m in my last year of high school, my parents are always home.  They don’t go out, they don’t spend time with friends (especially my dad, he doesn’t even have friends), they don’t physically go to work as they do everything at home, and I find it so so incredibly annoying. 
When I get home from a really tiring day at school, I like being alone in the living room as that’s the place I feel most comfortable, but they are always there as well. 
I’ve told them what I think of this before, and they say that it’s their house and they can do what they want, obviously I get that but I want my alone time too and I don’t love being stuck in my room. 
I’ve suggested stuff to them before, why don’t you guys ever go to a restaurant or the movies at night, they don’t spend a lot of time together and I’d like that to be different, but they dismiss me saying they don’t enjoy going out and they’d rather stay home.

"AITA for snapping at my new housemate over the parking spot? I (25F) have been renting a middle room for over a year, and everything was fine until the previous tenant, A, moved out. Then B moved in to the master bedroom for 1-month before moving to the small room.

Now, the issue is with the parking spots. Our landlord said the sheltered parking is for the master bedroom, and the open space is for the middle room. The small room, needs to rent parking with the management.

However, there's this extra sheltered spot beside our unit that sometimes A or I would use if one of us is occupying our spot. Plus, the guard suggested we park there instead of in the open space.

Here's where I might be TA. Since the master bedroom has been empty since I moved in, I've been parking in our unit spot. A and I agreed on a first-come, first-serve basis. So, when B moved in, I told her to park next to our spot while A used the open space. The landlord later clarified that B deserved the unit spot because she rented the master bedroom for a month. I could park as usual once B moved to the small room.

It's been more than a month, and I've been fine with B parking in our unit spot. But yesterday, I decided to park in our spot for no reason. B wasn't happy about it, and she messaged me to move my car. I explained what the landlord said about parking, but B insisted the unit spot was hers because of what the landlord had supposedly told her.

Confused, I talked to the landlord, who said B could use the master bedroom's parking sticker until a new tenant arrives. She also mentioned parking should be first-come, first-serve until then. When I told B what the landlord said, she got upset and insisted I park in the open space.

Today, she messaged me again about my car being in our spot, and I lost my cool and snapped back at her, saying if she didn't want to compromise, neither would I.

"AITA for leaving my friend at the airport forcing her to get an uber home? My friend needed a ride to the airport, and I was happy to help her. She told me six AM arrival at the airport, so I planned accordingly arriving at her place for 4:30- she wasn’t ready yet despite me repeatedly telling her when I’d come. To her, we still made it “on time” so I’m overreacting to the tardiness. She almost missed her flight. But hey I’m not the one that had to run. 

When she came back from her trip, I was to pick her up at 5 am. I arrived at 4:45am, texted her I was there, and heard nothing back. 5:30 came. I checked her flight, it landed without issue. I texted her and she didn’t answer. I waited for her until 6:45, texting every 15-20 min saying I was still waiting and where to find me, before I texted her a final time that I was leaving at 7. She texted me back and asked me to wait for her, she was on her way. 

She had been at the bar drinking, apparently, and when I realized that she was drunk I told her to get her “sloppy ass” into an Uber (not fair of me to say that true). I sat there with the doors locked as she started yelling at me to let her in until she finally set up an uber. Probably I should have waited for her Uber to arrive but I was angry and just left. 

Now her, her bf, and our friends are upset with me. Basically they agree it was annoying but I agreed to take her and should have been more patient to follow through with my promises.",0.12
"AITA for not wanting a temporary roommate while my house mate is studying overseas for 3 months? We have shared a small 2 bedroom unit for 2 years now. We split rent and bills 50/50. They are finishing their PhD study overseas without the opportunity to work for the next 3 months, and suggested they find a fill in housemate that can pay their portion of the rent.

Last time they studied overseas I paid half their rent in addition to my own share, and avoided a fill-in housemate. This time, their scholarship will run out while overseas.

I don't want a temporary roommate, especially when I will be away myself for several weeks intermittently during those 3 months. I have offered to pay all of the rent ($2500 extra) this time instead, and to find my own fill in room mate if I need help paying all the rent myself.

Our city is in the middle of a rent crisis, so I'm sure there are perfectly good students out there that would need the room that I'm selfishly wanting to avoid sharing.",0.2
"AITA, opted to pay for my stuff that my gf paid for? Ok, what happened - 

Me and my gf went to a bookstore together, where she asked me not to buy more books, as some are already in pending list. I was conscious about that, later she ended up buying six while i ended up buying one. I offered to pay up for the whole thing as it was my idea and i knew she was running low on funds. She anyways said she'll pay for the whole thing by herself and i didn't object to that. later i felt a sudden shift in mood (from cheerful to serious) and i ended up asking her hey is something wrong telling me not to ask again. I didn't quite understand why and we just dinner while sitting quietly. I was trying to understand what was wrong and told is it because of the money, she snapped and said no, and also went quiet and said hey sorry i was just joking. 3 days later i asked her hey was i correct in understanding (on chat) (because it bothered me quite a lot that why the sudden mood shift, was something wrong) ? She said why is it important for you to know that, i said because it seems important to me. She got pretty pissed off later saying why should i explain my feelings everytime to you, this felt very bad to me. Anyways i later responded , i was proud of her for paying for her own stuff and sent her the amount for that the one book i bought. I felt she might be overextending her finances and it'll again cause worries later on. She returned it back saying i was being very insensitive, and she'll return everything that i've given her till now. I don't understand this at all. 

Some background - I earn quite more than my gf and am ok with paying for stuff. In past I had brought her an ipad (as she needed one for some personal work) which i told she can pay off later when she's having the money, although i really don't care about that and have never asked about it.

"AITA for overthinking about the timing of splitting bills equally with my partner? My husband(30M) and I (29F)  have been married for three years and had been dating for 10 years before that. We've been lax in tracking our finances. Whoever goes out to buy stuff pays for it (groceries, medical bills, everyday life things) and whenever we go out, we alternatively pay the bill. We've talked about tracking our expenses but are too lazy to actually do it. My husband has been solely paying the rent and utilities bill since the last three years. I've bugged him about splitting these expenses multiple times but he hasn't yet.

He has a below average paying job. I quit my high paying job a year ago to pursue other interests. Since then, he's been taking the majority of the monetary burden of the household on his own accord. I have saved up from my job and have enough to last me a couple of years (my individual expenses, travel etc and household expenses as well). I've tried talking to him about sharing the expenses equally but he won't listen.

He's been bugging me about investing my money properly till I end up using it. He had a bit of experience in investing and wants me to invest as well. I have been reluctant. Today, he calculated how much money I have lost by not investing when he had asked me to. He said I'm headed towards bankruptcy and that I should contribute in rent and utilities bill. He also sent me details of rent and utilities bill of last three years.

I have paid my dues to him. What I find odd and belittling is the timing. All the other times I asked him to split the bills, he didn't. Today, when he realised I'm not being financially smart and going 'bankrupt', he decides to split all the bills. Am I overthinking about this?

Edit1:  He's an extremely sweet and gentle person, respects my boundaries and loves me to a fault. We've divided the household chores to cater to each other's likes and dislikes. He cooks atleast one meal for me everyday because he knows I dislike cooking. Similarly, I do the laundary, iron the clothes etc.

Edit2: I quit my job to pursue my passion. We had discussed it and I quit once I had enough saved up to cover expenses of my passion + my living expenses (inclusive of rent + utilities). My deadline for making my passion work is June, 2025 based on how much I have saved. If I can't make it work by then, I'll go back to a corporate job.",0.95
"AITA for having an outburst? So today I was eating dinner at the table until my mother came to sit down beside me. I heard her make some mouth sounds and I didn’t think too much of it.
I get really agitated by small sounds such as, loud sloppy eating, a door creaking, stuff like that. Sometimes it’s so bad it makes me cry out of frustration or I have an outburst where I suddenly jump or say something like “I have to leave” or “I can’t be here.” Usually, I would just be with my mom until she starts eating really sloppy and loudly and all I can think about is the sounds coming out of her mouth. So then I always leave to go to another room and come back to her when she’s done eating to avoid me getting more upset over the noise.

I know this sounds ridiculous lol. I always apologise and say “it’s not your fault, it’s just a me problem.” One time it was ridiculously sloppy so I even asked her if she was doing this on purpose to piss me off since she knows that I’m kinda sensitive to mouth sounds.

So today it pissed me off like always and I kept me mouth shut. Suddenly I got up from my chair and said something like “I CANT” or “NO.” I quickly sat down from embarrassment. It felt like I had no control over my body when I did that. I honestly can’t remember what I said because it happened so fast and was so sudden and it was so out of character for me to do that. I didn’t even recognise myself for a second because I usually don’t have outbursts where I shout like that. My mom said “Jesus! What is wrong with you?!” as she continued to stare at me with a concerned look on her face. All I said was “sorry” followed along with another “sorry.”

"AITA For wanting to talk to my ex about my feelings, after she suddenly comes back into my life telling me she has been going through a tough time?  Might delete this soon… For context: We decided to be ‘more than friends’ after the breakup. She started to leave me on ‘delivered’ often in January. Completely ignored me for 2 months. She comes back randomly a couple of days ago to tell me she cut off her family (I had no idea about this). During the two months I went through the whole emotional rollercoaster because I thought I lost her completely, suddenly being left in a no-contact situation, and then when I was fed up with her silence and was ready to move on, she reaches out. 

We called twice, and in both calls she talked about what happened with her parents. Understandable, it’s a difficult thing to go through. I supported her decision and just listened to what she said. What rubs me the wrong way is that she never once asked what I was/have been up to. She said ‘sorry’ for the sake of saying it (didn’t actually say what she was apologising for), and only after I said I was angry at her. She said she still loves me and thought of me. The second time we called, I brought up how I wanted to understand her thought process of ignoring me, and she gives me an attitude on how I should have filled in the gaps and should have understood her situation (without me actually knowing what was going on). 

I sent her a massive text going in detail and that I support her decision with her parents, however I’m still hurt and a bit angry, and I would like to talk/call about what she thinks and what we should do moving forward. I told her to let me know if it’s not a good time and I’d understand, but to at least tell me so, in order for us to talk about it eventually. She read the message. Left me on ‘read’.

"AITA: AITA for “not being a feminist”? 
Hi, I’m a young female who is just started thinking about jobs and family/the future. And many of my friends are strong feminists, who believe in women’s rights and have gotten into many hard debates about it. Of course, women deserve rights and an education. 

However, I’ve come to realise that when I’m older, I don’t really want to be the working woman. I thought about many jobs that I might have before I settle down, but I was thinking how much I would enjoy staying at home, cleaning having children and cooking. People make lots of jokes about housewife, but I seem to really enjoy the idea of taking care of my children and cooking for them and making food from my husband. 

When I tell this to my friends, they look at me like I’ve just dishonoured the women of the world. Just because I don’t want to be a girl boss or whatever… I’m a really family person I want four children and I love cooking and cleaning. So I don’t understand why my friends are taking this way. my friends want to be lawyers a chef or smth else, but that’s just not my idea of fun.

 Of course my husband would work, but that doesn’t mean I wouldn’t take the best care of him when he’s home. I’ve come to the conclusion that maybe I could just be a SAH mum because I would say I live a quite comfortable life with my parents and I would be able to support my husband as well. My friends seem very angry about the way I said I want to live and disagree saying that I should be glad that I even have the chance to work.

I asked her if she could stop being a bitch and be nice for once. I think I may have said it loudly since everyone in the office looked at me. I apologized but she still reported it.

I was called by my manager to talk to me and it didn’t end well. I tried to explain that this isn’t the first time I’ve heard her say stuff about me. I explained how I’m a single mom and buying new clothes isn’t my top priority at the moment. I explained how I have been unemployed after giving birth to my son and most of my clothes were too small for me to fit so I have to wear something that would fit me. The pay in my job is good. Though my manager was empathetic she told me that I should dress the part and we have a dress code to follow. My heart sank since she opened up the possibility of terminating me if I dont oblige.

The truth is, I know I dont look fancy but I always make sure that I at least look presentable. I have been using 2 dresses to get to work and have to rewash each one everytime I go home. I have a toddler and I cannot just shop for new clothes when I want to. FFS, I have been walking over an hour to get to the office because I need this job to get formula and diapers. My ex didn’t want my kid so I’m on my own. The bastard doesnt have a job so he has missed a lot of child supports for the past months. I dont have the time or money to bring him to court. 

Now everyone in the office thinks I’m the bitch. I dont have the time to explain my situation and ask for their pity. But the thought that I’d lose my job because I cannot afford clothes is scaring the shit out of me. 

Why can’t people be nice? I have been struggling with everything and I’m s",0.95
"AITA for not including any of the neighbor’s kids into my daycare because of how they acted in the beginning? Let me start this off by saying I have a daycare license and when I got my apartment, a 1 bedroom open space plan (obviously aside from the bedroom) I was very upfront about how I was going to use the space to my landlord. It took some compromising but I have full permission to use the area as a daycare lawfully and locally (landlord). My apartment is on the first floor so all clients have to do is walk through the lobby where I meet them/guide them to the apartment which is the first one on the hallway. Please ask any questions if needed, I’m trying to not give too much details about location.

My neighbors were unhappy about this I think. Whether it was passive aggressive notes or side eyeing the parents that would sometimes wait in the building’s lobby, they were not kind. My daycare is from 10am to 6pm which is pretty standard hours for noise and I don’t let the kids run wild or anything but I’ve always received complaints.

I had an issue come to head last week when a local daycare near us had to close down for a while. I’m not associated with that daycare so I don’t know all of it. All I know from the news and all was that the daycare had to close down due to improper building regulations or something.

This led to some of my neighbors asking if I had space for their kid(s). Now, their kids are of age for the license I’m authorized to care for. However, although I can’t confirm who did or didn’t complain, I’m pretty sure plenty of the parents who reached out must’ve complained at some point especially the ones on our floor. I think it’s unfair to take them in after they made complaints.

I reached out to ask the landlord if it’s fine to put a poster on the building bulletin board that I will not be taking in any kids of the building who were not already enrolled in my daycare. He confirmed that would be fine as long as it was informational (so no saying I’m refusing because of past compliants). I put up the notice/flyer without issue.

Today though, I had a neighbor knock on my door. I opened and he began to ask me about the flyer/notice. I just reiterated what it said but he kept pressing on why the residents of the actual building don’t get childcare in their own building. I explain that I’m independent from the building. He kept on pressing saying it makes more sense that the people who live here get to have childcare access and I got a little snappy and said that if multiple weren’t complaining about noise in the past then maybe I wouldn’t have that notice. 

I guess he spread the word around and now I’m getting some sticky notes on my door or complaints about noise before I even start daycare. AITA?",0.96
"AITA for wanting to be paid for my work I’m a single mom to a 10 year old girl and 8 year old boy. I was recently laid off and I’ve been struggling to make ends meet. 

I have a friend that is fairly well off. She’s a doctor with her own practice. She’s also a single mom to 3 kids (14m, 12f, 10f). A few days ago my friend called me and said her youngest was hit by a car and she needs someone to help her take care of her house and kids, and in exchange, my kids and I can live with her rent free. 

She only has 1 spare room so I asked about it and she would either have me sleep on the couch or share a room with my kids, she doesn’t want her kids to share a room. She will also not be paying me for taking the kids to/from school and taking care of the cooking and cleaning because she thinks free rent/utilities/groceries is enough. 

I told her I won’t work for free and she can call me back if she’s willing to pay me for my work. She had the nerve to call me entitled and told my friends that I’m trying to charge her for being a live in nanny to her kids. They’re taking her side, saying if I’m really struggling like I’m saying I am, I’d take the free housing and meals for a couple hours of work a day and now they’re refusing if I ask for help with anything because I clearly don’t need it if I’m turning down a perfectly good job opportunity.

"AITA for being wary of my gf’s exes? I (23M) and my gf (22F) have known each other since we were in high school. We met 10 years ago and 2 months ago, I ended up confessing that I’ve had a huge crush on her since HS. To my surprise, it was mutual, so we made it official.

I’ve never had a girlfriend before, and I have no clue how relationships usually work. My gf, on the other hand, has had a few exes. She is beautiful, smart, independent, and ambitious/driven - so it’s not a surprise that people are naturally drawn and attracted to her.

Recently, I suddenly thought about how she must’ve been with her exes. As she is my first gf, I’m experiencing everything for the first time, and imagining her doing stuff like holding hands, hugging, cuddling, and having sex with her exes made me a bit uncomfortable and jealous. 

Am I wrong for feeling this way? Am I an asshole for telling her that she might just be staying with me because she’s lonely and she’ll eventually get back with one of her exes once she realizes I have nothing great to offer?

"AITAH FOR NOT WANTING MY QUINCEAÑERA ANYMORE? I (14f) am having a quinceañera next week (April 13), and I am starting to have regrets on having it.
Now I know I might sound bratty but hear me out, my mother is basically planning MY quinceañera without me and is doing all the decorations and planning without me having a saying in it even though it's suppose to be my day.
I told my mom that I want also want to plan my quinceañera since it's my day and that I feel that I have a saying in this since I'm the reason we're even having one. My mom got super mad at me, and so did my sister and my sister. I told me, ""Why are you trying to stress mom out? All you have to do is to sit and look pretty, "" and I obviously got super pissed because she made it seem like I was asking for a castle or something.
My sister also had a quinceañera and she hated everything about it and I told her that I didn't want to hate my quinceañera the same way she did.
My mom got mad at me and told me to drop the conversation because it ""doesn't matter."" I told my close friends about this and how I feel like they're doing my quinceañera without me.
(Something I forgot to mention is my mom and sister picked my venue, color scheme, and what time it's gonna end without me knowing and I got super pissed because they picked my venue without ME.)
And when I was finally gonna see my venue for the first time I asked my mom if I'm getting a limo or a party bus since my sister got a limo for hers I was curious on which one I was gonna get. My mom got mad at me and yelled at me for asking my question and she told me ""you're acting as if I have a lot of money"" which obviously I know she doesn't have much since quinceañeras cost over 3k sometimes and then she told me ""you're not having a big party like the girls you see on YouTube."" After she was done yelling at me I guess she felt bad and said ""at least you're gonna have fun"" after she yelled at me I didn't talk to her for the rest of the week.
I obviously still want my quinceañera but my family is making me hate it since I didn't get the dress I originally wanted (don't get me wrong my dress is beautiful but I still wanted the other dress since it had my heart) and my mom is putting everything silver since my dress has tiny little pecks of silver and I hate silver with red.

"AITA for using a guys overused joke after he told me I was beating a dead horse? I am a member of a small discord server for a small streamer. For the most part everyone in said server is really chill but there is one dude who me and a few other people have a bit of issues getting along with. It started mostly when he got onto my best friend because she stated that she wasn't a huge fan of a game he like and it really took a head when he got angry at said best friend because a game he wanted wasn't revealed in a Nintendo Direct. I eventually decided I wanted nothing to do with this guy and pretty much just brushed off most of the things he said.

In said discord server there is a joke going around that horses are of the devil so for April Fools I decided to pretend my discord account was hacked by horses for some harmless fun. Once I had my account ""regained"" I went back to my joke about horses being of the devil.

Dude proceeded to post a gif of ""beating the dead horse"" with a card that said ""be original"". Now this guy is no stranger to over using jokes. His one joke is just adding German to things and including stuff like ""Merry German Christmas"" or ""Happy German Easter"" so as a slight gag I said ""hey is there a stream today or was that a German April fools joke""

Dude immediately blew up and said that I was making fun of his nationality. Guy in charge of the server dm'd me and said that while he understands why I made such a jab that I probably should have just not made a jab and let him deal with it. However a lot of people said that it was hilarious and that he shouldn't dish out what he can't take.

I decided to find the woman and explained the sitiation to her and told her she should get an abortion. She refused and wanted to raise the kid. We weren't in contact with Fiona and her mom until she contacted us and told us she really needs financial and emotional help and can't do this alone anymore. I told her that I warned her about this and she should have got the abortion because we are not helping her. She got mad and asked why we could raise Clara but can't even help her a bit.

"AITA for not refusing service to a customer On mobile sorry for the formatting.  
This story starts a little over a month ago, for starters I work in a bank as a personal banker.  I was having a conversation with one of my more well off clients about different accounts that can provide better services and a much better interest rate than our typical savings accounts.  After I’m done with him the next customer walks up to me and demands the same type of account that I just offered to the to the previous customer.  This account is classified as a savings account that gives 4.5% intrest along with most bank services being free, however it has a minimum balance of 100k to avoid all the fees associated with the account.  
Customer: hey I want the same type of account you just offered to him
Me: the emerald tier?  Sorry but I don’t think you qualify
Customer: anyone can get any type of account they wish, that’s what cooperate told me
For context this man has a bad habit of calling cooperate anytime he doesn’t get exactly what he wants regardless of our ability to actually provide that service.  
Me: technically yes, but I really don’t think it’s for you.  
Customer: I don’t care what you think, you aren’t gonna screw me out of a better account like you bank types always do. 
Me: I’m not trying to screw you out of anything I’m trying to….
Customer cutting me off and raising his voice: I DONT CARE GIVE THE THE ACCOUNT I F***NG ASKED FOR OR DO I NEED TO CALL COOPERATE AGAIN.  
At this point I’m stuck with no way out, if he calls cooperate I’ll get a complaint lodged against me and they will tell me to just give him the account knowing he will get screwed over in fees as he clearly doesn’t know how this account works.  
Me: fine just sign this and read these.  There’s also some things I need to go over with you about this new account
Customer: I don’t want to hear it I’ll just read it on my own time.  Oh and also I’ll take a new debit card it’s free with this new account right
Nothing of interest happens but he does have this crap eating grin on his face while he walks out.  For full disclosure this account is classified as a savings account to the number of transactions is limited.  It charges you 25 dollars monthly maintenance if you have below 100k and 15 dollars per transaction over 10.  This guy was about to use this as his daily spending account and get wrecked in fees.  I just thought he would go home, read the fees and come back to change it once he realized the mistake he made.  
He did not.  
Then a few days ago he comes back in panicking 
Customer: what did you do to my account?
Me: what’s the issue?
Customer: all my money is gone, why are there all these fees?
This man between overdraft and excessive transaction fees had been charged over 1000 dollars in fees most of which happened that morning.  
Me: this is what I was trying to warn you about, this isn’t a checking account and you can’t use it as such.  
Customer then starts crying about how “he can’t pay bills”

"AITA for trying to join a church to make friends? I have lots of trouble even just making friends, and I’ve only ever managed to really keep 1.  Coworkers literally refuse to speak to me unless it involves work.  I’ve tried initiating with them, but they all got pissed off, so I stopped.

I eventually tried making friends at a photography club and I outright got banned when a woman mistook my attempts to befriend her as a pursuit.  They won’t have me back, I’ve tried explaining myself but they think I’m lying.

I’ve also tried with neighbors, who also want nothing to do with me.

On Easter, I went to a church to try to make friends there instead of constantly hoping to befriend people I already know.  Thing is, I am not actually religious, but I know the Bible well enough to pass off as someone who is.  It wasn’t a “gays are evil” or “everyone who doesn’t think like us will go to Hell” type of church, it was pretty laid back.

Unfortunately I had a run-in with an old high school teacher who started going after she divorced her longtime husband.  He apparently started being emotionally hurtful and she’s there to cope.  She remembers me not being religious and asked why I’m there.  I lied and said I converted (I’m 26 now so I tried to pass off the atheism as a high-school-phase sort of thing), but she doesn’t believe me.  She wants me to knock this off, should I?",0.64

I ordered food for my mom and me, I always have to answer the door, which I HATE. I have severe anxiety which I take medications for. But my mom always makes me go to the door. 

I told my mom if I'm paying she can answer the door. She started complaining ""but you don't tip! They'll judge me!"" I kept saying that we're European and our tipping culture is really only for restaurants and such! Not take out. 

The food came and she rushed into my room,  Telling me to answer because she was ashamed to not tip the delivery driver. I got mad and just told her to tip him since my money doesn't matter to her.

"AITA for suggesting that my wife should consider making a career track change? My wife and I had a heated discussion about her dissatisfaction with her job today. She’s been complaining about her job for over a year now, citing conflicts at work, feeling stuck in manual testing, other people not giving her the recognition she deserves (apparently they’re slacking and that bothers her) and not fully grasping core concepts. Instead, her idea of learning is getting tests to run “automatically” without understanding why things run the way they do, and this style of learning has been happening for years without much progression.

During lunch today, I suggested she transition into software backend engineering where I am a lead level engineer and could provide mentorship if needed. However, she took it the wrong way and accused me of criticizing her and berating her. (I suggested a very specific path to make the change and told her that I’m here to help and provide guidance as needed). She then decided to ask me if I’m “really going to help her” (she usually just asks questions such as “I don’t get this, show me” and I asked her last time if she could tell me exactly what she’s stuck on, or she’s not really paying attention when I do try to show her).

So the situation is my mom is sitting on the couch holding my 10 month old on her lap, like holding her in front of her body and sitting on the edge of the couch, not like fully back. Anyway, all of a sudden she calls the puppy over, I didn’t know it, but apparently my mom had a dog treat in her hand and she was wanting to give it to the pup. So the dog comes running over to my mom and baby, and I yelled from across the room, MOM NO! Which stopped the dog in its tracks and then I went to get my baby. My mom got totally angry and defensive, and was saying back “ WHAT? It’s not a big deal the baby is fine!” And just saying generally defensive stuff like that. She then didn’t talk to me the rest of the day and hasn’t talked to me more than a few words since. We live together so it’s particularly awkward. The thing is, when she was sitting on the couch she was sitting towards the edge so my baby was literally like face level with this pup.

"AITA for telling my sister our mother would hate her? So I (27F) am a triplet (1 identical sister (Anaïs) and 1 brother (Arsène))  and our mother passed when we were 8. Our dad did his best for us, but he is a very traditional catholic (and not American), so we never got therapy or anything. We were all inseperable until our last two years of high school. 

My dad was always very worried about her, but always used the excuse ”she lost her mother at a very young age”, even though we all did. When it was time for us to go to college, Arsène went to college about 10 hours away. I went to college about an hour away, and Anaïs got a full ride to a college about 3 hours away. During our sophomore year I was home for spring break, FaceTiming Arsène and we decided to see if Anaïs could make it home. 

Eventually we got a hold of Anaïs, and she returned home very pregnant (and having never attended that college)! She moved back in with dad. To this day, no one mentions that Anaïs lied about attending school. After graduation, Arsène got married the same summer. They decided to look after our nephew so Anaïs could go back to school. 

She quite literally ran in the middle of the night and was unreachable for a year. Arsène and his wife moved, and take care of our nephew like their son. After that one year, Anaïs began to call dad once a month and call on her son’s birthday. Now, I am pregnant with triplets.

This was such wonderful news! I am going to have to be on bedrest in the future, so we were planning to get together for my nephew’s 9th birthday. My SIL decided it would be great to have a baby shower while they were visiting. So we made some arrangements and decided to have the shower the day before my nephew’s celebration. We called Anaïs the day before the shower and asked if she could come to his party. 

Anaïs arrived to my baby shower (which in my opinion means she is living close by) wearing an ”it’s a girl” shirt. I was confused because we don’t know the genders, and then realized. She walked straight over to me and my husband, and I was in shock to see Anaïs for the first time in so long. She came up and hugged me and my husband said “you got married!” As she had a wedding band on. She replied “Nope. It’s just better if people think I am.” Then said “It seems like we’ll have similar due dates! I’d love for you two to raise her!” 

That’s when I said “Are you serious? You neglect your son for 7 years and then pop up with another? You are a terrible person and worse mother, our mom would hate you.” Everyone was being really quiet so I just said “Get out of my house and don’t come back here”.

My husband is 100% on my side, and so is my SIL. Arsène however said that it was wrong of me to say that in front of my nephew and chase her out before he could meet her. My dad was crying and said that he hates to see his children like this and it was terrible of me to bring up my mother in that way. I do feel bad about my nephew having to hear that, and I hate to disappoint my dad.

"AITA For Nixing My friend For Almost Ruining my Birthday? I’m a 33yr old woman who had a 34yr old friend, we’ll call her Pam. I’ve known Pam 14 years, we’ve been friends for nearly 10. Two weeks before my birthday, she asked if I was planning to do something, to which I replied yes. I said I wanted to do something on my birthday at my house, just wasn’t sure what. She said she’d be there with drinks to turn up, just give her details later. We laughed and moved on with conversation.

 Fast forward to the week before my birthday; I was contemplating a Bonfire, but my backyard Gazeebo collapsed during a storm.  So my family and I were able to salvage it and make it nice. I’d only confirmed with immediate family earlier in the week that the Bonfire would work because I was sure we’d be able to finish in time, leaving a handful of friends left to tell. But before I sent the message Thursday, Pam called me.
 I told her that I’d be doing a bonfire out back and asked if she could still make it. We were on FaceTime and she made a weird face, but said yes and that she was excited. Fast forward to Friday night, the night before my birthday. I sent a message to the handful of friends, including Pam, reiterating that they only needed to  bring a drink to share and good vibes. I didn’t get responses, but assumed from previous conversation that they’d show. 

So Saturday comes, my Birthday, and my Mom, Finance and I spend half the day putting last touches in the back yard when I receive a message. It’s Pam. She says she has a pre-planned engagement and won’t be attending but she wished she would have known about the Bonfire sooner. I was really hurt and confused, not so much that she couldn’t make it, but that she waited til the day of, in the afternoon, to bail. 
She also could have responded to the text the night before to tell me this. I told her it was no worries but expressed my disappointment that she wouldn’t be there, to which she callously replied that  if she hadn’t called me Thursday, I would have never invited her in the first place, and that we could celebrate another day. Obviously that wasn’t true because we discussed it two weeks prior so I told her so and that she only got the details of the night on Thursday. 
She never once apologized, sent a very dismissive “I’m sorry that you feel this way, but the details were just too short notice for me... And it’s  your special day so I don’t want to overshadow it with this conversation so let’s table this for another day.” I told her that the damage was already done but we could table it. 

Two days passed and I heard nothing.   So decided to tell her I’d be taking a huge step back from her with our friendship because people who I hold close don’t treat people like this or handle things this way. She took a low blow and brought up some personal things, then said that I was overreacting, so I ended the friendship. Am I the asshole?",0.17
"AITA for refusing to pay for my step-daughter's hospital bills when she got food poisoning from her Easter eggs? I have two children: Bill (12 M), who's my biological child, and Rachel (14 F). She's my step-daughter. Bill is half-Jewish.

I'd married Bill's mother, my wife, a year ago & it was supposed to be the first Easter egg hunt when we are together. Rachel's never liked me. I tried connecting, but she says that I am not her ""real dad"".

Bill was caught in an accident and couldn't go out to get the eggs. Rachel got chocolate Easter eggs (completely chocolate), which she ate in front of Bill when she returned. She literally said ""You wouldn't have wanted them, anyway. You're probably upset that he's risen, as you're a kike.""

I was... shocked at the comment, and immediately asked her to apologize. She refused. It got into a huge argument.

Later in the day she complained of stomach aches which got worse, and she had to go to the hospital Turns out that it was food poisoning from the eggs.

My wife wanted me to pay the bills, but I said ""Ask her real dad who's got a flash job."" She got mad and began to yell at me a lot. In the end she had to get the money through other means in order to pay. She's still calling me the asshole though.

"AITA for ending the call after she rolled her eyes at me? I (27m) have been seeing tara (25f) for two months now. we are currently out of the honeymoon phase and seem to be running into some conflicts here and there but nothing dealbreaker level. I want to ask her to be my gf this month but i'm concerned on if i'm making a bigger deal out of something small or noticing a big red flag.

Situation: Last night Tara and i were on facetime and she asked my opinion on what i thought about what she wears in the relationship. My personal opinion is i think that in a relationship i would want my partner to be comfortable and sexy but not having everything out for all to see. By the look on her face i could tell she probably didn't like my answer. Now im not going to tell a woman what she can or can't do bc i dont believe in taking away someone's choice. I can tell you how i feel about things and whether you choose to listen is up to you and we will handle that however it plays out. 

Upon asking me another question (i can't remember exactly what i was pretty tired last night) i began to answer, but before i could she cut me off to say what she thought about her own question. I replied ""hey babe i wasn't done talking"" and she sat there mouth open in disbelief. After i said my piece she started to be very quiet and cold. 
Now i will admit that she did tell me she wanted to let it go bc she didn't want to get into it. She explained that it felt like i was telling her to not speak until i was through talking in a dominating way when in all honesty i just felt like it was a bit rude to interrupt me in general. I asked her for clarification on how what i did was wrong bc to me i was polite about it and if she didn't like how i did it or what i did. tara told me it was how but couldn't give me a why on how i did it was wrong. Not that i needed one but it would help me understand my own faults to work on. 

Being that she was upset i did want to get to a resolution and validate whatever she was feeling but also i saw it appropriate to speak my mind about it also. As i began to explain how i want to feel respected and listened to, she rolled her eyes during me speaking which totally threw me off track. I stopped before asking, ""did you just roll your eyes?"" to which she replied after laughing (she says she laughs in serious conversations not on purpose but nerves... still adjusting to it) ""yes i did "". At this point im frustrated that it feels like im trying to get through the conflict together and she thinks im a joke. So i tell her that i dont feel open to have the conversation anymore due to feeling disrespected and tell her to have a great night and to let me know when shes ready to talk about it but i couldn't talk to her behaving like that. i gave her a few seconds to respond to the goodnight to which she didn't and i hung up.

"AITA for being upset my parents invited my sisters bf to a mall trip? My sister 15F just got her first boyfriend 15M 3 months ago. Shortly after they’re relationship was public he started coming around the house. 

I 17F am in a play with night rehearsals and work nights so I’m usually not around. However he quickly started coming over after school every day. They were on the wrestling team together but she made it further in the big tournaments together so his season was over before hers. So he started coming around the house when she stayed at practice. He would just sit on the couch and watch Supernatural and eat Oreos the entire time.

Now my parents are inviting him on our family bike trip, trips to a mall an hour away (a girls thing with my grandma), a museum i had been asking to visit for weeks (we waited for him to go, he doesn’t even like planes), and even my family’s Easter celebration. I feel like this stranger just randomly started joining in on my family time. My parents say im being unwelcoming. Am i in the wrong? ",0.62
"AITAH for stealing someone’s cat. I know based off this title I sound crazy but here’s the background story 

I f 17 started experimenting with 🍃 when I was younger and the only way to get the kush was from some weird guy that everyone got it from. One day me and my friend were hanging out and we decided to text our 🍃 dealer. His car broke down so he wasn’t able to deliver it so he said we can drive over to his place, at first we were not sure if we should go but we were bored and wanted to have some fun, I ended up driving to his house with my friend and when we got there we saw that he had a kennel with a clearly malnourished cat. The cat has snot stuffed in his nose and you could see every single bone in his body. Me and my friend immediately realized if that can’t isn’t in better care it’s gonna pass away. The man went the back room to get the stuff and when he was back there I told my friend to go start the car after she went out and started it, I grabbed the cat and ran out.  We drove home and we took it to the vet the cat was fine just unfed. The man texted me telling me I’m a terrible person and that he’s gonna call the cops on me.

"AITA for not letting my kids use the bathroom and leaving Easter early? I had a baby the week before Easter. The plan has been to go to my in-laws. (Info: we live 30 min away from them) They have a large family but a small house with only two bathrooms. My FIL found 5 feral kittens, brought them home, and put them in the second bathroom. The kittens were not friendly, covered in fleas, and the room was covered in urine and feces. But we were still expected to use that bathroom, specifically the kids.

I was in a room nursing when my daughter(4) 'Ella' came in crying because MIL forced her to go into the cat bathroom and it stunk so bad she ran out to find me. I put my newborn in my wearer and escorted her to the normal bathroom. My MIL saw me waiting by the door and told me: ""Take Ella to the other bathroom. This one is for adults.""

I responded that I wouldn't and because of my newborn, my kids were not allowed to use the cat bathroom. I did not want my older ones getting litter, fecal matter, or fleas on their clothes and bringing it around the newborn. She tried to argue that wouldn't happen but I insisted my kids were not allowed to use that bathroom. 

When my husband got back from the park with my 2 other kids and cousins/aunts/uncles.  I told him about not letting our kids in the cat bathroom. He took over bathroom duties and made sure our kids stayed out of that room despite pressure and complaints of my kids using the adult bathroom. 

When it came time to eat, I was in the middle of nursing. My husband offered to make me a plate but I told him to feed himself quickly so I could give him the baby while I made my plate and ate. About 25-30 minutes later, I hand off the baby and go to make my plate to find hardly anything left, some ham fat and the deviled eggs/veggie tray I brought. I just got my baby, went to a room then called my mom in tears. 

My husband came to find me a few minutes later and asked what was wrong. I told him there wasn't any food for me. He was confused, stated there was 'tons' and went to the kitchen. He came back saying his mom thought I had eaten and had packed everything up and he could warm me up a plate. 

I couldn't help but feel like MIL did this on purpose because of the bathroom situation. Who packs up dinner that fast? I told him not to bother, that I wanted to go home. He didn't understand why I was upset/wouldn't let him make me a plate. I didn't tell him my theory - which is where I might be the AH. We fought a bit (don't be too hard on him, we were both sleep deprived and high emotions because of the newborn) then went home. 

My fav SIL has told me that MIL is bad mouthing me about not following the bathroom rules, not eating her food, and making my family leave early. She is calling me stuck up and a drama queen. I felt justified in my choices but maybe I'm wrong. AITA?

"WIBTA to give my baby the same name one of nieces or nephews has? My husband and I have loved a name for a while, but one of our nephews was given the name we wanted to use. The parents had no idea that we wanted to use that name before they named their kid so it was pure coincidence, but I’m wondering if I am still able to use that name? The kids would have about 5 year age difference. I always thought that it would be fine as I have multiple cousins and relatives that have the same names, but I come from a bigger family so maybe that is not normal. My sister in law already does not get along with my husbands family (despite the IMMENSE help she has received from them ugh) so part of me is like whatever, but I also don’t want to be a straight b***h!!

We have a very close and loving relationship and I love him a lot (I believe it is 100% mutual).
However, I HATE sleeping with him in his bed. I'm never able to fall asleep because I can't move around as I would like to since it's a small bed, and when he started cuddling me I get extremely hot and wish we could just sleep in separate beds so I could be comfortable.
I never told him this and I always pretend everything's okay because I know how much he loves sleeping with me and cuddling me. But I am never able to sleep and it affects me a lot throughout the day.

"AITA for becoming friends with my GF's best friend? Me (21F) and my gf (21F) have been together for a little over a year now. The first times we hung out was in a group. Her, her best friend (let's call her A), myself, and one other friend (B). B and I didn't get along that well, but we were cordial. About a month into knowing them, my gf moved abroad for school. We decided to do long distance. Since the best friend and I seemingly got along well, we started to hang out, and became friends. I would go to her apartment, we went to events together, and had nights out. Our friendship was a result of my gf introducing us, but we got along pretty well separately too. Later, A and B moved in together. During all of this, there were some pretty bad vibes between B and I, and she ended up saying I could never come to their new apartment. 

I thought things would go back to normal when my gf got back, all of us hanging out together. But, when she got back, she started hanging out with A and B without me, and A completely stopped talking to me. I felt really hurt and excluded, and started resenting all of them (secretly/not-so-secretly). I told her I didn't really feel comfortable with her continuing to stay friends with B, because she was pretty rude to me, but that it was ultimately her decision. And she said she couldn't hang out with A without also being nice to B. (But her nice is much more friendly than I felt comfortable with — texts, calls, etc.) The whole situation hurt.

That was all happening a few months ago. Recently, I've been more cool about them hanging out, but it still hurts deep down. My gf feels like I should never have become close enough to A to feel hurt by this. I feel like her introducing us together was an indication that she wanted us to be friends. What do you think? Did I overstep?",0.03
"AITA for walking out on a job?  I am an independent horse trainer that’s been doing work for a horse carriage business for the past 5 months or so.

I have had a very good client for over 3 years now and one of her beloved horses got violently ill one morning I was scheduled to also do work for the carriage company on a day that the carriages were expected to be very busy. Carriage owner knew that my longtime client had a priority and that I could work carriages when my time allowed. 

Both the barn manager and horse owner of the sick horse couldn’t be there with the vet while the vet was trying everything he could to save him. When I was told he was sick I messaged carriage owner right away that I can’t promise to make it in that day. 

She wanted me to leave the horse alone with the vet whether horse made it or not and I told her I would/could not do that. She sent me these messages: 

“I have a business to run please treat it as your job because it is. If it you was your horse I would be a little more understanding it is not and he is with the vet there is literally nothing you can do you have till 3:00 p.m. or don't come back. I am not arguing with you anymore you're being completely unreasonable and dramatic.”

Shit hit the fan and horse ended up being euthanized and the owner couldn’t be there because shit hit fan at her job and she literally could not leave to be there. I wasn’t gonna let the horse die alone with just the veterinarian. 

I ended up making it to the carriage company at the time she demanded I make it there or she threatened to fire me. I didn’t read too much into her messages at first but at about 7pm she came around to check on the drivers and see how many rides we’d done etc and I felt nothing but cold coming from her. I looked back on those messages from earlier that day and my emotions got the best of me and I tried calling so I texted telling her to never talk to me like that again and if she couldn’t come up with an apology then I am leaving right now and not coming back.  

She ignored my phone call a few minutes later but another girl there called and she answered that call and I had her tell the owner I’m leaving and for her to come write my check. She gave the pho one to me and turned it around like she was firing me and so before I left I told her she better not tell anyone that she fired me because I quit.

I ended up being called every every name in the book and all I said was to not talk to me like that. I was screamed at some more, and all I said was in calm voice “don’t talk to me like that”. She said she is a business owner and demanded I talk to her with respect.

I’m not proud of walking out on a job without giving notice but I felt like I had to stand up for myself and I really should have gone home to grieve the horse as I  loved him dearly and never went to carriage business to work in the first place that day. 

Am I the asshole?

Past year or so I have been solo traveling a handful of times, I am in no way a seasoned vet. This year was going to be the year I branched out more, did more trips with the money I earned at work. I enjoy new places and meeting new people since I live in a fairly quiet town.

In January I had booked two trips this year for March and April. A month before the March trip my father was diagnosed wirh cancer. I am very very close with my father, this was a big shock.

Since the trips were booked, I agreed with my parents that I would still go. Everything was fine on the march trip and I don't forsee anything being wrong with the April trip. My father has started chemo and is so far doing okay.

However, there is a clash between me wanting to be here for my family and assist where I can over the course of this year, perhaps longer, but I me being so excited to travel more. I'm single, and I meet more people travelling in 4 days then I do 4 months at home.

"AITA: Just Married my new wife’s debt? AITA I got married in November 2023. I have a property on my own prior to marriage and a healthy amount of savings. My new wife purchased a condo with her sister in 2020 and told her sister not to worry about anything. My wife put 60k and her sister put 10k down. Later my wife paid over 40k in renovations and again told her sister not to worry about contributing as she was trying to express gratitude (gift) for her sister being there for her in the past with helping her make ends meet when she was in college. 
Now, my wife is 61k in credit card debt with cards at 28% interest. Their agreement prior to me existing was that when they sell in the future they’d go 50/50 on the profits. At this point her sister is up and my wife is barely breaking even. I told her I married her with her debts and assets. She expects us to pay off her 61k together because i “married her with her debt.”
I provided the alternative to have her sister give her an additional 20k at the sale of the property whenever that is since I’m going to be helping pay down her debt and have that legally stipulated through attorney documents. She is having a hard time with asking her sister for that saying she feels like she’s taking advantage of her sister for going back on her word. 

We eloped, I bought both my ring and hers because she didn’t have any money. She has money sitting in that condo investment but now doesn’t want to touch it because she was under the impression that we’d pay it down together and not touch her sisters 50%. She said 60k is nothing for me but I’ve worked really hard in preparation for my future family when I’d get married.

I’ve offered to help her pay down her debt so as long as in the future whenever they sell the property “we get at least that additional 20k.” She doesn’t want to sell the property because her sister would have a hard time getting into another property but I want us to get out of debt or at least not be responsible for all of her debt seeing as to how hard I’ve worked too.

"AITA for making my friend choose between me and a guy

The thing is that I never allow myself to catch feelings for a guy till I get to know them better, just to safe myself from a heartbreak. To many times I have got heartbroken over a guy, so I put up these walls so I can get to know them better before putting myself into a situation like this. She however has a new crush basically every other week and gets easily obsessed with a guy, without making a single move on them. 
I met this one guy just over a month ago, he started working in the same place as me. As I was training him and working with him, I started to see how similar we are. We have the same hobbies, the same life goals and in my opinion a really good fit. We started hanging out outside of work and I really started to like him. I haven't liked a guy in years, so this felt big to me, so I told my friend about this dude. She met him (works in the same place, just a very different position) and told me how she sees us a good fit, and that I should go for it! We'd be perfect together. 
This weekend I spent some time with him in the afternoon, and then met with my friend briefly as I drove her to work. But in those 10 minutes she told me she had met with him the previous weekend, when I was working and they had been making out and getting to know each other on that level. I was in shock, it took me a while to process this information.

 I sent her a message telling her how that was so uncalled for, why she didn't tell me sooner, why she was encouraging me to get with this guy and so on if she was interested in him as well? She apologies and said it just happened, and she was waiting for a good time to tell me, but a week had already passed where she made no effort to tell me anything. I tell her that I need time to process this, but I would like to try to put this behind us, but I was hurt and mad that a friend would do this to me.
 Two days later, I message her saying that there is no way I can try and forgive her while she's still seeing that guy, I just could not see the betrayal every day. She said I was being dramatic and overreacting, since nothing had happened between me and him. I tell her that I have the full right to feel the way I'm feeling, and it's only going to hurt me further if she continues ""dating"" him, and I could not handle that now. Note that I have been in a very bad place mentally over the past few months and She has been there for me through everything, and knows about it. She tells me that real friends don't make their friends choose but got mad at me when I told her that friends don't steal a guy their friend is interested in.

"AITA for wanting to sit in the front seat in front of the car? I’m new to posting so I’m sorry if any mistakes were made.
I (17m) went out to dinner with my dad (48m) and my two sisters (both 16f) to a restaurant with my dad’s girlfriend, who we will call Mya which isn’t her real name, and her three kids. 

On the way out to the car my dad told me that I was gonna sit in the back with my sisters which didn’t bother me at first until I got the full gist of the plan. Turns out my dad wanted me to sit in the back seat of the car which is only two row car. Meaning while my dad and his girlfriend would sit in the front, me, my two sisters, and three other kids. It’s not a big car so we would literally be cramped inside like a clown car! In fact, two people were sitting on the FLOOR while someone would sit on top of the other person as well. 

I did NOT want to sit through that and I told my dad that I wanted to sit in the front because there was no way I would fit in that mess. I ended up having to sneak my way into the front before Mya could. (That might be where I was an AH) 

Mya said it was fine but my dad was mad but didn’t want to fight in front of the restaurant, so we ended up arguing in the car. He said I was the AH and I was being rude but I told him that I didn’t want to sit in the back because it was probably illegal to pack that much people like that. I said we can call an Uber before we left the restaurant so there would be more room but dad just kept saying I was in the wrong I tried to come of with alternative options but he was for some reason sticking to the clown car plan of his.

To make things worse, the next night we went out to dinner with my grandparents (both in their 70s) my sister tricked me into sitting in the back so my grandma could sit in the front. I would’ve offered she could sit in the front but my sister said smugly “I didn’t want you to be rude and make her sit in the back.” That pissed me off because instead of dad scolding her for her prank, he AGREED with her saying I was the rude one. 

The fact that not only he held on to that for 24 hours, but that fact he took my sister’s side when she clearly being snarky with me, it was enough to make me mad at him for the rest of the night. 

My sisters are still holding this over my head and I’m starting to have second thoughts whether I was in the right or if I should’ve just sucked it up and sat in the back. AITA?

Edit: this happened 4 nights ago.

Edit 2: A lot of you guys thought I was an AH for acting like a child. That I’ll admit is true. But many of you ignored that fact that I would’ve given up my seat for my grandmother but my sister decided to use this as a moment to piss me off and make me look bad. As if I hadn’t done that already the night before. Also, I’m at least glad a lot of you agreed with me on my dad being reckless and doing something that is in fact illegal. I mean, what if we crashed? I did offer other options too you know.
Uber. Cab. Mya taking her own car. Driving a separate car. Even walking felt like an option to me.

But for some reason my dad shut my ideas down, saying it was the quickest way to get there (mind you, the nearest ice cream shop was a 2 mile drive.) and most my options costed money and he just spent a lot at the restaurant. An Uber isn’t that expensive where I am so I don’t see how spend a few extra bucks is a bad idea compared to piling up with 5 other people in a thee seat row of a car.

I asked Kylie if that was true. Kylie explained that what happened was she did not realize how many pens she's borrowed from Lauren and forgotten to return. Lauren called that "" bullshit"". I asked Lauren if she really thought that Kylie was purposely just stealing pens. Kylie proceeded to offer to return them.

This only frustrated Lauren more to the point where she began shouting that I "" always take Kylie's side because she's fat"". I'd heard enough, told Lauren to give me her phone. She doubled down, told Kylie she was "" fat and lazy"". At that point I just took Lauren's phone, told her she'd get it back when I felt she'd earned it back.

"AITAH for calling my boyfriend’s mother out? I (29M) have been with my boyfriend (32M) for about a year now. We will call him Mark. Last week we finally agreed to meet each others parents. For context, I’m gay, he’s bisexual. I’ve been out since I was 18, but only ever introduced my parents to one guy. He came out in his mid 20s and I’m the first guy he’s bringing home ever.

Mark met my parents first. They’re Caribbean so I was worried at first as our culture can be pretty homophobic; but it was an amazing night. They made a big meal, we watched a movie and we even had a game night! That night I seriously pictured spending the rest of my life with him. 

The problem was when I went to meet his family today. Mark’s parents are catholic and it was tense from the moment I walked through the door. His dad was being excessively macho and grabby and I just felt very uncomfortable. I went to the bathroom for some space. 

The walls were very thin and I heard Mark talking to his mom about me in the kitchen. He said he loves me and is thinking about asking me to move in with him. She said he needed to start taking relationships more seriously bc she wants grandchildren and wouldn’t tolerate it being with two fathers. Mark, bless his soul, said that he didn’t want children and that was a large part of why he’s with me, we both wanna be child free. She said she’s never heard him say that before and that I must have been influencing his decision because she’s always told him how much she wants grandchildren.

I came out of the bathroom and they realized I heard everything. So to break the silence I asked “Have you ever asked Mark what he wanted?” She flipped out saying that I was a horrible influence on her son, and how dare I accuse her of being a bad mother. I tried my best to be calm and said “I never said that, you actually did a wonderful job raising this beautiful, sensitive, funny man. I can’t thank you enough for that. But have you ever asked him if he wanted to have children?” She said I was disrespectful, then compared me to his ex, saying she was so much better for him than I could ever be. 

The same ex he’s cried into my arms about, the same ex that had him close to ending his life! I. LOST. IT. I told her that if she wants her son to be bound to some cheating, thieving, lying piece of shit, just for the sake of living up to some 2000 year old antiquated crotchety vision of family, then maybe she’s not the amazing mother she thinks she is. Her jaw dropped. I just left. 

Mark ran after me saying that he’s sorry for his mom, but thought we should all go back, apologize and start over. I told him that there’s no apology that I can ever give or get that will change a homophobe’s mindset and I stopped letting people like that walk all over me years ago. I really don’t want to reconcile with her right now. I know what she really thinks and I’m not someone who can just fake a smile and move past it. But I love him so much and it’s killing me that I’m putting him in this shitty position. AITA?",0.24
"AITA for wanting to go to a College Campus overnight?  Hi Reddit! I’ve only ever listened to these stories and never posted so bear with me. 

I(17F) am an honor student in my high school. So far I’ve been accepted to about 5 colleges, I’ve gotten scholarships from these schools, and everything. I’m still not sure exactly what I want to pursue but does anyone really at 17? The reason I’m here is because a school that I was accepted to is doing a spend the night event where kids in high school are allowed to come to the campus for a night, stay in a dorm, get free food, experience college life, and even a lecture. When I saw this I was so excited. At the time, no one else I knew was going. Later I told my Dad(42M) & Mom(43F) about it, and they didn’t really respond. Today I found out that my best friend was going to. I was super excited now so just for confirmation, I asked them if I could go since I didn’t get a clear answer before. My Dad said No. Reason? “A bad feeling” I said that it was unfair! They’ve let me go to places outside of the state alone before. A month ago I went camping with my school for 3 days with no service and they were fine with that, so why is a secure college any different? My Dad kept saying “You only want to go because your friend is going to.” I checked my email and got more info. The school is giving me a 500$ scholarship if I attend that I can use if I decide to go there. I show my parents and they said that doesn’t change anything. I said to my Dad “It’s 500$, money that I need and don’t have.” He YELLED at me telling me to drop the attitude “I DONT CARE DO WHATEVER TF YOU WANT” and I started to cry. I stayed with my Mom and she was saying “anything can happen, people are crazy what if ur assaulted or there’s a fire arm?” I said  “That’s not a excuse and you just seem really overprotective for no reason” 
Here’s where I may be the AH: I yelled at both of them and said “y’all just seem to be jealous of me!You guys are pressuring me to go to college and figure out what I want to do but when I say something I want to do you guys say it doesn’t pay enough or it’s stupid! I don’t know why any of you have any room to speak either because you’ve only just got your Bachelors and you dropped out in the 10th grade!” 
They were offended and told me to go to my room. I called my cousin who is near getting her Masters and she said she’d call my Mom cause she thinks they’re being illogical. 
Did I go too far in what they said? I just want to go to this school for one night and they’re making it seem like I’m staying there for a month or skipping school. Is it really so dangerous? If I’m in the wrong I’ll apologize. ",0.69
"AITA For raising my voice at my parents in the airport after a tiresome vacation? I went on vacation with my parents about six months ago and it was the first vacation we all had gone on since I was born (I’m nearly 20 for reference). We didn’t get any sleep because our hotel sucked so we practically stayed up for two days straight getting only an hour or two of rest in between.

When it was time to head home we were all exhausted but I was the most exhausted out of the three of us since I was more active than my elderly parents. We made it to the airport early (4 AM) to avoid the rush and waited there until 7 AM when our flight left and they wouldn’t let me fall asleep. Every time I nodded off they kept nudging me. 

I probably fell asleep for a good 10 minutes before my mom woke me up asking if I wanted coffee and I loudly said “No mom, I don’t want any coffee I just want to go to sleep. We haven’t slept for two days just let me sleep!” I looked around and noticed that the seats around us were full and I was so embarrassed. 

Again and in my defense none of us got any sleep but somehow they were doing just fine and wouldn’t let me rest until we got on the flight home and even then they woke me up twice before they just let me rest and it really pissed me off how they kept waking me for some reason.

They bring up how disrespectful that was occasionally and I do feel bad because we aren’t financially well off so vacations just don’t happen and when it finally did I yelled like I was crazy and looked like a spoiled brat.

"AITA: Crazy Landlord Trying to Evict over Minor Trespassing I rent my house with three other college students - we moved in and the old house on the lot next to us got demolished and they started work building a new one. Construction has been going on for about 4 months now. Other than the occasional noise complaint we have been dream tenants - always paying rent on time, etc. We have never met the landlords and had assumed they lived out of state.

Anyway, one night I see that the fence around the construction site for the new house is open. I’m an architecture student so I’m interested in seeing a house during it’s various stages of being built, so I go into the under-construction house just to take a peek around.

I get to the top floor (sun is almost set at that point) and I hear what footsteps down below me. I figure I just stay still and no one will notice and they’ll go away - and even if they do find me, what’s the worst that could happen? 

The footsteps continue to walk around downstairs for like 20 minutes, I figure Fuck it, and just head down the stairs, trying my best to not startle the person there - I don’t want to be a dick and jumpscare them. 

I go downstairs and it’s a middle aged man in a casual track suit thing - I start to explain myself and apologize and say I’ll be leaving and he launches into screaming at me ‘how dare you trespass on private property’ ‘the cops are on their way’ ‘I’ll have you fucking arrested you fucking squatter’ - I let him yell at me and get his anger out and then calmly explain that I was just curious and looking around, I apologize and tell him it won’t happen again. 

Then he says ‘I know you’re one of those punk kids from that house, do you have any idea how lucky you are to be living in my home and you turn around and trespass on my property, I’m going to evict every single one of you’.  I try to talk to him and he won’t listen, and so after a while I just tell him ‘if you’re not going to listen to me I’m not going to listen to you’, which pissed him off much worse.

 I walked back over to my house and locked all the doors, and he’s still screaming at me. We have a door with a number combo lock, when he fails to just open the door, he just puts in the code and walks in - my roomates who were home come out of their rooms and listen to him scream at me that I was going to steal things and that we were all going to be homeless He ended up leaving and screaming away in his Tesla,

We haven’t been served an eviction notice yet but I wouldn’t be surprised if that comes in a day or two. Our lease isn’t up until July, and I still maintain I didn’t do anything that could get our lease cancelled.

TLDR: Went to explore under construction house next door on the lot, crazy landlord makes surprise appearance, goes crazy and threatens to evict us all. Does my landlord have legal grounds to evict me and my roomates? ",0.88
"AITA for asking my boyfriend to help me equally take care of our kitten I (18 f) have been arguing with my partner (19 m) for a few hours now about weather it's fair that I am the only one who cleans our kittens water bowl and scoops the litter and his only argument in response is that he ""works 10 hours a day"" I am in between jobs at the moment while also working on getting my GED but I am the one that mostly dose this chore and it's a fight to get him to even feed our kitten I ask him nicely multiple times to do these things throughout the week and it only happens after I rant to him about how I don't think it's fair for an hour and it's not like I want him to do it for multiple weeks without me doing it I want him to equally do these things with me and I don't think that's too much to ask but instead of being rational and asking why I think it's not fair he yelled at me to come on to here and ask you people for an outsiders opinion I wanted each of us to do the litter box and clean his water feeder once every other week for him and once every other week for me so it would stay clean but instead he went on a tirade telling me that he works 10 hours a week and buys his food and that should be enough. am I the asshole?",0.64
"AITA for being butthurt i didnt get birthday presents? 
I, (24f) had a birthday last fall and i invited my 3 bestfriends who ive known for 7+ years now so they know how important my birthday is to me. I dont know why but even as an adult, i still have that kid like nostalgia of getting cake, presents and over all just the whole vibe of a classic birthday party.

Id like to preface that im really understanding that not everyone has spare money for someones birthday and i dont demand a present or anything. For example, for one of my birthday's all i asked for was a box of Frosted Flakes as they're my favorite cereal lol. So to say i was butthurt when 2 of them showed up empty handed i was a little bummed but didnt say anything. I mean, i literally wouldve taken dollar store candy as a gift.

One of my 3 friends (invited) couldn't come because she was sick and i vented privately to her because she knows i buy presents for all 3 of them for both birthdays and christmas and i never get anything in return so idk why i expected anything different but she understood and told me to stop buying presents for everyone to make it fair.

So i did and so far no one seemed to care or notice. I know its kind of selfish of me to -secretly- expect a present but i also dont think its necessarily fair of me to burden guests with that expectation verbally. So i guess im just wondering, am i the asshole for still wanting presents in my 20s or should i just let it go?

(Ps: for those of you wondering, we all have fulltime jobs and live in our own places so no ones mooching off of someone to get by and we all make decent money. Also my boyfriend came through with some candy and a cake which i highly appreciated. )",0.52
"AITA for not being more appreciative of my partner while my little brother is in the hospital? I am 30 F and my partner is 29 NB.  
  
My brother (14) was admitted to a children's hospital 45 minutes away Saturday. He's been sick for weeks so my stress had already been growing. I also want to mention my partner has been required to work 15 hours of overtime a week so they have had additional stress from that.  
  
I got the call on my way home from visiting a friend so when I got home- I asked my partner if they would mind driving us over to pick up my parent's dog while they were in the hospital with my brother. They didn't hesitate and took me over so we could pick him up.  
  
We have three dogs and two cats of our own so having an additional dog does add some stress but honestly he is well behaved. He's anxious but he gets along with our other dogs and isn't destructive.  
  
On Sunday, I was going to my parents anyway to pick up some things for them so I dropped off the dog so my partner didn't have to manage all of the animals themselves.  
  
I spent all Sunday at the hospital- which was very mentally exhausting. My partner and I are both neurodivergent so interacting with people drains a lot out of us which is why I didn't ask them to come with me. Some family members brought a lot of food to the hospital for us to eat and I took some home. My partner took care of the animals all day and made some sides for us to eat with the food my family made.  
  
Monday I took the day off so I could go up to the hospital early again. I asked my partner if it'd be okay to leave the dog home this time since I didn't have to go to my parents house. But they work from home and preferred not to deal with the additional dog. Without complaint I took the dog.  
  
I ended up spending even longer at the hospital. When I got home (around 8) my partner had already ate but I was just appreciative that they made dinner. I asked if they would come with me after work the next day.  
  
My partner isn't a super physical affectionate person but I asked for some cuddles and so we did spent 20 minutes cuddling on the couch. Then they went to bed and I decompressed.  
  
On Tuesday they came with me to the hospital as promised. We only spent a couple hours since we went after work and it was a good visit.  
  
On the way home we got in a fight (unrelated) and they threw in my face that they have been ""bending over backwards"" to support me during this. Everyday I have told them multiple times how much I appreciate them taking care of our pets while I was dealing with this. I've acknowledged how I know it's even more effort because they have extra work right now as well. I appreciate the support they've given me but I do feel like it's the bare minimum a good partner should give. AITA for feeling this way?",0.09
"AITA if I’m refusing to let my husband kick our dog out of the bed? My (31F) husband (30M) and I have been married for 1 year and living together almost 5 years. He’s not a big dog guy, but has accepted my dog into his life. My dog is 8 years old and I’ve had him since he was a puppy. He’s seen me through many life changes and is honestly my heart dog. I recognize that he is spoiled since the training he got from an early 20 something girl wasn’t top of the line. I have always allowed him on furniture to cuddle with and he’s slept in bed with me almost every night of our 8 years together. 

We recently purchased a top of the line bed and are very excited about it. He expressed concern about the dog on the bed and I assured him that with a mattress protector and regular nail trims, everything will be fine. My dog has never been destructive, so his concerns are around accidents. 

The conversation was brought up again tonight about how he still doesn’t feel comfortable with the dog on the bed and that if anything happens he’ll have no choice but to be mad at me. I can’t help but feel he’s placing a lot of emotional weight in material things and not considering my feelings of comfort having my pup next to me or considering that this is not a fair change in a routine the dog has known his whole life.

"AITAH because I want truthful answers?? AITAH for not speaking to my mom since Christmas Eve?  a little background…when I was barely a teenager, I found out that the man I thought was my dad was not.  I lost an entire family.  Since then, my brother was murdered, my bonus dad, her husband number 3 (or 4?)(who I loved dearly), passed away, my mother claimed to have cancer, but did not, and have gotten divorced from a cheating husband during COVID. Fast forward to this Christmas, and I found out that her husband number 2, the man who she told me was my father, was not my father either.  I did a DNA test and I don’t recognize anyone on my paternal side. I have now lost a second familia connection. After doing some research, I realize that the man who is my biological father, lives 30 minutes away. Furthermore, my best friend tried to set me up with what eventually ended up being my half brother. Thank goodness i declined that date!!!  I confronted my mother on Christmas Eve and she basically told me that I needed to get over it as it happened a long time ago. And also she thought I considered my bonus dad as my real dad.   I walked out and have not spoken to her since. She has called several times but I ignore the calls. I want the truth about who I am. But I do not feel she will ever tell me the whole truth.

So yesterday me and my other two friends were playing cricket.i was the only one who had a bat.

So friend two was trying to break the rock (it was a bit bigger than a baseball)but he was not able to break the rock and instead broken my bat.i was very angry because the batt was a birthday gift from my dad.

So i demanded money for the bat i asked for 100 rupees for the bat because it was old(you could buy a bat in 300 rupees)i already had 200 rupees saved up so with his 100 i could buy a new bat.(i know i should have asked for the full price but i was not trying to brake my friendship)

After that he started calling me an jerk.he said that it wasn't his fault.he said that i should ask friend 1 for the money because he was the one who dared him.

"AITA for refusing to hold my (26M) gf's (23F) backpack as she went to use the washroom? So, me (26M) and my gf (23F) have been in a long distance relationship for about two and a half years now.

I held her sling bag but refused to hold her backpack and then she finally put in on the bench pretty angrily.

"AITA because I give the special needs kids extra privilege. I volunteer 2 times a week at a local primary school library, I am autistic and struggle with lots of work but really enjoy helping out a few days a week at a place close to home.

One thing I’ve started doing is offering stickers to kids who help out at the library, tidying up books and picking up paper from colouring and drawing.
They can come in during second break and do puzzles, draw or colour. Whoever helps me out the best will get a sticker. I usually pick 4/5 kids.

There are 3 kids who are autistic/special needs that I offer stickers to more than the other kids, that doesn’t mean the neurotypical kids do not get stickers at all.

I started doing it because I know how isolating it is to be autistic in a school with “normal” kids and I remember not getting prizes because the challenge wasn’t possible for me. I still see it now at the school, and even if the teachers don’t do it on purpose I still see it happen. 

I see it as making these kids feel special and know that even if they can’t do it the “correct” way they still get a pat on the back. If I had someone like that in school I would have felt so included and that’s exactly what I want to do for these kids.

I was chatting to some friends today who said I was treating the autistic kids with special treatment and I shouldn’t be doing that.

"WIBTA for not going to my twin sister’s graduation? My twin sister and I have always seemed to be competitive with one another. I love her so much, but my family has a big issue where they compare us. This specifically applies to my dads side.
I’m in community college. I am transferring to a prestigious university next year for my undergraduate at 21 years old, while my sister is about to receive her bachelor’s at 21. I have taken a completely different path than her, and for that I have been ridiculed continuously by my family. Something that broke my heart was hearing my grandma, who I love more than anything, drunkenly ramble on my 21st birthday on how I failed my family by not already having a bachelors. I may be in community college, but despite getting an associates instead of a bachelor, I am top in my class with a 4.0 grade point average. I have my pick of the litter when it comes to university. But for some reason, that’s not good enough for my family. 
My family has always seen me as subpar (except for my mom). I do things at a different rhythm. I’m autistic, I have trouble socializing, and I had an incredibly traumatic upbringing. For this reason, I struggled in high school. Especially since then, my family has seen me as never good enough, and even an embarrassment to the family. My father always tells me that I did everything wrong and that I am nothing but wasted potential. It has created this void inside me that I have spent years upon years repairing.
Knowing my family, I know that if I go to her graduation it will be a week of being constantly berated and verbally punished for not “getting a bachelors on family time”. I already am going through a major depression, and I don’t need to have family shaming me on top of it. I know she’s upset, but WIBTA if I avoided her graduation to save my sanity?",0.14
"WIBTA if I charged a cleaning fee to my roommate? I (almost 20 F) live with my roommate (18 or 19 F idk when her bday is) as well as my S/O (19M). I’ve tried all sorts of tactics when it comes to splitting chores, holding each other accountable, etc. Most recently I made a list of all household responsibilities categorized by time. We each have 1 chore that is a big one, and 3 small ones. To help make sure my roommate would do her chores I allowed her to pick first what she wanted to be responsible for, then my boyfriend picked, and I took on what was left. Well my boyfriend then started working full time (we were all 3 uni students until this) so he took both the roommates and I’s large chores and one small chore from each list. So now there are 4 small tasks that my roommate and I are jointly in charge of. Those tasks are currently: dishwasher, counters, fridge, and stove/oven. I thought this would work well because we are both busy students and can help each other out, but now they have basically just become my chores. She will do them when reminded multiple times, but I’m not her mom I don’t feel that it is my responsibility to remind her of the chores. When she had her own chores they also didn’t get done which is why I thought doing them together would be easier since I could text her “hey I ran the dishwasher so it will need emptying” without the nagging aspect. 

On top of this, she has been keeping dishes in her room for multiple days, then clearing them all out at once. We’ve been running out of plates (we have 8 BIG plates and 8 lunch sized plates so this shouldn’t be an issue), forks (again we have 8) and spoons (we have 11). When she takes the dishes out all at once like this they don’t all fit in the dishwasher so she will stack what doesn’t fit on the counter. I then run the dishwasher once I realize she’s filled it, notify her, she doesn’t empty it so I do. I then leave her dishes on the counter for a day or two hoping she will rinse them and put them in, which again doesn’t ever happen.

Like I said, I’m a uni student, so I am busy and don’t like to spend my couple free hours a week cleaning up after her. She will be moving out in a few months thank god but aside from charger her a cleaning fee I’m at a loss of what to do. We’ve lived together for about 8 months and for the first couple she did chores without needing to be asked and we hadn’t even implemented a chart yet.

"AITA for ordering for 15 people at McDonald's? Hi, I'm Karla, and the rest of my name is in my username. I'm currently a mom of 13, including my real kids, adopted kids, foster kids, and some kidnappees by choice. Let me introduce you to their real names. My current daughters are Havana, Dream, Celia, Willow, Vida, Maria, and Lola, and our current sons are Dark, Man, Bam, Ed, Yotuel, and Carti. Being a mom of 13 means I have a husband (Shawn) because where else would my biological kids come from? To answer my your question, they come from many places actually, but a few are actually his. Just a few though haha.

Some context, we don't eat out much because it's hard to find seating (some of us require multiple seats, not me though but y'all stay safe). Our butler can usually use doordash/dine'n'dash to order anything we want, but my worst nightmare happened this weekend when Bailey left on an emergency trip to attend some wedding-funeral amalgam. This meant one of three things for my familia:

1. *I make food*. ***No***, I can't do that. I haven't prepared my own food since I lived in an ingredient household before my parents won the lottery when I was 6.
2. *Shawn make food*. **No.**
3. *We eat out*. **Sigh**, this was the only option.

The other issue is that neither I nor Shawn drive. I've never had a license in my life, and Shawn has only driven our two-decker tractor trailer Tesla illegally (he also has no license). This meant we had to walk, all 15 of us. Finally, we stumbled upon a restaurant. I don't know if it's a well-known chain or not because I'm not very educated on plastic food, but it's called ""McDonald's"". They're slogan is ""I LUV IT"", and though I knew I wouldn't like the food, I thought it'd at least help me gaslight myself into being slightly okay with it. Little did I know I wouldn't taste a bite.

All 15 of us walked up to the counter. There was a line, but I was happy to let people go behind me. When we got to the front, I asked a simple question to the two female or male workers or employees, ""What do you have for us to eat?"" They both looked shocked, so I again repeated my question, ""What will you give us to eat?"" They both looked shocked, so I again repeated my question, ""HAND OVER THE FOOD YOU DUMB F\*\*\*S"". I agree, this was a nasty thing to say, but I gave them three chances to serve us food, and they wasted all of them.

One of them said, ""uh, ma'am, you'll need to pay for anything you order."" Wow, minimum wage workers really think we need to pay them? But how else will they stay minimum wage, hm? Whatever. I apologized silently and slapped $30 on the table. That's $15.50 EACH, which is plenty, so I expected our food. Then the other one of them asked what we wanted to order. Order? I gave him or her a reality check, ""I want to order McDonald's!"" and she or him just said ""Okay, please start your order."" AUGH! The 15 of us left, foodless and hungry. I had to take an online course to figure out how to use doordash, so we finally ended up eating dinner at 2:00 AM. Our country has ❌ failed us.

"AITA for initiating a kiss with a best friend while drunk? So, I (17M) have a friend (17F) who I have known for five years.  Recently, I found out that our parents used to hang out together when they were young. Her dad has been dead for 6 years and recently she wanted to meet with people who knew her dad. That's why she wanted to meet my mom. 

Two days ago, we went to my place so she could meet her. We all talked together, laughed, played the guitar and had a good time and everything was going great. Then we went to my room so I can finish a school project and she went with me.

One thing led to another and shortly after we were drunk. And now, I'm not a type of person who takes kissing too seriously, for me it's like handshaking. 

So I asked her if she wanted to kiss me and she said yes. Note we were both drunk. We made out until all of a sudden she got upset. Few minutes later she left and I followed her to the uber. After that I came back home and went to sleep.

After I woke up, I saw a couple of messages from her saying that it shoudn't have been like that and how she despises herself and me. I tried to calm her down and I kept apologizing, saying I didn't know she would take it like that.

She forgot her headphones at my place so the next day I brought them to school to return them., but I didn't have the chance to see her. After I finished school I noticed that she had blocked me on instagram and also told some of her friends to block me, apparently.

"AITA for walking in front of wheelchair person? Was walking toward a store in a mall. I hear a voice behind me ""Hey"".

I responded ""you could slow down or go around"" they replied, ""oh well, you will get run over then"" I ignored this and kept walking toward the store. I guess my thought was that the normal rules of movement apply to everyone.

This includes the family on her side I do talk to (mainly her parents, two of her siblings and her two siblings five kids aka my cousins). I talk to them because they were there for me.

The reason for the estrangement? I don't like who she became after my dad died. I was 8 when he passed and 9 when my mom suddenly announced that all photos of dad, all of his clothes and possessions and anything to do with him were being boxed up and sent to his parents because she wanted us to move on from dad and she wanted to be married again and she didn't want her new husband to be uncomfortable seeing her dead husband's face everywhere and she wanted me to like and love whoever she married and didn't want me to cling to a dead man who was not coming back and was no longer part of our lives. She refused to let me have a photo or two for my room and told me she would not fight with me and had already fought with his parents because they were outraged she wanted to throw all of his stuff and photos in the trash. From that day on my mom was cold toward me if I even attempted to bring up my dad. She did remarry, she had three (possibly more after I left) more kids. She married a man who was bitter that I wouldn't call him dad and refused to change my last name to his and accept him adopting me. My mother was furious with me for stopping the adoption. They had spent thousands on a lawyer who they felt would be able to push it through regardless of my feelings..

When I moved out at 16 I spent two weeks with maternal grandparents before going to my paternal grandparents and the relatives I mentioned above continued being supporting and understanding even after I left the state.

But now that has changed. They brought up inviting my mother and her family to my wedding several times and I told them nothing had changed for me. They would try to make persuasive arguments as to why I should invite her and let her be there for this day. I got a little firmer with them and then they changed course and said that I should invite her other children with them, so we can have a relationship. I refused that too. Then they brought up how important it is to invite my mother. Which is when I told them if they bring it up again or try anything to get her there, they can be uninvited. I told them I would make them leave on the day if I had to.

They told me there was no reason to be so harsh toward them.

"AITA for mixing food and offending partner's family? I(23f Chinese Australian) have been dating Andrew (26m Half Vietnamese half Australian) for 4 years, and regularly stay at his place on the weekend. He lives at home with his parents and older sister Hayley (30f). Not too long ago, Hayley suggested that since I stay over often, I should start paying them for groceries and bills, though I'm still a student so they aren't too strict with the amount. I transfer them $50-100 here and there to cover my share. His family treats me very well and I respect them, I have been really happy in my relationship so what happened today was quite shocking to me.

Andrew's mother, Louise (60f), is Vietnamese and cooks amazing food regularly. I love her cooking! Today she had cooked a delicious pork rib and taro soup, and I ate some for lunch. At dinner, Andrew was going to make some instant noodles, so I asked him to make me a pack of Shin Ramen (Korean spicy noodles). When it was done, I decided I wanted some of the pork rib in my noodle, and mix some of the soup in my bowl. Louise hastily stopped me, saying that no I should not mix the soup with my ramen. I was confused. Andrew came over and said the pork rib soup should be eaten alone and not mixed with my spicy noodles, since the flavors are different.

I argued that Koreans also eat spicy rib soup, so it shouldn't be too weird, and since I've had the rib soup by itself for lunch, I wanted to try a different flavor. However Louise insisted that the way I mix food is wrong, and Andrew said I should just eat my spicy noodles and maybe come back for a bowl of soup later. The argument got quite heated as I didn't understand why mixing food is such a crime (this had happened a few times before, when I added different condiments or mixed stir-fry with noodles, Louise pointed out that my eating habits are strange, but she never said more than that). Then I got overwhelmed and ran to Andrew's room and started crying. Hayley barged in and began yelling at me (she's normally kind to me, but she does have a bit of a tempter) ""why are you throwing a tantrum in someone else's house? We are feeding you food and you're so ungrateful!""

I was really upset because I think I did nothing wrong, so in the heat of the moment I stood up and screamed back ""I paid for the food, why should you care how I eat? I'm not forcing you to eat what I eat! If I go to a restaurant and pay for a plate of food, you think they'd kick me out for eating the food wrong? How ridiculous!"" In the end, I was so angry I packed my bags and stormed out of their house (after Hayley got so mad she said I'm no longer welcome at their house), and now I'm on the way home and crying, wondering what I did wrong. It really doesn't make sense! I tried to put myself in their shoes, and say if Andrew wanted to eat Chinese dumplings with tomato sauce, my Chinese family and I would not care at all (we'd just laugh it off due to personal tastes). So AITA for mixing food/having different food preferences and upsetting my partner's family?",0.5
"AITA for entertaining kids during my shift? I (26F) work as a waitress and lately I’ve been making an effort to entertain kids at our restaurant. Specifically when the parents seem overwhelmed I offer to give the kids a “tour of the restaurant” just to get them away from the parents for a breather. I also offer to hold babies when they are crying. My coworkers recently told me this was super weird. 

I just feel like parents need a break and I like kids (I was almost an elementary teacher before I got scared of the salary and treatment). 

Is this weird or uncomfortable for parents? I don’t want anyone to feel uncomfortable. I thought it was nice but I know that there are true creepers out there so I understand caution. Idk???",0.19
"AITA for not speaking French? I'm 40 and have been married to my French husband for 12 years. We have 2 kids 10 and 8 and live in the UK where we met 17 years ago when my husband was learning English/working abroad. It was a whirlwind romance that saw us do long distance for 2 years but now we are all happily settled in the UK. 
Over the years my SIL, also 40 has become increasingly hostile towards us. She is single, with no kids but speaks perfect English. She has a great job but is constantly moving around and just doesn't seem to settle anywhere.
Everytime we visit my PIL, she visits aswell and is constantly complaining about us. When the kids were toddlers it was because we ate too early or we didn't help with the cooking, we were too noisy, kids woke her up in the night (because they were scared and she wouldn't let them use her childhood room next door to my husband's so they couldn't find us in the night), kids didn't speak French etc. 
Wherever possible we have tried accomodating her requests. (Kids squeezed into our room which in 40 degrees heat in the Summer is fun!) Changing mealtimes when possible, taking the kids out as much as we can. But she is never happy and most years ends in a screaming match.
Yesterday it came to a head. I said enough was enough after yet another screaming match, brought them both together and said we need to move on. When I spoke with her, it all comes down mostly to the fact that I don't speak French and they kids aren't French enough (in addition to many other petty things). 
AITA for not learning French? My children attend a a private French school 1 day a week and do speak, read and write French (granted not at the same level as French kids their age but not far off it) and I have always helped with reading and homework. They only watch TV in French and we encourage them wherever possible to carry on the French traditions but obviously they will speak English the majority of the time and aren't yet quite fluent/old enough to translate everything. I can understand a lot of French conversation but over the years have withdrawn from speaking as I am no longer comfortable with making mistakes and feeling judged.
AITA? What more can I do to ease the tension?
 (my husband no longer wants to visit France because of her and his parents won't step in or help the situation). I am worried our children will end up the same way.",0.06

"AITAH for being glad my friend was murdered? Before I start I respectfully ask for no politics in the comments. 

I (22M) am an Israeli, my friend (20M) was a tank driver in the IDF on the date of October 7th. His tank was overwhelmed and the entire crew was believed to be taken hostage to Gaza. 

For the following 5 months I prayed every single day that he will return alive and well but a couple of weeks ago the military told his family that he died while in the tank and his corpse is still in Gaza (the family decided to halt the funeral until the body is recovered) 

I initially was devastated by the news of his death. I cried for literal hours but the more I think about it the more I’m glad at least he wasn’t taken hostage alive because of the possible torture he would experience. 

I’m really conflicted about my feelings and I’m not sure what to think anymore ",0.34
"AITA- 3 day wedding dilemma   My partner and I are going on two years together. We live together, have two dogs together, etc. Since our time dating, his family has been a priority generally over us. I completely understand that, especially during our first year. As we have progressed and have had discussions of future life plans, the dynamics have shifted though. 

All holidays last year revolved around his family including birthdays etc. I was unable to see mine. His father sadly passed away last year as well so he was also gone multiple periods of time in  between the holidays. On Christmas, after his father passed, he stayed with his family for 4 days and 3 nights and I spent the holidays completely alone. 

Side note- my family, who is made of just my stepdad, helped us move. My partners family did not. 

In between each holiday, I also had COVID and RSV and still managed to keep the house running, go to work, and care for the dogs. 

We have, unfortunately, had an emergency in the house with one of our dogs. Keep in mind, these dogs are our kids. Our 8 year old had a serious leg injury that required extensive surgery from her wrist to her upper leg. It was either that or amputation. We opted for the surgery since her back legs aren’t the best due to years of abuse before we rescued her. 

The surgery has a 3 month healing process and she has to be monitored 24/7. When I mean 24/7, I’m dead serious. She needs a cover for her leg if she potties. She can’t walk anyway if outside so we have to leash her and hobble her outside to do her thing and bring her back in. She can’t jump, play, go on stairs etc. she can’t get her soft case wet at all.  She’s on enough pain medication to kill a horse. We take her weekly for bandage changes and lifting a 60 pound heffer is no easy feat. Did I mention that she has severe crate anxiety so we can’t crate her? 

 Currently, we rotate schedules which allows one of us to shower at one time and one of us to sleep downstairs with her so she doesn’t fuck up that 10k surgery leg. We also work from home (Thank God) so on certain days we have flexibility when things are difficult with her. 

Now, here’s the dilemma. My partners mothers birthday is in 1 week and in 3 weeks it’s his brothers 3 day wedding. The wedding is on Friday with an intimate reception. Saturday is another reception where everyone not invited to the wedding comes. Sunday is Greek Easter and the family are hosting the brides family for the first time for that. 

My partner and I agreed that he could go to his mom’s birthday and stay overnight and come back.For the wedding, he would go Friday attend the wedding and intimate reception, and come home mis-day Saturday. (His family lives 4 hours away one way so it’s not a quick skip hop). 

His family is demanding him there for all 3 days for the wedding. They brushed off the fact I’m not there and sure as heck cared less the extensive stuff with our dog at home. Im at my wits end with his family. Am I the asshole?

"AITA for telling my classmate she should probably drop out? AITA for telling my classmate she should probably drop out?

I’m currently in my first year of law school and overall, I’m pretty happy with my choice. It’s a good uni, I like the professors and I think law is pretty fun. Of course I don’t love everything about it, there are subjects that I find boring and I’m not always motivated, but overall I’m happy, you get the picture.
A mate of mine, however, let’s call her Ann, is currently struggling. We’re not best friends but friendly at least and we hang out in the cafeteria regularly with a few other people. We’ve had exams recently and I’ve been doing quite well, whereas Ann has barely passed them. Failing a class or two in law school is pretty standard. Ann, however, has always been top of her class and is very unhappy about her grades. She has been complaining all semester and now it’s become even worse. She’s been complaining constantly about how hard it is and how boring and how she spends all day in the library studying.
She then said something along the lines of „no one can find this stuff interesting, right? But we just have to push through and when we finish school we’ll be earning tons of money“. I honestly thought it was a joke and laughed, but she meant it and reacted irritated. So I asked her if she really didn’t like any of the courses? To which she replied no, she didn’t. So I asked if she really wanted to continue law school then, since it’ll be years before we graduate and it can’t be healthy to force herself to spend every waking hour with topics she apparently hates. So if she really didn’t enjoy any of it, she could maybe pursue a degree that suited her more. 
She kinda blew up on me, telling me to stop rubbing my grades in everyone’s faces (which I wasn’t, I only mentioned them once a few days earlier when I was explicitly asked about them). She also told me it was none of my business what degree she pursued and I shouldn’t have humiliated her like that in front of everyone else. Most of my mates are on my side but some also think I shouldn’t have been so blunt. So, AITA?",0.21
"AITA for expecting friends to care and make an effort_ Alright, so here's the lowdown. Five months back, me (F20) and this guy (M24) and other friend (F21) hit it up while gaming. We were like two peas in a pod, chatting every single day in our group chat. But then, things took a nosedive. He stopped giving a damn about me, started tossing around mean remarks, and it got to me, wrecking our trio in the process. He even said that he preferred our other friend over me and that I was asking too much by expecting him to care. January rolls around, and he drops the bomb that he can't stand me, my humor, or my personality, and he never wants to be my friend again. 

Come mid-February, we hash things out a bit, but I'm not exactly jumping for joy. Meanwhile, I've made new friends who actually give a damn about me, but somehow, he creeps back into the picture, even though I can't fully trust him. Then, we have this conversation that ends with him blocking me everywhere.

So, here's the kicker: he starts gabbing about this girl he met in the game. Suddenly, he's starts ditching everyone else. I try to tell him that's not exactly the healthiest approach, especially if things with her don't pan out (they're not even dating yet, but he's already calling her his partner).  He's adamant that I'll never be up in his life and i just have to deal with it.

He goes on this spiel about ranking his friendships into tiers. Apparently, I'm in the second tier—someone he trusts and chats with but doesn't really care about. And he says thats is even harder for him to be friends with girl bc they all turn to eb abnormally stupid.

I call him out on this nonsense, saying he can't expect me to consider him a friend if he flat-out admits he doesn't care about me. He fires back, saying I should spill my guts to him regardless of how he feels.

I try to explain that people won't feel comfortable opening up to someone who couldn't care less about them. But he's convinced that affection and effort are only for romantic relationships.

He has the gall to blame my supposed lack of friends on me being too demanding and having unrealistic expectations. I remind him that expecting people to care isn't just a dating thing; it's basic human decency.

In the end, I lay it all out for him, calling out his messed-up way of looking at life and hoping he sees the light someday. I say that havind tiers for friends is insane, not caring for people like they could just die is insane, that people should feel comfortable around him even if he doesn't care nor tries to care is insane, but he blocks me saying that he was trying to help but i was being just me.

"AITA For giving my girlfriend mixed messages causing her not to believe me?  My gf and I have been together for two years. We live together. I love her and 100% plan on marrying her. She comes from a broken home, so she had to grow up very quickly and sometimes I think it causes her to see things from a rushed perspective. After a long conversation last night, I realized that she thinks I’m giving her mixed signals. 

It started when I came home from work and we talked about our day. We were talking about families, and I told her that I’ve been thinking about what it would be like to have a daughter to come home to. How cute it would be. And how I’ve been thinking about that all day. 

Immediately, she says “Ok so let’s get it moving” in a joking way. And I said not yet baby we are only living in a one bedroom, and we don’t have the space and money. Then she apologized and said she was joking. 

We both have talked about marriage and children and she knows it’s what I want. It’s just not something I want/am able to do *right now* 

We have discussed in detail about our wedding and other things. 

So in our conversation, she said she feels lead on and confused by my timeline because I asked her questions about a ring she had on when we were out drinking. I said “is that the type of ring shape you like? What shape do you like?” And I’m guessing that made her think a proposal was coming on Valentine’s Day. 

I don’t have a specific timeline or date I want, I just want to be financially comfortable and in a bigger place. I was honestly quite offended when she thought I would purposely lead her on and lie about everything ",0.14
"AITA for ditching my best friend? I've been best friends with this guy since the 5th grade, I'm an only child with an abusive single mother so I saw him as my brother. His parents never liked me mostly because of my mom, and one time when they actually let me use their pool I had to use their shower first. It bugged me even then.
Getting older I had to ask him to hang out, if I didn't he wouldn't talk to me. I got him Christmas gifts, birthday presents, random things I saw he might like. But he only ever got me a gift card once, and that bugged me. 
About 2 years ago he started dating a girl who just turned 18, he's 26 and it bothered me a little but she's of age so whatever ig. She just acts like she's 15, throwing tantrums, screaming to get his attention, drinking all of his alcohol when he's not looking. And his mom texted me trying to get ME to do something, the relationship was tearing the family apart.
I was in the hospital because of my bulimia and asked him to please visit, he said not this time he's with his gf. I texted her saying ""You're interfering with my relationship with my brother and I'd appreciate if you talked to him about it, if you're around I won't be."" She took a screenshot and didn't answer. So, I texted him saying I care about him greatly but as long as she's around I won't be and that his mother and sister are worried about him.
He responded ""you've always been a burden and I'm tired of your depression and anxiety, if you don't like her you can disappear"" so I did, I blocked him and never talked to him again. AITA? He's going through a lot internally and I just left",0.42
"AITA for staying at a hotel whenever my parents come to visit since they won't. I love my parents completely. I can handle them in small doses. 

They insist on staying with me and my family when they visit. Which means kicking one of the kids out of their room so my parents get a bed. 

I have told them that I will pay for a hotel so that we can all be comfortable. They say it is too much trouble.  Then they take over my house and start criticizing everything. It just grates on my nerves. My dad also stakes out the tv in the family room and leaves it on Fox News all day. 

They were here for a week over Easter. I booked a hotel for myself, and my family and I left them the house. 

They got upset since they had travelled all that way to spend time with us. But here's the thing. My kids got off to school.on time because they didn't have to try and eat the massive breakfast my mom insists they have every day. There were no fights over the tv. We had dinner together every night but the kids got to sleep at their regular times since my parents couldn't keep them up. 

We spent Easter weekend completely with my folks. We made food together. We took everyone to the new Ghostbusters movie. Then we went to the hotel and slept in comfort. 

My mom says she is disappointed that I would do this. I reminded her that I had literally seen her crying when my grandmother, her mom, would stress her out during visits. I asked her why she stopped inviting her parents to visit. And why we always stayed at hotels when we visited my grandparents. 

She said it was completely different since all her parents did was criticize how she did things. I asked her for a list of all the things she said about my house and family that were not critical. The list consisted of greetings and congratulations to my son over graduating from grade six this year. 

She had the grace to look embarrassed. But she still said that we should stay home when they visit. I agreed that we would spend the night until her or my dad said something insulting. Long story short we spent that night at a hotel as well.

"AITA for texting my boss too early in the morning? So i've been sick the past few days, I worked Monday but started getting worse as the day went on. By time I got home Monday I had a fever and went to bed very early hoping to sleep it off by the morning. I slept from 5pm-3am, but woke up miserable (Tuesday morning). I tried to get myself together but couldn't so at 3:52am I texted my boss that I wouldn't make it in. And yes that is early, but for context, our work day starts at 6:30am. I know, because he has told me, that he wakes up at 4am every day. And my boss has even texted ME at 4am before (I don't wake up until 5). So I figured a text 6min before he usually wakes up wouldn't be anything to be concerned about? He responded to me in less than a minute so i went back to bed and slept all day.

Today (Wednesday) I still am sick but don't have a fever so i'm back at work. My boss ended up telling me ""you can't text me at 3am anymore"". I was kinda confused, and apologized immediately. He elaborated and said that my text woke him and his wife up. I apologized again and I really do feel bad for waking them. But he was almost upset at me... for a single text 6min before his alarms go off and surely wakes the both of them? He told me that he felt bad having to respond to me while in bed and that his wife was asking questions and instead of him telling her it was me and that I was just calling off sick... he said he told her ""it's a female at work who is not feeling well"". 

I honestly feel like he's making this more weird than it is. I've met his wife once before and talked to her on the phone 2 or 3 times when my boss was out sick for a very long stretch of time. She literally knows me. I wouldn't say he's ""angry"" at me but he seemed pretty passionate about it and kinda aggressive? I've worked here for about 8 months now and feel like i know him pretty well, we get along good and everything.

My other point... if you and your spouse are such light sleepers that's a single text wakes you both up.... why do you have your ringer on? I keep mine off almost 24/7, a text wouldn't wake me, but if it would I'd be extra sure to keep the volume off.

"AITA for not attending sister in law’s baby shower after miscarriage? I miscarried around 7 months ago with my first baby at around 14 weeks. I found it really tough and have been struggling emotionally ever since, every cycle when I’m not pregnant. 

A week or so after I miscarried I found out that my sister in law is expecting her first baby. We aren’t particularly close but get along well when we are at family gatherings.
She didn’t reach out with sympathies and I realised later because she was pregnant and probably didn’t know what to say. 

Her baby shower is in just over a month and we were desperately hoping to conceive before then so I’d have no issues with going, but we are having no luck. The baby shower is around the time I would have been due and I just can’t face going.

I have sent my apologies and explained the situation that I’m happy for her but I’d just find it too traumatic  but have not received a response and I feel as if the relationship is damaged slightly with myself and my partners family (there are lots of sisters).

"AITA For Snapping At My Boyfriend For Hitting My Vape? I (f22), have been with my boyfriend (m25) for around 4 years now. We are very similar, hardly ever fight, and love each other a lot. Some people might think we have the perfect relationship. But there is one consistent problem: the vape situation. We are both severely addicted to nicotine (as are most young ppl these days unfortunately due to the convenience and pleasant taste of vaping). I do my best to have a juice refill schedule and keep my vape in good, working condition. He does not, and constantly has a burnt coil or yucky juice. So he hits my vape when his gets gross. On the rare occasion that my vape is out of commission, I'll hit his too until I can repair it. Think every few days vs once every few weeks. When I go to hit my vape and he is holding it/hitting it/hits it again I get extremely irritable because I want that instant gratification and he is delaying it for me. It also makes me go through juice and coils much quicker than if it was just me. My pod will frequently be burnt from him hitting it without juice. Recently he has decided to quit vaping and switch to dip. Not my cup of tea, but whatever. I thought this would finally be the end of the issue. Right? Wrong. He still hits mine all the time, even though he still has a vape and chooses to let it stay burned and gross. A couple nights ago I was critically low on juice and all the smoke shops were closed, so I had to make what I had last until the morning. I asked my bf to not hit my vape that night, and to hit his burnt one if he needed to. He took a couple of last hits of mine, then agreed. I took a last couple of hits and then put it away under the pillow so I wouldn't touch it anymore and burn my coil. I woke up in the morning to him standing over me and hitting my vape, which was completely out of juice. I sat up quickly and said ""Wtf are you doing?"" He replied ""Is it out of juice?"" ""YES I LITERALLY ASKED YOU NOT TO HIT IT."" He then tossed me his burnt gross one to hit instead. I gave him some dirty looks. Things have been a little tense since then. I know this whole situation is really stupid and not a big deal, but the addiction aspect makes it feel like it is. I do feel a little guilty for snapping at him, but I don't think I'm being unreasonable here expecting him to handle his own nicotine issues instead of roping me into them. I don't want to use his dip or burnt vape, I just want him to not use mine stuff. So fellow addicts and redditors, AITA? ",0.31
"AITA if bc i don't want to go to my brothers wedding? I moved from MA to FL 22 years ago, fam still lives there. Now, my baby brother has been to Florida 7 times since my 6 yo was born, twice since my 3 yo. Not once has he come to visit us and he's never met them. In fact, the last time he came to visit me was like 15 years ago when he moved down her and stayed with me rent free before giving up and crawling back to mommy. Anyways, now he's getting married in October, a trash time of year on cape cod, and he's not allowing kids at the wedding or reception.

edit: i do talk to my brother often, we do use harsh language with each other, as is customary in MA, i have visited home a ton of times up until my kids were born 6 yrs ago and have been up once since alone, I'm not saying he should change his plans to make me happy or anything of the sort. I'm simply saying if he doesn't want the kids there then that's ok, but be prepared for not everyone to be able to make it. He thinks we should all go, ""so at least the family can see the boys"" (ironically) and when i told him it would be just me and i may not even be able to go, THAT'S when i got called an AH. He expects us both to attend as though i can simply find a baby sitter for two special needs kids 1400 miles away from where we live and everyone i know who won't be at the wedding, and his reasoning is that if their friends who have kids have to take their kids, they won't ""party"" with them. additionally, i don't even want to go BECAUSE he hasn't in my opinion put forth the effort to be a real part of my life, and i would rather spend the money on a real vacation with my kids that they will enjoy, rather than fly them up to a place where there's nothing for them to do and we'll all be too cold to enjoy being on cape cod.",0.33

 the other day i got home from work(12am), went to shower and the shower head burst. i tried to twist it and pop it back in but it was clear to me this was something i couldn’t fix myself. the next day i called my landlord (11am) and he spoke to me as if i was a little girl at the mechanic. very condescending and belittling my problem. he said “i’ll be by this afternoon to show you how these things work.” i let his attitude slide bc he’s my landlord after all and i just wanted to shower. i put my whole day aside to wait for him and finally called him around 5/6pm when i’d cleaned my whole house for him and he still wasn’t there. he was there in the next 20 minutes. my shower is fixed now but when he came in he didn’t say hi, barley looked at me, and huffing n puffing like a kid.
 he made a point to tell me how pissed off he was that i called him out for this repair and that he thought i was joking. i understand that it might not be a difficult repair but i’m literally just a girl(22) plus since i rent i don’t wanna make mistakes while learning and fuck his apt up. the way i see it he coulda sent one of his maintenance team members or saved face/ate his words when he realized i wasn’t lying about having a problem. when you own and rent out a place people are paying you for a functioning household so wouldn’t it be HIS JOB to repair things on his property???? i’m just at a loss because i’ve had a good experience here/with my landlord but i dont think the situation called for him to be so annoyed and to lash out at me.

"AITA for outing my(F30) husband(M30) in front of all his colleagues. My husband cheated on me. He cheated with a man and I caught them *right* outside our home making out. I said nothing when my husband walk into our home and continued being silent on this matter until I fully processed what I had saw.  
  
After moping and being sad all I had was anger. I stalked them. Got some pictures.  
  
I went to my husband's work place and simply started throwing them like confetti and left.  
  
  
  
Here's where I might be TA: My sister is bi and when she heard what I did she was angry at me, for outing him so publicly. We live in a pretty conservative country, where only recently LGBTQ+ marriages were legalized. So she said even if I was mad at him I shouldn't be using his identity to harm him.  
  
However, if he wasn't bi and I had other dirt on him I would have *absolutely* used that to ruin his life. I have zero care about his well-being.",0.9
"AITA for not agreeing with my husband on what religion to raise our kids   
My (20F) husband (42M) of 2 years cannot come to an agreement, he was raised catholic but doesn’t really believe in organized religion, after a long journey i came back to what i was raised with, Jehovahs witness. About 6 months ago. im 6 weeks pregnant after a long battle with infertility.  
we started talk about what religion to raise them, he believes a lot of misconceptions about mine, even when i correct them. The closest we could come to an agreement was he said i teach them mine and he teaches then what be believes without organized Religion. Also threatened me that if any happened to our kids ( as in “things” with a child ) he would never forgive me, i assured him that i would never let that happen and told him I wouldn’t be doing this if I didn’t believe it was best, and asked him to trust my judgement. He got mad and told me i was using 1950s reasoning against him in asking that he trust my judgement.  
the closest church is an hour drive away, and he made it very clear he would not attend (never asked him too) although having help with the kids would’ve been nice.  
i don’t know what to do, I can’t have him undermining everything i say, telling my kids religion is poison and what im teaching them is wrong. I also don’t believe is celebrating birthdays and Christmas and i know he will make a huge issue with this. When it was just me he would ignore it, i’d get a bit of a cold shoulder around the holidays but that was it. But i know with kids i’ll never hear the end of it,  
i’ve been tiptoeing around the subject since the first discussion, i don’t how to talk to him or even what to say. I was pretty confused about religion and what I believed when we got married, but i knew i wouldn’t convert to catholicism (made that very clear) so we were married infront of a judge, his whole family hates my religion and constantly pressures me to change, i don’t know how to deal with this when we have kids

so am i the asshole for not just caving in and letting him decide?

"AITA for seeking a little more in life, even if I should’ve sought it out sooner? I avoided dating and relationships for a myriad reasons. Most of them revolve around trauma such as abandonment issues, shame around sex, not being in a healthy environment etc.

I am working on these issues and can see that I'm getting better. I'm not boasting but I have got a decent personality, a great sense of humor, and I'm into music. I am often seen as a wholesome dude but I find it hard to make romantic advances, I’ve been having terrible luck with it.

I’ve tried flirting with a few single coworkers but that idea went downhill.  Most of Tinder is in their 20s which I feel somewhat intimidated by.  I’ve been trying my luck at a singles bar, but that also had bad consequences.  The women thought I was a creep and the staff asked me to stop.  Now I have somewhat of a reputation for having asked out around 15 women in the past year.  AITA?",0.5

Recently ive been stuck on this one phrase that i just cant stop saying. My best friend, lets call them J, said that it was getting annoying. I love J with my whole heart, they have been my best friend for four years, coming on five, and i cant imagine ever hating them. They have been there for me when my own family wasnt. But i cant just stop saying this, so when J said ""can you stop saying that, its getting a little annoying?"" I responded with ""No."" J knows im on the autism spectrum and that i have certain stims i cnat stop. This isone of them as i said before, ive tried stopping saying it but sometimes it slips out, J has anger issues and gets annoyed very easily but we've never gotten into fights too big because i know how to help calm them, but this i just cant stop saying.

"AITA for not wanting to give up on cigarettes? I (20F) been smoking for years, but when I first met my boyfriend (25M) I tried to stop smoking since he doesn’t like it, and if I love him I should quit smoking 
Thing many non smokers don’t understand is the feeling that cigarettes give you, they only think it’s bad for your health and that it’s gonna kill you 
Smoking makes me feel alive, keeps me motivated and brings me joy even though it’s not good 
My boyfriend does not want me to smoke anymore due to not having health problems when I get older so he won’t have to deal with a sick person 
“If you love me then stop smoking” this is what he is telling me but what if I would say “ If you love me then let me smoke”… This is a big issue in our relationship and it’s hard for me to give up smoking but I don’t wanna lose him and I promised him that I will stop. This is driving me crazy cuz it feels like I lost a part of me, like I lost my spark 
I loved listening music, playing, drinking some soda or energy drinks while smoking it was making me feel alive and wanting to give my best in that game 
I lost motivation and it affects him as well, but what can I do…

"AITA for expecting my friend to ditch pre made plans to attend my birthday? I (24F) have a very small circle of friends, and after my last breakup 1 1/2 years ago, it became even smaller. To keep it short, one of my friends ""Jenna""(25F) was making my life during this hard time even harder by making up lies about my ex (like, that he thought I was unatractive), lies about me (for example, that I have an eating disorder) and when I confronted her about it, she told me ""I'm only doing that for your own good."". She never clarified how that was supposed to make things better, but I cunt contact with her for a while. A few months later, I tried to reach out to her and resolve things (because she went around saying I made everything up) but she said I hurt her beyond repair and never wants to hear from me ever again. Fine by me.

So anyways. My birthday is coming up, and I always celebrate on the day of my birthday, or the upcoming saturday if my birthday is on a weekday, which is not the case this year. Birthdays are very important to me, because I was bullied in school and never had the nice birthday experiences, and all my friends know that, especially my best friend ""Casey""(26F). Yesterday on one of our calls, I brought up my birthday, and since I moved further away, I offered that she could stay at my place if she doesn't wanna drive home late or wants to drink. She got really weird and then admited that Jenna had invited her and one other friend from our circle for a picknick and photoshoot on the same day (something Jenna and I wanted to do when we were still friends). 

I asked her what the issue is, since she obviously declined, but Casey admited that she had in fact accepted. She said that it didn't seem like a big deal to her, because i could simply move my birthday party. I told her that I wasn't just angry that she should know how much my birthday means to me, but also at the fact that she is clearly ignoring what Jenna is doing (scheduling a shoot we wanted to do on my birthday, and yes, we were friends long enough that she knows when I celebrate my birthday). 

Besides that, there is no other weekend I can postpone my party to since there are a lot of Birthdays around that time in my family, and every other weekend, I am at someone elses birthday, or baptism, or wedding. I also explained, that I don't want to schedule my birthday on a week day, since I won't have time for setting up everything and I also don't want to get up early the next moring.

Casey said I'm beeing an AH since I'm putting her in the position of choosing sides over a birthday, but I told her that I frankly do not care, since I'm not the one who started this whole thing, and she would not be in this position if she hadn't accepted. Also, I was hurt enough Casey still keeps close contact to Jenna, knowing how badly she treated me, but I thought this didn't have to affect Caseys and my relationship. So if she is willing to let Jenna get between us now, I don't see a need for her to be in my life at all since this will just keep happening.",0.89

"AITAH for telling my dad I need space? I(f 19) and my dad(50) usually have an alright relationship but over the last few months, things have become more difficult between us. Last night, I made my brother(10) some food to take with him on the way to a lesson because he didn't have time to eat before they left. Before I made the food, however, I asked my dad and brother who both said yes(my brother probably wasn't even listening to what I asked). I made the food and gave it to my brother who then said he didn't want it. I was frustrated but just left it for him to decide what to do with it. A few minutes later, my brother came into the kitchen asking for the same food I had just given him but he wanted us to take it to our mom's house(our parents are divorced) after his class. I told him no and that he could just take what I made and eat it later. I can't remember exactly what happened next but for some reason, my brother and I were still arguing about the food when my dad came in the room. My dad began to get frustrated with me and said my brother could eat what he wanted I eventually said okay fine and just dropped it but my dad kept going on and on about. I eventually said to him, ""Can I please just have some space, I need space."" My dad took this as me trying to shut down the conversation(for context I have made it very clear to my dad in the past that my asking for space is lonely when I am overwhelmed and doesn't mean we can never talk). He then began going on at me about how I can't ask for space in the middle of a conversation(It was not a conversation, I wasn't talking. Also, when else are you supposed to ask for space? I am not gonna ask for space when I am alone) I eventually stood up and got kinda made him. I tried to explain to him how asking for space isn't rude(at least I don't think it is) but he would not listen to me and I could barely get a word in. I am a very emotional person and began to cry during this which my dad took as me trying to guilt-trip him. I then snapped and yelled at him about how I was trying to not cry most of the time and how I was incredibly stressed. Eventually, he just left and we haven't spoken since. My sister, mom, and friend all think I was in the right( my sister and dad have got into a much worse argument where the police were nearly called) I don't know why, but my dad tends to take everything very personally and it makes it difficult for me to even feel comfortable talking to him.

After speaking with her multiple times prior to booking my trip, she has given me multiple ultimatums with our relationship. “If you go to Europe I won’t be able to handle it and breakup with you”. She is an emotional person and a great girlfriend which was why I was surprised to hear this. 

I was on the side of not going for the longest time until my friend decided it would be a great idea to go. So knowing how my girlfriend would react I decided to book the tickets and hostels before telling her so I could plan out a perfect scenario to tell her and try to convince her with a layed out trip that would be safe.

Once high school was done she moved back to Florida to attend some nursing program. Once she heard that her dad met someone she decided to move back to live with him while we were dating, we agreed that we would move in together but that she would need to come with us.

"AITA for expecting an invitation to my cousin's wedding? I (M, 35) have family in Connecticut that are quite snobby, often looking down on others, openly making derogatory remarks about others’ jobs and social status. They are my half uncle and half cousins on my mother’s side and have made disparaging remarks about my family in the past. However, family is very important for us so we always tried to keep them part of our lives. I was even somewhat close to my half cousins when in my twenties but then we drifted. I felt very judged when around them and they openly criticized other family members in front of me, calling some white trash. I figured they also did the same to me behind my back, even though I have a decent job and have more than one MA.   


Two years ago, my half cousin (F, 29) got engaged and I noticed we were not friends on Favebook any longer. My account did get hacked previously and I re-added her but she refused my request. I decided to try adding her again just to congratulate her on her wedding but this request was rejected outright. Being stubborn, I tried again and she accepted. She replied graciously to my congratulations, albeit 10 days later.  


This week, I found out that my parents are invited to the wedding but that neither me nor my sister are. My half uncle said that that’s what his daughter wanted. I come from a culture (both Russian-Ukrainian and Jewish) where this type of selectivity in wedding invitations is absolutely unacceptable and considered insulting. And that’s how my family is taking it. Nobody is going to the wedding. My family in New York got a similar invite (parents and not adult children) and are also shunning the wedding. Some of the family in Israel is also outraged.   


I understand that this type of selective inviting is more accepted in the US, but my family’s values are strongly against this. On top of this, we know that it is a large wedding (250-300 guests) and distant relations in Israel have been invited and so we feel very much discounted and snubbed. My uncle has come up with many excuses for why we were not invited but I am sure that his daughter only invited my parents because of his insistence.

I need your opinions. So months ago, I (30f) and my bf (37m) went to see my favorite band perform. The venue was about 500 people and was separated in the middle by 21+ and then under 21. We had mostly stayed in the back bar area and had a couple drinks. 

The very last set they played, happen to be my favorite song, so I am very excited, not thinking, I ran ahead of my boyfriend into the crowd so I could get a better look. He caught up to me about 15 seconds later and was absolutely furious at me for running off.

I did not think it was a big deal because I was just getting closer to the stage and was super excited! 
This bands music to help me through many tough times so I was super pumped. They were playing my favorite song at the last one.

He thinks I’m an asshole, because I ran into a crowd while I was drunk, and what if he would have lost me I could not have gotten a hold of him because his phone was dead. I am on the other hand.

"WIBTA if I told my coworker his comments were out of line? I (25y.o. afab, nonbinary, asexual) was talking about how I don't understand how anyone thinks pick-up lines will actually work on anyone, since we were discussing the worst pickup lines we had ever heard. My coworker (26y.o. Autistic & ADHD, male, demisexual) went off on a rant about how pick up lines work if the person using them is hot. I will say, he goes on rants like this a lot. At least once a week I have to deal with him complaining that women love to date ""good-looking assholes,"" underage girls ""trick"" men into sex with makeup, the male loneliness epidemic, and how girls push him away because they see him as a threat.

I disagreed with his ""they work when they're hot"" theory because, in my opinion, the awkwardness of being expected to laugh at someone's bad jokes would just annoy me, not make me want to get to know/sleep with them. 

Then he decided to pull the whole ""well, you like Hozier, and if he asked you for sex, cheesy pickup line or not you would say yes."" I was pissed, because no. I wouldn't, and I am insulted he thought I would. Yeah, he is pretty and I like his music, but that doesn't mean I want to fuck him. I told him that that would kindof ruin Hozier for me because then he would just be another artist that uses his fame for sex. I wanted to tell him it made me really uncomfortable that he acted like he knew what I would do, especially when it comes to sex, more than me because he sees me as a woman and has this sexist idea of women floating in his head, but a customer walked in so I couldn't. 

Would I be the asshole if I told him I felt he was out of line the next time I get the chance, or should I let it go? Idk. On one had it made my skin crawl, but on the other hand I don't want to seem overdramatic or like I am throwing a fit.",0.93
"AITA For telling my MIL that I’m not her son’s (my husband’s) mother?  My (27F) husband (27M) and I have been together for four years. Married last year. That’s when everything changed. At first, I thought his mother Brenda was wonderful. Very polite, thoughtful, and included me in the family very quickly. Before I knew it, I was going to every holiday, and we got engaged not too soon after. 

My husband moved out for the first time on his own two years ago when we moved in together. That was a big adjustment for her I’m sure as she did all of his planning, appointments, and payed his bills. I would have to hear constantly how “overbearing” his mom was and “over involved” And how frustrated he was. Meanwhile he never set any boundaries. So it just bothered me to always hear it. He complained because they have his log in to his bank and doesn’t know the email it was assigned to. So instead of demanding they hand over the info and he change it, he just gets the log in password and email from them and accepts it. 

The red flags started for me when we got married. His parents treat him like he’s incompetent and he doesn’t realize it. They treat me like, since we live together, I need to be in “charge of him” 

“Please remind him to make a doctors appointment” 
“Remind him to do his taxes, won’t you?” 

If I haven’t seen them for a week or 2, they tell me how much they miss me. Meanwhile my husband stops in multiple times a week for a little while after work. And they still joke about how they never see him. 

Casually my husband mentioned at a dinner about his work day before, and his mom said “Oh. Well I wouldn’t have known that because I haven’t talked to you all day yesterday” 

He insists that his parents are joking and I’m “taking things the wrong way”

My husband gets upset and flustered during family events and occasions because he doesn’t want to piss off his mother or “get a look from her” for being late. Things have to go the way she wants with car rides and the time. And he gets pissed, but caters to it.

"AITAH For cheating on my (now ex) boyfriend... So I (16f) was dating (I'll call him ""Alex""15) he was 15 and I was his first girlfriend. Yes so far it is sounding bad for me but allow me to explain. I have been in my fair share of uncomfortable situations and relationships with really bad things happening. This being said some of the trauma from these situations has made me really uncomfortable setting boundaries. I was hanging out with my friend let's call her ""Sarah"" and we were just chilling in bed and cuddling because i cuddle my best friends often. I texted him asking if it was okay that I did that knowing I am into woman, he said it was all good and asked when I would be back at my place. I then told him and also told him goodnight as I js wanted to hangout with my friend but didn't want to forget. Soon enough Sarah and I were kissing and touching. And I felt like a shitty person for it but she made me feel safe and comfortable with her and didn't want to lose her friendship by telling her no bc of Alex (She knew Alex and I were together)

Since Alex and I went on our first date he has taken everything sexually to a point where it was very uncomfortable to me and he has some anger issues that are scary to me and almost everyone who knew I was with him were asking if he was hurting me or if he was threatening me for these things. As I was very uncomfortable leaving the situation I held Sarah feeling safe with her.

We broke up a few days before this post and I did come clean to him about the cheating. I also before getting into the relationship with Alex knew I might be a lesbian and he took that risk too.

I tell him that he can just breathe through his mouth if he really can’t smell it but he “doesn’t want to get the particles in [his] mouth.” At this point, these “episodes” are getting on my last nerve. Besides this, he is a nice, loving boyfriend, but I’m tired of the over the top theatrics and I just need to know if I’m just being “ignorant” as he says, or if he’s just being dramatic. ",0.18
"AITA for telling my step sister that she should grow up? I(F16) have a 15yo stepsister named Lily. it seems that she feels like just because my dad sleeps with her mom, then everyone in the family should treat her the same way they treat me. she gets like weirdly upset if my family gives me a gift or take me somewhere without her. I told her multiple times that we are not fcking conjoined twins therefore I'm allowed to go places without her but she doesn't get it. 

yesterday my auntie wanted to take me out for dinner and Lily asked if she can join us. I told her no she can't. she got upset and said it's not fair that I'm always going out with them without her.

"AITA for not wanting to ""change my approach to religion?"" I (25) consistently find myself arguing with my girlfriend (24) concerning religion. I am a practicing Muslim (convert), and she is what I would consider a spiritualist (with a Hindu upbringing). She says that she ""believes in everything"" as in all religions are true, and claims to be very inclusive. I have no issue with anything that she believes or practices, and I truly believe that everyone has the right to believe in whatever they like. I have never made religion an issue in the relationship, and have never made her to feel like any of her practices are wrong or silly.  
  
The problem is that although she claims to ""believe in everything"", she has an obvious dislike of organised religion, and casually makes remarks that certain practices like fasting or ritualistic prayer are silly or have no value, despite the fact that I engage in those practices, and it makes me pretty uncomfortable. While I do like to think that I practice the Islamic religion, I'm not exactly a book-thumping zealot, and often find myself breaking the rules that the religion lays out, like not praying regularly, smoking weed once in a while and pre-marital intercourse. That being said, I truly do believe in my religion and the things that are taught in it, all of it.  
  
She claims that I am too rigid, and have a closed mind to other beliefs and cultures, stating that because I refer to my religion for my spiritual beliefs, I am intolerant of other beliefs. I disagree with her fundamentally, as I love to learn about different religions and cultures, and it is because of that that I have found myself practicing the religion that I do. She claims that it is not enough to learn about other religions or beliefs, and that I must genuinely believe what other religions teach in order to have an open mind.  
  
While I am more than happy to learn about other religions and spiritual practices, I feel that I should not be pressured into participating in anything that would go against my religious beliefs, and feel as though she is the one pushing her spiritualist beliefs on me. As an example, I would be happy to participate in things like yoga or sand gardening (which have their origins in religions other than my own), but would not go so far as to participate in a Hindu prayer whereby I address other Gods than my own. This has been the source of many arguments between us, to the point where she has threatened to leave me if I do not ""change my approach to religion. AITA?",0.33
"WIBTA if I tell my fiancé if he doesn’t lose weight, we aren’t getting married? WIBTA if I ask my fiancé to either lose some weight, or we’re not getting married?

Me, (40f) and my fiancé, Hubert,
(39m) have been together for almost 3 years. We are polyamorous, though we don’t each currently have another partner or fwb. My fiancé has been a big guy most of his life. Like… 6 feet tall and 280 lbs, most of it is carried in his upper body. I always thought he was vey attractive of course, we both have extremely high libidos. He does have to take a med for ED (erectile dysfunction). It has worked really, really well until recently. He also snores. And refuses to wear a C-PAP (even tho he has one, bc it’s not comfortable).  It literally shakes the bed when he snores. I wake up multiple times a night. 

The problem came to a head in the last few months. He has gained about 50 pounds. I have gained about 10 also. Well, now he is having trouble becoming erect even with his medication. He said he thinks his sexual “vitality” is over. He said this matter-of-factly . I was like, “Nooo, you are only 39! We just need to get in shape and it will come back.” He said he thinks he is on the downhill slope sexually. He said I will find other “suitors”. Ummm, no. I want to be as intimate as possible with my own fiancé. And I don’t accept that he is just going to “accept” not having sex with me, when he could at least try to improve the ED. 

   Also, the snoring is even worse. I offer to sleep on the couch, or take turns sleeping on the couch, but he insists he likes the couch. That’s a nice, short term fix, until he either finds a CPAP mask he can tolerate, or loses enough weight to get the snoring under control. I also want to sleep in the same bed as my fiancé. Both problems, the ED and the snoring, are related to his weight. I haven’t been able to sleep as I can hear it even when he’s on the couch. He is sensitive/insecure about the ED in general. I know it’s going to get his feathers ruffled if I even mention it. He is somewhat insecure about his weight though I think he’s used to being big. It scared me that he gained 50 pounds in a little over 3 months. 

I am not willing to go without having a sex life with my future husband, unless it is a medical issue that he absolutely cannot help (he could help the ED). I’m also a little salty that he would just tell me go get my sexual needs met elsewhere, instead of working a bit on himself so we can be intimate together. Sex is a big part of our relationship and I love our intimacy. I am also not willing to have a separate sleeping space from my husband (not long term anyways). Here’s where I may be the asshole- we’ve already had some talks about the snoring especially, he’s just not getting it, that these are deal breakers for me. WIBTA if I told him that if he doesn’t exercise and lose weight- and therefor improve the ED and snoring- that I will not be marrying him, and I will be moving out?",0.35
"AITA - for telling therapist I cancelled sessions due to partner   Hi, I recently had my first baby, December 2023, 10 weeks after having baby I suffered from PPD, I had a slightly traumatic birth l, a horrible MIL and needed a way to process a lot of what happened. Due to this, I started therapy, when I was down in the pits and before I began therapy my partner said in an argument ""you don't even want help, you're doing nothing about it"" so the next day I booked therapy for two days later. Anyways, I have my first session and I was asked what was discussed which led to an argument, the next day I was stil hurt and said ""you made my therapy session all about you"" and he replied ""well it's never going to work if you sit there (to therapist) and just fxking blame everyone else"" in the heat of the moment, I cancelled all following sessions. 
Yesterday the therapist called and asked why I cancelled my sessions and I said ""my partner said it wasn't going to work if I blame everyone else"". 
In my eyes, I was just telling the truth, I tell my partner this last night and I've never seen him so angry, ""how dare I throw him under the bus"" ""you've shown the type of person you are"" ""how can you do that"" ""you've took something I said in the heat of an argument"" ""I feel like you've really shown your true colours"" bla bla

"AITA For Making My Wife Look Bad In Front Of Our Kids? Me (39m) and my wife (38f) have two kids: 11m and 10f. My wife and I usually get on get along pretty well, except when it comes to somewhat large purchases for our kids. 

&#x200B;

My wife, makes a good amount, around 120k a year, and works from home, but I don't think that's a bad salary, but correct me if I'm wrong. I make 5 if times more than her, which is the primary cause of our squabbles. 

&#x200B;

For example, a couple weeks ago, my son needed new glasses. We were looking, and my son settled on a frame that looked pretty good on him, but it was Prada and would cost like 200 ish. My wife was *going* to ask him to get something else, but I interrupted her and told him to get the glasses. This is just the one that pops up in my mind now, besides the one that's the main issue. I'm not trying to sound like ""good dad bad mom"" and that I don't tell my kids no. 

&#x200B;

Well yesterday, my son came out asking for some shoes. He showed us, and I was pretty set on it, the shoes were like 140. I was surprised by the ask though, because he never asks for shoes, just waits for us to buy him some every once in a while. He is also outgrowing some of his current shoes so why not? Before I could buy though, my wife made my son leave to talk about it. 

&#x200B;

She said that she didn't want to buy the stuff, and wanted *me* to tell my son no, because I always make her look like the bad parent. I told her I just want to make sure my kids have a nice life, and there's nothing wrong with that. She also stated again, that I always make her look bad, and when I asked why, she said I wasn't ""Getting the point"" and went to bed. We never bought the shoes.

"AITA for being inflammatory on purpose to spite my dad? I am 19 and a freshman in college. My parents pay for the part of my tuition that is not covered by my scholarship (I go to a public university for context). I have always been very interested in politics, in high school I joined the debate team and ended up going to nationals. My parents were happy because they were so annoyed with me constantly trying to argue with them and they encouraged me to put my interest in politics to productive use. I’m currently an art major but I’m seriously considering law as something to do in my future.

Anyway I’ve been pretty politically active on my campus. I protested for the school to create a disabled student Union because the DRC was not great, and it actually ended up being passed by SGA and endorsed by the school. I’m getting a certificate in religion and am in an international program to create a podcast with an int student where we create a question related to politics/religion and it will be uploaded somewhere. I find it to be a topic il really passionate about.

Me and my dad agree a lot and we are both VERY annoying and constantly debate with each other about politics. He has always encouraged me to pursue my passion both in art or a future in law. Lockheed Martin is coming to my campus to do a Q&A and I was considering joining and asked my dad for his opinion. He hasn’t known about my activities on campus, but he generally has the same opinions as me and I expected him to maybe tell me not to do it bc it would get rowdy or something. Instead he absolutely exploded at me, screamed at me the entire ride home that I’m categorically not allowed to do anything related to politics until I graduate and am no longer under his roof. I was really surprised and ended up pushing and asking “and what if I do it anyways?” And from his reaction I could tell he was not playing at all. 


The best way to get me to do something is by telling me I can’t do it. This is a pretty serious character flaw of mine. I could’ve just gone to the sit-in and do other things without ever telling him but I decided I wanted to rub it in his face. He told me to focus on school and only school so for the last few weeks all my art assignments have been VERY political. My art professor has been really enjoying them and I’ve been loving doing them but my dad is so angry about it. I did a public display of one of the works of art and got spotlighted in the school gallery and people showed up to argue with me about it and when I told him he absolutely blew up and said I’m disobeying him and disrespecting his authority. I just act like I have no idea what he’s talking about and am following his instructions to focus on school. My mom has been telling me im being ridiculous and disrespectful and while I’m not following his orders I honestly don’t think I’m being the asshole here! But maybe I am just engaging in teenage rebellion and being a dick for no reason and I need to get over myself. I don’t know. AITA?",0.33
"AITA for putting a tree net to stop any fruits from going onto my neighbor’s yard? Edit: 
Advised to add this in too. We started the net when we had a medical bill come up and needed to work on paying it off.


I’m being advised to edit this in. The box of fruit was for fruit that was prepped in some way and what I was asked about. My wife was asked for the fruit as a whole. It was when he came to me that he asked about the fruits that were prepared. I thought it was implied because of how the topic differences between me and my wife. I’m putting an ** next to the part I’m talking on . I’m sorry for not making that clear 

Hi. I inherited a house from my dad from his passing a few years ago. His house came with the guava tree on the yard. The tree has been there for a good portion of my teen years and is special to me.

Me and my wife were one day thinking of ways for extra income and realized we could literally sell off the fruit. Got the permit and started to prepare guava in different ways. For reference, I sell the fruit whole, splice and put into cups, candied, etc.

We realized that while the branches weren’t exactly hanging over our neighbor’s lawn, sometimes guava would either fall over or buck against the fence at the right angle and end up over there. So me and my wife purchased a tree fruit net for the side of the tree that was closer to the neighbors yard. Since then I don’t think any fruit fell to their yard which is good.

What led me here today is that last week while my wife was out on the lawn, the neighbors kid approached her and asked what happened to the fruits. My wife explained that we keep the fruits in a net so that we can have more. Apparently the kid ran off and came back with their dad who asked my wife the same thing. She explained again and, from what she said, the father looked like he took it personally. Asked if we thought he was stealing and my wife explained no, we didn’t think that, we just want to maximize the fruit that falls from our tree since we do use it for some profit. 

Today the same neighbor knocked on the door and I answered. He asked if we could talk about the fruit tree situation. He said that he thinks it’s selfish how my father would freely let the fruits fall wherever but now that I’m here I’m hoarding the fruit. I explained that the tree is my property so whatever comes from the tree is also my property. I said he could buy guava off us if he wanted but he looked more upset that I would even recommend that. I’m glad his kid liked the fruit but now that I’m making money off this I can’t just let that happen freely. He called me selfish again and that I could at least **spare a few. I said again he could buy some off me if he wanted. I offered a box for $5

Now everytime we see him around he doesn’t smile at us which I guess is expected but now they let the dog poop on our lawn and keeps telling his kid loudly that the “neighbors killed the fruit fairy”. Some of the neighbors are still cool with us but it’s like we made an enemy from him and I’m feeling slightly guilty for the kid

"AITA for only giving BF one of my keys but not the deadbolt key, after he pushed to move in to my house? Bf has been asking repeatedly to move in to the house I own since his lease was up. He started asking about 2 months into our relationship, and it's now about a year in. I would normally be fine with it now, but he yells at me in anger sometimes and has a temper.

I gave him 1 front door key, but not the key to the other lock (deadbolt). I said I would give him the 2nd key when he paid rent for the first time, which he still hasn't. So today when I was home painting a room and didn't answer his texts for 2 hours because the phone was downstairs since I didn't want to get paint on it, I accidentally locked the deadbolt as well out of habit.

He came home from work, tried the door, and got angry at me calling me names, etc. because 1 I hadn't answered his calls while I was painting, and 2 that I had locked the deadbolt that he didn't have a key for.

He has also never paid me rent since he moved in, saying he ""has other bills that need paid right now.""

"AITA for not wanting to pay my wife's taxes as though she was single Background: my wife and I got married about seven months ago. We live in MA. This is the first time we're doing taxes together.

We engaged with a CPA to do our taxes (it's worth it to me to have someone else do it). The CPA ran all the numbers and sent back her recommendation of filing ""Married filing Separately"".

The CPA also, per my wife's request, sent back the results/refund as if my wife were filing as ""Single"" - which is illegal if you are married.

The upshot: my wife would be receiving a refund if she filed a ""Single"" but given my income, that we are married, and that we are filing ""Married filing Separately"", we (her & I) do owe money to the IRS.

My wife is now asking me to pay her the difference of what she would've received had she filed as ""single"". 

To me, this is totally ridiculous. First of all we are a team...my money is legally her money. Secondly, she can't file as ""single"", it's illegal... She's benefiting from my (and therefore our) higher income. It doesn't make sense to me. Why should I have to pay for something that isn't even possible? FYI I (we?) am covering the tax bill anyway.

"AITA for wanting my graduation party to be purple themed?  Graduation party is coming up soon and mom is planning for the party. We were going to go to the dollar store to get red and black party stuff, and I asked if it had to be red and black. She got defensive and cited tradition and it'd match with my schools colors. And I told her I didn't want to do red and black, and said that if it was cheaper to get something else she would have bought that since she's pinching pennies a little lately. Nothing unreasonable or anything, just generally making an effort to save.

She said that the color won't change the price, and decided to suddenly downgrade to plain white paper plates in bulk from Wally world, I guess to punish me for not wanting red and black. We drove home in silence. 

Argument in her favor is : She already ordered the cupcakes, might be red and black themed, I'm not sure. [She has left me out of almost every single part of planning for my graduation party.] My school colors are red and black. She mentioned tradition so maybe it's just a family thing for it to be red and black. I never communicated until now that I had a different idea in mind, but she has a ""my way"" about her sometimes. Maybe I sounded ungrateful? I'm unsure. I usually don't struggle with things like that, but I'm autistic and wouldn't have been able to tell if that's the case, and I've told her to tell me directly if I'm sounding rude. 

My argument is : I hate red and black, I feel like it's not a celebratory or party kind of combination. I have no pride for where I've gone to school, I want to be done with it. [ My school fucked me over so much and has done so little for me that it's not even the bare minimum. It doesn't help that I hate my town too.] Purple is my favorite color, and I thought it would look nice for an outfit I'd want to wear for the party [my usual pink sweater]. I want it to feel like my party, yk?

If I had it my dream way there wouldn't really even be a theme. It'd be cool to just get a bunch of different colored things. Like rainbow. The only thing holding me back would be finding the colors in bulk at a small enough amount that it wouldn't be absolutely ridiculous amounts of items for a party 20-30 people big. 

But now it's just gonna be plain white as cheap as possible so she can prove a point. So fuck me I guess. ",0.2
"AITA for not wanting to pay for my brother’s plane ticket when he comes to take care of me for surgery? So, I am getting surgery in a couple of weeks. When I found out I needed to get surgery, my brother offered to fly up to drive me to and from surgery as well as stay with me for the day after. He did any of this before I even asked and now he is turning it into a trip. He plans on coming a few days in advance so that we can hang out and do some fun things around town.

Now that the surgery is scheduled, he is requesting that I pay for half of his plane ticket. I really don’t think it’s fair, considering he offered to come in the first place, and he also was making a trip out of it. I told him that I was planning on taking care of him while he was here buying him dinner and paying for drinks when we go out the weekend before the surgery, and things of that nature.

For reference, the flight is under $300 and he is by no means in financial trouble. Sometimes, I feel taken advantage of by family members when it comes to money, so I am definitely feeling some sort of way about this. My whole thing is that if a family member asked me to come take care of them or help them for surgery, I would absolutely buy a plane ticket and go and I would not expect them to pay for it.

"AITA for saying what I said during a conversation with my sister? I (21F) was in the car with my sister (23F). We were getting Popeyes to go, with our stepdad as the driver. On the way to Popeyes, she started complaining about our city. 

We live in a major city. It is the city with the largest population in our country. Lately, there have been lots of problems with it, such as crime, homelessness, drug dealing, etc. I acknowledge that those are very valid criticisms of the issues. Our city has even been compared to LA in regards to the issues. I have seen people call our city the LA of our country. 

I also had some personal issues in our city. Our city appears to be known for rude, unkind, unwelcoming people. This was a problem I had in our city. I got bullied a lot growing up by kids for being overweight, having good grades, being sensitive (emotional issues are present in my life as I have been diagnosed with anxiety and depression. Autism has also been speculated for me, but I've never been diagnosed with autism) and more. I had even been targeted by some teachers and guidance counsellors, mainly for sensitivity although even then some of them just seemed to hate me without reason. One of my teachers (a 7th grade and 8th grade art teacher) laughed at me for crying after she started yelling at me and making fun of my goals. Another one of them (9th grade drama teacher) was known for sharing everyone's grades with the class without your permission to embarrass you. My high school guidance counsellor would defend the drama teacher and she mocked me for taking his class, asking ""Why are you taking drama class if you have anxiety?"" as if there are no successful actors with anxiety. 

4th grade was one of the bullying peaks for me. My teacher favored the bullies. Our parents were also getting divorced. A few boybands came onto the scene at the time and I have since then become a HUGE fan and remain a fan of the bands to this day. 

Although I have my issues, I still love the city because it's good for concerts. It's the only city in our country where bands play if they go to our country on tour. My sister was complaining about the city the whole time on the drive to Popeyes (the traffic didn't help as that's another thing our city is known for). She said that we should move to a different city because she doesn't like the city we currently live in. I chimed in and acknowledged that while it isn't perfect by any means, I do still like it. I commented that it's too bad that nowhere else in our country does concerts. My sister then turned around and angrily asked: ""Is that all you really care about?"" I get anxious and panicky when I feel like people are angry at me so I felt anxious and stayed quiet, looking outside the window to distract myself and try not to cry. I stayed silent while my sister continued: ""I know you went quiet cause you're upset.""

"AITA for inviting my sibling's ex to my wedding? My (36f) sister and I (34f) have had an often rocky relationship. I won't go into many particulars, but essentially she has mental health issues and is neurodivergent in a way that manifests as a need to be viewed as better than others, which she achieves through intentional verbal aggression. She doesn't get along with our family for a few reasons.

I asked my sister to be in my wedding, and she said yes. I knew it would be tough for her to come, but I really want my sister at my wedding, it's a very important day for me.

A few months ago, she called and asked me why I invited my friend (Anna), who is her ex (Mike)'s sister, to my wedding and didn't tell her. I was really caught off guard because she's best friends with Mike. I knew she wasnt on great terms with Anna, but I didn't think they were enemies. Mike, Anna, and I are all working on a project together. My sister was the one who suggested to me that I work with them. we've become friends to the point of enjoying vacations together without my sister, and she knows that.

We didn't talk for a few weeks, then she called me one day like nothing had happened and I thought we moved on. A few days ago she called about booking a place to stay. She wanted to book a place an hour away, and I said sure but it might be a rough drive to make for 3 days in a row. She yelled at me for asking her to give up 3 days.

She then brought up again how I invited Mike and Anna and asked why I wanted to hurt her so much. She said that by inviting Anna, I took her safe space away since she blames Anna for her and Mikes breakup. I told her I didn't invite Mike to be there as her safe space. She says I've deeply hurt her for doing this, and she told me that she never expected me to become friends with them, that she just wanted me to work with them. She said she didn't realize she had to tell me not to become friends with her ex, her ""other family"", and that by becoming friends with them I've attacked her. She said she would never invite my ex to her wedding. I didn't feel like the term ex with it's negative connotations applied to him. He's been my friend and her best friend for longer than they were together.

I'm worried about her pulling out of the wedding. Yesterday, she sent me a photo to show she bought plane tickets to come home for the wedding. But I don't feel reassured. I believe that she was looking for me to do or say something that would serve as an excuse for her to not be in the wedding and have it not be her fault for backing out, because that's what she did before her graduation and before our sibling got married. She picked fights and then later said she wanted to push me away first.

AITA for demanding she be in my wedding, would it just be better if I took the bullet, accepted she can't be there and tell her not to come so we're both put out of our misery?

We've always been close, me (M34) and him, and when he struggled with living costs and boredom during his gap year, I invited him to come down to my city and come live with me. The place that I live in is quite vibrant, lively, and my house is too big for just me and my girlfriend, Georgia (F30). In a way, because of this, I do kind of blame myself for William getting knocked up.

Not long after he moved in with me, he started going round with this lad, Day (M21). They found out about the pregnancy like a month into the relationship. The only good thing that I can say about Day is that he's at least good at providing financially for r kid and his baby, he's uninterested and mostly absent in every other aspect. He does go all out for the baby, Day's even taken r kid out to awfully overpriced shops like Harrods or Selfridges to buy clothes for the baby. Not too smart, but excellent provider.

There's been a few rifts in their relationship, a couple of times William has ended up coming crying to me and Georgia. It's not unusual to find him crying in his bedroom over Day. Georgia is usually a pillar of strength for him. I guess their relationship has totally fizzed out, which lead to Will changing his birth plan.

Originally, he was going to have a home birth, with only a midwife and Day present. Due to the changed dynamic, he doesn't want Day included anymore, which made him come to me asking if I'd stand in for Day. He's said that he wants me there to comfort him and hold his hand. I thought it was a sweet request but I shot it down. Will was really persistent in trying to find out why I didn't want to be there, so I told him that I found it all a bit strange. 

I explained to him that although we're close and I love the bones off of him, it's too intimate, too vulnerable for me to watch him labour. I told him that if I were his older sister, I'd agree in a second, but unfortunately I'm male. I asked him if he wouldn't prefer having Georgia with him instead, she's a woman who's given birth before and they are close, surely she'd be a better fit than me? 

Its made Will really upset and made him withdraw from me, and I do feel like a dick about it. Georgia said that I should've just kept my big mouth shut and accepted the offer.",0.1
"AITA for not sharing our current business success with former friends who left the business 4 years ago when it was completely ruined Throwaway, but basically me and a couple of buddies started a food truck business pre-covid. We each put in about \~$5k each, but covid-19 hit shortly after. During this time, our sales were basically nothing (our area didn't have many people using delivery options) and eventually we had to close down. 

Our friend group got together (each of us had put money into it), and decided that it wasn't worth it to sell the truck (which was in used condition, with graphics on it, and just would have been maybe 15-20 cents on the dollar) for the state it was in, especially during covid, and also a pain in the ass to sell. Everyone was lowballing us. 

We each had day jobs so temporarily kept the food truck. Keep in mind, the \~$1-1.5k refund (from possibly selling the truck) each may seem like a significant amount to some readers, but a lot of us work decent paying jobs so just treated it as bad luck. 

A few members decided they no longer wanted to continue with the business and since it wasn't worth selling, parted ways. I think the fact that it didn't work out and all of us putting a lot of time/effort into the passion project led to these few members completely cutting contact with the rest of us.

ex. those 3 people haven't said a word in our old group chat (which we did eventually stop using a year after we had stopped working on the food truck project, but still). we have mutual friends still so would have been easy to get in contact. 

Fast forward to mid 2022, the remaining 5 of us restarted the food truck. We initially got in contact with the 3 people who had left, but they declined to partake and said they had moved on

The new venture of the existing food truck didn't require much additional investment, and we've found decent success. Our area now does have a lot more using delivery platforms, and we've also done events/what not. It's still a passion project, but we have employees now who run the truck as we still have day jobs. One of the members of the group also works on the biz full time. 

Anyways, two of the three people who broke off contact for a good 3-4 years recently got back in touch literally last month and were asking us to give them their % of the entity the food truck is under and % of the revenue, based on their initial investment in 2020, so basically 12.5% per because we did about an equal amount among the 8 of us.

The 5 of us think that it would be stupid to give them a % of the entity because they broke off contact for 3-4 years and we literally worked our asses off in the past \~2 years, so our thought was refunding them their initial $5k was already very accommodating since if we had decided to sell the truck when covid hit, they would have maybe gotten 1.5 each? 

I know some comments will talk about contracts/legality, we did not have any legal documents before since we didn't even really make it off the ground in 2020 and the current entity (created in 2022) is made up of us 5.

"AITA for “discriminating” against my partner’s single friend to save money? My partner Jo and I are planning to go up to a nearby mountain area to do some snow hiking next weekend. It’s 2 hotel nights and a carshare rental because our car doesn’t have snow tires and they’re required for the pass. While we were planning, we realized we could save some money by bringing friends along, as a bonus hiking with friends would be fun too.

I asked him to send a message in our group chat. This is what he said.

“Hi everyone! We’re going up to [mountain] for hiking next weekend, and if we get a 4 person room and split the cost it’ll be cheaper for everyone. Is anyone interested in coming? I’m already a [carshare company] member so it’s just the hotel and 2 days of carshare costs]”

Two people responded right away, Sky first, and Ann about 1 minute later.

He sent this message in a group chat that has a bunch of his friends & most of our couple friends instead of the one with just our friends. Sky and I don’t get along because they’ve said some not nice stuff to me repeatedly. They’re the only one of his friends I don’t get on with, and I go out of my way to not make it a big deal, so I think he forgot, and otherwise would’ve sent the message to just our couple friends.

Sky is single, and the type of person to complain about couples getting unfair savings constantly, so I knew it would be a 3-way split with them.

I told Jo I wanted to go with Ann, and we discussed why (cost, and that I don’t like Sky) he agreed and said would handle smoothing things over. Sky’s message mentioned “splitting 3 ways, but that’s still cheaper for everyone” so my assumption was right. He took it to DMs with Sky, then started a group chat with me, Ann+ Ann’s bf to plan.

This has caused a curfuffle in the friend group. Sky sent a message in the group chat saying we were being bullies, then started vaguetweeting about people discriminating against single friends and wanting to get a scam them to save money. Some of Jo’s friends taking sides and saying trips should always be split per person. Apparently when Jo messaged Sky he started by saying I’m close with Ann, but when Sky  pushed he told them we wanted to split 4 ways.

Here’s the #s

Go alone:
- single queen =350/night*2=700
- car share = 400
- total = 1100

Go with Ann& BF:
- double queen =550/night*2=1100
- car share = 400
- total = 1500
- our cost =750

Go with Sky:
- same total=1500
- our cost=1500*2/3=1000

So, we would save 100 by going with Sky, but 350 going with a couple. The original goal of finding someone to go with us was to save money. If we don’t save money, why not just have a couples weekend, especially since I don’t like Sky. I feel like even if Sky was nice to me all the time and I just wanted to go with another couple to save money, the savings difference justifies that.

But, it’s turned out to be a very divisive issue, so AITA?",0.58
AITA for telling my father he has no integrity and being upset with him I(m19) have been working a job for a few weeks. Prior to that I was looking for one. My father(m57) took away my pc while I was on winter break from school. He said he took it because I wasn’t working or in school. I asked for it back 11 days ago through a message. He ignored me for the 11 days. Today he wants to talk me about something and starts with telling me he’s not giving it back. He said he doesn’t give a shit about it.

"AITA For Expecting My Family To Come To My Two Wedding Events? My fiancé and I got engaged in February and wanted to have a courthouse wedding in Los Angeles (where we live) in June. Since courthouses are only open M-F we pitched Friday wedding dates and found a Friday/weekend that worked for both of our large families. Since our wedding is small, we pitched late June, and though it is fast, everyone said they were available.

The plan we pitched at the time was to have the Friday courthouse wedding with just family and a nice dinner at a restaurant after. Then Saturday, the next day, host an afternoon party with our families and local friends so that all our favorite people can mingle and we can keep our actual wedding intimate.

When trying to book the courthouse date, we found out that you cannot book a date without a marriage license, and, in California, a marriage license expires after 3 months. We didn’t want to give our families even less notice than we already had so we kept our original date, and made a pivot to have them come to really pretty restaurant that will do BOTH our ceremony and dinner - and we will pay for all the food and alcohol. 

My family is from Northern California (Bay Area), and his family is from the East Coast. The wedding is in Los Angeles, CA where he and I live. We are not doing bridal parties, speeches etc just asking them all to show up and celebrate with us.

The Saturday party moved to an evening event because we wanted both families to have the entire day to recover from the night before, sight see in Santa Monica (where they are staying) or go to the beach during the day to make the most of their time here. The party is still casual, but just moved it to later in the day.

With this “huge party time change,” two out of four of my family members want to leave on Saturday and skip the evening party for two reasons. The party, which would be from 5pm-10pm, is too late for the kids to be at. The second reason, they want to leave on Saturday during the day instead of staying until Sunday, because travel is hard with the kids, and they want that full Sunday to reset them. 

Remember, my family is from the Bay Area and it is a 45 minute flight to LA or a 5 hour drive. No one in my fiancé’s family (traveling from East Coast) has any concerns with their travel. Not even the family with kids.

I’ve made it clear it’s important to me and that I would love for them to come for even a portion of the party, and that I would be disappointed if they weren’t going to be there. To which they responded, that I’m not being understanding, and with such short notice this is a “big ask"" from me, and that the wedding made “so many changes from what it started out being.” But when we originally pitched the weekend, everyone was available and said it worked for them? 

Am I the asshole for not being cool with the fact that my family members want to leave during the day on Saturday? Does short notice really matter when everyone says they are available and able? Is this really a big ask?",0.67
"AITA for taking a neutral stance in the confrontation between my friends? My (22f) friend Riley (23f) has a pretty peculiar personality. As one of our mutual friends put it quite eloquently, “if Chanel Oberlin and Lorne Malvo had a baby together”. In short, she’s the biggest shit stirrer ever and she would eat you alive for the pettiest of things.

I was dining out with Riley and a friend of mine (25m) who doesn’t know about Riley’s antics. Riley ordered a steak and was enjoying it with a glass of wine.

At the next table sat a family with a small child, about 5-6m. The child was clearly neurodivergent. The mother was looking after him, but every time she was losing focus, the child was starting to run around. He approached our table and chatted us up.

Everything went smoothly until the child ran up to our table and snatched a piece of asparagus off Riley’s plate. Riley looked him dead in the eyes and mimicked a shocked expression, saying that “oh no, it’s a very poisonous plant you just ate, if you won’t take the antidote, you’ll die in a few hours! by the way, let me take mine” and downed her glass of wine. The child was frightened and had a meltdown, crying, throwing up, while Riley was watching the entire thing like a movie. My friend rushed to help, but the boy didn’t listen at that point. I knew about Riley’s antics as it’s not the first time she created public drama out of the slightest inconvenience.

Later in the evening my friend confronted Riley about it, saying that she shouldn’t have terrorized the child. Riley shrugged and said that he didn’t have to grab her food off her plate and she hoped that the family learned the lesson and won’t let their child run loose anymore. My friend told her that she traumatized the child, she said “that’s negative reinforcement for stealing food”. Anyway, they had a verbal confrontation that I wasn’t engaging in, I didn’t want to start any beef with either of them. I told Riley in private that her reaction was over the top, but I doubt she would listen. 

Now they’re both saying that I should’ve picked a side and not just sitting there in silence listening to them talking. I told them that I’m not picking sides and that the family should’ve looked after their child better because of people like Riley. Now they’re both annoyed at me. Am I the asshole?",0.78
"AITA for saying my opinion? For context, I’m a raver and this is in a groupchat with some friends, and we’re all planning to rent an Airbnb together for an upcoming festival. 

So we’re planning on going to this festival and it’s getting to be around 20 people in one house. I personally think that’s excessive and my boyfriend is flying in from out of state to attend this festival with me and my friends. I don’t so much care for my comfort, but I’m not going to have my boyfriend fly in and have to sleep on an air mattress on the floor.
When 3 more people were added into the groupchat, I verbatim said “feeling like : we’re going to need another house” because 20 people in one house is a LOT in my opinion. The recently added people were just saying hello and after being ignoring I once again, verbatim said “Respectfully, I don’t wanna pay 200 dollars to sleep on an air mattress on the floor” and I made the point that it wouldn’t just be me, it would also be my younger sister and my boyfriend. 

They all got upset with me, texted me separately and called me rude and insensitive. I genuinely don’t understand this because I’m just trying to make the point that it’s a lot of people for one house… Both my boyfriend and sister agree with me, and they stayed in the groupchat after I left, and my boyfriend even stood up for me saying that I was never trying to be rude, I was literally only concerned about space?

"AITAH for asking my wife to watch a different show? So for context, I am a huge fan of movies and TV, but my wife historically is not. She will occasionally watch a movie with me in theaters but mostly for the popcorn, and the only TV shows she's really ever watched are friends and Grey's anatomy... I've been pushing for a while now to get her to watch something new with me and I finally succeeded! She picked Gilmore Girls and I happily agreed just to have something to watch with her.

Fast forward 3 months and we have watched 7.5 seasons! That's around 140 hours worth of gilmore girls, and as much as I love Lorelai and Rory, I'm a bit burnt out. The last week or so I've been asking if we could watch a little less gilmore girls and maybe watch something else. 

Today when I asked she got really upset saying that she just can't win, first I beg her to watch a show with me and then we finally find one she likes and now I don't want to watch it with her. And how she feels hurt that I don't want to watch it with her anymore. I tried to explain that I do want to watch it with her and that I just wanted some parody as it's been all we've watched lately(1-3 episodes per night).

"AITA for catching my boyfriend talking crap about me on my camera with the “tenant” I don’t want in my house  I have cameras throughout my house in public spaces, all of which everyone knows about. 

I say “tenant” because it’s my bf’s friend who he let live here in this house&who I don’t agree with living here. His friend has like 8 siblings all of which who will no longer let him stay at their houses. He is a known drug addict. He had asked me while we were drinking if he could stay her, which I said ok - but quickly after this said I didnt feel comfortable as we both have kids.

He told me his friend was just gonna crash the weekend because he was sleeping in his van knowing full well he was gonna let him stay. Now bf regrets bc he’s not paying rent / borrowing his money all the time. He’s using my Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, wifi (free). 

bf’s friend broke a pipe valve one night in our house by tripping over it and causing a flood. he stood there let it spray heavily all over the basement for minutes before yelling up to us.  Luckily, my dad is a plumber and talked us thru stopping the flood, some major cleanup. My dad came and fixed it free the next morning. 

While his friend was here, I also repaired other leaking pipes and it worked out great. Recently I also changed out our shower head to make it detachable. So anyway, our tub was leaking from the tub spout separately from all this. Bf takes it apart while I am at work and doesn’t know what to do next but is gonna go to Home Depot to buy expensive parts. 
I got my dad to give us parts from a spare shower valve that day and BF changed out some of it after I gave him tips on how to do it. it didn’t have everything but a lot of what we needed, so it helped save money. I also changed out some of the parts.

Anyhow, the next day I get more spare parts and he gets some & we finish it up. Now coming out the tub spout a pencil width only while the shower head is on, but not vice versa. everywhere online says it’s a hydrolok safeguard on newer valves for symmons- dad agrees. Thing is, the valve is like 20 years old and a Frankenstein mix of new and old parts now. Regardless, the shower works ok but he was flipping out telling me I told him how to do it wrong. He claims shower pressure is bad and it’s because of my new shower head(?). So he then says “forget it I don’t want to go out tonight” (after I told him that day I wanted to because I enjoy it and we didnt have our kids) - I got the sense he got a twisted joy out of “punishing” me. So anyway, he’s downstairs smoking outside with the friend. I hear him say stuff but stop. I decided to leave and go to pharmacy. After I leave, I check the camera and he and his friend and are making fun of me. He’s mad I checked the camera but I know he’s a shit talker so I wanted to see him do it. He was furious I spied and called him out. I told him his friend is ungrateful, a mooch, and has no right to talk about me either. I can understand him venting - but my BF said “I told her forget it I don’t wanna go out tonight” and they both laughed hysterically",0.85
"AITA for not giving financially towards my son’s wedding/honeymoon?  My son (22m) is getting married this June and I think we have done more than enough financially towards his life, at this point I personally feel like we’ve enabled him.

 My husband and I are lower middle class, and have 3 other boys that we also care for, 2 are over 18 and one is 16. There’s no way that we can provide for them the same way we have our oldest, and it’s really not fair to them. 

For starters I gave my oldest his first car because he drove his brothers everywhere, and he helped out a lot so I had no problem giving him that car, he TRASHED it!! By the time he went to college he had completely ran it into the ground, I got a new car and loaned him my mini van, he TRASHED IT TOO it no longer drives and it’s parked outside his college apartment. My husband loaned him our company vehicle and it’s well on its way being completely trashed. 

When he came to us and informed us that he was asking his gf to marry him we had major hesitations, we still pay his car/health insurance and even though he was supposed to be helping with the car insurance he has maybe paid once. I wouldn’t have let this go on this long, (I should clarify he’s my step son)

He text me and ask “you guys are paying for the honeymoon right” my head almost popped off 😤
So my husband said he’d handle it. The deal he made is he’s going to give our son the company vehicle and we are done, he also is coming off our car insurance. We are literally SPENT, we are NOT rich!

This weekend he tells me, hey we need to order the tux and I responded “We?” And he was like “yea it’s going to be a couple 100” and I was so shocked at the entitlement! 

When it comes to the wedding I’ve worked with the bride and paid for things for the wedding so I haven’t been completely unhelpful, also paying for part of the wedding shower. But we have 3 other kids, we literally can’t afford anymore things that he as an adult should be paying for. AITA??",0.18
"AITA for moving on with my life and wanting to spend less time helping my elderly mom? I'm 41(F) facing a tough situation with my hoarder mom (73). I haven't lived here since I was 17 and have worked all my life, but the pandemic prevented me from starting an overseas job. While here, I’ve tried helping Mom. Since Dad’s passing years ago, Mom's depression worsened. The house became increasingly cluttered. Research indicates hoarders must decide which clutter to discard and that others should not dump stuff without the hoarder’s permission.    
  
Although our relationship is close, her hoarding causes stress. To be fair, my mom is very generous. She makes sure to remind me of her support whenever we argue. When first moving in, I gave Mom $20K+, but now live rent-free and contribute to groceries / gas, do errands, chores, regularly cook for us, shovel snow, do bookkeeping for a co-owned property, help Mom with computer tasks, etc.  
  
The clutter makes daily life difficult. Stuff is piled on sofas, floors, stairs. Porch, basement, and garage are filled with unusable, broken, old items. Downstairs, only 2 chairs are available. We clear the table every time we eat.  
  
There are countless inconveniences, and Mom's ""solutions"" are frustrating. When the fridge was leaking air, we wedged in plastic bags to lessen leakage. When the stove wasn't working, we used a portable burner that took forever to heat. I managed to convince her to replace both fridge & stove, doing research to find the best ones.  
  
The real kicker is the basement. Since last year, there’s a leaky pipe and black mold. I offered to rent a dumpster so we could clear the basement (and have the pipe repaired), but Mom’s always ""too busy."" To dry out the basement, we had to leave windows / doors open. Mosquitos were still in the house months later.   
  
Meanwhile, we can’t let water down the drain. We plug the sinks, scoop leftover water into buckets every time we wash dishes. We don’t even shower here. We shower at the gym.   
  
When I complain about this or anything clutter-related, Mom dismisses my complaints. She says I’m lucky to live rent-free, that I'm being immature, that I ought to be grateful for the time and money she’s sacrificed. She’s “too busy” with paperwork, yardwork, etc. She implies I don’t help enough. She also refuses to see a mental health professional. I have my own work and commissions as a freelance artist. Plus, there’s my own mental health.   
  
Our latest argument was on tech help. I’ve tried teaching her basic skills over the years, writing step-by-step instructions in a notebook. She never practices. Instead, she expects me to do tech tasks or teach her the same thing again and again. When Dad was alive, he bought her a program to learn typing. She showed zero interest, never learned.  Now, she wants me to reteach her skills since I’m leaving. I might give her YouTube links instead – maybe they’re more effective.

"AITA drink fiasco (parenting) Hey everyone. On a throwaway here. Something happened today that has left me wondering who TA is. Myself (28f), my bf (35m), or my daughter (11). 

TLDR: daughter accidentally throws drink away. Bf freaks out. I get new drinks. He freaks out even harder. AITA? Or who is TA?

Bf and I went grocery shopping today and afterwards stopped to get me a frozen coke (I'm 30 weeks pregnant and it's a huge craving). He got an iced coffee as well. We get home, I set the drinks on the counter and start putting groceries away. I noticed my daughter and roommate have a ton of old mcdonalds/tacobell/starbucks drinks in the fridge so I pulled them out and set them on the counter by the sink to be dumped and then tossed. (Yes they were near where I put my 2 new drinks. But we have a tiny apartment so no counter space..) I asked my daughter to help out by dumping the old drinks before tossing them in the trash. 
I did not realize til it was too late that she dumped the 2 new (half drank) drinks along with everything else. I asked her if she dumped them accidentally, my bf overheard and comes into the kitchen and is livid. My daughter is a deer in headlights at this point as my bf is asking her (in what I would call a loud angry ((agressive?)) Tone) why she would dump out our drinks, they were right by the microwave off to the side a little bit. Almost accusing her as if it were intentional. He said she was grounded from her games and he stormed out of the apartment, slamming the door. I could tell she was frightened, he's never really talked to her like that before. It frightened me as well. 

Bf texted me not too long after asking if I was okay, I said yeah and that I wanted to talk to him about how I feel he overreacted to a mistake my daughter made, that I very well could have done the same thing. Radio silence, he doesn't reply. 
He comes back home and slams the doors again, freaking out about how what she did was intentional, bs, he can't take it anymore. I try to calm him down so she doesn't overhear and try to get him to sit so we can talk about it, as he's angry I didn't agree with the grounding. I ended up getting the bedroom door shut and locked in my face. I tried not to get too worked up, so I grabbed my keys and went and got him a new coffee. He texts me as im on my way back that he didn't want it, he'd throw it away if I got it, etc. So now he's mad about that and I am crying on the sofa in the livingroom because my pregnancy hormones make my emotional stability that of a toddlers right now.

So with everything, if I am the asshole I will own up to it, and I'm sorry for making everyone read this. But I really needed outside perspective on the situation. ",0.19
"AITA for constantly bitching about my brother? I (18f) have a little brother (Jacob 10m) with Spina Bifida. If you don’t know what that is, it’s a disability that affects the spine and often other parts of your body depending on the seriousness of your case. Because of this he needs to be cathed regularly and often has accidents (poopy ones) so therefore has to wear pull-ups. 

My parents have constantly acted like the world revolves around him, giving him everything he wants and to them, he can do no wrong to anybody (unless of course it’s them). I on the other hand do not put up with his bs. He’s constantly disrespecting everybody making them feel like they’re less than and tbh I don’t think he cares about anyone but himself or his video games. Jacob refuses to clean up after himself and throws fits when he’s asked to do anything. 

Because he wears pull-ups, there are constantly poop covered pull-ups in our bathroom trash and he often gets poop on the walls when the trash is too full to fit them (mind you his only chore is taking out that trash). He also often gets poop on the floor (which I’ve literally stepped in) and on the toilet. And I mean everywhere on the toilet, the outside, on the inside of the seat, the back of the toilet, EVERYWHERE and yet he still won’t clean any of it until I lose my shit and constant have to complain about it. My parents say they’re tired of my bitching and complaining but they don’t understand because they have their own bathroom and I know for a fact if my mom had to deal with it she would lose her cool constantly. Am I the asshole? ",0.12
"AITA for not being turned on all the time? I (23F) and my boyfriend (24M) have been together for a little over a year. We dated for two years when I was graduating high school and got back together to try again. It’s also important to note that I’ve known him since I was 12.

We also recently had a baby who is turning 9 months soon. This is our first child together ams separately. It has being hard seeing as we are young parents and tackling the discoveries of parenthood as they come.

The issue is he is constantly complaining about how much sex we have. It’s important to note that before I got pregnant I had a very high sex drive. I now am exactly the opposite. After having a baby it is very common for women to have a low sex drive especially for breastfeeding mom’ (which I am). The hormone that produces milk decreases the estrogen in women. So there is literally scientific evidence on my side.

My bf is very sexual and his love language is physical touch. This is bad on both ends. I get overwhelmed when I’m touched too much and my sexual drive has decreased. We have had many arguments and conversations about this, and it will be better for a while but then go right back to the same issues. 

I also find it hard to get horny without non-sexual foreplay, meaning I get horny by things that aren’t really sexual. Like massages, rubbing my scalp or feet, cuddling, hugging. It’s also important to note that my love language is acts of service. So things like opening my door, carrying things for me, doing the laundry, etc. those are things that get the engine going. 

Don’t get me wrong he is a good dad, but lately the things he does are for the baby, he hasn’t catered to me hence sex is suffering. He recently brought up me not trying in the sex department and I said that it is directly related to two things. 1. Being my love language not being met 2. Being his attachment to corn (substitute p). 

He follows a lot of OF girls on Twitter, and tiktok. He claims it’s just porn but it makes me uncomfortable. He likes these posts follows these girls so much so that, it’s all he sees on Twitter, tiktok and IG. It isn’t just a few girls (that I could deal with) it is FILLED. When I bring it up he says I’m putting the blame onto him, which isn’t true I’m simply pointing out why I’m not being sexual. With the new baby, new hormones, and the insecurity of all these women with his attention it’s hard to feel like I’m what he wants and turned on (not to mention none of them look like me). 

Our most recent argument was really bad with talks of breaking up. And he even said “this is why men cheat” this really hurt especially with my insecurities of him with other women. Idk what to do I understand it’s a need for him, but I just had a baby and I feel like I deserve some understanding and kindness.

"AITA for telling my sister that her boyfriend isn't allowed at my wedding? In a few months, I (F29) will be getting married to my fiancee Jason (M32) who is the love of my life. We have a date, a venue and a theme ready and the next step was to send out invitations. For some more context, my relationship with my sister Harriet (F23) has been strained over the last few months because of her relationship with her boyfriend Anthony (M51). I vocally disapproved of her relationship from the get-go because of the age gap, reasoning that Anthony is taking advantage of her. However, my pleas have largely fallen on deaf ears, as Harriet's continued to date Anthony and insists that the two of them are in love.

Anyway, when Jason and I were mailing out invitations, we sent one to Harriet but made sure that she didn't have a +1, because I don't want Anthony at my wedding since a) I don't like him and b) he'll be a distraction. When Harriet found out, she called me absolutely livid and tore into me for being ""callous"" and ""ageist."" I countered by saying that it was my wedding and that I had full discretion over who was and wasn't allowed to come and that was that, and that she could either come by herself or not come at all. Harriet and I haven't spoken since then and I feel a little guilty about this, but at the same time I feel like I'm making the right choice.",0.57

"AITA for arguing with my wife about hanging out with my friends? My(20M) wife(20F) and I got married in October and up until this, everything was sheer bliss. A couple of nights ago, I got a text from a buddy of mine saying that a group of our friends were going to meet up and play basketball, just for fun, just as something to do. I told him I was in and started getting ready to head out. This is how the conversation with my wife went.

Her: Where are you going?

Me: Play a little basketball. I'll be home soon

Her:  Gee, thanks for asking  \*rolls eyes, folds arms\*

Me: Great, now you're mad

Her: Why can't I be mad? You're inconsiderate. You were just gonna leave

Me: For a couple hours

Her: Fine, just go, who cares? I don't care. Do whatever you want

Me: Nope, nope. You're mad so now I'm not going because if I go you'll be even angrier and then I'll hear about it

Her(sarcastic tone): Yes, this is my fault. Not you who thought he was just going to leave and not say shit to your literal wife.

"AITA for threatening to call CPS on my friend if she doesn’t stop smoking weed in the car with her children? I have a BFF and I love her to death but this is one thing I cannot stand. Besides the glaring fact that she smokes weed while her children are in the car, I would classify her as a good mom. Her baby daddy cheated on her and is not really in the picture. 

She has a two and four year old. When I asked her to stop this, she said that she knows it wrong but isn’t worried about it because she has the windows down and no smoke gets in the car. She isn’t worried about driving stoned because apparently she doesn’t get stoned anymore.. she said weed is just a stress reliever. 

Either way, I’m so upset that she continues to do this. I wanna call CPS and just get it through her head that this is wrong.

"AITA: Asked Non-Snoring Husband to Try Earplugs I’m a loud snorer with sleep apnea. I used to have a CPAP, and for about two years was able to use  an oral appliance to stop my snoring and my apnea. That changed after I had my second child,  the weight has been slow to come off, and although the apnea is no longer an issue I still snore. So I wear a CPAP once again.

I’m happy to do this for my husband and my health. However, in the eight or so years that I have been dealing with this, I’ve tried every single potential treatment, seen every doctor, paid a fortune for supplies and co-pays, and slept uncomfortably every single night. Even the oral appliance that is minimally invasive hurts my mouth a lot.

In the years that I have been dealing with this, my husband has not tried anything on his end other than buying large one package of earplugs when we started dating. He has refused to do absolutely anything, even order a different brand of earplugs from Amazon.

I accept that the snoring is my issue, and I own responsibility for addressing it. At the same time, I deeply resent the lack of effort from my partner to find a solution that could make my sleep better too. If the earplugs don’t work, that‘s fine - it’s the effort that I’m looking for.

"AITA for getting pissed off when my husband said; “He didnt want to be someone Bitch for the rest of his work life” ? I female (36) and my husband male (36) own and operate a business together. Technically he has 51% of the business so we get veteran benefits. 

The business is in my line of work so it’s my job to manage, organize and schedule. It’s my husbands job to run number, payroll and over all accounting with 50% of his time answering emails and helping with bigger events that happen maybe 3/4 times a year. 

We have been trying to build a new location and it’s been a shit show. We bought land and have been trying to develop it and put up a new building but our GC left the project and stole 200k from us. So there’s been a lot of stress. 

My husband came to me today expressing he’s to overwhelmed with the financial side and needed me to look over everything. But as I asked questions I found he doesn’t have any systems in place. He would have to make all the spread sheets in order to answer my questions. I started to get very annoyed. This isn’t the first time he’s dropped the ball on organizing and completing his job expectations. Finally I asked the hard question “why do you expect me to do my part and hold your hand in order for you to execute you job”? 

A bit of a background on his personality… he isn’t organized so I make lists, he procrastinates so I make a chart/calendar with deadlines, and has trouble with confrontation so I gave him a handbook to reference. 

Today he said he wanted out of the business because he needs to do something for himself. And said “I don’t want to be someone’s Bitch for the rest of his life”.  I snapped! I took this as; he doesn’t respect me as the expert, he thinks I’m controlling, and doesn’t want to work with me.

"AITA for wanting to leave without any warning? I (29F) met my boyfriend (33M), a widower with two kids (now 10 and 12), 7 years ago. Initially, I was content with my career and friendships, I moved in with him but felt like an outsider despite a good relationship with the kids. 

There are pictures of his wife in the house and I’ve never had a problem with this. I also never called myself their mother since Im not. However, I do most of the chores, i help the kids with their homework and I have a full time job (I’m a nurse practitioner). Seeing his enduring love for his late wife sparked a desire for a similar love story, causing me to question my place and desirability compared to his deceased wife. I know that comparison is the thief of joy. I’m not jealous of her, and I feel so bad for “living the life” she was suppose to live.

Despite not seeking reassurance, I find myself grappling with insecurities about being a ""downgrade"" and feel that my role is to support his family until he reunites with his wife. She had blond hair and blue eyes and had the figure of a model. I have brown hair, glasses and I’m 5’2 and 140 pounds which is not skinny. I’m conflicted about wanting my partner to love me as much as he loved (and still does) his wife but I don’t think it’s possible with him. Don’t get me wrong, he’s a great partner and dad, but I just feel like no matter what I do, I’ll never be enough. 

I would love to have kids of my own so I can speak my native language with them (French) but I’m hesitant about having children with him and I feel guilty for wanting to be his number one. That’s why I want to leave him and try to find my person. The only thing is that I know he and the kids will be blindsided since I’ve never talked about that subject.",0.42
"AITA for not wanting my sister to join our plans 
Hey everyone, 

So, my parents and I had been planning this road trip for weeks, just us and my 2 siblings. We were all set to go when suddenly, at the last minute, my sister decides she wants to join us. And now, to top it off, my brother-in-law wants to come along too.

I love my family, but this really threw a wrench into our plans. We had everything organized and now we have to cram into the car with two extra people and a crying toddler for 10+ hours. Not to mention that we also have to sort our luggage and somehow reduce our bag number so they could put theirs. My sister always had a tendency to be a bit selfish and always want things her way regardless of what anyone else wants. But I didn’t think she’d still insist on coming at the expense of everyone’s comfort just cause she wants to. 

I'm really frustrated with them for making this decision without consulting us first and for not considering how it would affect everyone else. My parents ofc just welcomed them and said the more the merrier but me and my siblings are enraged. Am I the asshole for being mad at them? Should I just suck it up and deal with it, or do I have a right to be upset?

"AITA for refusing to dress up around friends because my partner wants me to? My partner is a big believer in appearing your best and takes a lot of pride in his own style and presentation, whether it’s at work, on a date, or at a get-together with friends. I will dress appropriately for a special occasion, but I am quite casual if just at a friend’s place or the pub. For context, I’m a performing artist and dress formally for work, wear full face make-up for stage lights, etc. When I get home, I can’t wait to throw on leggings and a t shirt or sweater. 

My partner is very bothered by this “new side” of me. He specifically dislikes my style when we hang out with his friends - usually a t-shirt and leggings with Birks or other comfy shoes. Maybe makeup. From his view, it’s important to represent ourselves well as a unit, since we are a couple, and he wants to appear sophisticated and modern together. Mind you, most of these nights involve beer pong with a group of guys in their mid-late 20s in baseball caps.

I find it deeply insulting that although there are far more interesting and valuable things about me, he has chosen to fixate on my appearance. I believe in letting people show themselves through their actions and personality. Also I just think fashion trends are dumb. 

To drive my point home, I have not put a single ounce of extra effort into dressing well for events with his friends. If anything, I have leaned even harder into the leggings and t shirt aesthetic. It’s grown into one of our biggest fights. I know that it would be much easier if I just made an effort to wear something different when we go out. I refuse to.

"AITA for trying to get my mid-50's mom to work? Mom is currently mid-50's and hasn't had a job for over 35 years. No relevant education either, don't think she has a degree. She has been a stay at home mom/wife since before I was born. Her primary declared reason for a lack of career / income is social anxiety, and also that it's a lot harder for someone in her situation (no degree, no experience, starting from scratch in mid-50's). She shuts down the topic if I bring it up, or if my dad brings it up too. She's physically able, no major health issues. Due to a lack of working all this time, she won't be receiving any social security for herself. But whenever my dad passes, she will be able to collect half of his.  
  
Dad is mid-70's and has been the sole provider for my mom and mid-30's mentally disabled brother all this time. My brother also doesn't have any college background, and never worked a day in his life. My brother is emotional and angry all the time, people have a hard time understanding his slurred speech impediments, he can't drive, and he wants to never work for his life either, just stays at home and enjoys his video games / movies. My brother collects a disability related social security assessed by his mental disabilities, but it's not much.  
  
Dad has mostly had low paying odd-ball jobs, not a steady career, but luckily came into a bit of a windfall of money \~5 years ago. Every dollar of that was put towards a relatively cheap house he bought a few years ago, which is fully paid off. Dad, mom, and brother all live in it. Dad and mom have probably \~$15k in debt on cars and \~$5k debt in hospital bills. Almost nothing in savings, and zero in retirement accounts. Brother has no money or debts.  
  
Dad's health isn't good, and hasn't been for over a decade. He has diabetes and cardiovascular issues cause him to go to the hospital several times a year. He won't change his diet or exercise. He has a company provided life insurance plan but it's not much, just enough to cover the associated expenses for when he passes.  
  
As these hospital visits occur more frequently, I'm trying to think logical and plan further ahead. When/if my dad passes, the income in my mom's household will drop dramatically. This will be a greater concern especially as inflation / economy gets worse.

"AITA for not wanting my mom to track my phone? Context: throwaway because some irl people know my main. I’m 16m and I originally didn’t have my phone tracked since I got it (when I was in like 8th grade, now I’m in 10th) until my younger brother (14m as of now) got his phone earlier this year in January. Now my mom has been pretty strict about turning on my location whenever I go anywhere a foot outside my house. For the rest of the post, the only people will be me, my mom, and my dad. 

Okay so I’m on spring break right now and I want to, and have been encouraged to by my mom to go outside and hang out with my friends. It’s been about halfway through spring break and all I’ve done was stay inside mostly because I find it harder to have fun when it feels like I am being watched by my parents. (Keep in mind I don’t do anything sketchy or stuff my parents would disapprove of. I exclusively stay in town with my friends. I live in a middle-upper class suburb which has extremely low crime rates. I’m not buying drugs. I don’t have a gf so they shouldn’t be worried about me getting someone pregnant) I tried to find a reasonable opportunity to bring up turning off my tracker in a hopefully logical conversation. 

I just told my mom I was going to bike with friends and waited to see if she would tell me to turn on my tracker. She did so I just took off my shoes and waited. Fast forward 30 minutes and I get food in the kitchen where she is near and she is surprised and asks why I’m not outside. I explain how I changed my mind and she asks why. I then go explain how I didn’t want to turn on my tracker because it doesn’t feel like I can have fun and it feels like she doesn’t trust me.

Instead of having a reasonable conversation that I expected she started crying and yelling about how she needs it in case of me getting hit by a car, family emergency, if I’m out past curfew (which I never stay out that late), etc. I explain my side/refuting hers about how she wouldn’t know if I get hit by a car via my location, being able to text me or call me for an emergency, and how I am home before 6 always which is before dark and before the 10pm curfew. I then say my part about feeling restricted, not being able to enjoy myself, etc.

She responds by saying she doesn’t want to take away my freedom and I should just turn it on and forget that it is on. She then goes on about how she needs the peace of mind. I say that I also need my own peace of mind and she needs to learn to trust me. She then has to go pick up my brother and says this conversation isn’t over.

Fastforward maybe an hour ish. My dad calls me and asks me what made my mom upset. I explain what happened and his response was basically just “I understand you feel like you want more freedom and I agree that you should, but please just humor your mom. She worries too much. We also pay for your phone and you aren’t 18 yet.” I say okay and hang up. Fast forward to dinner and my mom asks me if we are good and I lie and say we are but she is still upset aboutit",0.32
"AITA for lying about when dinner is ready? I (23M) have been living with my girlfriend (29F) for a little over a year. She works from home as a software developer and makes more than enough money to comfortably cover all our expenses, so I do the homemaking, which includes cooking dinner every night.  
  
Lately she's been especially busy at work and staying in her home office later and later. Even after leaving she'll often have to answer messages from work. Needless to say, she has been exhausted and hasn't had the energy to go out or do fun things together.  
  
I try to at least give her a delicious hot dinner that we can always find time to eat together. But when I call her over because dinner is ready, it'll often take her 5-10 minutes to actually come. Sometimes she's responding to a work email, sometimes she's playing video games and wants to finish what she's doing, sometimes she's just decompressing on the couch and takes a long time to get up. I'm sympathetic to her situation, but it really bothers me when I work hard on dinner and she doesn't even eat the food when it's hot and at its best. It's even more frustrating when she complains that the food is cold or mushy, because if she had just come when I called her it would be much better.  
  
A few weeks ago I decided to try calling her for dinner 5 minutes before the food is actually ready, and most of the time this worked and she showed up when the food was still fresh. But last night she actually did show up immediately after I called her, while the pasta was still boiling. She asked why I called her when the food wasn't finished yet and I explained that I didn't think she'd actually come until a few minutes later.  
  
Initially she seemed fine with it, and was just a little annoyed that she had to wait longer for dinner. But as we were eating she asked how long I had been lying to her about dinner being ready. I answered her straightforwardly because I didn't think it was a problem, but she just got more and more upset that I had apparently been manipulating her for weeks, and that I didn't understand why lying to her is a big deal. She ended up not finishing dinner and slept in her office.  
  
I guess that what I did is technically lying, but it's just a little white lie that ultimately benefits her. Even when she had to wait for pasta, she didn't go without dinner for any longer than she usually would. But she got so angry last night that I keep wondering if I actually did something really bad.

Zoe's 25th birthday is coming up, and Harry wants to throw his sister a surprise birthday party. He told me about it and I was on board. We called Zoe's girlfriend of around 2 years, Kate (28F) and asked for her help.

Kate is a medical doctor, currently a neurology resident, and she couldn't meet up with us in person because she was busy. But she did speak on the phone with Harry and I, and said she had managed to get Zoe's birthday off and had a two-person surprise plan for the day since months ago.

After the call, Harry said while a two-person celebration was nice, Zoe loves people and would love to spend her birthday with her favourive people. He insisted Kate was a unidimentional person, with her focus on only her job, and wouldn't understand how much this celebration would mean to her.

This kind of got on my nerves and I may be TA here. I told Harry he could plan his surprise for any other day, and that he should leave Kate out of it. Kate doesn't love many people, isn't that social, but she's a very smart, polite, ambitious and kind woman who literally treats Zoe like a princess. So I told Harry to suck it up and sit down and re-plan the whole thing.

Harry was really offended and said I should be taking the side of my son and not Kate who is at this point only Zoe's girlfriend. I feel like maybe I went a bit too far. Aita?

We ended up being together for just over a year until she cheated on me and I kicked her out. That was three years ago.

I've been with my current girlfriend (21) for 3 months, we don't live together but we spend most weekends together. Usually at her place.

She's 16 and in out country you can move out at 16 without parents consent so I agreed and I picked her up the next day after work. I talked to my ex and she denied that her new boyfriend was being abusive but she told me to take her daughter as she was ""tired of dealing with her"". 
I told my girlfriend afterwards about this while situation and she got really upset with me that I didn't ask her. So I told her that we don't live together, and I spend most weekends at her place anyway. We had a fight about this and even though it's been a few days she's still angry with me.

We are technically divorced but are trying to work on our marriage, plus we have a 6 month old son who needs the both of us. Lately though he's been annoying the hell out of me, making excuses saying its his adhd, and we've been arguing alot. 

I do TikTok for a living and I like going live daily, he'll say shit that he knows can get me a live banned. If I ask him to do things or for small favors he cusses me out and makes me feel awful. 

We got into a nasty argument yesterday over something very little. I was live and wanted him to go into McDonald's to order us lunch because I'm always the one doing nice favors for the both of us. He then proceeded to call me lazy and run his mouth how he's ""tired of always having to be the one to pull his weight in our marriage"". Like okay you don't even work lmao... while I'm the one who brings in the income. 

Well things turned nasty, and of course he got me banned from going live. I told him to go kick rocks and kicked him out of my car.

"AITA for getting mad at my friend not hanging out with me Just a few days ago, I (20M) invited a friend (let's call him John (21M)) to play a video game with me in a few minutes later. He said he would see and I told him I would come back to him whenever I was actually free. Half an hour later I came back telling him I was ready to which I got no reponse whatsoever.  
  
This wasn't the first time he had done this to me before, and I could tell he was online because he was playing league and rocket league the whole day.  
I forgot about it until a few hours later when I saw him playing the same game I invited him way before, just without me. And he never even got back to my old message, that's when I lost it.  
When I confronted him, he told me I was a narcissist for thinking him not answering and not playing with me meant he hated me or I wasn't a good friend. He told me he had been struggling with depression and mental health issues so he had been struggling to reply.

"AITA for faking my giving birth? I'll keep this as short as possible.
I (25f) am pregnant with the baby due in a couple of days. My husband (25m) promised that he would be the one to drive me to the hospital & that he will be glued to the phone until birth. He works only 10 minutes from our home & his boss agreed to let him go when the birth happens.

The problem is my mother-in-law. My husband & her have an unhealthily (IMO) strong bond & she is overly involved in our relationship which has caused many issues in the past. She requires his attention every day, she has suggested moving in with us ever since I became pregnant, she also has ""emergencies"" whenever we have anniversaries, important occasions (like my birthday) etc. 

As the date is approaching I became increasingly worried that his mother will have an ""emergency"" during birth & I will have trouble getting to the hospital or will be forced to be alone during. I voiced my concerns & it caused fights between me & them. I even suggested asking my bsf to drive me & keep me company (as I'm scared of giving birth) but it was shot down with ""how can't you trust your own husband?!"".

So, I'm not proud of it but I faked giving birth yesterday. I called my hubby at work, told him it started, he said he will be right there. After half an hour, I called him to ask where he was & he didn't answer. After almost an hour he called me to say he is at the hospital with his mom because, guess what, she is having a medical emergency... Apparently he called her to tell her I am giving birth & she got ""a heart attack"" from excitement... He said he will have to miss my birth & actually asked me to call my friend to drive me & stay with me...

I admit, I was very angry & heartbroken so I told him I wasn't actually giving birth & that it was a test that showed me how he would actually behave vs what he said he would do & it that it proved he would always care for his mother more than for his own wife whose carrying his child. He was very angry & even blamed me for his mother's heart attack in that moment. 

His mom of course didn't have a heart attack but a ""false alarm"". I felt very justified but now that we talked I feel guilty. He said he feels manipulated & gaslighted. That just because his mother lied about the emergency doesnt mean I should lie to him. He said that marriage is built on trust so I have to trust him instead of lying to him to prove a point. He even said that he didn't choose his mother over me but chose a ""bigger emergency"" & that he knew I could ""handle getting to the hospital"" but his mother needed him more & that a heart attack is more serious. I pointed out she lied but he said he ""couldn't have known that"" & that I was ""just as bad for lying"".

About 2 weeks before, however, a friend (B) I got into an argument. It got pretty heated, so B went across the cafeteria to C and her friends and asked her if she liked me, basically blowing the 'private' part of my plan, and basically hinting that I liked her. I was mad, he was mad, C was embarrassed, and basically everyone at C's table was either giggling or asking her if she did. 

This is where I may be an AH. B's crush was also at this table, so I walked up there, and practically shouted that B liked her. Looking back, she just got caught in the crossfire, tbh. The whole table erupted into more chaos. 

B has been refusing to talk with me for the past week or so and I'm afraid I've just lost a friend, and I'm an absolute AH.

"AITA For telling my girlfriend to stop with the manipulation?  My (27m) girlfriend (23f) and I have been together for two years. I moved into her apartment 6 months ago and things have been going well. Until we had an argument last week about the next moves. 

Our lease ends in 9 months, and I’ve been mentioning getting a bigger place together since it’s only a one bedroom. 

She tells me “I’m not going to move into a bigger place until I have some level of commitment” Then she went on to explain how if things don’t work out between us, she has nowhere to go and won’t be able to afford the rent on her own. She has no family, and explained how she could possibly be homeless as she found a good deal on the apartment we live in now and “that gives her a sense of stability for herself”

That caught me off guard, so I told her “That’s feeling like I’m going to be forced to do that now” 

After I said that, the argument started. 

She said to me “Really? You’d feel forced? Didn’t you just ask what kind of ring shape I like the other week? I thought we were on the same page” and began to cry. 

Yes, over the past few months, I may have done things that would hint for a proposal within the next year. I did ask her what ring shape she likes, we have talked in detail about our wedding, and kids. I said to her that I’ve been thinking about coming home to a little one the other week. 

But all of that was in a future sense.  As I don’t have a specific timeline. I’m just taking things one day at a time. She tells me I’m saying things “men with a timeline would say” 

I just wanted it to be special when I propose. A surprise. I was just looking into rings. 

But it all comes off as manipulation. Since she’s basically telling me if I want to live in a bigger space, I have to propose.",0.97
"AITA for not wanting to sleep over my friend’s dorm after she caused me to spend the night in jail?  I (M21) have a friend I’ve known for about 4 years (F22). Recently she just got out of a year long abusive relationship and hasn’t been taking it the best. 

Last Friday, after we took her dog for a walk and got something to eat for dinner, she asked me to stay the night at her apartment to keep her safe and secure since she was feeling upset. I could tell she was having a hard time with the breakup and it wouldn’t be the first time I stayed over to comfort her so I was okay with it.

Usually she talks or moves a bit in her sleep when she has nightmares, but last weekend she had a full on night terror. She sat straight up and started full on screaming “he’s going to hurt me” over and over again. I tried to calm her down but her roommate heard her screaming and called the police. 

When they got there, she still wasn’t coherent and all she could say was “he’s going to hurt me, stay away” or something to that extent. I didn’t even have a chance to explain what was happening, they detained me and had me spend the night in jail. It wasn’t until the afternoon after when they released me. 

I had a talk with her after, she said she was having flashbacks to when her and her ex would get into fights and couldn’t help it after repeatedly apologizing. 

Fast forward to yesterday, I haven’t really talked to her much this week at all. She asked me if I’d like to go to the bar with her this weekend with a couple of her girlfriends and spend the night again. I told her I wasn’t comfortable at all after last weekend then asked if one of them could spend the night with her. Especially if there’s alcohol involved too. She said I was the only person she trusted and was comfortable enough to sleep in the same bed with for security. I told her again that I wasn’t comfortable with the idea. She hasn’t texted me since. 

I’ve tried my best to be there to help, even getting her into therapy for other reasons. But I’m not okay with putting my safety at risk.

"AITA - Do i break up with him or not? For context, i’m a 18 year old female from Wales and so is my boyfriend 18 year old male, also from Wales.
I’m unsure what to do about the situation i am in and could use some help.

So my boyfriend has 3 girls in particular he likes to talk to, let’s call them Sarah, Lola and Charlotte. I have stated to him multiple times that i do not like him talking to these girls which i got a response of “You can’t control who i talk to” i understand yet i still tell him i am uncomfortable with him talking to these girls. Eventually i got fed up and about a month ago i messages Sarah myself and told her that she isn’t allowed to talk to him anymore as i am uncomfortable by it, she understood and blocked him off of everything really easily. 

Now, the girl called Lola, was the reason me and my boyfriend broke up the first time as he slept with her (non sexual way) which i obviously got very annoyed by which is why we broke up. Me and my boyfriend eventually got back together although he still likes to talk to her now and again, i am not really bothered by this one though as she is a family friend to him and i have grown to understand i can’t stop him from speaking to a family friend.

Although, when it comes to Charlotte i am really annoyed. He likes to pick her over me, his own girlfriend which i just find rude and disrespectful. He always talks to her and when i bring it up that i am uncomfortable with the situation he completely ignores me and disregards my feelings like im some random girl he’s speaking to.

Here’s the thing though, my boyfriend is my first everything and im unsure if i want to loose him over this girl. It doesn’t help that Charlotte used to like him a couple months back before we got back together and probably still does like him? I have no proof of that though.

Someone please help me and tell me what to do because i really am not sure if i want to loose him over this girl.",0.95
"AITA for choosing the bride over my best friend One of my best friends begins planning for her birthday months in advance, she usually plans a full weekend of going to bars/breweries/wineries and she invites about a dozen people.  Not sure if it is relevant, but we are in our late 20s.  She and I casually texted about her plans and I of course said I would be free because it was about 3 months away at the time.

Fast forward to about a month ago, I got an invitation to my boyfriend’s brothers fiancés bridal shower.  My boyfriend and I have been together for 5 years, and my boyfriend is the best man in their wedding.  I was on their engagement trip and while the bride and I are not best friends, the men in our lives are very close.  I am also very familiar with the family since I’ve been with my bf for a while.  The bridal shower happens to fall on the same weekend as my friends birthday, and the events are 5 hours apart from one another, so I will not be able to attend both Saturdays.  

As soon as I got the invitation, I texted my friend saying I had been invited to the bridal shower on the same weekend, thinking she would understand, she did not.  She responded “well, what are you going to do” and is very upset that I would want to go to the shower instead of her birthday.  I let her know I would make it up to her and am even seeing her the Friday night before I leave for the shower.   She stopped responding.  

The weekend is about 2 weeks away now.  I want to attend the shower, if my boyfriend and I end up getting married one day I would like for the bride to be there for me.  I also think the mother of my boyfriend would be disappointed in my choosing a weekend of drinking instead of celebrating with the family.  Plus I just feel like bridal showers are once in a lifetime versus a birthday that happens every year.  

Another part of this whole dilemma is that my boyfriend and his brother recently had a stupid fight on the bachelor trip and are in the process of making up, so I also feel like if I skipped the bridal shower, that may make it seem like I am trying to extend the fight, which is absolutely not the case.  AITA?


EDITS I LEFT OUT IN OG POST: I let my friend know before she had to make any reservations that I could not attend, she did not have to pay any additional fees due to my cancellation, I let her know 6 weeks in advance, and she is still able to go do everything, she is not missing out due to me.


The bride is definitely not a stranger, I’ve known her for 4 years now, we just are not as close as my birthday friend as bride lives 5 hours away.  We have gone on many family vacations and trips and spend holidays together.

"AITA for adopting the child my sister wanted to adopt?  I (34M) have two sisters, Amy (36F) and Jane (31F). Amy and her husband have been trying to conceive for the better part of a decade but nothing seems to be working for them. 

2 years ago they went for another round of IVF but sadly Amy miscarried once again. Due to the complications following this miscarriage she became sterile. This of course devastated her and her husband because they really wanted to start a family of their own. 

They are now looking into adoption but it’s a long and slow process since Amy’s husband has a criminal record from when he was 19. 

A year ago my sister Jane gave birth to her son Sam. The pregnancy was the result of a one night stand Jane had during her vacation in Italy, and although it was unexpected and the father wouldn’t be in the picture Jane decided to keep the baby. 

Sadly Jane had a stroke when Sam was 6mo and passed away. It was very unexpected and most of the family is still grieving. After the funeral, we started to discuss who will take Sam in. 

My parents were out of the question since they are too old and won’t be able to take care of him. So it was between Amy and I. 

Amy jumped at the opportunity and volunteered to take Sam in, and although this seemed to be the ideal solution at first, the way Amy spoke about the adoption didn’t sit right with me. 

She wanted to change Sam’s name and surname, and asked us not no mention Jane around Sam after the adoption would be finalized. Essentially Amy wanted to raise Sam as her own and didn’t think telling him his bio mom passed away would do him any good. 

To me this felt like Amy was trying to erase Jane’s memory and was treating her like some surrogate and not a sister whom she lost. 

After much consideration, I didn’t like the idea that Sam would grow up without knowing who his bio mother was. And although I already have 5 children of my own, I decided to contest the adoption and volunteered to adopt him instead. 

We went to court, and it was recently determined that my wife and I would be adopting Sam.

Amy is furious at me and is calling me an asshole for ruining her chances at becoming a mother. She is saying that I already have many children of my own so I don’t understand how badly she wants to become a parent. Some relatives are now calling me selfish for taking this chance away from Amy and are telling me that instead of thinking of what would be better for Sam I was thinking about how to preserve the memory of Jane. 

Although I don’t regret adopting Sam, I’m starting to doubt whether I made the right decision for his future. 

I know that Amy would have made a great mother and that both her and her husband would absolutely adore Sam. And as their only child they would probably be able to provide him a better life financially. However them wanting to erase all memories of Jane just doesn’t feel right.

"AITA for not inviting the neighbors to our daughter’s bday party and then awkwardly kicking them out? Hi. Yesterday was my daughter’s 8th birthday and we did a princess themed party. The only people invited were family or family friends. 

My relationship with my neighbors is meh. We wave if we see them but otherwise we don’t talk to each other or anything really.

During my daughter’s birthday party, held in our yard that is semi-fenced, I started to bring out the cupcakes for the kids. When handing them out I noticed that 2 kids were definitely not invited because they weren’t my nieces/nephews or of a family friend. I then realized they were my neighbors kids. I paused handing out cupcakes to ask why they were here and one of the kids just shrugged and said “my mommy said I could go”. I told them it was inappropriate to just come here. My husband escorted them back to their parents house. All the neighbors houses are decently spaced so it’s not necessarily dangerous but we felt better if someone walked with the kids.

Later on, I think after we did the whole cake cutting, our neighbors approached again. This time it was both parents and the kids. I asked what they were doing and they looked confused, saying they were joining the party. I was a little agitated now and sternly said they were not invited, that this was a birthday party for my daughter and family/family friends were invited. It was awkward as they left and the kids kept whining as they did.

Next day, today, I got a handwritten letter in my mailbox about how I treated the neighbors rudely and it’s expected to share community events. Was I too rude/harsh?",0.33
"AITA for wondering what my life would be if i wasn't married.  This is a long post. Some background. Me and my husband have been together since 8th grade on and off but has been solid since senior year in high school. We are 33 now and have been married for 12 years. 1 son who is 4 years old. He was my first everything but i was not his and that fact has never really bothered me I would give him crap about it but never serious about it. Everything he has wanted to do in life so far, he has done. I have never said no to him (except for normal stuff like going somewhere) and always accommodated my life for him. I have been this way because of the way I was raised. In church and always witnessed my aunts being servants to their husbands. So I felt if I stopped him from doing something then I would be a bad wife. He is a great provider and has always been a hard worker, something i admire him for. But for the past couple of years, we have been going through a rough patch. It came down to him not choosing me. No cheating. Choosing his family members over me, going to them with his problem instead of confiding in me. Well, it came to a head last year, so bad that I saw a divorce attorney. He got himself into stuff that could get him into legal trouble and i hit my limit. My attorney advised me to file and remove his name from our accounts to protect myself. I didn't go through with the divorce because I see red when i picture him moving on. He agreed to remove his name from all our accounts. I fixed his possible legal problems. we did marriage counseling, but he wanted to stop because he felt the counselor always praised me for being the wife I am staying supporting him when most would have left and always pointing out his faults. I found out a lot more during counseling and started realizing I deserve better. Cheating is a hard line for me. But i can't stop wondering and picture my life with another man. Our sex life is okay, but I always wanted him to be dominant which doesn't work because he wants me to be the dominant one during sex. It's a turn-off for me but will do it. I have been wondering how it would be with different men and I also feel disgusted with myself for even thinking about it. What are your thoughts?",0.03
"AITA for taking space for the night from my BF after he told me that I don’t remember important parts of our convos I (25F) and my partner (27M) have been together now for almost 7 years. Over that time we’ve grown a lot together and things have been amazing in our relationship for the last year or two. Were both NeuroDivergent and that can sometimes lead to some misunderstanding based arguments but we’ve gotten really good at navigating our feelings and that hasn’t happened in a while. 

This brings us to the present, early yesterday morning (1:00AM) we were both getting ready for bed, when I overheard him talking to a friend of his about his upcoming summer job. He mentioned a specific start date and I got a bit upset. After he was done on the phone, I made sure to compose myself and then let him know that I was a little upset I had to find out his start date through listening to him talk to his friend. He then starts adamantly telling me that there were multiple times he’s told me before and he was hurt I didn’t remember. 

I really felt like he didn’t tell me but when I expressed to him how I felt, he got very defensive. He told me that he definitely told me before and he was frustrated because he feels like i never listen to him. Naturally, i felt awful because who wants their partner to feel like that and if I truly am forgetting these interactions i feel like it’s indicative of a bigger mental health issue for me. I told him i was sorry and that treating him like that wasn’t ok and that I wanted to spend the night by myself to reflect and do some research to see if i can find the thing that might be going on in my head. I’ll admit i was cold, but i let him know it wasn’t because of him. If there really is something wrong with how my brain takes information, It’s just a lot to take in. He got extremely upset at me for wanting to sleep elsewhere and came out multiple times acting sorry and trying to placate me, which feels weird to me because why is he sorry if I just affirmed to him that I know I did the wrong thing? I haven’t slept all night because i truly don’t know how to reconcile this. Every time he would come out and try to comfort me, it felt like he felt so guilty. I’ve been with my husband for several years and i feel like i have a pretty good grasp on his reactions and behaviors. This isn’t how he normally acts in disagreements when i acknowledge his feelings and i’m having a really hard time understanding where his need to comfort me and make excuses for my behavior is weird.

On to the issue my MIL and her husband had been taking Auggie every Thursday afternoon to help out as I had had my youngest son, I'll call him Damien, just over a month before and we were all still adjusting to the big change in our family dynamic as Auggie is autistic and nonverbal so the adjustment took a little longer for him.

"AITA for taking a shower while my boyfriend was over? My mom is ignoring my existence now. I 19f live at home with my siblings 17f, 12f, and our parents. My parents are strict but I'm okay with it since I still live with them and I try to follow the rules. I have a boyfriend who comes by the house some days of the week. He never stays the night and always leaves before it gets too late.

A problem arose a few days ago when I had my bf over. He tends to leave at the same time every time he comes over and after he leaves I take a shower for work the next day. I was tired and wanted to take a shower earlier because I felt gross and was just in the mood for a shower. My bf hadn't left the house yet but I took a shower anyways. Context, I have taken a shower while he was over before and I usually keep the door unlocked unless I'm doing more than showering 🚽🧻. He came into the bathroom while I was showering just to talk to me. He did this last time and there was no issue so I didn't think anything of it. 

After I got out of the shower we hung out for a little bit longer then he left. I was going to bed so I said goodnight to my mom and she gave me the cold shoulder, something she does when she's mad at me. I didn't know what was going on so I brushed it off as her having a long day. When I went to say goodnight to my dad he asked me if I took a shower with my bf, I said no, and he said that's what he thought. He then said that my mom overheard me telling my 12f sibling that I wanted her to get out of the bathroom so I could shower with my bf. I told him I didn't say that, it seemed we had a mutual understanding that it was just a mix up and I went to bed. 

The next day my mom was still ignoring me. I went to work (I work 10 hour shifts) and when I got home she hadn't changed. Now I am laying low in the house trying to not draw attention to myself. 

I am stressing out about what she is thinking. My parents have said I am a bad influence on my siblings in the past but I'd like to think I have a good understanding of what I am allowed and not allowed to do by now. When she is upset she won't talk to me for a few days before she blows up at me then she returns to normal. I want to just talk to her so we can clear the air but she completely blocks me out. I will stand next to her to talk and she won't even look at me or say anything.

"AITA for telling my wife to sell some of her collection My wife of 16 years is a huge fan of pop culture, video games, and anime. When we moved into our home she got her own gaming room with a computer and lights. This is when the problem began she started to collect things, figures, posters, props etc. At first I was happy we finally had the money to help her explore her interests. She quickly filled her gaming room so we converted our den to a collection room with display cases and shelves etc. 

Then this room got filled to and her things started to spread. They were in our room, under the kids bed, filled a full shelf in the living room. Eventually we got a storage unit but she filled that too and wanted another. I told her this would be the last one and when she filled that I told her she needed to get rid of some if she wanted more. 

She broke down and told me most of not all of the items were one of a kind or limited release and she would never be able to get them back, but the amount we are spending on these and the storage unit is becoming too much. 

I feel bad because she really does love these things but we don't have the space or money for more storage units. I stood firm and said she would need to sell out donate some but so far she has refused.

"AITA for putting people on a ""no drinking"" list for my wedding? I (22f) am getting married in 2 months. At our wedding, we have an open bar from when food starts to the end of the evening. The bar has beer, wine, and a specialty cocktail. My husband (23m) and I do not drink much, if ever, because we both take medication. There will be soda and water available as well. 

Our wedding has almost 100 guests. Out of our 100 guests, we have some 3 relatives and 2 close friends who are alcoholics. Due to friend/family drama and etiquette, we did not really have the option to not invite these people without there being significant social consequences. 

We have a list of those 5 people  we plan on giving to our bartender and instructing them not to be served alcohol. All 5 of these people know they have issues with alcohol and have been confronted by their own friends and family before for their drinking habits. These issues include being banned from bars, urinating in their pants due to overdrinking, causing physical fights, inciting screaming matches over something minor, and more. It is not like they just overdrink and need help getting home. 

As much as I love these people, they cause significant disruptions when they drink, and I do not want to risk something horrible happening on our wedding day. When talking about this with my friends and other relatives, I got several comments about how we should let them drink a few drinks so they do not feel embarrassed about not having / holding a drink, cut them off after a certain number of drinks, or that I would have a lot of fun at my wedding and not notice them acting poorly if they did. They also said we may get backlash for not allowing them to drink or that they may end up just taking someone else's drinks. They also said that I have already hired security for the event, so it isn't a big deal if they do need to be kicked out.

I told them that I am tired of having to plan ahead for people's addictions and all of them are capable of not drinking alcohol. We have already had to pay $1800 for security just to have 5 people attend and I do not want to pay any more for any incidents they may cause due to drinking.  My husband and I have had to consistently take care of alcoholics and deal with the consequences of their abuse and I will not prioritize them over us. 

I've been called unempathetic and inconsiderate of their feelings.

"AITA for telling my wife's friend that not everyone's as narcissistic as her? My wife Lisa & I have been married for over a year. I have access to her phone password, e-mail, etc (our bank account is a joint account). I take her phone whenever I want to, delete her mails without asking, etc. I take her money without permission. We consider it to be ""our"" money. **She does the same things to me, it's not one-sided.**

Her friend Hannah was visiting us yesterday. She saw me taking money from Lisa's purse sometime later. She was shocked and called out to Lisa to say that I was ""stealing"". I also had Lisa's phone in my hand at the time.

She was accusing me of things until Lisa explained that it's normal, etc. 

But then she said ""You let your husband take your money and phone? He's controlling you and you don't even care about it. Your husband is a controlling scumbag. If Ethan \[her husband\] did that, I'd be sending him a divorce notice immediately. ""

I snapped ""Well, it's a good thing that not everyone's a narcissist like you then.""

She got mad & began to yell, but Lisa was on my side. Hannah yelled about how I am toxic, etc. and in the end she left. She told Ethan about it & he's now mad at us as well.

"AITA for not wanting mother-in-law to have access to my daughter?  I (22f) and husband (23m) have a 5mo old daughter, this is our first. Unfortunately, we were playing catch-up financially after BOTH catching covid & missing work which forced us to move into a friends for some time. Eventually that situation with said friend wasn’t healthy nor safe, so after listening to his mom beg us for months to move in with her (because she wanted us to stay there for free & save money, HER WORDS EXACTLY) to move into a better stable environment for our daughter, we agreed to temporarily move into my her house. The first month or two was okay. They were sweet, we all got along & it was fun, a little pushy but I expected so considering this was the first grandchild & niece. 
But I very quickly realized why my husband & I had so many frequent arguments living together because he was raised completely different than I was. I also realized very quickly that his family never really liked me.. 

There were nights I would rush into the kitchen, sleep-deprived & completely exhausted, and hear mama-in-law talking about me to others.. It started off with her hating that I wouldn’t give her my baby more often. She wanted her hours on end every other day but she didn’t listen to my requests & boundaries when she had her so eventually I started shortening up the time.. She had her for 7 hours the longest and my baby went unfed & unchanged. So I only let her keep her for about 1-3 hours. I knew my child was getting the best care from ME but I also didn’t want to be selfish & respect an excited new grandmama so I COMPROMISED. It wasn’t enough.
Compromise after compromise, things I did for them unnoticed, it wasn’t enough. She started to want money for anything she wanted when she wanted it.. At some point we were putting food in the house, paid to keep her lights on & were still giving her money when she asked for it. It got to a point I had to embarrassingly ask a family member for money to buy my daughter diapers.. (to put into perspective her bills MAYBE ALL TOGETHER reach 1,000 a month which she already receives from HER husband) 
It finally got to a point after hearing her scream at my husband every day over money, and hearing her criticize everything I do or don’t do & causing problems in our relationship/finances that I told my husband I would not be dealing with it anymore. Couple days ago I heard her talking shit about me and saying if I couldn’t learn to do what she wanted me to, I had to go. So I packed my baby & I up & my husband & I are now trying to figure it all out. 

My problem is.. mama-in-law KNEW by kicking mama (me) out, her grandchild went with & she KNEW we had nowhere to go. She’s lucky I’ve been staying with family unnoticed (i could potentially get them into trouble for staying with them). AND she broke up my family (even tho its temporary, he cant stay where baby & i are) & if it takes 2, 3 ,4 months for us to find a place , thats time that neither my daughter or her father will get back.

"AITA for refusing to take pictures of my friend?  I(19F) recently went on vacation with a large group of people from my university. There’s one person in the friend group, Sandra (19F) who is quite pushy and always likes to be the centre of attention. Me and her have clashed in the past cos our personalities don’t mesh well but we both have been getting along fine the past couple of months. I decided I’d take my grandpas old film camera with me and get some cute pics for the gram. On the day we travelled I took a few pics, one of them being a bunch of my friends at the airport but I couldn’t fit everyone in.

After I took the photo she told me to take one of her and another friend, Amy. I politely refused and explained I want to save the film for the actual trip. I also had mentally decided to take one photo per place and she had already been in a picture of us leaving the house that morning. She responded with ‘okay so you don’t want any pictures with me and Amy in them. That’s fine.’ And I repeated what I said then she didn’t respond. Later on in the trip she saw me taking pictures of people from our university that I’m not necessarily close with, but they were doing something funny and I thought it’d be a cute memory. She seemed annoyed. Halfway through the trip the camera ran out of battery when I was trying to take a photo with Sandra in it. It was very obvious that I was frustrated the camera wasn’t working, but Sandra pulled a face as if I was doing it on purpose. 

In the end I only took 16/36 of the photos I had because of the battery but when we got back a bunch of us went to a bar and I used up the rest of the film. I took some pictures with Sandra in them but apparently she’s complained that my other friends are in a lot of the pictures and she’s only in a few. She’s not said this directly to me but I can see it becoming an issue in the future if I carry on using the camera. 

I feel like I may be the AH if I refuse because I have taken pictures of my other friends and they’ve posted them all over insta so I get that she’s annoyed but I also would like to be in more of the pictures myself because I’m not in half of them! It’s my camera so I’m paying for the film and for it to be developed and I don’t want to be peer pressured into taking pictures of people that don’t make any effort with me unless they want something.

It was a long journey since they live in a different state. David has three children: Jason (15 M), Aiden (16 M) and Rachel (14 )

Everything was going fine until I met them. I hugged Jason and Aiden, ruffling their hair. Asked about how their studies are going, that I hadn't seen them for a long time, Jason's sports, etc. And when Rachel arrived, I touched her cheek in greeting and said ""You have grown up a lot since I saw you.""

She just smiled and did not say anything, I thought everything was normal.

Later on I was in another room when David walked in to say ""I did not know that you are such a fucking pervert."" I was just... shocked and asked him what he was talking about. He said that Rachel did not like me touching her, that I am a pervert, etc.

We got into an argument & I said I did not mean bad by it, etc. and tried explaining. But he did not care & yelled at me. In the end I left the place. David said that he doesn't want to ever see me again, and that he'd report me to the cops if I even talk to Rachel.

"AITA for wanting my husband to love me and our daughter more than his parents? My husband found an app which automatically generates songs about any prompts you give it. We had fun generating songs about our 1 year old daughter for a while.

Then, I asked him for the phone so I could generate a song about him. The song included how much he loved his daughter and his cat. He asked why I wasn’t in it, and I said because I didn’t include it in the prompt.

He asked for his phone back and I was sure he was going to do a song about me, but he did one about the company we built together. It hurt my feelings, but I didn’t make a thing of it.

Later we went to give our daughter a bath and I asked him whether he still loved me. He said yes, and that he would be very hurt if anything happened to me. He said that the song I made of him should have included me, his parents, and “many other people”.

I didn’t know how to react about being included with his parents and many other people, so I just smiled (that’s just my reaction when I’m upset about things I’m not sure I should be upset about). He was put off by my smile and demanded to know what it was about, so I lied and said I didn’t think that fear of death is a good indicator of love. He was quite obsessed with proving me otherwise despite me asking him to drop it.

It was still on my mind though, so later in the bath I asked him whether he loved his parents as much as me and our daughter.

He insisted that it was a trick question and there was a bit of gaslighting (there’s always gaslighting when it comes to his parents for some reason), where he insisted he didn’t say that I should be in the song alongside his parents and other people. He screamed at me for a bit (again, this is another thing he does whenever his parents are concerned - they’re a sensitive topic for him) and then he asked me to make this thread.

"AITA for calling my cousin and aunt rude names? I 15 (F) play soccer. Last year i got a really bad concussion which caused me to lose my memory for a while. I got better and wanted to play for my high school and tried out with my cousin. Until i got injured AGAIN and messed up my ankle really bad while playing a scrimmage. 

My cousin called my dad and her mom. (Her mom raised me since i was 6 but i moved in with my dad two years ago due to our financial circumstances improving.) I was in the car with my dad and my cousin. I was already stressed and crying. My cousin then made the comment of saying “My mom said you’re not allowed to play soccer anymore.” 

This is the part where i kind of fucked up. I then yelled “MY AUNT IS NOT MY MOM.” (another fyi my mom isn’t in the picture.) 
Although my aunt raised me, I have never seen her as a “mother figure” due to her actions.

My cousin yelled back that it doesn’t matter and that I’m ungrateful. Me and my cousin were arguing and screaming but my dad doesn’t understand english so he didn’t understand anything.

"AITA for shooting down my boyfriend’s proposal idea? I (24F) have been dating my boyfriend (24M) for three years, and we’ve been friends for even longer (met our first day of college). Recently marriage has come up more and more, he’s always told me he’s been sure he wants to marry me but now it seems like a proposal could happen in the next 1-2 years.

One time about a year ago we were driving and a song came on, and he said “this is the song I’m gonna play when I ask you to marry me.” I thought it was sweet and kissed him but also didn’t realize he was serious - it was my first time EVER hearing that song and while the lyrics are cute it didn’t like really move me in any way and I have no connection to it.

Last night we got drunk and he brought up the song again as we were going to sleep. He was talking about our wedding, engagement etc. I was like “wait, you actually want to propose to me by singing that?” And he was like “yeah!” And I said “oh, I don’t know if I’d like that.” He started tearing up and I felt really bad, apparently the song had a lot of meaning to him as a kid and he always envisioned singing it to his future wife. But 1) I get really awkward when someone is serenading me and don’t find it romantic and 2) this song doesn’t really meaningfully relate to OUR relationship or MY interests/tastes/personalities and so it makes me feel like this generic projection of something he wanted as a kid over a real person.

He said he understands, but he was still silently crying a lot and I feel like shit. I told him if it means a lot to him maybe we could figure out a way to incorporate it but he’s like “no I don’t want to do anything you dislike when I’m proposing.”

"AITAH for supposedly ruining my sister’s birthday ? I female (26) and my sister Alexis (28) are pretty close. A lot has transpired in our lives in the last month. My sister Alexis has lost her mentor almost 2 wks ago and Our Godmom passed 3/29, just 2 days before my sister’s birthday which fell on Easter this year.

Alexis's cousin asked me to help her plan a birthday brunch for my sister two months ago, but I declined as I was already planning a surprise sisters brunch for her, which Alexis didn't know was for her birthday. The sisters brunch plan fell through 1.5 months later. My boyfriend and I are saving our full paychecks to move out of our current apartment due to iour slumlord.
On the day my Godmom passed, Alexis's cousin asked about plans. I said they fell through, but I sent half the money for my sister's hair. Originally, I planned an experience for her birthday (a spa day), but she said she didnt want to do anything if her hair wasn’t done so I offered to cover half, explaining it was my full budget. She agreed. We discussed me visiting, but my boyfriend took the car, and trains were on Easter schedule, making it a 3-hour trip instead of 40 minutes. I called and explained.
i called her yesterday and noticed she seemed distant recently. During the call, she mentioned a $900 trip despite facing eviction due to unpaid rent. She segued when I questioned it and mentioned her cousin's comment about a brunch she never had, her cousin’s intention was to stir up trouble, given their history.

Anyways, Alexis ultimately told me that if I knew that plan fell through I should’ve told her cousin so she can have someone who prioritize her birthday do something for her instead of sitting in the house alone with no gifts and had to grieve alone. She said I slighted her and that she didn’t get anything for her birthday. I told her I have her money for her hair and she said that wasn’t a gift since she got her hair done a day before her birthday. She also said that I technically didn’t pay for half her hair since my budget was $10 short of half and that still didn’t count.
Despite her claim of me not prioritizing her, in the past six months, I've dedicated most of my savings to help my sister who quit her job and fell behind on bills. I even traveled out of state to support her at her mentor's funeral, staying in uncomfortable accommodations due to her budget constraints. I offered her money to secure a place of her own after her eviction. Although I never mentioned these sacrifices, I believe her stability should outweigh a birthday celebration, especially since she previously stated she didn't want one. Yet, she sees me as the bad guy for ruining a potential experience that she said she didn’t want anyway. AITAH for not letting her cousin know my plans fell through and “ruining” her birthday?",0.44
"AITA because I am embarassing my parents while we are doing a pilgrimage? My mom and dad have always wanted to do the Camino de Santiago de Compostela. It is a walk across Spain. It is anywhere from 60-600 miles long depending on where you start. I got a massive bonus last year and I cashed in all my PTO and vacation time. We are doing 120 miles over the course of a month. We are taking detours to awesome stuff along the way. 

I'm not in perfect shape. I'm a doughy 43 year old. My wife is in great shape. She does half marathons for fun. She is enjoying the walk and all the great wine and food. She is also the only one who has no trouble with even the longest stages of the walk. 

The problem is that my parents refuse to walk ahead of us. They say that they ""don't know where they are going"". This is bullshit. The route is marked very clearly with stones and arrows everywhere. You would literally have to intentionally ignore all the information your eyes are providing to go off the path. 

My wife and I have no problem walking at their pace. We are taking thousands of pictures and having a blast. But my parents will sometimes just stop and make us take the lead. 

Not really a problem except that when I walk with my wife we are keeping a brisk pace. One time we had to sit at a roadside bar and tapas place for an hour to wait for them to catch up. My mom was mad we didn't wait for them. I told her that they should walk ahead of us so that we could keep pace with them. She said that they aren't kids and I do not dictate how they walk. 

So I have taken to doing one of three things. I will pick a spot where I am not in the way and stand stock still, I will spend a minute taking baby penguin steps, or I will moonwalk, (I'm pudgey but skilled in the ways of a b-boy). All of this forces them to either stare at me like I'm an idiot, which I am, or walk ahead of us. 

My dad said that he gets it, that he will make sure that they walk in front. He has had a heart attack so he knows why I want to be able to see him. My mom thinks I'm being controlling. My wife is just impressed that I have such a graceful moonwalk.

"AITA for not watching my brother after warning my parents that I wouldn't do that because babysitting isn't my job? Apologies if I get anything wrong or this sounds confusing, I'm recovering from a bad hangover as I write this.

I (19F) have a little brother (10M) with mild autism. He's old enough to be able to take some responsibility for himself and not have to be constantly hovered over. I have made it clear to my parents that I am not interested in constantly watching him, and have asked them to find a friend or someone to help out every so often so I can live my own life. They brushed me off unfortunately.

Something I should also mention is that I smoke pot. It's legal in my state and my parents don't seem to be too against it, I am an adult after all. I keep some hidden in my nightstand and some hidden in my purse, my brother doesn't usually snoop around my room so I'm not that inclined to go to ridiculous lengths to keep it hidden, I don't wanna go to insane lengths looking for it when I wanna get high.

Well, unfortunately my brother decided to go snooping through my purse while I was in the shower and found one of my edibles. I was still in the shower by the time my parents got home and saw that he was obviously high and crying. My dad went into my bathroom, practically RIPPED off the shower curtain, and demanded an explanation as to why my brother was obviously baked. I told him that I was in the shower and unaware of how he even got into my stash. He started crying, saying he just went into my purse to get my phone because he wanted to say hi to our mom (he's not allowed to have a phone or tablet), and that he saw chocolates and couldn't help himself. (These chocolates were kept in a bag saying DO NOT EAT!! by the way, but the wrappers did kinda look like candy)

Thankfully, my brother was rightfully punished for snooping through my shit. However this did not stop my parents from being angry at me too. They were livid that I had edibles in my purse and that I wasn't watching him well enough. He's 10, almost 11, and does not need to be hovered over. He understands ""DO NOT TOUCH"" means don't touch my shit. He should not have to be told to not eat chocolates he finds in someone else's purse. This didn't satisfy my parents enough unfortunately, and I was told to leave.

"AITA for denying my sister’s grief I (26F) have a sister (30F). We were kinda close growing up due to age and stuff but came to be good friends once we hit our stride in college. She took a while to graduate, changing courses and stuff, so I graduated before her – but just by a few weeks (in our country a bachelors takes four years). 

We had a brother (20M) who died five years ago. He was younger than me and my sister. I was the closest in age to him and also the closest to him. He was my best friend and confidant. My sister and him lived in a different state to me so, you know, they spent holidays and stuff together. I visited him every couple of months and called him weekly.

When he died we were all good. But then my sister started mourning him like no one else knew him? They had a falling out about 8 months before he died and they had only been talking for the last month before he died. She was okay for the first while after he died but then she started attending grief clubs, posting poems about him her socials and every conversation she turned into about how she grieved him.

Don’t get me wrong. I miss him every single day. I miss our weekly calls and I miss going to see him. I support my parents through their grief (I live close by). 

Recently, my sister came to visit. She spent the whole time talking about her grief, her loss. She never once asked my or our parents how we were doing. She told us that his death had ruined her life. She accused us of brushing his death under the carpet because we didn’t talk about him (we do!), that we didn’t show emotion (we do when we are alone). Our parents didn’t know what to do.

So I told her to shut up. That she hadn’t a clue, that she hadn’t spoken to him in nearly a year, that this wasn’t about her and to stop Grief Shaming us. That she was a horrible sister to him and a horrible daughter to our parents.

She left the next day and posted on her socials how me and my parents are in denial about my brother’s death and haven’t mourned him properly.  Now my phone and socials are blowing up with friends and family accusing me of not looking after my parents properly and denying my sisters grief.

"AITA for taking care of myself when my GF wasn’t in the mood? Hello. My GF (29) just broke up with me (37). Honestly, we were probably sliding in that direction for a while for a lot of reasons I won’t get into, but we had some good times mixed in so I though maybe it would work out. The final straw happened last night. We watched the Roadhouse, actually both films back to back (highly entertaining!). We were cuddling a little but she wasn’t super enthusiastic (usually she holds my hand and throws a leg over me, heaven!). I could tell something was up. 

Usually after movie night we transition to sex but I could tell she wasn’t feeling it so I let her sleep. However, after all that cuddling I was amped up. I laid awake for an hour, unable to drift off to sleep. So, I decided to take care of myself in the bathroom. Unfortunately, I couldn’t get into the zone so I went back to bed with her. After another 30  minutes I was feeling even more amped up, so I got the idea of finishing myself off in bed. I thought I was very discreet. I was quiet and nothing got on her or the bedding.

Well, she heard me. The morning was a little awkward. I drop her off early on Thursdays so we were both groggy in the morning and often it’s a quiet drive. Later in the day she texts me that it is over. What I did is a deal breaker for her. That’s fine, if she doesn’t want to be in the relationship that’s her choice. But is this truly bad behavior? Either way I won’t be risking it again but I need to know, AITA?",0.79
"AITA for getting annoyed at my bf for agreeing to do our plans not only without me but with his best friend? Okay so, please bear in mind I’m dyslexic and using mobile.

I (20f) have been dating my boyfriend (24m) Jack for over 6 months now, for context before I met him I had severe mental health issues and addiction issues but to get over them issues I used the gym as therapy, Jack knows this and he’s very proud of me. 

However whenever I mention I’m going to the gym I always offer for him to go with me, not hinting at anything but I case he wanted to because he said he used to go all the time. With that in mind, I’d be nice and ask. I asked him so many times to come with me because I think it would be fun for us to do something I enjoy. He kept saying no over and over again.

"AITA for telling my daughter she knows nothing? I (41F) have a daughter who is 17, and her father and I divorced when she was 7. We had a very rocky marriage, during which I was a stay-at-home mom, and I struggled a lot financially afterwards. Because of this, during our divorce, my ex-husband and I agreed that our daughter would live mainly with him and I received alimony payments from him for about 4 years after our divorce.

For the first several years after the divorce, my daughter would stay with me every other weekend and several holidays (the specific holidays depending on the year), and I always enjoyed our time together, but it would often feel like she didn’t want to see me. She was never interested in any activities or occasions that I planned for us and normally when I called to talk to her, she would be busy with school, an extracurricular activity, or something else.

Usually when she would spend the night with me, she’d ask about the divorce and why her father and I aren't together anymore. I always tried to be as honest as possible with her but I could tell the divorce had been hard for her and when she started high school she stopped visiting altogether.

She and I have been low contact for the past few years, and this past weekend we had an argument regarding her graduation. She’s graduating from high school this June, and I texted her to ask about the details. She responded with a very passive aggressive text asking if I would actually come and how she didn’t want to waste a ticket.

I wasn’t sure where it was coming from, so I called her and she started ranting about how I was never around, and that I always blamed her father for everything, and how I cared about my students more than her (I’m a high school teacher). I interrupted her and told her that she knows nothing about what happened between her father and I.

I told her that she made her choice to stop visiting and not to answer when I call her and that she couldn’t blame anyone else for that and she hung up. About an hour later she sent me a long text about how much I hurt her and that she didn’t want me at her graduation and that I “needed to change”.

"AITA for saying I am naked in a group chat with married men? I am a woman(adult) and a gamer. I have a fixed team with 4 other men(adults too) in which we play together every night about 9 to 11pm. When we play, we open mic in our group chat for easier communication.


So the other day I took a shower after 1 session and alerted my teammates about it, asking them to give me 10 minutes. I rushed back to my pc after shower and heard 1 of the guys complaining it has been more than 10 minutes and I was late. Alright my bad, so I took 15 minutes instead of promised 10, so I voiced out ""Hey sorry I am back give me a moment ya""


That guy then said ""Finally, it took her forever can we start now?"" So I said ""Wait I am still naked at least let me change before we start""


The guy then started saying ""you don't have to say that"" ""we don't need to know that"" ""too much info"" ""my wife is listening"" and expressioned his discomfort. I rolled brushed him off saying ""relax it's not like I am inviting you or something""


We returned to our normal gaming sessions after that and afterwards the same guy private messaged me saying again how inappropriate I announced in the voice chat that I was naked and he has a wife, and to mind what I say as other 2 of the 3 guys are married too.

"AITA for getting upset with my fiance for not properly handling the situation when I have an anxiety attack?  I (25F) have clinical depression, GAD and clinical anxiety attacks that leave me in a paralysis-type state for several minutes/up to a half hour. My fiance (28M) claims he ""doesn't know what to do"" when I have an anxiety attack, even though we've been together for 6+ years and have lived together for 2+ years. After every anxiety attack I've had around him (I don't have them too often, maybe once every two months) I reexplain to him how to handle it for my case. For me personally, that's: 

- don't smother me, it makes it worse. 
- Comforting words help more than one would think. 
- get something to reset my senses. Hold a candle under my nose, squirt lemon/lime juice in my mouth, etc. These are proven methods that work to help me get out of this paralysis state. 

I've just come out of yet another anxiety attack where my partner didn't ""know how to handle it"" even though I have clearly communicated after EVERY anxiety attack I've had around him. This time in particular, I was laying down, and he for some reason thought it would be a great idea to just almost lay on me, which freaked me out and within my anxiety attack made me feel like I couldn't breathe, thus making it worse. 

He thinks I am the asshole in this situation for being so angry with him that he never learns how to help me when I'm in a state that I can't control. I think he is the asshole for for never learning after years of being together. He told me to ""get some outside perspective"" because I'm ""clearly crazy"".

"AITA for not attending my step-grandma’s funeral? So starting out I want to make it clear I don’t have a very close relationship with my stepfather. He has disrespected my mother plenty of times and recently she told me she caught him cheating. 

To break everything down, a few years ago my family came in town for the 4th of July to hang out. My wife and I decided to stay for a few days at my mom and stepfather’s house. It ended up being a complete crap show. My stepfather started arguing with my mom in front of everyone, threw money at her face and just was a complete ahole. Over the course of our stay things continued to escalate and they ended up arguing again which then led to him telling everyone that was staying at their house had to leave at 2AM (which included my younger sister that was living there at the time and my mother). 

His reasoning was “I have to prove a point to your mom” and was accusing her of cheating on him. (Which is insane considering what I just found out) He also involved his daughter about the accusation and she threatened my mom, chased her down the street and everything. Throughout their relationship they’ve had many disagreements and the topic of my mom’s kids being treated differently than his was brought up. His reasoning was his daughter is related and obviously he’d go about things involving her differently. 

My mom had a medical issue last year but couldn’t afford to take the time off work to get the surgery. He never made it a priority to cover or help her with the expenses but continued to make large purchases for himself. And despite her buying an $8k ATV for him as a gift. 

Recently my wife and I experienced a hardship and needed family support. My mom and stepfather came in town to visit us (also to add this was his first time visiting our home that we’ve lived in for 3+ years now) it was nice seeing them, they stayed for a few hours then went back home. My mom mentioned this and how he was there for us at this time in need but I feel different. 

Now, my stepfather’s mother was diagnosed with dementia 2 years ago and her health continued to decline until she recently passed away. The family was well prepared so when she passed they just needed to set a date for the funeral. She passed away Sunday and by Monday my mom is telling me the funeral is on Wednesday. 

I knew I wouldn’t have enough time to adjust my schedule as I’m a business owner and operate everything 100% on my own and couldn’t help but think of everything this man has put my mother through. I mean just last month she’s saying she found out he’s been paying for an escort!!! 

I told her I wouldn’t be able to attend and now I’m being looked at like the bad guy. My family has a huge history of being manipulators so I’m having a hard time deciphering if I’m being the ahole???

"AITA for buying my niece lunch after she refused the one her mom packed? My sister (F36) got a new car last week, and I (F32) offered to help her pick it up. I would drive us there in my car, we would drive back separately. It was a weekend so my niece (F8) had to come with us. 

She is quite small and still needs a booster seat, rather than fuss around switching the seats into the new car, it was decided niece would just travel in my car there and back. It was an 6 hour round trip and my sister packed a lot of her favourite snacks, lunch and entertainment, to make the journey more comfortable.

On the drive back my niece complained she was hungry, but refused to eat anything that was packed. It got to the point where she was crying and I couldn't take it anymore, so when we came back through a town again, I bought mcdonalds to shut her up. (they are not a health nut family, the fast food isn't the issue).

My niece has been acting up a bit lately, pushing boundaries etc and her new way of doing that is refusing food unless it is exactly what she wants. Throwing a tantrum etc and her parents are trying to nip it in the butt, by not giving in. This is not a neurodivergence thing, it's just kids being bratty sometimes.

My sister gets really dodgy cell reception and I did send her a message before stopping, but I didn't get a reply and made the call to stop anyway.

She is pissed that I gave in, especially since I know already what they are trying to do. I feel like this was once and if anything it just tells my niece I'm a pushover but not her parents. She was crying in the car and I was stuck with her, I just wanted her to shut up and this was the easiest solution. My sister says I undermined her parenting etc.

"AITA for not understanding why im the problem To start this off, im Autistic, im really bad at ""reading the room"" and telling others tones.

 In the last few years, ive had issues with making and keeping friends because ive moved 

around so much, but high school has made that so much harder. 

 At the begining of the year, i had a big friend group ( 7-8 people ) and i was close to two of the

 people in it, then one of people in the group turned out to be a children liker, and so we said 

nope and moved on from that, then the couple in the group broke up, there goes another 

person. 

then others start to drift away and that leaves me with around 3 people, one who just blocked

 me without word, and the other two started fighting a bunch, and it started to be even harder 

being around one of those girls, because all she did was complain the other person, and its so 

draining, because its every single day. 

so really that leaves me with the last person, who was my best friend up until now. today after 

school we hung out and we were good, and i go to text them later. 

blocked. 

i have no idea what happened, so i text someone else who knows them if they can ask whatsup. 

The person i asked for help texted them, and my old best friend said what was wrong to them, 

but said not to tell me, only to say they were uncomfortable with being friends with me

which i am 100% going to respect that, but i just want to know what i did so i can either fix it or 

make sure not to do it again to someone else.

 The reason why i brought up the fact that i cant tell tone is because i make slightly dark and

 coping jokes.

i recognize that sometimes those jokes can make others uncomfortable but its hard to tell 

when they are uncomfortable. 

it justs hard, i have a few online friends, and a boyfriend, but its hard to make friends, because i 

really want to be close to people, but i feel like i come on too excited sometimes, and i scare 

people away

and i know this is my fault, but i always have this thought in the back of my head of "" im just a 

side friend, a background character to their story"" i know it sounds like im being a pick-me but 

really thats how i feel. 

i so desperately want to be someones favorite person, because i give that treatment to 

everyone, i just wanna be loved by a friend in a way that i can feel safe to talk to them 

so really, im just here for some advice, what can i do?

i dont want to be alone, because thats how i feel

if you could provide me some advice, or maybe a website i can meet people on, id really love that

Just for shits and giggles I played into it and moved one of the rings that I always wear to my ring finger making them think we were engaged.

"AITA for not wanting to meet my gf on weekdays? My girlfriend (21F) and I (23M) have been dating for almost 9 months. In the beginning I wasn’t ready for a commitment like she was, and that’s why we stayed friends for so long before we started dating (I wasn’t seeing anyone else, I was just afraid of commitment). I’m so grateful she stuck around and didn’t leave when I was hurting her with my childish behavior. She’s done nothing but love, support, and uplift me all throughout our friendship and relationship.

She’s a full time student and I took a break this semester to focus on my personal studies. I have a schedule that I follow so I don’t lay around and do nothing all day. Before the semester started, I knew she’d be very busy with school -and I with my own stuff so I offered that for this month (March) we don’t meet on weekdays and only see each other on weekends. Before this, we hung out every other day. She looked a little surprised, but agreed and said “if that’s what you think is better”. We’d still text pretty often and call some days, I’d be well focused on my stuff and she wouldn’t have to worry about adding me to her schedule when she’s running from class to class all day. On weekends we’d relax, debrief, and a week of missing each other made us more appreciative of one another in my opinion.

I was talking to my friend who is also in a relationship and when I told him about this he found it weird. He asked if i didn’t like her or something for me to “ban her” from seeing me 5 days of the week. I said we don’t have to be conjoined at the hip to like each other. Him and his girlfriend are very lovey dovey, see each other every other day etc. My girlfriend and I just don’t have that dynamic. I told him it was a month for me to find a routine without school and sticking to it, and her first month of the semester would be very hectic. But now he thinks I’m being an asshole to my girlfriend and the only reason she didn’t protest is because she’s too nice and not because what I asked of her is acceptable.

This already had me feeling a type of way, but then when I met my girlfriend on thursday she asked if I was meeting her on weekdays now because it’s no longer March. I told her yeah I guess but I will hop on that schedule at some point, and she said “Oh okay. I mean it’s not like I ever not understand when you’re busy and want to be alone, you don’t need to put rules like that for me to do that”.

"AITA for continuing to use Spotify when someone who has/had a crush on me is paying for it? There's only so many words I could fit in the title but basically, 8 years ago I had a friend and he very openly had a crush on me. It was purely platonic on my end and we were still good friends regardless. He made me my own spotify account back when we were friends and he paid for premium. I told him I didn't need it but he insisted. I know it was only because he had a crush on me as the password was ""Coraliscute123"".  
I haven't talked to this guy in over 5 years and I am now happily married to someone else. He is still paying for my spotify and I never really questioned it. My husband knows someone else pays for it but he didn't know why. 

He asked me for the spotify login today, when I told him the password he immediately got suspicious. He asked me why the password was calling me cute. I explained that the guy who pays for it had a crush on me back in the day and the password was never changed. He started accusing me of being secretive and even assuming that I'm cheating on him. I assured him I wasn't and I even showed him our old chat logs. Nothing was ever sexual or flirty and my last message to him was in 2018, before I even met my husband.

After I assured him I wasn't cheating and nothing ever went on between me and that guy, he started accusing me of USING him. He said I've been stringing the poor guy along for years and he's still paying because he thinks there's still a chance. He had me call him (our old messages were on discord so I called him there) to ask if he knew he was still paying. I called him we exchanged hellos and how are yous (I mentioned I was married he was very happy for me) and I asked if he knew he was still paying for my spotify. He told me he was ""well aware"" and not to worry about it. He also said I wasn't the only spotify account he was paying for someone else. He has the extra money so he doesn't feel the need to cancel it.

My husband wants me to stop using the account anyway. He says he doesn't feel comfortable with it now that he knows the guy paying for it has/had a crush on me. I really really don't want to stop using that account because it's the only app I use to listen to music and we don't have the money to pay for our own premium. The premium works for me because my work doesn't allow us to connect to the wifi so premium allows me to download music at home so I can listen to it offline. It has nothing to do with the guy paying for it whatsoever. Would I be the asshole if I put my foot down on this? My marriage is worth more than anything so if you guys tell me I'm not being reasonable I will apologize stop using the account immediately. ",0.6
"WIBTA if I kick out my angry parent? tldr I asked my retired parent for temporary help with my kids, they moved in permanently, and are screaming at my very sweet kids (and me) all the time. WIBTA if I make them go home?

I am a parent of 2 school aged kids. They are extremely good kids, and I take such joy in being around them. I was working in some very time consuming training as a recently single parent couple years ago, and I asked my retired parent, “Pat” to come help me during difficult work assignments for a month at a time a few times a year during the training. They agreed. It was either quit a decade-long training for my life’s calling, or this. 

1. Pat got into a fight with their spouse (not my other parent) about 6 mos in and moved in permanently one day while I was at work. I had too much on my plate to address that, bc they are very codependent and defensive, and I was in training and recovering from an abusive relationship and trying to be a parent.

2. 3 years later, Pat still lives with me, and ignores the fact that their spouse is still living in their home, and is probably engaging in self destructive behaviors there until they die.

3. Pat’s spouse abused me emotionally and verbally and Pat never acknowledged this. I took decades of therapy for this.

4. Pat has always thought it is acceptable to yell at me - and now my kids, snap off, and speak harshly/rudely multiple times a week (HEY CLEAN UP THIS TABLE NOW!!!) - because they help take care of lots of housework.  When I politely ask Pat to stop the behavior, I am told that is how they are and they are old so they can’t change, or I get a sarcastic response. I didn’t realize how bad it was until I saw Pat with my kids- because it is how I grew up. I knew no better. 

5. ANY ask of Pat is met with being yes’d with no change or defensiveness “I never do anything right” sarcasm. If I say -“hey pls keep do xyz to take care of pet or just let me do it.” It’s ignored, and I’m having problems with the pet bc of it. 

6. Max emotional immaturity here - we are talking years if not decades of therapy for this to change if that is even possible because Pat utterly lacks insight. When I asked Pat to treat my kids respectfully, they said “ok, I’ll either kiss their ass or just won’t speak to them.” When I said,  carefully, what does that mean, they sarcastically said in a singsong voice, “sweetie please get your shoes on.” 

6. Tonight, Pat snapped off at my kid for no reason again, and I quietly asked the kids if they thought Pat was mad all the time, always yelling at them, and if they were scared etc. Answers: affirmative.

 6. I am haunted by my facing my future adult children, and having them ask me why I didn’t stand up for THEM. I’m ready to move Pat (my parent) out and having them just visit regularly.

Actually I'm doing very well financially but I'm not paying for this. It was an accident. Shit happens when you live with an 8yo boy.",0.41
"AITA for smoking when my roommate had a bad day? ||Roommate uses he/they.||

I(22f) have a routine every night. I get home, I smoke grass, I do laundry (and clean up when needed) and then I relax until I fall asleep. I have done this since LONG before my roommate bc I have a very stressful and intense job so it really helps with my back pain and anxiety. I LITERALLY cannot get quality sleep.
About 8 months ago my roommate(20nb) moved in. We sleep in the same room (very fkin complex situation) and I have done this every night. 
They have asked b4 that I not smoke bc they want emotional support from me. In the end, they spent the entire time talking to their online friends and hardly talked to me. And I ended up getting only 2 hours of sleep. 
Well, they asked again bc their job and partner are giving them issues again (it's always the same problems and he is just as much the problem as anyone else)
I smoked with a friend b4 I got home and he got really angry. He said that all I do is smoke and slack around the house (I am the ONLY one who does the laundry, cleans the room of trash, and makes/buys food for everyone). He said the one time he asked me to be sober I couldn't even do that and he thinks I have a problem. They said a lot more but I just left. I took my car and went to a friend's. 
I've had this issue with him and one other person b4. And EVERYONE around me (non-smokers and smokers) say that I do not have one, that I am very responsible.
If he had just said that he needed me I would have conceded, apologized, and went on a T break to 'prove I am not like my mom'. But he used the ONE word they KNOW I have issues with. 
He is in my house and pays 1/4 of the rent. I am an adult with a big boy job, I am allowed my ONE thing. 
But maybe I should have just not smoked and been ignored or been taken advantage of.

"WIBTA If I got my tiddies pierced I(19f) and my partner (18) had a disagreement that started when I said I wanted to get my tiddies pierced. I mentioned it to them that I wanted to get my pierced and they said they “wouldn’t allow me to do it”. I told them that they had no right to tell me what I can and can’t do, but they could tell me their opinions on the matter. I got upset that they were trying to control me and they got upset because I wasn’t listening to what they were saying. What they meant to say (which they later told me) was that they didn’t like the look of them and did not want me to get them. We’ve talked about it a few times since then and they’ve been more receptive to the idea but still not set on it. At this point, I’m not sure that I want to get the piercing anymore. Would I be the asshole if I got them pierced?

"AITA for telling my girl she cannot possibly know how high my libido is? I don’t see wanting action 3 times a week as that high of a sex drive. And my (ex)girlfriend doesn’t even know how much, because I didn’t tell her. I will admit that past partners said the same thing, but that was only after we began having sex.

I’m 29M and I recently began courting a 31 year old woman. When I began trying to move it to the next level, she was put off and said “sorry, I can’t handle this.” She then said my sex drive is clearly way too high for her and she could tell just by seeing how I act. We never really even talked about it until Tuesday.

I texted her saying that she can’t know how high my sex drive is because we’ve never even done the deed. She then said she could “already tell” and said she wouldn’t be able to handle it. I then said she was being ridiculous and quite foolish. Now she’s not responding to me. AITA?",0.9
"AITA for talking to my GM about my friend I 35f met my friend 26f at work a couple years ago. She was a manager at the time and I was crew. I moved up to manager and she was promoted to people manager. I have a certification I have to go through to run my shifts by myself without another manager present at the end of the month. Recently her behavior towards me has been off. She’s made comments about me not being a manager because I haven’t gone through said verification and has been very snappy and rude to the point other managers have seen it. It’s gotten to the point where she won’t talk to me at all, in or out of work, unless it’s a work related question.

Here is where I feel like I might be the AH. I was struggling to figure out how to approach her about her behavior without potentially causing both the  working and nonworking relationship we have to crumble so I set up a meeting with our GM to talk to her about the issues I’m having with my friend at work.

"AITA for asking my husband to choose our anniversary over his cousin’s wedding? My DH and I will have been married 15 years this month. He’ll be out of town on business on our anniversary. 

We were supposed to go to Hawaii on our tenth anniversary, but he lost a job that year so we cancelled. He said we could do a special trip this year and I have been sooo excited for it, planning and dreaming. 

His bonus turned out to be far less than we were expecting (which was to pay for our anniversary) and now we have to choose between him going to his cousin’s bachelor party and wedding or choosing to celebrate us and our marriage with a trip (note: we never take trips alone without kids and rarely go on dates).

I told him our marriage is more important that him attending the wedding and we could send a nice gift, but he says it’s in appropriate not for him to go. He says he should go to both events and if he gets a raise, maybe we will celebrate our anniversary.
Children aren’t invited so I have to stay home and watch them while him, my in laws and BIL/SIL (they have childcare) all attend together.

"AITA for ""making things about myself"" My (25F) boyfriend (24M) needs more reassurance than most people, like im talking every single day of the week at least 10 times a day (not exaggeration) which i'm completely okay with because i understand that he needs reassurance and it doesn't bother me, however this makes it so that we never really talk about my feelings or anything that is upsetting me.

 Earlier today when I woke up I was doing my daily morning reassurance texts when i got cut off by him asking me to say more which upset me because it made me feel like I wasn't doing enough even though I genuinely try my hardest every time I give any kind of reassurance to him, when I tried explaining that I felt like I was basically being told to do better I got told I was ""making things about myself"" which obviously upset me more because nothing is EVER about me, in order for my feelings to ever be recognized I HAVE to make it about myself or else I would never be asked and there isn't ever a time for it to be brought up naturally because its always about making him feel better.

A couple months in he started gaslighting the shit out of her and forbidding her from doing things being very controlling. She spent another month with him before it ended thankfully.

"AITA for wanting to be able to make decisions around the house? I (38f) have been with my partner (52m) since October 2022. Because we lived in different countries when we met we fairly quickly ended up living together. I left my country, moved my dogs, had to leave my cats behind with family because he won’t let me have them here and generally put my life on hold to give this a shot.    


 The terms of my visa do not enable me to work so I am totally reliant on him or spending some savings. There have been many incidents where we have had conflicts and I am told that I expect too much and that this is his house. He had just bought a very, very large house when I met him. 

Despite living here for over a year now we still have hardly any furniture, mostly just items that were left here with the house. We have very different taste when it comes to interiors but I have tried to compromise to find items that are acceptable but he won’t buy anything unless it is perfect. We got close to buying a chair but the piping wasn’t the right colour, according to him, so no chair was purchased. 

In the property we have a cabana where my dogs have to live because he won’t let them in the house, even though his dog is allowed anywhere in the house. This is where I spend a lot of my time and it’s really only me who spends time in there. Some of the lightbulbs are not working so I mentioned about changing to LED spotlights and he said he would look into it. Knowing how long he can take to make decisions on things I said so I’ll have lightbulbs in a couple of weeks, right? And if not I can buy some? 

I was categorically told I am not allowed to buy any lightbulbs. This is not my house. I am not allowed to make decisions. I feel like we are not making any progress in our relationship. I feel like I have no control over my life or its direction. I’m just living in this limbo where he can dictate what is permitted. For me where I live is really important. 

My home used to be my sanctuary, but now I just feel I’m a lodger. I have told him that I just feel like I’m an unpaid employee to which I was told  that I get ‘free bed and board’ and I am ungrateful. All of our arguments have led me to becoming more frustrated, more upset, more trapped each time and I will shout and get angry in arguments.

"AITA for accusing someone of stealing my dog? My dog is 16yo Chinese crested, shi tzu chihuahua mix. Looks like a maltese when her fur is grown out. I keep her shaved due to the texture of fur is the Chinese crested, only one layer & gets matted super easy. She wears a pink hoodie to stay warm even in the summer, but hates her collar. She takes it off. Given her age & not going far past the yard, I kept it off so it didn't get lost. I took her outside before I pick kids up from school around 3pm. She had gotten pretty shaggy & needed to be groomed again. (I've had health issues & wait list is long at groomers)
I ran inside for 10 minutes, then came out to call her in. She wasn't there. I searched my yard, house & around the block and couldn't see her. 
Went & picked up kids, then kept searching. Posted on Facebook. No luck.
Finally someone posted they think they say my dog & to call them. We'll call her Cathy. This is 10:30pm.
They were a groomer at PetSmart. (my groomer is at her vets office)
Cathy said a male & female brought the dog in they had attempted to shave & botched it. Nicks and cuts everywhere & missed spots. Dog was in a red sweater. We'll call him Nathan.
Cathy normally would just fix it but had a weird feeling. Asked for proof of rabies.
Nathan: We found her so we don't have it. 
Cathy: have you tried to find the owners?
Nathan: yes and we're going to post on Facebook. She needed a haircut though. 
Cathy: (still suspicious) I don't have time today, but give me name & # I'll call tomorrow if you still have her.
Nathan: gives full name & #. (Then proceeds to buy dog food, dog bed toys and puppy pads as they leave)
Cathy was able to sneak a couple of pictures of the dog. She was looking on Facebook to see if they posted her & they didn't. She then saw my post.
Sure enough my dog in a red sweater. 
Also gave me the name & number. 
I called an officer to ask what route to go. I wanted her back. Showed proof she was mine. He called Nathan & he reluctantly said I could go get her. This is 11:30pm. The officer came with with me. 
Nathan told the officer they found her & she looked homeless & neglected & didn't have a collar. She didn't deserve to go back to the owner. Lied about where they found her. They had no intention of trying to find the owner either way.
I wanted to press charges for theft. They stole my dog. The officer said unless I have actual proof, like on camera I can't. 
Now, as emotions have settled, I'm grateful I have her back. But I still feel like they stole her & got away away with it for the most part.
Most people say I should just drop it and be glad she's home. Some have agreed they stole her. 
*yes her collar was not on. I was honest about it, but it doesn't seem like it would have mattered. They could have removed it either way. 
 I apologize for spelling, grammar all that stuff. First time posting, and trying to make sure I include all info.

My mom then immediately said “I’ll read it for you first” and I kinda not-knowing-what-to-do-ly said “sure!”
 
I was kind of upset about it because 1) I really like the author and now I’m probably gonna read it after my mom hands it to me and says “oh that was an interesting story” or even something negative (which is more likely gonna be the case) and 2) I’ve literally only seen my mom read one book that wasn’t work-related my whole life so that was kinda weird. I then remembered that when my grandma read some of my books a year ago she circled and underlined a lot so I asked my mom not to do that, which kind of irritated her.
 
I then saw her go talk to my dad in the kitchen and left the book there with the cat near by so I picked up the book to move it to somewhere safe but then started reading it (*wrong move*). My mom saw me reading it and told me to forget about it, she was too busy for my book anyway.

"AITA for not wanting to part with my old couch, even though it upsets my flatmate? AITA for not wanting to part with my parent’s old broken couch?

I (f34) live with a good friend (m33), as the rents in our city are ridiculously high and we are both freelancers. We’ve been flatmates for 2 years now and friends for way longer. It is meant to be a temporary situation, but no concrete end date in sight. At some point I will want to move in with my boyfriend, but as he works and lives at the other side of the country (which will affect my ability to take on work) that is not in the near future yet. It might be a year, it might be more.

Now there is a dispute between me and the roommate. When we moved in he didn’t want a couch of his own, as he said it made people lazy, and I wanted to bring my parent’s old couch that they’ve given me when I left the parental house and had moved with me for over a decade. It is a small, English style leather couch. It is not very big, which is good, because our house is not very big, but annoying, cause it is not very comfortable to lay down on. It also has a big tear in the leather, which I used to hide by throwing a blanket on it, but we’ve ceased to do that, because my cat (f6)  peed on the blanket.
It is not the most practical couch, but I like it and it has sentimental value for me.

My flatmate hates it. He has changed his mind (which he is of course allowed to do) about not wanting a couch. He feels not comfortable laying down on it, thinks it’s ugly and to be frank it embarrasses him when he brings his dates over.

Now he offered to buy a new couch, but that would mean I would have to get rid of mine. I have asked my parents if they can take it back, but that’s not an option. Neither can my boyfriend take it. My flatmate is getting more and more impatient and annoyed and we’ve reached an impasse.

Am I the asshole for not wanting to get rid of an old, broken couch so my flatmate can buy a new more comfortable one?",0.46
"AITA towards my sister and shown my “true character”?  For context my sister and I are economically in quite different places. My husband and I are “high-earners”, we own a house etc. She is bright but struggles to hold down employment - is often fired from quite basic jobs etc. we’ve had all the same opportunities in life but just made quite different decisions. That said she’s inherited money recently so is not struggling financially. I only write this to try and give you all the full picture as I’m currently raging but wondering maybe AITA… 

My sister and I recently applied for citizenship to a second country through our grandparent. My sister wanted to order all the necessary documents (birth certificates etc) “fast delivery” so things would arrive quickly. Every time she did so it would cost an additional £20. I made it clear I didn’t think it was worth it but she used the “fast delivery” service anyway.

When I transferred the money I owed her for all the certificates last week I didn’t give her half for the “fast delivery” despite her asking for it. She said things like “just give what you feel then” and I could tell from the tone of voice she was pissed. I ended up giving her about £30 extra than just going half on the basic certificate price.

I have since learnt she’s been venting about me to our parents, she’s absolutely livid about this and how ungenerous I am. I tried to speak to her to explain my perspective and she would not give an inch. She said she’d learnt “a lot about my character.”

"AITA for refusing to help my mom because she doesn't want to ""bother"" my siblings? I have a contentious relationship with my mother and we recently started talking after a 6 month period of zero communication. We both have legitimate problem with each other. 

I believe her reaching out to me was more because my three siblings were getting tired of her and they started to shun her. I did take the opportunity to reconnect because life is short but this time with firm boundaries. One of those boundaries was do not offer her money or do anything for her.

Why?

Because she does these amazing things for my siblings like pay their rent, help them buy a house, pay their legal fees, etc but she didn't do anything for me when I needed it. To add insult to injury, all she does is complain how badly she's treated by my siblings when she does so much for them. Literally my mom hasn't given me money since I was in high school. I've given her more money in the last 10 years than she's given me in the last 20.

Recently my mom asked me for $400 for a storage unit and to help her move to a smaller place. I asked why she couldn't ask my other siblings and she said they have their own things going on (one's having another kid, one is moving, one lives out of state) and didn't wish to bother them.

I said no. In the past I would had said yes and it wouldn't be any skin off my back but then I'd feel angry towards her asking me for help and money when she hasn't done anything for me but does so much for others. I told her she  gives my siblings tens of thousands of dollars a year so she needs to ""bother"" them.

She said they helped her out ""too much."" I said no, I'm not here to give you money and to help you with things so you don't have to cause an ""inconvenience"" for your kids who you bankroll at my expense. If you were paying my rent or helped me get a house then I'd help you at the drop of a hat but you don't.

My friend group wanted to plan a camping trip. We all agreed on a date and length in-person. My partner is also in the friend group. 
I asked my partner about this trip because there hadn't been any updates and then she texted the group asking if a totally new date and time frame worked for us. The new time frame included Monday. 
For context, I am extremely close to finally graduating. My partner knows that I have sacrificed everything, including taking care of and then losing my mom, to get to this point. I do not want to miss out on my education. 
So I said Monday does not work for me, and the other Members of the group sent emojis which to me communicated some level of frustration that I couldn't make Monday. 
I was extremely upset that they would give me a hard time about having to say no because of the Monday. I do not think anyone should be giving me a hard time about setting a boundary, and moreover if anyone had looped me into the plans I would have clearly indicated my availability.

"AITA for being “more successful” than my best friend? My best friend (23F) and I (22F) have been friends since the summer before university and we were dorm roommates. It’s been almost 5 years and I think our friendship is ending because I’m “more successful” than her.

For context, I struggled mentally for 3 years in university. I’m bipolar and psychotic so I had a lot of ups and downs that negatively impacted my social relationships and career. However, summer before my senior year I did a complete 180 and focused on my academics so I can accomplish my goal of going to graduate school.

My best friend shared a lot of my goals as me, just in a different department, so we bonded most during my senior year when we would study together and talk about our goals of being professors and possibly even attending graduate school together.

Everything changed when we graduated. I got offered a job in research before graduating and so I moved cities and started working a month after graduating. My friend, on the other hand, started her job in the fall. We have essentially the same job, but I work for a university and she works for the government. Hearing this news I was excited to see we were both successful and working in our respective fields, especially considering the job market. So I would ask her about her job whenever I spoke to her, which was about once a week.

Post-grad I had a lot of free time (I’m taking multiple gap years before applying to graduate school) so I decided to start a TikTok account talking about my experience post-grad and providing tips for people who want to pursue graduate school like me. When I told my best friend about this, hoping she would hype me up, she ignored the message and never followed the account. I shrugged this off as maybe she forgot so I didn’t bring it up again.

Communication between us dwindles after this point, we went from talking once a week to not speaking for a month. I decided to call her and see what she’s up to, thinking maybe she got busy with her life. She starts the conversation by saying she’s been avoiding me because she thinks I pressure her too much academically, and she needed some time to focus on herself. 

I understood this, but then she brought up my TikTok account. She said she deliberately avoids every video of mine she sees on her for you page, and again she just needed time to focus on herself… maybe a month (her words)? I gave her leeway for 2 months after this conversation, and have since blocked her on that account because I started getting the feeling she wasn’t ever going to engage, so I might as well cut out the middle man.

Even though we spoke at once a month, she called our mutual friend once a week (excuse was it’s late at night so they don’t bother me). I have now seen they went to Disneyland together, and never once mentioned it or invited me. I tried contacting them over the weekend it happened but they ignored me. What changed so I could lose my two closest friends of 4-5 years? AITA?",0.76
"AITA for jokingly telling my sister that she'll make a great housewife? I (33M) have a younger sister (25F). Our parents are dangerous people, so as soon as I was able, I rented out a place so that my sister and I could have somewhere to live. We got out of there when I was 18 and she was 10, and I took care of her until she was able to go to college (she is now in graduate school, doing very well for herself).

Basically, I’m not the most well-organized guy. I mean of course I take my job seriously (I work as a paramedic, and I aspire to go to med school soon, and I am responsible for peoples’ safety), but my primary motivation is making a living and breaking the cycle. I don’t put too much effort into things like looking presentable, or cleaning around the house or whatever. I’m too busy for that. So I admit that while my little sister was growing up, she was more often than not the one who washed the dishes and cleaned the floors. Even nowadays, she spends her money on nice clothes for me and whenever she visits my apartment, she scolds me as if I’m a little kid and she cleans up the mess. It’s kind of amusing.

So last weekend, my sister visited me, and once again, she rolled up her sleeves and started tidying up the place a little bit while we were chatting. While she was doing that, I jokingly told her that she would make a great housewife, and that she should aim to find a job like a flight attendant or something where she could put her neat-freak talents to use. My sister was sort of embarrassed when I said this, and her face turned red. She went on this whole rant about how this wasn’t what she was going to grad school for, and then she entered my bedroom and freaked out when she saw the new clothes she bought for me, just laid out all messy on the floor. It was enough that she even started crying! She was so exasperated, and all she could say was ""you're supposed to be an adult"". AITA?",0.53
"AITA for cancelling a date? I’ve (22) been talking with this girl (26) for the past 2 weeks. We have been falling asleep on the phone some nights and it’s been super exciting overall and I really like her.

Our schedules don’t really mesh well together and we both live at home so it’s been hard to actually get together. We made plans to go out yesterday night at around 6pm for dinner and a movie. I texted her yesterday at 12pm asking if she was still good to go out. She never answered me so I texted again at 4:30pm asking if she’s okay. An hour goes by and she still doesn’t text me. So at this point its like 5:30 and I’m super hungry and I don’t think she’s interested in going out so I eat something and cancel the movie tickets. She texts me a few minutes after this and says “I’m just getting out of work”. I tell her that I already ate and kind of cancelled the movie tickets.

She texts me a gif of someone smashing a heart and I try to call her and she doesn’t answer and just texts me “I am in the shower being sad”. Give her another hour and try to call but she just doesn’t answer. I then try to explain how I was super excited to go out with her but she never answered me so I thought she didn’t want to go out. I sent another text asking if she still wanted go out for a movie but she never answered me. I guess at this point I’m going to give her “space” and if she wants to talk then maybe she’ll reach out.",0.89

"AITA for not telling my bf about another man? I (21f) and my boyfriend (22m) had a recent argument because I didn’t mention another man I knew at the time. My boyfriend, 'Jole,' and I have been dating for about 3 and a half months now, and he’s asked me a lot of questions, but there was one pertaining to if I know or talk to anyone that has the same name as him. At the time, I said no because I didn’t think much about it.

 I recently posted on my Instagram story, 'How much you think I like you vs How much I actually do,' and a guy that I know with the same name as Jole swiped on the story. I posted it not thinking too much about it. My boyfriend saw the story and swiped up, questioning me.

 He said, 'I thought you didn’t know any other Joles?' I told him I totally forgot about him since we don’t talk, and he didn’t believe me. I apologized several times and told him I completely forgot, but he wouldn’t listen. I don’t think it’s entirely my fault, but maybe I should’ve thought about it harder when he asked.

"AITA for calling out my best friend’s behavior when she is in a relationship? I (18f) have a best friend Halley (17f) that has recently gotten into a relationship with Riley (18M). I have noticed that when she gets into a relationship she starts to act differently. She begins to push away and distance herself from her friends. This is not the first time this has happened. She also has never apologized for any sort of bad behavior towards me and uses the excuse that she can’t mentally have the conversation. 
At first I understood, because I also struggle with mental health, but this has been going on for years. When I confronted her about it, she got her boyfriend involved and basically accused me of questioning their relationship. I wasn’t questioning their relationship but rather Halley’s behavior towards me and our other friends. She got mad at me, and her boyfriend has been calling me names.

Me 23F recently told my boss that hiring my sister would not be a good idea. I am a waitress . We are currently looking for busboys and hosts.

 My sister 18 F  applied to be a host.  My sisters has pretty bad work experience including calling out, showing up late, and has not lasted long. I would constantly hear abt her being fired for never showing up. She explained she won’t do it anymore if I tell the higher ups  to hire her. Last week the higher ups  asked me if we were related because he saw her application. I said yes. 

2 days ago I went up to him and told her my concerns. I explained that I don’t think she will be a good fit, that she doesn’t have a good record, and that I don’t want to lie and say she is responsible when she isn’t. It would look horrible on me. The higher up  agreed with me and said that it took a lot of guts for me to say that and he really apreciates it.

 I told my mom because it was eating me up for betraying my sister and my mother said I shouldn’t have done that and I disrespected her.

"AITA for thinking that he is Me (27) and my boyfriend (28) have been together two years. My arms are almost completely tattooed and they were like that when I met him. He didn't mind that when we started dating. At the beginning, we we're just friends and hung out a lot and told each other a lot of things, including the fact that we were not unfamiliar with drugs, and we used them together (nothing ""serious"", mostly weed,. A year ago we stopped with everything, including alcohol at his suggestion. This is ofc positive and I am happy about it. However, everything written is important because following facts:
1. After 2 months of dating, my boyfriend started talking about how much he hates my tattoos, how disgusting they are and that only stupid people and ""addicts"" have them.
2. Then he started saying that my past was disgusting (because ""I wasn't a classic girl"" (whatever that meant?!?!?) but I always hung out mostly with men (my friends from elementary school) and I tried drugs (so which he also did, before and with me).
3. It also turned out that religion is very important to him and that he does not like people who are not believers (although he knew that I am quite far from a religious person)
4. He told me that I should wear clothes that cover my tattoos when we go to his parents because he ""doesn't want to cause stress to his loved ones"" because they hate tattoos.
5. plus, I started taking off tattoos that are harder to hide and putting band-aids over them so that his parents wouldn't accidentally see them (i literally look like a very fancy frankenstein when we go to his place)
6. My father doesn't like people who are into religion since his sister went crazy, 
in his opinion, because of religion. So I don't like or dislike people based on this shit, but yeah a man cries because of it and doesn't contact her for half his life. Yet, ofc I never hid from my father that my boyfriend is religious, I said that I would like him to accept him and not to say any ugly words, and my father loves him and looks at him without prejudice. While I am hiding tattoos in front ofhis parents and listen to how he hates my history (having more than 1 boyfriend before him, 4 exactly) and my tattoos. But doesn't want to break up ""cause I am the most emphatic, sensitive and funny person in the world"". I told him that it seems to me that he has double standards and that I feel like a less of a (important) person and less respected due to his behavior.I suffer from an eating disorder, with a history of hospitalization due to anorexia. I explained to him that my tattoos served as a mechanism for accepting it and that really helped me a lot. But his answer ""I understand everything, but I have to think about my family"" seemed so superficial and unfair. I know it's stupid to conform at all, but I thought that maybe if a person really understands me and loves me, it's not a problem to be remove the shit that would make his mum and dad upset.

"AITA for coming home early from work because my husband wasn't answering his phone?  Im 23f, husband is 24m. To add context: I'm a stay at home mom but I do work 2 days a week for extra income. My husband works night shift- he works 7pm-7am. Obviously I work during the day. He came home sick this morning at his normal time, and was stressed a bit when I said I had work today. I guess he forgot?
Anyways he tries to sleep when the baby sleeps, our 8 month old doesn't take naps very well. At all. So my husband I guess just falls asleep anyways and leaves the baby In his crib. We have an owlet cam above his crib and today I was checking on ghe baby. There was a fucking wire in his crib, and a large blanket. And my husband? In the bedroom. (The baby's crib is in the living room). So I call my husband, in a panic, and he doesn't answer. I call 3x times. And he doesn't answer. I texted him 3 times. He didn't answer. EVENTUALLY the baby started crying, and I guess that's what woke his ass up to check on him. I said over the camera microphone , ""hey there's a wire there"". He did push it off, but this wire is the camera wire. It's actually hidden behind a wire cover, but the wire cover fell off. I'm assuming the baby was too close to it and was picking it off. Anyways my husband didn't even bother trying to fix it. And went to bed. I'm like dude?? Not only does he have a BLANKET in his crib, but you didn't even fix the wire? So the baby is up, just sitting in his crib alone, and my husband won't answer his pgkne to please get the blanket out and fix thr fucking wire. 

So I had to leave work 2 hours early to come home and make sure the baby was ok and someone was fucking watching him.
I understand he works 12 hour shifts. I get it that his day time is his night time for sleep. Bur the baby ISNT. The baby ISNT ON THAT SCHEDULE. 

I came home, and i was very angry. I said ""I had to leave work 2 hours early because you wouldn't answer your phone"". And he said ""yeah I was ignoring you because I was already annoyed with the baby crying all day"". SO HE WAS IGNORING ME??.
I started screaming at him at this point. I said ""I had to leave work 2 hours early because you decided you didn't want to talk to me??, it was ABOUT THE BABY"". And he's like ""he was fine!"". Then insulted me on my job, how I don't make as much as him. He pays all the bills with his job. I said fine, I fucking quit then if you can't parent during the day.

"AITA for not wanting to make friends? So I (F30) moved to a new city for 7 years ago to my now husband Mark (30). I moved because I had no connection in my former city so we were thinking it would be best for me to move and because I didn't like my job I had at the time. 

Mark have a lot of friends and are very outgoing. Me on the other hand is very introvert and I don't what to bother anyone. But I do go to party and stuff if I get invited. Im also a High sensitivity person. So a party or a meetup is very exhausting for me. Even just interaction at work is enough for me for the day and I'm drained.

Mark have two friends that are brothers. Fredric (34) and Kyle (25). Fredric is planing to move to our city with his wife and Kyle also planning settle down in the city with his girlfriend. Both of them whant me to be ther wife/girlfriends friend. 

I have meet the wife but I haven't felt a connection to her and the girlfriend I have never meet. 

Mark said it would be good for me to have some friend. But I just feels pressure and drained just thinking about almost be forced to make friends to their partners. I actually can't think a life with friends. I really like being alone.

"AITA for taking drastic measures to protect my gf? So it all started a couple weeks ago when my (24M) gf (21F) went to a college party at a frat house. I wasn’t comfortable with her going to a frat house but I’m not going to tell her where she can or can’t go. I expressed my feelings that I would feel more comfortable if she didn’t drink so she could stay alert and safe. She agreed that was the right thing to do and promised me she wouldn’t drink.

She spent most of the night sober until her friends pressured her into drinking. She was blackout drunk and one of her drinks was roofied. Thankfully nothing physically happened to her. She was taken away by ambulance before the “drugger” could hurt her. The next morning she called me from the hospital and I was disappointed and devastated that something like this could happen to the love of my life.

I comforted her as much as I could, but I told her that I’m not comfortable with her going to parties anymore after what happened. I also said that I didn’t want her to hang out with the people who peer pressured (forced) her to drink when she explicitly told them she didn’t want to.

Her friends now think I’m an AH and think that I’m trying to “control her” and “isolate her from her friends.” I think that college parties are unsafe and that college boys are only looking for one thing at a party and they will do anything to get it. And based on the fact that her friends forced her into a situation which got her drugged and sent the hospital, I don’t think they are a good influence on her and that she should find better friends.

"AITAH – For asking my fiancés 20yr old son to pay me back $50 for moonshine he opened and drank? I recently won a raffle of a yeti cooler full of alcohol including two large jars of Ole Smoky Moonshine. I put all of the alcohol in the refrigerator in the garage where we keep the alcohol. I had planned on either re-gifting it or taking on a camping trip in May to share with the group we are going with (16 people). I went to the refrigerator this morning to get a soda and noticed that seals on both of the jars of moonshine had been broken. I did not open it nor did my fiancé. His son has been warned before that we do not tolerate drug use at all nor him drinking alcohol until after he is 21 as his mother is bat shit crazy and we don’t want to get caught up in anything. His son last summer had asked to drink one of my alcoholic beverages in the can (very strong) and I informed him no he was not 21 and I only had two left. Well the next morning I wake up to the fact that he ended up drinking one anyway and when his father confronted him he laughed as if it wasn’t a big deal.  I want to ask him to reimburse me $50 as they are $25 each so that I can take unopened jars camping and also to teach him a lesson. I do not think it acceptable to “brush” it under the rug? AIBTAH?

Our friendship is strictly platonic, and we've never had any romantic interest. Over the years, I've gotten close with James' girlfriends, including his current one, Layla (17F). Layla has been insecure about our friendship, though I've always respected boundaries.  
During a hangout, I borrowed James' hoodie and checked with Layla if she was comfortable with it, and she was. Later, I posted a video on a private tiktok account wearing the same clothes while at a friends house only a few hours later. A week later, Layla saw the post and felt uncomfortable, asking for the hoodie back. James conveyed this to me. I borrowed the hoodie because i had on a low cut shirt and was riding home with a guy I hadn't met, alone. i didn't intend on keeping the hoodie and it had no flirty intentions whatsoever, and i told her that. I've been pretty close with Layla, and I've always been close with his girlfriends. I've never had any issues before her.  
I didn't intend to make Layla uncomfortable, and I also see James as a brother. The private account only had a few followers and didn't imply the hoodie was his. Nobody would know it wasn't my hoodie but her. I'm torn and seek unbiased opinions. AITA?

"AITA for crashing a ""mom's club""? My wife and I are parents of an elementary school student, and I take care of \~90% of the school drop-offs and pick-ups. I am the only dad who regularly does this, and all the moms hang around to talk and grab coffee afterward. I've tried to join them, but I've been told that this is a moms' thing.

Those gatherings are where play dates and birthday parties and carpools are scheduled, and my daughter is frequently left out or added at the last minute. And when it comes time to scheduling play dates, the moms ALWAYS reach out to my wife even though I am literally right there.

Two weeks ago my daughter missed a birthday party because the other kid's mom told everyone about it over a coffee that I was not invited to. She called me up the next day incredibly upset/apologetic about it.

I told her that this is what happens when I am intentionally iced out, and I gave her 5-6 specific examples of when this had happened. She told me that she would make more of an effort to include me, so I thought things were resolved. WRONG!!!

A few days later, I arrived at the school and some of the moms wouldn't make eye contact and walked away when they saw me coming. After a few days, I managed to talk to one of the women who was intentionally ignoring me, and she FREAKED-OUT on me. She told me that I was destroying their group, they can hang out with whoever they want, and that I shouldn't even be doing drop-offs!

I found out that it had become a major issue in the group. Most of the moms had no issue with me, but the one who confronted me has a controlling husband who doesn't want any men near his wife. I got angry and told the ""cool mom"" that they were all cowards and should be embarrassed that in 2024 they still felt that taking care of children was ""women's work"" (all of the parents work, by the way.)

Over the last few weeks, I've dropped my daughter off at school and left without talking to any of the other parents. Several of the moms have tried to make conversation with me, but I am officially done. One of them asked if my daughter wanted to come over for a play date, and I told her to call my wife because I was clearly not a competent parent. She started to tear up (literally!), but I just didn't want to engage. Quivering lower lips do not move me.

When I got home today, my wife told me that several of the moms reached out to apologize and let her know that they were going to be cutting off the toxic mom and her husband, and that they felt bad about everything. I'm still pretty upset over the situation, and told my wife that I will continue to do drop offs, but I have no interest in any sort of relationship with any of the parents because they've been so crappy to me for the last year and a half. She thinks it would be better for our daughter if I bury the hatchet and play nice, but that's not where my head is. I'm a middle-aged dad, and I don't need to deal with mean-girl shit.

"AITA for not wanting to get rid of my tattoo that my ex did on me? I am using a throw away and fake names. I (24F) am in a new relationship with my girlfriend Alice (22F). She’s great, lovely and perfect in many ways. We have been going steady for 9 months now. 

We have talked about our past relationships. We are getting to know each other more and more everyday. Had met each others friends and family. Sure we did have a few arguments, here and there. What we argue about mostly is, she doesn’t really like are my tattoos and piercings. 

I had a two facial piercings. My dahlia piercing and smiley piercing. They were done by one of my friends. But I took them off for Alice. Now I only have two tattoos. One with a dead unicorn on my hip, and a zebra with red eyes with cosmo flowers around.

The one with the zebra was done by an ex girlfriend of mine, who is a tattoo artist. Who I dated few years ago. When I told Alice about it, she got uncomfortable and asked me to remove it. I told her no repeatedly. Even for weeks it went on and on. The same argument. It’s just so pricey to remove a tattoo and a waste. I love my tattoos, i plan on getting more tattoos anyways. But I already got rid of my piercings for her. She just keeps demanding more and more. I don’t tell her to not color her hair. I have been nothing but supportive. 

I feel like she should love me for who I am. Just as I do for her. She just won’t stop. Alice argues in front of my friends. When we hang out with them. It’s embarrassing. It got to the point my best friend Livia (25F) told Alice off, and to leave me alone about it. They both got into a big argument. In front of my friend group. I never felt more embarrassed. 

Now Alice wants me to stop being friends with Livia. Who I have known since I was 4. I did of course tell her no. None of my friends want anything to do with her. After they saw her treatment with Livia and I. But she keeps continuing about it. 

It is so draining to me. That its getting to the point, I am covering myself up with baggy clothes, to cover my tattoo. Just so I don’t trigger her into an argument. She’s also bringing her family into this. They did tell her to stop it. But Alice just doesn’t want to.

Her friends texted me to think about it at least. I ignored it. I am just not sure what else to do. I don’t want to break up with Alice over this. She means a lot to me. It will be heart breaking for me. AITA for not getting rid of my tattoo, done by my ex? ",0.04
"AITA for having my gf over once a month So I (27m) have been living with my friend Will (28m) for the last year and a half in a small 2 bedroom apartment. So far our roommate situation has been smooth sailing. He is very clean and considerate and I would consider myself to be as well. 

About 4 months ago I began a relationship with an amazing girl who lives about 3 hours away in a neighboring city. Most of the time I will go visit her because I also have family who live near her and it’s convenient for me. But 1-2 times a month she will visit me and spend a couple of nights with me. When she does she is an extremely considerate houseguest and spends 97% of the time she is there either out with me or in my bedroom. We deliberately avoid the common areas as much as possible unless we have to cook dinner real quick. 

My roommate has expressed that it makes him very uncomfortable that she is staying in the apartment for “multiple days” (really it is 1 full day and 2 nights about 1-2x a month. Also my roommate is often out working for much of the time she is there). 

I personally think this is unreasonable. It would be different if I didn’t give him advance notice (I do), my gf spent lots of time outside of my room in the common areas (she doesn’t), or if it were a regular occurrence (it’s not—it’s 1x a month on average). 

I think part of it is that Will has been in a bit of a “drought” romantically and has never brought a girl home to the apartment. Be that as it may, I think it’s unfair to take that out on my girlfriend who has been nothing but respectful and who seldom visits. AITA?",0.04

I’ve been friends with a guy, let’s call him Dave for the sake of the story. Dave and i work at the same job and we both make decent money, enough for us to be able to both buy a house. A few months ago, Dave met a girl that was immediately in love with him, or so we thought. From the start i noticed she always wanted to go to expensive restaurants, rack up a big bill and let Dave pay (he regularly told me about this)

So after a while, they break up and she goes on to find the next sucker to milk. After a few weeks, i get a friend request from her on facebook, i’m a little suspicious but i accept it anyway. She immediately starts chatting me up about how it’s been so long, how have i been, bla bla bla. Within a week she has asked me twice to go grab food together, i know what she’s trying to do so i ask Dave for advice. He and i devise a plan to get her back for all the times she made him pay for her stupidly expensive habits. 

I agree to dinner, and set a date. We meet at a pretty fancy restaurant, and just as I expected, she starts ordering expensive drinks, food, pretty much anything that is expensive. When we finish our main course, i wait for her to go to the bathroom and spring into action. I call the waiter, ask to split the bill and pay my part of it. After that i tell them “the girl that was with me might try to dine and dash, just a heads up”

As i walk out, i hear commotion behind me but just keep walking towards my car. Not much later, i see her trying to leave the restaurant, i assume without paying. The staff tries to keep her inside but she starts screaming and throwing stuff around in an attempt to escape. Cops are called and they came this close to arresting her. She had to pay close to 300$ for her portion of the bill and i paid about 60.

"WIBTA if i asked for the top i made back? i (20F) crocheted a top for my friend (23F) that she asked for. she offered to pay but i refused as a gesture for a friend as she needed it ASAP for an important event. we’ve also known each others since we were kids and even if we’ve distanced from each other over the years, it was a a favour i didn’t mind doing for free. it’s a pretty complicated top and i wasn’t sure if i could complete in the 3 weeks preceding the event, but she insisted on having it. i spent 40h+ on this top and finished it in less than a week. i then delivered the top to her. 

the event just passed, and i noticed she wasn’t wearing it in any of the many posts she made online. she then sent me a text saying “oops sorry i stupidly forgot it at home” and that felt incredibly disrespectful of me and my work. i also do not believe that she “forgot” my top, as she was wearing another top that fit perfectly the event. if she was honest about my top not working out with her outfit, i would’ve been bummed but understood. instead, she chose to lie to me and gave a stupid excuse, and that makes me feel like my efforts were easily disregarded. knowing her, the top is probably in the back of her closet never to be worn.

"AITA parking situation (really long)  I live in a community that has handicapped parking spaces about every 7 houses away from each other. One of these handicap parking spaces is right in front of the house I live in & every so often I’ll need to utilize the handicap space if there is no other parking or if  my handicap father is visiting. 

Lately I’ve noticed that the handicap parking is very rarely empty & will have to park in another handicap maybe a block or two away, because there is ALWAYS a grey Toyota parked there. This was always strange to me and the rest of our family as we know most of our neighbors and have never seen that car until it started parking there (about 2-3 months ago) and we can never find out who it belongs to. When the car is parked there it’s parked for at least 3 or 4 days in a row. 

So recently I was with my handicapped father, left for 20 mins to go to the post office and when we came back the handicap was taken by grey Toyota. We’ve realized that every time we leave, the Toyota will park there instantly (almost like if they’re looking out for it.)

Now here is where it gets confusing as the other day when we come back home, we FINALLY seen who the car belonged to after months! We see a woman in her late 20s or 30s parking and WALKING 2 BLOCKS DOWN into another subdivision of our community. This is confusing as there are almost 4 other handicap parking spaces much closer to her and even one right next to her house, but she CHOOSES to take the parking spaces specifically in front of our house. 

This is frustrating for us, 1: because of course if we need to use it, most of the times we can’t because she’ll park the car there for days. 2: we’ll have to park in a farther spot making my dad walk more. 3: other handicap people that might need that spot can’t use it. And most importantly 4: she is taking up a handicap spot intended for people who have difficulty walking/getting to where they need to go, just for her to casually walk 2 entire blocks away into a different subdivision. 

AND to add fuel to the fire, the other day my father’s car was parked for about 3 days in the handicapped spot & police came knocking on OUR door saying they received a call from a neighbor & asking if the cars parked in front of our house were all ours?? We suspect it was the Toyota lady trying to gain back the parking. 


Is there something that can be done here & does anyone else think what she’s doing is wrong? Or am I taking it too seriously? ",0.29
"AITA for not telling my daughter's dad my boyfriend's name? I have been divorced from my ex husband for three years now. When we split we agreed that we would tell the other parent if we planned to introduce our child (7-year-old girl) to a new romantic partner. He held up the agreement - he told me about his now-wife when they became serious and also gave me a heads up before he introduced her to our child. I know her full name, address, where she works, where she's from, etc... But since she has been around, my co-parenting relationship with my ex has gotten so much worse, to the point where we don't speak and only communicate on an app. I've never spoken to his wife and that's my choice. I pretend like she doesn't exist.

  
So because of the deterioration, I no longer believe I should be held to our agreement. I've had a couple of boyfriends and my ex found out about them from our daughter. I've been with my current boyfriend for more than a year now and so far have been able to conceal his name and work from my ex. My daughter and I just moved in with said boyfriend (I am the custodial parent) and I gave my ex the new address, as I am legally required to do, but I still don't want to give him his full name. I did tell him that my boyfriend is a police officer, so that should be comfort enough. My ex says that he should, at the very least, know the first and last name of someone who's living with our daughter most of the time. But again, since our relationship has deteriorated, I don't feel like I should have to tell him anything that's not required by a court order.

  
My ex is not a dangerous person, so that's not an issue. He's a good dad and pays the max amount of child support allowed by the state. Our relationship has become extremely difficult in the last year, especially, because at first we had a 50/50 split without child support, but then he took our daughter to a pediatrician against my wishes, so I sued him for full custody and child support and won.

  
I am not legally required to tell him anything other than my new address - that's what the most recent court order says. He says it's the decent thing to do to tell him my boyfriend's name. Why, though? 

Am I the asshole?",0.71
"AITA if I don't reply to my boyfriend an hour after sending a ""BRB""? [Long-distance relationship] We agreed that when I send a ""BRB,"" it means I'm occupied and will talk or respond to him later. Is it impolite if I don't reply or send a message an hour after sending a ""BRB,"" even though I'm still occupied?  
  
For instance, during a Discord study session in my server where my boyfriend is also participating, he expects me to send him an ""I gotta head to my session. Love you,"" even though I've already mentioned that I'm busy with a BRB.  
  
Additional Context: We previously had a disagreement about acknowledging Discord messages before going AFK for an unknown period. I argued that Discord communication differs from in-person conversations, allowing for freedom to step away without formal goodbyes. However, he insisted that regardless of the medium, especially since he's my boyfriend, he deserves at least a BRB. I adjusted my behavior accordingly, understanding that it is basic etiquette to let the person you're conversing with know that you're going to be busy for a moment.

"AITA for “forcing” my(19f) boyfriend(25m) to get a credit card? So my boyfriend (let’s call him Mike) and I have been together over a year now and i have been starting to think about our future together and the idea of getting a house. Of course I haven’t been thinking about in the next few months but within 3-5 years. I myself already have a credit card that I got a couple months ago and according to ClearScore my credit score is at 679/1000. Mike however never owned one.

Now since I’ve been thinking of a house with him I’ve bought up the fact that we need to sign him up for a credit card and almost instantly he said no that he has no use for one, I then started saying all the facts as to why it would be useful like having a lower interest rate for our mortgage and a higher approval chance but even with all this he still says no. I kept asking him if he would bc it would make our life easier and it would feel like a burden on me if I have to search up banks that would accept that or even having to go to get a mortgage myself and he’s saying he’s feeling trapped and I’m forcing him to get one. 

Mike also told me a story where someone he knows told him that a girl had her boyfriend sign a house with her and when they did she instantly broke up with him and in general with I feel like most things he brings up experiences of other people in our relationship and says he fears those eg marriage, I’ll take his assets and money (even though with my new job I’ll be making 10k more than him?) and kids, I’ll get child support out of him (I used to want kids but not really anymore) I don’t know what to do or say to stop those fears either.

"AITA - husband spends a lot on gifts for brother My husband Ted frequently wants to send money or buy expensive gifts for his brother, Tom. I have never been able to really talk to him about it. For Christmas, Ted gave Tom a very expensive mister for his plants, and when Tom bought a new car, Ted bought him seat covers, steering wheel cover, air fresheners, and a bunch of other products for a car. These are just a couple of examples.

Recently, Tom was going to pop over to let our dog out and Ted wanted to send him $50 for lunch to thank him. I made Tom some cookies but Ted doesn’t seem to think that is enough. Granted we have watched Tom’s dogs for a week and they didn’t pay us for it.

"AITA for helping to keep their birth story a secret? Over 20 years ago my relative met a lovely young woman who was pregnant. The baby’s dad gave up all his rights and the new couple went on to marry and have several more children. They are a beautiful loving family. My relative loves that child like it’s his own.
They live far from me so I haven’t seen them often but lately have been making more of an effort.
After one trip I was talking to my mum and to my total shock she told me that the oldest child, now a young adult, had no idea they weren’t our biological relative. For some reason the child had never been told.
On my next visit this was confirmed by the child commenting on how they must have inherited their skinny physique “from grandma”. 
Now I feel like I’m part of some horrible deception that’s bound to affect this oldest child at some point in their life. Maybe they will go for a medical procedure, maybe they will cross paths with their bio family. I just don’t understand why this was never addressed and now we are all in on it.

"AITA for being in the way of the city bus? So I am relatively new to the city I live in. I will admit common sense can sometimes be a weakness for me. I am waiting on the sidewalk on the line of the yellow bumpy part (you know, the one that signals to blind folks that the sidewalk is ending) for the walk light to turn on. 
A bus comes up in the right turning lane (next to me) and starts honking. I don’t do anything as I assume they’re honking at something else. Then the bus starts going over the sidewalk curb to the point I have to take a jump back or else my foot would have been ran over, and I realize “oh, they were honking at me to move”. These are relatively narrow turns, but the bus drives halfway over the sidewalk to turn… Had I been deaf or not paying attention, I would have most likely been injured in some way. Anyway, I’m wondering is this common sense to step back when the bus is turning? AITA for not doing so until I was almost hit?

"AITA (are we) for not inviting my wife’s mother to our wedding? So me and my wife got married this weekend! Just us + my mum and her sister as our witnesses. Her mother knew we were getting married but did not know who our witnesses were. She called and asked who was there the day after we got married and my wife told her. Her mother hung up on her and has since blocked both of our numbers, deleted us on social media and told my wife’s grandma she will never speak to us ever again. 

We didn’t tell her who our witnesses were before the wedding because we were worried her reaction would ruin our big day. We were thinking about having strangers when we were first planning which is probably what she thought we had done but I decided I would be more comfortable around people I knew so my wife choose her sister as her witness.

For context my wife has body issues and strongly hates her face to the point where seeing some pictures of her make her extremely distressed and upset.
She was diagnosed as having ASD as a teenager which may or may not contribute to her unwillingness to want to be photographed or looked at. 

Her mother has commented on her clothes  being unflattering in the past and made comments about her not smiling in pictures etc which is the main reason my wife did not want to invite her. 

We wanted it to be as relaxed as possible and my wife felt like not having her mum there would ease the pressure. We weren’t planning on telling her who we invited to our wedding to protect her feelings, however, if she did ask, which she did, we weren’t going to lie to her.

"AITA for pushing my boyfriend to tell me about his personal issues?  Me (F18) and my boyfriend (M18), let’s called him Jay, have been together for 2 years. 

We are very in love with each other and whenever we get into disagreements or arguments, we handle it maturely with acknowledging each other’s feelings and current issues. But as of recently, we got into a big argument because I found out that Jay was showing his friends tiktoks of girls and calling them “cute” or “fine”.

It made me deeply insecure because for about a year now, we’ve been having issues with his time management. Jay is always playing on the game and responding to my texts late. When I mean late, I mean about 3-4+ hours. It’s been a while since we had a date or hung out in person. I felt deeply frustrated and felt like I was being ignored. We’ve had many conversations about this, but Jay always brought up how there’s issues going on in his life he can’t talk about, and that he will tell me eventually. You would think he would’ve already told me 2 years into the relationship, but he hasn’t.

Every time we argue, I keep telling him that I won’t judge him for anything he has to say regarding his problems, and that he can trust me 100%. Even then, he won’t tell me and keeps pushing it off saying he will tell me one day or “soon”. Jay did this just recently, and I keep pushing him to tell me because it’s becoming a huge issue between us. 

These issues get him very emotional and frustrated, and I would give anything in the world to know what they are. But because our relationship is going through a VERY rough patch, I’m not sure what to do other than keep telling him that I’m always there for him whenever he needs me. 

It’s true that his family has a lot of problems. Him being the oldest out of 5 adopted siblings including himself. He has to look after them constantly, both of his adoptive  parents own their own businesses so they leave early and come back late. He’s had issues with his biological parents revolving abuse, and it’s a sensitive topic for him that I don’t bring up. 

There’s more but I kept a promise to not tell anyone and I’ll stay keeping that promise. I’m not sure if his background involves the issues he doesn’t want to talk about. but I feel bad for pushing it, but I’m being deeply affected by our relationship with being pushed to the side and not being given a lot of affection.

"AITA for replacing my roommates fire alarm? So my roommates smoke alarm has been chirping every day and she has said she was going to try a few things to fix it but it is still chirping. I’m not sure if she actually tried anything because she always says she’ll do something and never does. 
I’ve been silencing it every day for a week now and by pushing the button it just silences it for 8 hours. Sometimes the chirping wakes me up at 5AM in the morning and it’s super annoying throughout the day. My other roommates are also annoyed but seem too scared to say anything about it. Apparently one of them did ask her about it and she said that she will try to fix it. It’s been a week and nothing has changed.

If she hadn’t come home I would have texted her to let her know. She immediately said can you please let me know before you go into my room to do something like this?

"WIBTA if I don’t let my husbands female friend stay with us for a few days while she’s grieving Husband (32m) and I(27f) have been together 3 years and to preface this post, he has never given me reason to doubt him. He works remotely while I work in person M-F and don’t get home until 6:30-7ish pm most days. Earlier today, he texted me saying he spoke to an old friend (33f apparently) of his because she moved to a city 3 hours from us and after hearing about the things that happened in her life recently, invited her to come stay with us for a few days. 

He told me that both her parents and her brother passed away within a few months of each other recently (around a year ago) and she only has a sister left as part of her family now who she’s away from atm. She also recently broke up with her BF who she had been dating for a few years, not sure who broke up with whom. He said she seemed very distraught during their phone call and he didn’t really know what to say or how to console her, that he felt really bad for her, especially because she’s mostly alone now. She said she was off from Thursday to Sunday next week so he invited her to come and stay with us for that time.

This woman used to be his coworker at the first job he worked, probably more than 8 years ago now. I know and have met most of his friends but this is the first time I’m hearing of her, but it might be understandable because I haven’t met people he knew from 8 years ago unless they live close by. What I think really pissed me off was that he didn’t ask me if it would be okay, more or less just gave me a heads up that he invited her. I’m normally all for helping a friend out in a time of need but i expected him to ask me and make sure I’m okay with it before inviting someone over like that. I’m not comfortable with a female friend of his being in the house alone with him for a few days while I’m not around for most of the day. I don’t know this person or what they’re thinking so while I trust my husband, I don’t trust her. Grief and loss also makes you act in ways you might not normally act in and the fact that she had a recent breakup isn’t comforting either so I feel like letting this happen would be like inviting trouble into my marriage. I also know for a fact that if something inappropriate happened, even if she initiated it and my husband shut it down, I would lose trust in him for bringing this situation about despite me not being okay with it.

"WIBTA if I bought the same dress my friend is wearing for her prom for myself (not for the prom) Basically a friend of mine and myself have essentially identical taste in clothing, and we already share very similar clothes (doesn't bother me). We were both shopping for our prom dresses and she shows me an instagram story of a guy she used to talk to of his prom date wearing a certain dress which she liked. I immediately took to the dress as well, as it was gorgeous, but I obviously wasn't going to wear it to prom myself, as 1. She found it first and 2. It was a bit too casual for me to wear to such an event. But the dress was still absolutely enchanting and I could picture myself wearing it on holidays or to more casual but still formal events.

I ended up finding the dress for her and asked if she would mind if I bought the dress in a different colour (I made it clear I wouldn't wear it to the prom). She essentially lost her shit and told me I couldn't have it at all because she found it first and it would be selfish of me to buy it. I said nothing and just decided to leave it alone. Safe to say I was pretty pissed off, I found it for her, and she also only happened to come across it through someone elses instagram. There was every chance I could've found it before she did through pinterest etc. as it's very much my style too. Honestly if she would've wanted to buy it I would've let her.

About a week later I brought it up, she realised she overreacted but still didn't want me to buy it because it would downgrade her dress if she wore it to the prom, but I was seen just wearing it more casually. (Although that would mean I'd be getting more use out of it than she would).

It's been over a month and I see the dress everywhere and can't stop thinking about it. I generally lose interest in things after a month if I'm not actually that interested. Proving I actually would've bought the dress with or without her wanting it too, so it's not a situation where I just want what she wants (which I'm pretty sure she thinks the situation is) I talked to another friend about it and she told me to just buy it anyways and not tell her/post pictures of me in it. I feel like that's a bit of a shitty thing to do, as we are actually good friends and this is just one issue I have with her really. But I feel like bringing it up to her would cause unnecessary drama and I don't want to lose her friendship over a dress, as I slightly see her point with the downgrading thing, and feel its my job as her best friend not to do that to her.

What do I do? Do I just secretly buy the dress and hope she doesn't find out or do I politely ask her again and just tell her I'm buying it regardless of what she thinks?

Tl;dr want to buy the same dress in a different colour which my friend is wearing to her prom, but wear it elsewhere (not the prom) but she thinks I'm copying her (even though she came across it randomly, which I had equal chance of doing, and I found it for her).

I'm starting to get pissed because our previous text was me opening up about how people have been taking advantage of me and I'm starting to think she's taking advantage as well. So I sent another text asking what is it and she sent a text saying ""Emergency"" and I asked her what kind of emergency (now I'm getting worried) and she leaves me on read again.

I asked my husband (29m) to sit with our two year old son at the dining room table while eating dinner. I (29f) was sitting in another room eating with a visiting friend while playing a card game.

He walked into the kitchen wearing it (and had finished playing). I asked him to take it off when sitting down to eat with our child. He said there was no good reason to because he could see him through the headset and had paused the game. 
I felt like there would be a disconnect between him and the child by having it on. Our child couldn’t see his full face and range of emotions.

  I, 18F is a senior is high school. In the mornings before classes start, we have to sit in the cafeteria. My friend group and I all sit at the same table and we normally just talk about classes or homework.
  
Today my friend I’ll call Jill for privacy reasons, came to the cafeteria crying because her one of her two pet guinea pigs, Fluffy, had died that morning before school. We all tried to comfort Jill, and she’s one of the nicest people I’ve ever met, and I hate to see her this way.  

The thing is, I’m terrible at comforting people when they cry, because I get nervous and when I get nervous, I laugh. I like physically cannot help but laugh when someone cries. I tried SO hard to not laugh because I genuinely love Jill and wouldn’t want her getting the wrong idea. I failed though and burst out laughing. My whole friend group looked at me like I said the most offensive thing ever and I said sorry tons of times. 

I’m a loud laugher which makes it even worse. Before I could explain why I laughed, the bell to get to period 1 rang so my friend group throughout the day has been giving me tons of shade and I know they’ve been talking bad about me when I’m not with them. 
  
After lunch I caught up to Jill and explained that I laugh when I get nervous and I didn’t think her feelings about her pets death was a joke. She coldly brushed me off and said “Just don’t do it again.” and walked off. 

The whole school day I tried to explain it to the rest of my friend group and also asked friends outside if my friend group if I was in the wrong, most of them said I did a terrible thing and are now also mad at me.

I did reply to her story saying how cute the dinner party was and I didn’t know she was having one and she said « oh I thought you knew « . Which is odd cause she never mentioned it. ",0.31
"AITA for nervous laughing when I saw footage of Ariane Grande on Nickelodeon? I was at my girlfriends house. We watched the footage of Ariane Grande on Nickelodeon. It's obviously gross and creepy. 

Ive had a nervous laugh reaction to a lot of uncomfortable things in my life. I remember getting in trouble for hysterically laughing when I saw someone break their leg horrifically on TV. It's just a weird coping mechanism. 

Anyway, my girlfriend was disgusted by my reaction. She said it was ESPECIALLY fucked because I'm a teacher. 

This pissed me the fuck off. Like my nervous laugh in any way effects my ability to care for kids. It just feels very gross and judgemental.",0.2
"AITA for telling my in-laws they were trying to profit on their son’s possible death My (30F) husband’s (31M) parents took out a $500,000 life insurance policy on him when he was a senior in high school. He was planning to be a doctor in the military and would likely accumulate some debt in school, so their explanation was, “if he dies, we will use this to pay it off.”

Because my husband had a medical issue as a kid, he ended up rejected from military schools and went to a regular college. We met our freshman year and have been in a steady relationship ever since.

When we were 22, we got engaged. We were joining our finances and he told me about this policy—he wanted to get it transferred to us so he asked his parents about it.

They wanted to keep it themselves. The school debt stuff was no longer valid, but they said that they’d use it to pay off their mortgage. He insisted that it go to me, as his future wife, and that we take it over, but they said no and that they’d “look out for me with whatever was left.”

We got married and ignored it.

Then, 2023 hit us like a ton of bricks. We both lost our jobs, had to move from a major city back to our home state, and within a week of turning 30, my husband was diagnosed with thyroid cancer. He got very depressed as the bills racked up and started wondering if maybe I’d be “better off with the $500,000 than with him.” Of course I assured him absolutely not, but he contacted his parents to ask about the policy again to see what he could leave me if worst came to worst.

They said that they’d let the policy lapse and that it was only worth a few thousand dollars now. He was terrified he’d leave me strapped with medical debt and his student loans (which by now we’d refinanced with me as a co-signer).

A year later, my husband is doing amazing health wise. There’s still a ton of bills but things are looking up.

Now, his mom calls and says that they have to sign his life insurance policy over to us because of some rule. He said, I thought it was gone? And she got quiet. She said that it never lapsed—she lied because she thought it would help him not be so depressed if it wasn’t there. He kept pushing and she gave the same lines about how, if he died, they’d planned to pay off the mortgage and probably help me with whatever was left.

He was too surprised to say anything in the moment but was very hurt. When we met with them to discuss the transfer of the policy, the lie came up again. They tried to play it off and my husband was getting really upset. I usually don’t argue with them but I snapped and told them what they did was extremely fucked up and selfish, and that it was weird that it seemed like they were waiting to get a benefit from his death without giving him peace of mind in a time of need. I told them they’d lost our trust.

His mom started bawling and his dad started screaming and we left. His grandparents and aunts and uncles thinks we’re greedy assholes and made them out to be monsters and are demanding an apology, but the younger generation thinks we were right. AITA? ",0.85

"AITA for not getting involved in an ex-colleague’s retirement farewell video? I recently left a job to move interstate and I got a message from my old boss asking me to be involved in a video for a colleague who is retiring. They asked me to record myself saying farewell, and to recall a favourite memory with this person and my favourite meal they made (they would make lots of food for the office). The video will be put into a compilation and played at their farewell dinner.

I adored this colleague and I loved working with them, but I felt personally uncomfortable making the video. I have a horrible memory and I struggled to recall specific things to say in the video. I also HATE recording myself or talking in front of a camera.

I recorded something anyway but after a few tries I couldn’t get it right. I kept mumbling and my stories were not that great.

I forgot to send the video at first to my old boss, but after they followed up with me, I just ignored it. I love the idea of the videos and I wish I could be a part of it, but I just can’t get it right. Plus I can’t stand the idea of everyone seeing it.

AITA for doing this? I feel guilty about it. Is it fair to not get involved or should I have just sucked it up?",0.08
"AITA, if I tell my younger sibling to break up with their “disabled trans” partner? I (34F) have a younger sibling (F24) has been dating… yes and might even marry a man (27m) who does not work, help pay bills or do anything for anyone besides stay at home and leech off my sibling. Now I usually don’t give a shit about what others do with their life, but after like 3 years of seeing my sibling work so hard for a good life and constantly being the only one to pay bills barely making 2k a month. I feel like I’m going insane seeing this happen, for context this person claims to be disabled but has no proof or evidence of such disorders and when I say they are full of shit, I truly mean it. This person says they are a “disabled transgender” who has “multiple disabilities” and claims they can  live off disability checks for the rest of their life. This makes me furious as someone who pays taxes and works my ass off daily to earn my keep. Seeing this person do nothing but hold my sibling back is absolutely cringe worthy. The idea of my sibling marrying this man blows my mind. I wonder if my sibling has a care taker kink? I have been accused of trying to ruin their relationship for trying to be a voice of reason. I don’t care trans or not, helping my sibling should be a priority yet, that is not the case. Is this man just a lying lazy piece of shit who wants to game the system for themselves? The craziest thing is they say they have extreme difficulty working, when all they do is sit around playing video games and pretending to be in “so much pain”. I have never seen this “unbearable pain” show itself as in they are lying. I swear if you all just saw this person, heard them speak and see how able bodied they truly are you would probably think i am not the asshole here. I truly have respect for all people, especially disabled people, as I myself have a learning disability and struggled plenty in school. This person has a new disability every month and it’s just gotten to a point where I don’t believe them one bit! Get a job, do something to help my sibling, stop being such a lazy piece of shit. It’s like I’m watching my sibling wasting away taking care of this pathetic coach potatoe. All in all, I could care less what my sibling does but If this person becomes apart of my family I will be very disturbed. I just wanted to hear what you all think? They have been denied disability multiple times and still keep pretending to be “servely unable to work”.

"AITA for falling in love with my girlfriend and I’s mutual best friend? Hey guys, obvious throwaway account here. 

Like the title says, I think i’m in love with someone other than my girlfriend. We’ve been dating for ~1.5 years, and don’t get me wrong she is in amazing human being. However, as our relationship continued to develop, I started to realize some differences in our personality. For example, she is much more of a stay at home type of person while I would rather go out and do something. Her family leads a very sedintary lifestyle, and she doesn’t put much effort into social situations or meeting new people. I don’t think that there is anything inherently wrong with this, but as I continue to grow as a person I realize that I am almost the complete opposite of this. We tell each other that we love each other often, and now every time I say it pains me because I genuinely don’t know if I mean it or not. In short, I think i’m falling out of love with her. 

This is where things get messy. We basically met through a friend, and over the past couple years I became very close with this friend (F18). We even kind of dated way back like freshman year of high school, but it didn’t go anywhere because neither of us really had feelings for each other then because we barely knew each other. Flashforward to present day, I find myself enjoying talking to this friend more than my actual gf. I feel like I can tell her anything, something that i’ve never really felt with my gf. I hate to lead my gf on but it’s her birthday today and I don’t want to ruin it, in addition to her virtually having no other friends other than me and our mutual friend. I feel like if I break up with my gf, my relationship with our mutual friend and entire friend group will be destroyed, which is something that I absolutely don’t want to do. It hurts me to say this, but it almost feels like I am physically in love with my gf, but i’m emotionally in love with our friend. I don’t physically find her attractive like I do my gf, but there is something about her where I could genuinely see myself with her for the rest of my life. 

It gets even messier though. My aforementioned friend just started dating one of my buddies (also M18) and they seem to have a pretty good but slow relationship. However I feel like she comes to me whenever she has problems, and we facetime very often to study together/just talk. I can’t tell if this is just me trying to see something when there isn’t anything. 

I don’t know where i’m going with this. I basically just want to put it out into the world so I don’t have to keep it bottled up. Any replies/advice would be much appreciated. ",0.5
"WIBTA For forcing my condo co-owner to sell the condo I (M29) and my ex-best friend/roommate (F29) have been friends for 17 years and in 2021, we bought a condo together. Both of our names are on the mortgage and deed, we had lived together several times on and off over the years, and trusted each other to make this big step.

In October 2022, I met my current girlfriend (F32) and by the next year, October 2023, she and I were discussing moving in together. I discussed this ahead of time with my roommate, that I was thinking of moving out and she seemed happy for me.

However, once I actually made the decision and said I would be moving and, specifically, would want to get off the mortgage, my roommate said that I had betrayed her and am abandoning her with the mortgage that she can't afford. I explained that since I wouldn't be living in the condo, there's no reason for me to risk my credit and stay on the mortgage with her, (she has a history of not making payments on time) much less pay the bills for a place I wouldn't be living in.

Things have escalated over the last seven months, to say the least. It's at the point where my roommate is basically threatening to have us both go bankrupt if I don't continue to pay my half, despite my attempts to get off the mortgage. She refuses to buy my half for less than $8,500 (for context, we bought the condo for $345k and it's worth $405k now), refuses to sell, and brings up the bankruptcy threat when I try to suggest I rent my room out. Basically being a huge asshole to me.

Because of essentially being backed into a corner, I'm going to a lawyer to see if I can force her to agree to sell the condo (my state has the Tenancy in Common which should allow this) - she'd have to move, but we'd both walk away with more money and not have to deal with the long and expensive process of breaking the mortgage. But... I feel like that would be an asshole thing to do, but in this case, would I actually be an asshole?",0.64
"AITA for ruining a friendship of one year all bc i wanted to join my gay friend's joke?

"WIBTA for buying 🍄 in DC before my friends bachelorette party, even after she asked me not to? So, I (27F) am attending a bachelorette party tomorrow in DC. My best friend (26F) is getting married in May and I’m so excited for her. 

Unfortunately, my friend has a lot of anxiety. Like, a lot. Sometimes a little too much. We have very different views about drugs and their morality. I smoke weed and do psychedelics, whereas she refuses to touch a drop of alcohol. She is so afraid of the ramifications of drugs. DARE really did a number on her lol. I have never pressured her to try drugs or alcohol: I offer occasionally but she has full bodily autonomy and I don’t need my friends to do drugs to be my friends. She has never stopped me from doing my own thing as long as she isn’t involved. 

Anyway, here’s the issue. Mushrooms are decriminalized in DC, and I don’t have a lot of opportunities to go down there, so I was really excited to get some chocolate bars and bring them home for me and my bf. My cousin is also a friend of my friend and is coming to the party, so she wanted us to go to the dispo together when we first got there. Neither of us have any intention of putting them in our bags or bringing them into the hotel, only putting it in my glovebox till the weekend is over. I originally told my cousin sure thing, but when I texted my friend to see if we would have 5-10 minutes at the jump to go to the dispo, she sent me a lot of long paragraphs asking us not to go. 

Her reasoning is that she’s afraid of getting caught with it and being arrested. I have told her countless times I’m making a legal purchase and that there would be no repercussions from this. She is also afraid me and my cousin will take them during her party too, which we never would, or sneak them into her food and dose her. Which again, I would NEVER. She’s also scared that if I touch it I could get residual drugs on my hand and dose her that way. I’ve tried to tell her that’s not even possible, but she has anxiety so bad that I don’t think there’s logic there. She keeps saying it’s her bachelorette so she gets to be selfish this one time and ask us not to go. I don’t want to make her uncomfortable or have her panicking during her party. 

My cousin really wants this stuff and she’s even farther away from DC than I am. Idk how I would get it to her unless we went together tomorrow. Also, I think the dispo is closed on Sundays? So I couldn’t go on my way back home. 

So here’s my question- WIBTA if I stop on the way down and just don’t tell her I stopped?

"AITA for not agreeing to drive 6 hours a month to pick up my step son for my bf? My boyfriend and I have been together 7 months. He sees his young son once a month because he lives about 3.5 hours away from him.

He doesn’t drive, so the current arrangement that stands is he gets a train to a half way point and his ex drives down to that point to meet him/ drop off. The train is expensive, and to do this trip (there and back twice) over a single weekend costs him around £200.

Last night my boyfriend mentions he wants to start seeing his son every other weekend, and asked would I drive to the half way point to facilitate this (1.5 hours each way, so 6 hours total), as trains are too expensive to do this twice a month. He says he’d pay me fuel.

I didn’t really give a response and said let me think about it.. however my gut wants to say no..

I currently already drive an hour to see my boyfriend, and we’re talking about moving in over the next few months. When this happens I’d be moving to HIS location due to him not being able to move his job. As a result of this I’d be commuting an hour and a bit into work every day just so we can be together. I feel with this in consideration, it’s asking way too much of me/ borderline taking advantage.

AITA if I refuse and make him get the train?- which would force him to still only see his son once a month due to costs.


TLDR: my boyfriend of 7 months is asking me to commit to picking up his son for him once a month. It’s a 6 hour round trip over a weekend. I already drive an hour to see my boyfriend. I want to say no but worry I can’t really say no without looking like the AH.",0.25

"AITA for calling someone I met by the ""wrong"" pronouns? This whole concept and the huge argument it has come to is just bizzare in my opinion. So I am asking the internet if I was indeed as huge of an asshole as everyone says I am.

I (25F) was invited to hang out by a friend of mine, I'll call her Natalie (24F). She said there would be a few other friends that I don't know but she knew I would get along with. I was like sure.

There was this person among those friends I didn't know, Alex, 24 years old. He (in my opinion at least) was a man, wearing make-up and feminine clothes with beard. After we were introduced he told me I was to refer to him as she/her since he identified as a woman. I didn't want any problems so I didn't say anything. However through the lunch, I slipped and called him a 'he' a few times.

He got really offended and said I was being an AH and not respecting him. I was like sorry but I feel like you are disrespecting my cognitive abilities by saying you identify as a woman, when you look every bits and pieces of a man. I was like, you're a man who likes stuff that are traditionally feminine, good for you! But you're not a woman.

A huge argument broke out and I was being lectured in 4 different languages on LGBTQ and gender politics and whatever the hell. I got really mad and told them they should just think a little bit more about this and left. 

Natalie texted me saying I was homophobic and transphobic and a biggot and whatnot. I am not. I am a bisexual woman myself. However, my common sense didn't allow me to accept a full blown man as a woman just because he said so. Am I really delusional and an AH???",0.79
"AITA for getting mad at a girl for saying i'm faking my Tourettes? Background: I (16m) suffer from Tourettes syndrome, which I was diagnosed with when I was around 11 years old. I say suffer because in my experience, it has been horrible. It affects daily aspects of my life, and isn't something I joke about.

The other day, while I was in the library, this girl (18f, senior) came up to me and we started chatting. I'll call her Amy for the sake of the story. Anyways, Amy tells me that she heard 'through the grapevine' that I was ""going around telling people that I have tourettes when I don't. ""

[Extra bit of information: Amy is friends with this girl that I used to be relatively close with (we will call her lily), and Lily knows that I have tourettes. She used to come to my house often and only found out because she heard my mom asking me if my new meds were helping at all with my tics. I thought Lily was my friend, so I explained to her that I was diagnosed as a child and it is something I struggle a lot with. She seemed okay with that answer and didn't bring it up again. Lily and I had a falling out around a year ago, and haven't spoken since.]

I got upset at Amy and asked her who told her that I had it in the first place (already kind of knowing it was Lily), and she quickly tried to change the subject. I, being extremely bothered by the fact that my diagnosis is being spoken about in conversations that dont include me, got onto her. I told Amy that if she thought I was faking, I could show her my diagnosis papers and records of all the tests they did on me as a kid to reach the conclusion that I have tourettes. She said I was getting defensive and rude, and that I shouldn't ""shoot the messenger"".

The next day, Amy's brother (16m), who is in my math class, told me that his sister is still going around telling people that I am faking tourettes. He knows that Amy is a liar and just likes attention being on r. He also told me this isn't the first time she's done something like this.

I went up to Amy that day at lunch and said ""If you don't keep my name out of your mouth, we're going to have a serious problem. I don't need you talking about my medical history with complete strangers. If I hear that you start spreading this shit again, I'm going to get the deans involved.""

This apparently made her cry during the next period and have what she described as a 'bullying induced autistic meltdown'. So I got called to the counselors office and when I explained what happened, the counselor said that I wasn't being 'tolerant enough' and that if I didn't apologize to Amy, I would get written up and my mom would be called.

I went ahead and apologized to Amy, but told my mom what happened. She said that I was not in the wrong, and that Amy should have been the one to get punished. I agree with her, but the schools staff seem to think that I am in the wrong and a 'bully'. Am I the asshole?",0.5

Me and my fiancé are high school sweethearts. We arent super close with our families, cause we are living in another city. His family is more on the conservative side, my family liberal. My family is really wealthy and known in community (which plays part in a story) and his is low middle class, more blue collar workers. We’re re doing great financially- I’m a doctor and he is an engineer in huge company.

The introduction was kinda relevant because his brother in law used to work for my parents. He was building our main house. When I was 17 and started to date my now fiancé he targeted me. It all started really slow, he was polite and sometimes making these little jokes, which wasn’t really jokes. He was joking about my education, about my family house, about my relationship with my fiance. When I was in my first year at the university he would joke about what a shitty doctor I would become and downgrade my education. Over this several years it was getting worse and worse. He has problem with drinking and is really mean to every women (including his wife and his mother in law) while drunk. He was commenting on my family, our house, our dogs, our new car, he was saying that my fiancé should stay home with his family and I made him travel to another city. Once when he was drunk he asked me in front of the whole family what are my and my family political views. I said that I didn’t want to talk about it during dinner plus it doesn’t matter to me. He was asking me on repeat, like seriously 10 times about it. He knew damn well that my fiancé’s dad is super conservative and HATE liberals. 
I hated seeing him when I was younger. Sure, we visited them 3 times a year, but he was making me feel really shitty about myself. I knew that my fiancé wanted to be on good terms with his family so not event once I asked him to step up for me. This Easter he really irritated me. He got drunk and started to make fun of not only me but my future and his mother in law. This time it wasn’t so innocent. She was staring to get really uncomfortable but still trying to laugh it all. I wasn’t having it. So I started to make fun of him too. I joked about his salary, that he couldn’t take his family on a decent vacations and is buying alcohol all the time, that maybe his wife should start looking for someone new with better prospects. I wasn’t saying this straight to his face, I was just telling some jokes, making sure that he is reading between the lines. He chocked, literally he chocked.
Now my fiancé is mad at me. He is saying that his jokes were harmless and he was just trying to make everyone laugh. But mine was just rude.
I have never made anyone think that I was better than them, cause my heritage and money doesn’t define me. I’m always nice to all of them, I play with kids and buy them gifts, when someone is sick I always help. I’m just trying to fit in but he is making furious sometimes. ",0.4
"AITA for telling my boyfriend to kick out his mom’s things? I'm 24F who's been dating my boyfriend (26M) for 10 months, and we're generally good together. However, there's a major issue that's causing a lot of tension in our relationship: his mom's junk. 
Background: Four months ago, I decided to move in with my boyfriend after leaving my previous living situation due to a toxic housemate. We thought it was a bit soon, but we wanted to give it a try since we're serious about each other. The problem is, my boyfriend's mom used to run a salon from the house, and when she moved out a year ago, she left behind a ton of stuff. This includes around 50 huge boxes taking up an entire room and cluttering half of the kitchen. It feels like she is using this space as a free storage unit for things she doesn’t want to have in her own home but doesn’t want to throw away either. Me and my boyfriend agreed to clear it out before moving in, but despite promises, nothing has changed. This junk is overwhelming for me. I'm a clean and organized person, and this mess triggers my anxiety. I want my house to be my comfort zone. Plus, my boyfriend's mom recently visited and made things even worse. She disrupted the organization and started messing everything around and made me feel completely unwelcome in my own home. She even screamed at me multiple times, despite having only met her a few times before. (My boyfriend did tell her this behaviour with me was unacceptable and she eventually apologised to me but nothing changed in her behaviour, she is more of a ""I follow my own rules and no one tells me what to do"" type of person). Note: she does not own the house in any way. This how is a rental from a third party landlord, and me and my boyfriend split the rent and all bills. I've reached my breaking point and given my boyfriend three options: either he gets his mom to clear out her crap out of here ASAP, we find a new place together (which he doesn’t want because rent prices nowadays have doubled), or I move out (which I don’t want because I love living with him). Am I wrong for pushing him and pressuring him so much to take his moms junk out of this house? Should I speak with his mom directly and tell her myself to take her things out of here? I love him, but I can't continue living like this. ",0.5
"AITA for not changing the rules because of my stepdaughter? I got married a few months ago.

I always had a rule that my daughter would get money for her grades because I believe it's a kid's job to study. she never had a problem with this rule, in fact she loves it since she never gets anything below A+.

before we got married I talked to my wife about this rule and she agreed that this is a good rule and didn't have a problem with it because she claimed her daughter is always getting good grades.

turns out that my sd's ""good grades"" are mostly B and I believe it's because she doesn't study enough and if she did study she could get A.

Recently she started to ask me if I was going out for walks or not, that I should because it's healthy and so on. She is not wrong there, but i normally just forget to go out. Now she started to ask me if I wouldn't want to take her dog out. I like dogs, but not really interested in her dog. Its a tiny one, don't remember the breed. I don't really want to walk her dog. She requires medical attention daily, so she does have nurses coming everyday, they sometimes take her dog out for a bit. I'm pretty sure if I do it once she will want it to become a regular thing. I avoid answering her or simply forget about it, because I'm forgetful. But I'm I the asshole for not helping her?",0.07
"AITA for pouting over some jokes? F30 / M37, 7 year relationship. I had to get a root canel done . They called to confirm the appointment and told me that I’d have to pay for everything up front and that my insurance would reimburse me, and that it would anywhere from 1500 to over 2000. I was annoyed because I had  been waiting for this appointment for a while and had I know I would of tried finding a different place or saved up for it. I agreed but was stressing because 2000 is almost an entire months paycheck for me. I talked to BF about how I was frustrated and that 2000 is all I have. He just kind of shrugged it off and was like you can put it on my credit card if you want and walked away. 


The  morning of I got up and  tried making some phone calls to see if I could find a better solution and couldn’t. BF comes home from the dentist. I tell him how I tried to find a different place and couldn’t. He goes (in a mocking baby voice) “awww poor baby Gunna have to pay it all up front, it’ll be okay your not going to die, awe baby is worried about money she’s going to get back anyways , I just went to the dentist and have a clean bill of health”. I was annoyed and said “I don’t know that I’ll get all my money or even any of my money back there is no guarantee that the insurance will pay it” ( I had an annoyed tone at that point). He knows that’s 1. I have dental anxiety in general and  2. I don’t make a lot . So he knows my stress levels are high at this point. 


THEN before leaving for work he goes “are you going to be in a pissy mood when I get home” . To which I reply “don’t know guess it’ll depend on how broke I am”. Then he goes “ guess I won’t come home then “. When he did get home he asked me “ well, did ya die?” I get he offered me his credit card but then he turned around and mock me for being stress and upset about the situation. So why would I want to borrow any money from him . His family had to tell me stories about how some kid died from a abscessed tooth so for the last few months of waiting I’ve been terrified about that. He has a habit of making mean jokes ( exp saying I would break his legs if I sat on his lap) and then saying I am “pouting” when I get upset. Am I just being a dramtic child ? ",0.09
"AITA for arguing with my boyfriend over me paying for his takeout? I (21F) argued with my boyfriend (25M) over takeout. 

For context, we are in a long distance relationship as I’m completing my study year abroad for part of my degree. He works two jobs (one full time, the other is once a month sort of like a gig) and earns a decent amount of money as an engineer. We met in person and went on a few dates before I had to move. 

We agreed to do date nights where we bought each other takeout and watch a movie over discord which is what I hear a lot of people do on dates. Since the country I’m studying in isn’t convenient for him to order food since he can’t read the language nor he doesn’t have the app installed, I ordered myself food under the premise that he would just send me the money for it. I still ordered him his food. He ended up eating $45usd of sushi whereas I ordered noodles for like $5 which to be fair, is expensive in my country. He really just gave me the $5 when he knows I’m a broke university student with no income (or any money from parents). To be frank, I expected maybe $20 or more. I let this slide, thought I was overreacting but that $39 would’ve been around 20 cheap meals, or about 70 rice rolls from the corner store near me so it goes a long way. 

I didn’t think about it for a while until he wanted me to order takeout for him after him whining again - and this was out of the blue, just before I was about to get dinner at my university cafeteria. He wanted another $45 worth of sushi and I ordered it under much hesitation since it’s a lot of money to me. I also had recently spent a lot of money for gifts for him (about $200) and I saved this by sacrificing a lot of my guilty pleasures like snacks and makeup. He asked for those gifts and wanted me to ship them back home ASAP. He never has bought me gifts. 

I asked my friends about what should I do and they all said he shouldn’t be asking me for so much and he’s taking advantage of me since he works 2 jobs and knows I’m too nice to say no. He tells me I’m AITA because he’s not asking for much and it’s what couples do (and I’m being entitled).

I’m completely stuck and I don’t think I’m the AH since he knows I don’t earn money and I’m trying to save as much as I can. 

And if this somehow (probably not) blows up, I don’t want this to be in any videos or podcasts. Thanks!",0.13
"AITA for getting angry and ""ruining"" my father's wedding day? I (20F) am the oldest of four children. I have one younger brother (16) and two younger sisters (10 and 8). Our parents got divorced about five years ago, after finally admitting that they couldn't stand the sight of each other.

My dad met someone pretty soon after the divorce was finalized, a woman called ""Jenny"". My mom wasn't happy about it, as she felt that it was disrespectful for my dad to be dating so soon after their marriage had ended. Custody was 50/50, so we would spend every second week over at my dad's new place with him and Jenny. She was pretty nice and none of us disliked her, which made my mom even angrier.

This year, my dad told us that he was planning a very special trip for us on Easter weekend. He came and picked us up on the Friday evening and we drove into the sticks for about two hours, before eventually reaching a big, fancy manor house.

Jenny was waiting inside for us, as were she and my dad's extended families. They then revealed to us that the special trip was actually their wedding weekend. They had deliberately kept it a secret from my mom because they were worried that she wouldn't let us attend or might even show up to sabotage the big day. This was a shock to all of us, but they asked us to keep it a secret until the wedding was over. We didn't really have any choice but to agree.

The wedding itself went fine. They had packed special clothes for us to wear and the ceremony was really nice. At one point, during the evening party, I noticed that my 8 y/o sister was being very quiet and so I took her outside for some fresh air. When we were outside, she burst into tears and told me that she felt terrible about betraying our mom by keeping our dad's secret. I gave her a hug and tried to comfort her as best I could.

I went back inside to the party and asked my brother to bring both of our sisters upstairs to start getting ready for bed, so he did. When I went out into hallway, I ran into my (now quite tipsy) dad. Hurting for my little sister, I told him that it was very unfair for him to put us in this position and pit us against our mother, especially my two younger sisters who couldn't possibly understand all of this. He got mad and said that it's my mom's fault for being ""crazy"" and not allowing him to just be happy. I said even so, it's still his job to be an adult and make good choices that don't harm his children. He ended up getting really angry at me and then started to cry, so Jenny came out and told me to go to bed while she took care of him.

The next day, he clearly wasn't speaking to me. All of us got into the van after lunch and drove two hours home in near silence. An hour after he dropped us back at my mom's, he sent me a text saying that he was sorry for getting upset but that I had ruined his wedding evening and now that's all he'll ever remember.

I don't know how to feel about this situation. AITA?",0.12
AITA: Am I actually in the wrong here? I (30f) and my fiancé (30m) got into an argument bc he says I’m always making him the bad guy with my kids. Backstory he was at the store. My daughter (6f) and son (8m) were laying on the couch playing their tablets. He has a rule no tablets in the living room. The tablets don’t bother me I often let them have them out of the room when he’s not home. He had called me and said he was about to be home I casually mentioned to the kids he would be home soon. The kids then took their games to their bedrooms. He asked why I would run them off just bc he was going to be home. I told him I didn’t I just said he’d be home soon then they went to their rooms bc they had their games. Which started a huge argument bc he said that I always make him the bad guy and don’t stick with him on rules. And I said I understand the rule when he was home and watching tv but when I’m here alone it’s not a big deal. He continued to argue with me about it. I ended up saying it was a stupid rule and he was being controlling since I never even agreed with said rule in the first place. Now he mad I called him controlling. Am I the asshole here? Or is it ridiculous he wants to control what the children do when he’s not even home? ,0.5
"AITA for going out with friends instead of staying home with my gf? First time posting on Reddit.

My (32m) gf (27f) and I have been together for under a year, and we live together as of a few months ago. We get into arguments daily. She thinks it’s because of me but I’ve been in many relationships before this one, each lasting 2-3 years, this is her first real relationship.

She HATES me going anywhere at all. If I go out, I ask if she wants to go, she always says no. Then we get into an argument about if I loved her or cared about her, I wouldn’t go without her.

This specific incident is because my friends and I play Pokemon Go together. So every Wednesday we all go out in a group of 10-20 people and do raids together. We basically walk all in a group and play together.

She asked to go this time to my surprise. I was like sure, we can go together. Then at the beginning of the day I told the group she would tag along, to which they said there’s no room in their car. I told her this and she got super upset and started screaming at me. I tried to calm her down and she just kept saying don’t touch me.

We can’t take my car separately because I hate driving down these one way streets and if I had to drive, I would just stay home.

"AITA for telling my friend she isn't autistic? Throw away account - My (32F) friend whom I'll call Jaz (32F) used to always have a level head about everything until around 2020 when our other friend Mari (32F) and I started to notice changes. The 3 of us met in secondary school our first year when we were around 12-13

Jaz has ***never*** shown any signs of autism or even made mention of being autistic in all the years I have known her. Her parents, brothers, school officials, friends etc no one has noticed anything nor said to her that she could be autistic. Yet once she downloaded tiktok in 2020 and seen people who started doing these ""autism/spectrum tests"" like the ""put a finger down if..."" she has gone in to a full blown frenzy about it.

Jaz told me she had ""done her research"" on how to act autistic and was going to pay for private medical care so she would ""get the diagnosis she wanted"" and not go to her NHS GP because ""they've known me for years and won't give me the *right* meds and treatment"" This disgusted me and I didn't speak to her for a few days.

It all came to a head a few weeks ago when I had enough. Myself, Mari, Jaz, our partners and another couple went to a friends house for the weekend. Everything was great until the 2nd night when Jaz got a little tipsy and started going on and on about being autistic, how ***no-one*** understands her struggle and she feels isolated when in a group. A few of us then questioned why she'd never been tested, on meds or sought out professional advice. No answer. I then mentioned how she told me about her research and everything else she said to me, I raised my voice and said ""You aren't autistic in any way, shape or form and you need to stop acting like this""

Jaz got very quiet, walked in to the garden and stripped off. Then started yelling at the top of her lungs ""**I AM AUTISTIC! I'M ON THE SPECTRUM! FUCK YOU ALL""**

We all stood in shock and tried to get her dressed and to calm down but to no avail. Eventually it was her husband that was left with her as we all went to bed. The next morning she didn't say a word to anyone, no apologies and left. I text her to ask wtf happened and if she was alright and I get flooded with texts about how I was the one who did this to her, I was in the wrong and I shouldn't have left her. It honestly was a bunch of confusing messages that contradicted themselves. I said sorry for snapping and calling her out but that I wasn't the only one over the years questioning her and that I'd honestly had enough with the bs and tiptoeing around her. She called me an asshole and we left it at that but I wanna know am I in the wrong?",0.47

So it happened when we were on our way home from my dentist, and we had an argument.

"AITA for not coming out as gay to my father's family to protect my mom? I feel like it might be an ESH but I'd like to get some extra feedback.

Getting to the point, I came out to my mother and sister when I was a teenager, still living with my parents. My sister couldn't be bothered and was accepting. My mom didn't take it well initially, she took like a week to process and eventually came over hugged me and said she loved me. So cute, right? We didn't really talk about it for a few years as I didn't have much to report, she also did not actively ask about my love life. Eventually, I introduced my boyfriend to her and she's been very supportive and likes him a lot. I'm also out to my mom's side family.

Moving on to the dramatic part, back then I did not come out to my father because he was/is an asshole and an alcoholic. I had no business letting him know. At the time of my coming out they still were married and got a divorce shortly after me and my sister moved out to study.

I am still in touch with my father's family, including my grandma, uncles, aunts, etc. basically no contact with my father, he's a mess and basically never shows up to family events. However, since the divorce I see them less, partially because they are just kinda weird, competitive and having these passive-aggresive ways. My mom interacts with them occasionally too since they all live in the same town. However, that family has a history of just saying hurtful things whenever they saw opportunity. In short, I really go there to see my grandma and she's like the kindest person ever.

I've also lived out of the town since I turned 18, so I get to see them not more than twice a year. My mom asked me not to come out to my grandma. She's afraid my father's family will use it to say rude shit to her. On the one hand, I see where she's coming from and she's still around. On the other hand, I'm also sick of telling half truths to my grandma about my life, and being weirdly half-closeted. To play along, whenever my grandma or my father's family ask me about love life, I just come up with lies like ""I focus on career"" or ""I just don't have a long-term girlfriend"", etc. Basically saying I'm single by choice and my grandma is worried I live far away all alone, etc.

for the most part everyone on our street keeps to themselves. 
except my immediate neighbor, 
for some reason, he’s always parking directly in front of my house. 
once just to be petty i parked in same spot in front of his house and he called cops on me. obviously i didn’t get in trouble as it’s not illegal. 
once confronted by what happened he denied calling cops. 
stated he was indifferent it’s a free country and u can park anywhere u want. 
i will admit that this is true but also just out of respect if other people i don’t park in front of random people house. 

am i wrong? 
him and i have made a mutual agreement that as long as he pulls up all the way to leave room for my car and any of my guests im ok and i’d leave room for him to park. 
and i stayed true to this until his dad decided to instigate and block entire front of my house when there driveway was empty. front of their house was empty. so i nosed up as far as i could go.

"AITA for changing my mind about hosting a baby shower because i wont remove my dogs. A few months ago I (F28) offered to my best friend to host her Baby Shower.  We've known each other for 20 years.  I was her maid of honor.  She accepted.  Invitations were sent out a few weeks ago.  We are in the thick of planning it.  It is next weekend.

  
The topic of my dogs came up.  I have a lab and golden. She doesn't want them at the party.  I was like this is the dogs house too, i'm not going to take them anywhere or lock them away.  She said there are going to be a lot of people here including several young children. We've know each other forever, she knows my dogs are well behaved and great with kids.  Even if they were messed with, i trust that nothing would happen.  

  
She explains that my dogs can be a bit much, i'm like I don't know what you are talking about.  She says she is fine with them, but doesn't think in a party setting like this they will be great.  She again asked at the very least if I could keep them locked away.  I told her that she can find a new venue to host her baby shower.  She called me an asshole.

"AITA for telling my SIL she was extremely harsh by kicking my mother out of my brother's hospital room while he was critically injured?  This actually happened back in October but it's just recently flared up. My (M33) little brother Sam (M26) was very badly injured in a car crash and in a coma. It didn't look like he was going to make it the first several days and still uncertain weeks afterwards. During this time, our mother (F61) suggested to us that we should freeze his sperm so his wife Emma (F27) could get pregnant ""if the worst happens."" Everyone was disturbed by that comment, I admit it, for obvious reasons. I talked to her at the time and told her not to bring it up because it's very inappropriate to be thinking about creating future children while he was dying but she found it a perfectly legitimate concern but agreed to shut up nonetheless. Again she brought it up and asked if Emma had come to a decision about that. Emma got rightfully upset and told her to leave and not come back. I supported her then but didn't think she would keep her out for weeks (about 11 days). I told Emma then that she'd learned her lesson and that keeping her away from Sam when he could die at any moment was unthinkable to me despite whatever she'd said. She defended her decision but relented when I promised on behalf of my mom that she wouldn't bring it up again. I then made my mom promise to me that she wouldn't say anything like that again, and even though she was outraged and very hurt at Emma, she apologized to her and we thought that was over. Fast forward to now. Sam has recovered a lot but he still needs a lot of rehabilitation and has quite a few cognitive difficulties still. I thought my mom and Emma had moved past their issue but it turns out my mom is still holding on to resentment because she keeps thinking that Sam could've died without her ever saying goodbye to him because of Emma. This came out again when Emma recently confronted her about why she's been so off with her and my mom told her everything. My mom was crying that she'll never forgive her and Emma was saying she won't have to because she won't even apologize. Emma then told her that I agreed with her. I corrected her and said I agreed with her initial decision but was always clear that letting it go on for weeks was a horrible thing to do. I was definitely more forceful than I was when I'd first told her because I'd tried to be gentle with her then. Emma is distraught is because nobody is taking her side. Sam himself has come to find out about this through our sister and is upset with me because he thinks I should've tried to diffuse the fight instead of egging my mom on. I'm so conflicted because I definitely don't want to strain our family even more at this time, but if I tried, I think I could get them to see eye-to-eye because I'm generally regarded as a ""peacemaker"" in my family but if I were to do that, I'd have to be diplomatic and say stuff like ""I see both sides"" when I unequivocally dislike what Emma did.

"AITA for demanding my roommate replace $120 dollars worth of clothes after they got stolen because of him? My roommate(20M) and I are polar opposites. He's a frat boy who spends every day of every weekend out partying. I prefer my quiet and spend weekends in playing video games or reading. Last weekend his frat had a ""Golf Bros and Tennis Hoes"" party that I thought he'd be at all night but ended up coming back early with 2 girls. I was in the living room playing a game on our big TV when he busted in with two girls dressed like ""Tennis Hoes"". I assumed they'd just be in and out but he took one girl into his room with him and they were in there for quite a bit. The other girl waited out in the living room.  
This is something I was really uncomfortable with to begin with, but I get why she was there and I kinda just ignored her and focused on my game. When I got up to grab a beer out the fridge, I could tell she was shaking from cold. So I told her that if she was cold I could let her borrow a jacket or sweats or something. She asked for some and I gave them to her. I played for like another hour before it just became to weird and I went into my room.  
So I expected her to just leave the clothes before she left the room, but she apparently left with them on. So I don't even know the girls name, but I assumed my roommate would. I asked him if he knew her name. He did not. I asked him if he could text the girl he was hooking up with and get her info so I could get my clothes back. He doesn't even know the name or phone number of the girl he fucked.  
So at this point I was upset and blamed him. The clothes I lent were abercrombie essentials so they were decently expensive and very nice, I only let her borrow those because they were the only clean ones I had. If I wanted to replace it would be $120 dollars. So I told him I thought it was his fault since the girl wouldn't even had been here if he wasn't bringing random sorority girls over to bang and that he should replace the clothes that got stolen because of him.  
He said I was out of line and that I shouldn't have given the clothes to the girl in the first place if I was afraid of losing it. We've been arguing about this all week and I really feel like I'm losing my mind.

"AITA for saying that I have no sympathy for wannabe gangsters? Yesterday, I was hanging out with some friends—all of us are African American—and we were discussing  One of the guys, who I’ll call Caden, brought up the fact that a student of the school we all attend had recently passed in a shootout between rival gangs. Caden happened to be friends with the student that had passed, and went on a tangent about how the gang that killed him were “pussies” and that he might as well “strap up and show them a thing or two.” 

I facepalmed and said that this is why our people keep dying, because so many of us want to be gangsters. I said that I completely understood why someone who grew up around that stuff would resort to that lifestyle, but someone from a privileged background like us? With so much going for them? Trying to be “gangster” for no fucking reason? They’re literally CHOOSING to run the risk of getting killed. I then asked why I should have sympathy for wannabe hoodlums if they’re stupid enough to throw their lives away for arbitrary street cred.

He then got pissy about it and called me anti-black. I went onto say that I’m not anti-black, just anti-hoodlum. Am I the asshole?",0.5
"AITA for teaching my little brother a harsh but necessary lesson? Ok so I think i need an outside perspective because i might have been too harsh, and to my surprise the family is divided.

Some background: Most of my siblings(m31, f30, f22) and I(m28) grew up “poor”. Our parents, especially dad worked his ass off to provide for us, but as kids we never really had much. Personally I remember Only getting 1 toy on my birthday and on Christmas.

Well that was until about 20 years ago when my dad opened his own buisness. Things started getting a bit better but it still wasn’t sunshine and rainbows at first.

17 years ago my youngest brother ‘Eric’ was born. By the time he was a kid who could ask for toys dad’s business was actually doing pretty well, it wouldn’t be crazy to call him rich, and i guess because they could now afford it our parents started spoiling Eric, to make up for what they couldn’t give us. 

They also supported us as much as they could tho, so we’re forever greatful.

And I’ll admit we siblings are at fault here too. We’ve all been close and he’s the runt of the litter and the cutest, we’ve spoiled him too.

Well that was until this week. For the past couple of months Eric has been dabbling with the vile ideas of communism. I’ve tried talking to him about it, but he won’t engage, he just sends me videos by youtubers like Hakim, Second Thought, Hasan. 

We were all ready to just dismiss it as a phase and ignore it I guess but what happened at the Easter reunion last week crossed my line.
Dad wanted to tell us he recently fired one his oldest employee, and before he could even explain himself, Eric blew up.

He went on and on about how capitalism exploits the worker, how it’s evil to fire someone before easter, and worst of all he told dad to his face that he doesn’t understand what it’s like to do real work a day in his life because he is a “capitalist robber baron”.

This blew my fuse, dad was hospitalized several times from overwork, most recently when he started his business from the ground up. But I didn’t react in that moment.

Instead, Eric keeps his Funko Pop collection (~€5000) at my house. So when I went home, I took it, spent a week selling it, and donating the proceeds to a homeless shelter nearby. I also talked to a friend of mine and he’s willing to offer Eric a part time job.

So today when Eric visited, he asked where his collection is. 

I told him, i sold it because it’s an unnecessary consumerist vehicle to extract wealth from the people to huge corporations, and I donated the money to a homeless shelter. 

I also told him I got him a part time job so he’ll actually learn what work is and how taxes work.

Finally I told him, if he refuses the job, I’m donating our entire Lego Collection.

Needless to say he reacted as expected, broke down in anger, really disappointed. 

My wife says i went to far and Mom the rest of the family is livid with anger. Dad hasn’t said anything. My siblings agree with me, that it’s about time he stops being pampered if he’s going to act like this.",0.98
"AITA for not letting my sister borrow my face wash? My (21 F) sister (25 F) is visiting right now, where I live with my brother and my dad. Every time she comes down we end up having an argument, and most of the time I end up feeling like I was not listened to and my feelings were ignored. I should also mention that very often she has trouble taking no for an answer, and I end up doing things I'd rather not to try to make her happy. Just little things like watching a movie I'd rather not, but it's very hard to mutually agree on something. This has been a consistent thing, and while I understand she does not visit very often (she lives in another state- it is about an hour plane ride), and she wants to have a good time with me and the rest of our family, I try to voice when I am upset at something she does in a mature way, but each time she ends up acting like I am starting a huge argument and she ends up not talking to me for a while afterwards. 

The other night, she asked if she could use my face wash since she didn't bring her own. Earlier in the day when she first asked to use it, I explained that I didn't want her to use the one I use each day, because it's more on the expensive side. I had an extra one I never used, but she refused to use it and asked to use a different one (yes, I do have three, admittedly) which is also a bit more expensive. I agreed and let her. Later on when she wanted to use it at night though, I again told her that it's a bit pricey and I asked if I could put it in her hand, so she didn't end up using a lot of it. She refused, curtly said ""forget it"" and then went into the bathroom. This was the hall bathroom, and she has one in the guest room she is using, so I asked why she wanted to use that one. She said she just wanted to brush her teeth, because she did have her toothbrush in there since she didn't bring her own toothpaste. It honestly seemed like she was going to use my face wash behind my back, so I told her I was going to take it out before she shut the door. She immediately got angry, told me to get out, and shut the door. We didn't talk for the rest for the night. This morning she acted normal and as if nothing had happened, we agreed to go do something together, but I felt uncomfortable about last night and how hostile she had been. I didn't feel like sitting down and talking about it would go well, because I know she would just want to drop it. I explained that I felt like she threw a tantrum the other night and I felt I deserved an apology. She immediately got mad again, said every time she visits I get angry at her, and told me to stop talking to her. At this point I was getting very upset and trying to explain myself, but she continued to talk over me and tell me to stop talking to her. It turned into a screaming match and she went and complained about me to my brother, which I could hear since she was in the room next to me. Now we are not talking and I'm sitting here feeling like I was not listened to again.

"AITA for being put into a situation I wasn't comfortable in at a restaurant  AITA
I went to tgi Fridays for the first time with a group of new colleagues who have been before.

As we walked in we saw a big commotion for someone's birthday and I glad it wasn't me. My colleagues on the other hand were excited at the prospect of free cake and decided that they were going to pretend that it was their birthdays.

When we were seated and the waitress had our orders she asked if I was anyone's birthday 4 out of 6 from my group said yes them the waitress asked if it was my birthday I told her no but my colleagues interjected saying yes and I reassured her it wasn't and I didn't want to be part of it my colleagues shenanigans.

Through out the meal they handed out balloon hats for those who said it was their birthdays the waitress put one on my head I took it off and repeat it's not my birthday and I didn't want to take part. Again she tried to put a hat on me and I firmly refused.

After this I spoke with my colleagues and they were fine with me not being part of their fun and for me to disappear outside when it was time for the song and cake.
That time came shortly after we had finished eating one of my colleagues saw them approaching and let me know so I had sufficient time to leave I left and went outside for some fresh air whilst they had their fun and cake after a few minutes I went back inside and thought it was all over, it wasn't
Shortly after I arrived back at my table a group of waiters and waitresses gathered round our table with a slice of cake all looking at me. Realising what was about to happen I jumped up and went to leave, at this point a couple of waiters/waitress grabbed hold of me trying to keep me there I had to push through them to escape and then had them chase after me outside with someone shouting ""he stole he stole""
I managed to put some distance between myself and them and escaped round the corner and was able to calm down a bit
After the staff members dispersed inside one of my colleagues came to find me to make sure I was ok

When I got home I emailed tgi Fridays about my experience and I received a response within 12hr
I had a phone call from the restaurant's manager apologizing for my bad experience but also blaming me for the whole thing explaining that I should have known what to expect from a tgi Fridays and my colleagues were also at fault for their enthusiasm for the birthday fun and that they have had complaints in the past from people saying it's not their birthday and then getting upset when they didn't receive any special treatment.

I am angry that I wasn't listened to and I was forced into a situation I wasn't comfortable being in.


At this point I have no idea what to do I want to just forget about the whole thing and move on but I can't I am still angry after 24hrs 
My colleagues are on the fence some agree that I have the right to be upset about it others think I should have known what to expect from a visit to tgi Friday

"AITA for wanting my wife’s mother gone? 
Hey guys so just want a little input on if I’m an asshole or not. I (25m) and my wife (24f) are in a pretty shitty situation and I can’t stand much more of it. When I met my wife she lived 2 hours away from me with her mom and 1 year old son. My wife’s mom constantly complained about how her job was ruining her life and she hated it and whatnot so my wife offered her to quit and allow my wife to support her by paying all household bills and in return she watch my wife’s son. Her mother happily agreed to this and about a year later I came into the picture with a 1 year old little girl of my own. We both have full custody of our children, her sons father abandoned them and my daughters mother is a drug addict who happily walked away after accumulating some backed child support. After dating for a while my wife ended up pregnant and the decision was made that my wife would move in with my daughter and I. After having the baby and only seeing her mother a handful of times she asked to come stay with us for a little while to spend more time with the kids. During this time she was a little aggravating with an attitude over silly things but altogether tolerable and her help was pretty great stuff like riding a ride at Disney with my wife suddenly became possible! Then 2 weeks before our wedding she came to my wife and I and said without my wife and the kids she’s dying inside and has nothing and nobody. She never leaves the house (refuses to learn to drive) and depends on her friends for everything which is terrible because they too are in their 70’s and have problems with various things and are pretty unreliable. She begs us to move in with us, which wouldn’t have worked in a 3 bedroom house. She then pitches selling her house and using the proceeds and our savings to buy a bigger house and offered to watch our kids while we work Monday to Friday. After talking with my wife I solemnly agreed. Big mistake. After moving in her mother very quickly showed her true side within 3 months she is constantly losing her mind over anything, freaking out, second guessing our parenting, and very clearly treating her “biological” grandchildren (my wife was adopted as a baby, she calls our son and baby her biological grandchildren despite having 0 blood relation) differently than my daughter. My wife has tried talking with her and addressing multiple occasions of these incidents to which she pouts like a child and storms off. The latest incident was her reading my wife and I’s messages and lashing out because i said over text that she was wrong about something minor. I’ve sat in silence and just let it bottle up and can’t take much more. This woman is a miserable, awful, selfish, needy 70 year old bully and I want her out of my life. AITA for despising this disgusting woman after she helped us buy a house and wanting her gone?",0.17
"AITA for warning people about Happy Horseshit Ranch I (25F) have been estranged from my father since I went to college at 18. Long story short he was abusive to me and my mom and sisters growing up. I’ve been diagnosed with CPTSD because of it.

He remarried when I was 16 (I found out on Facebook, despite us not being estranged) and moved to my step-mom’s (“June”) family farm in a rural ass part of the state. It’s been in her family for generations and they raise horses.

June is very similar to him. She had a tough upbringing and completely endorses how he raised us (even talking about it as a joke in front of my friends).

Anyway, my youngest sister tells me that June and my dad are opening an equine therapy center on their farm for “at risk youth” and people with PTSD. I couldn’t help but think this was not only hypocritical but dangerous—based on how my dad thinks he did nothing wrong and could invalidate the kids’ experiences.

I called the state to find out if I could report him, and found out that they’ve filed the therapy center as “faith-based” so they need no permit and there’s basically no regulations on what they can do.

So I made a public Facebook post. I said that my dad had abused my whole family for years, lied about why we’re estranged, and is now opening this happy horseshit ranch. I advised people not go.

June texted me asking me to take it down. She said this was her dream and I was ruining it and he was barely a part of it. I asked if he’d be conducting the “therapy” and she said well yes. So I said no, it stays.

She lost her absolutely shit. My step sister started posting that my dad’s a “good Christian man” and I’m an ungrateful selfish money-grubbing asshole. June started saying I deserved everything he did in very explicit language. So I took screenshots of what she texted me and added it to my post.

People who weren’t them responded well to my post and some even said thank you for the warning, particularly the screenshots. I feel justified in sharing my story but part of me wonders if I am truly crushing June’s lifelong dream for something mostly about her husband. I also didn’t specify the type of abuse, which they said makes people think “it was worse than it was.” AITA?",0.33
"AITA for texting my mom's boyfriend that she was upset? My (19M) parents divorced 6 years ago and I have 4 younger siblings (9-15). My dad is a POS and my younger siblings are terrified of him and he was awful to my mom.

Despite all of this, my dad has visitation rights to my younger siblings and essentially forces them to see him every now and then.

One of these visitations happened recently. My youngest brother was literally crying when our dad came to pick him up. Afterwards my mom was very upset and crying too. I was trying to comfort her but I was really struggling too.

About an hour after my siblings left, I texted my mom's boyfriend (of 2.5 years) and told him what had happened and that my mom was very upset and asked him to call or visit. 

He turned up about 30 minutes later and was actually able to comfort my mom. However, later that evening, after at some point finding out I had texted, she told me she wasn't happy that I had texted her boyfriend. I told her my reasoning but she said it's her choice what to share about our private family matters. Was I the asshole here? ",0.15
"AITA for telling my friend her attitude at work towards her wife is unprofessional? I (35F) am an RN. I have been quite good friends with one of the attendings in our ward for a long while now. I will refer to her as Victoria (37F) who is a pediatric cardiologist.

Victoria is married to Charlotte (38F) who is a plastic surgeon. And they have two kids who are 12 and 10 years old. Charlotte used to work in a different hospital on the other side of town, but took a job at our hospital recently. She never really comes down to our ward. 

The other day, while Victoria was done with her rounds, Charlotte came for a consult. She was clearly overly happy to see Victoria, and after seeing her patient, went on to sit down and talk to her. From an outsider perspective, they were sitting pretty close, talking with faces in real close proximity, holding hands, and Charlotte kind of gave a small hug before leaving for another consult.

I told Victoria after Charlotte left that it was lovely in my opinion but others may find the way they interacted a bit unprofessional. She was confused and asked me why. I explained that there were other people around and that they should have kept a professional distance at work. 

Victoria said she had done nothing inappropriate and told me it was crazy for me to expect her to not be happy when she randomly saw her wife at work like this for maybe the first time in many years. She has been mostly normal but kind of distant with me about this whole thing. Did I overstep?

"AITA for not wanting to be in my friends wedding party So I (29f) am going to be a co- matron of honor at my best friends (28f) wedding. This is a friend that I have had for 20+ years.

 During December I ordered the specific dress she wanted as the bridesmaids dresses. She specifically measured me since this was a made to order dress. This is an Indian wedding so the dress is coming from India to the US. The dress skirt ended up falling at a weird place and so I had to reorder the dress, which  I did in late February.

During the time that I'm waiting for this 2nd dress, my friend had texted me asking to know if the dress arrived. When I told her it hadn't, she proceeded to text me about how I may not care about her wedding and that I should have ordered this dress earlier. This text was a few days before the bridal shower that I had planned for her. I felt really offended with her saying that I didn't care about her wedding after the time and energy I put into planning the bridal shower and decorating the venue. But I just let it go cause wedding planning is stressful.

 However, the dress took quite a while to arrive and Fed Ex delivered it to the wrong address and they were not able to recieve it back. So I went ahead and ordered this dress a 3rd time. I haven't recieved it yet but it should be coming since the company shipped it. After letting her know that my dress is arriving late, she basically told me that either I wear the dress that is too short on me or I'm not in the wedding party if the dress doesn't come on time. 

Now I'm really rethinking even being a co- MATRON OF HONOR since she was so quick to tell me that I wouldn't be included in her wedding party. Not to mention that this was all through text. She didn't even tell me on the phone or in person. 

Like I said the dress should be coming and it'll definitely come before the wedding but Am I the asshole for not wanting to be in my friends wedding party after she said that to me? ",0.4
"WIBTA if I let my coworker get fired?  I’m new here so I apologize if I break post etiquette! 

For context: My coworker and I both work in retail management. We are in parallel positions. We are paid hourly. 

A few days ago I was running shift with my co-manager (CM) when they asked if I minded taking care of things by myself for a bit while they ran out to handle a personal matter. I told them I didn’t mind and they were gone for probably about an hour. (I did not keep track of what time they came and went.) They came back and we ran the rest of the shift no problem. 
Now, we are not allowed to edit our own time cards. As a personal practice, I do not touch other manager’s time cards if they are parallel or above me in the chain of command unless specifically asked. I realized CM did not ask me to edit their time card, I called our boss (GM) who was working at the time and asked them to follow up with CM and get their time card corrected since I would not see them again for the rest of the work week. I knew they wouldn’t be able to edit their own card and they were off the rest of the week so someone was going to have to reach out to correct it. 
Today, GM asked me to write down what happened in a formal statement. In my experience, this means someone is about to get fired. I looked at CM’s time card and it still had not been corrected. I believe our boss is about to fire CM for time theft. 
WIBTA if I say nothing to CM? I could remind them that they need to request a time edit since they left, but I feel wrong getting involved. We have a few more days to correct the issue before payroll processes and they have officially committed time theft. I am kind of torn on how involved I should get. Any advice is appreciated! ",0.85
"AITA for arguing with my dad over food? I'm living with my parents. We all haven't had dinner so I texted on the family group chat what to get. We decided on a place and my dad decided to order. He said ""All right sounds good."" He didn't ask anyone for their order and went ahead and order for himself.
I was somewhat irritated but I decided to go and ask him to place my order that I wanted. He said just try a bit of what he got. I told him I would rather have my own and asked again. He said no. I asked why and he just said he already ordered and laughed about it.

That's when I got mad and said that it's fucking rude that he can't just add my order after I asked him. He has a big thing about language and got mad that I said that. He (ironically) called me an ass. I wasn't focusing on apologizing for my language because I felt to need to defend and justity why I was so infuriated that he couldn't just simply place an order. We argued over text and he said somehow it wasn't his fault.

"AITA for not wanting someone to sleep in my bed? I (19M) am currently living in a mobile home with my mum (53F) and stepdad (56M) usually we all get along rather well but something happened that’s really rubbed me the wrong way. 

In this mobile home, they sleep in the master bedroom, we use the room with the small beds for storage and i sleep on the pull out bed in the living room. Tonight two of their friends who I really like came over. My mum and stepdad both kept suggesting that, if they wanted, the friends could spend the night and sleep in the bed I usually do. The first time I laughed it off like everyone else but by the 5th time it felt less like a joke and more serious. It really hurt my feelings, I’ve been used to feeling sort of passed off and unwanted ever since my parents split up and I had to go back and forth every week. Both my mum and stepdad are aware of this. 

After their friends left, I asked them both to please never do that to me again. They immediately both got defensive and said that it was obviously a joke, making me feel like I was overreacting. I’m hurt not just because they made me feel like I could just be pushed aside, but also that my feelings could be too, especially given that they both have been encouraging me for years to express my feelings more, be they negative or positive. They’re both acting like I’ve spoiled the night. AITA? 

(Also in case anybody was interested, the mobile home isn’t our permanent residence, just temporary while our house is being renovated. I am able to go to my Dad’s house we are still in close contact, but his wife constantly goes out of her way to make me feel like I’m hugely inconveniencing her whenever I’m there so I don’t exactly feel it’s a safe space to be either.)",0.08
"AITA for sending my parents a picture of the Biblical Rebeccah every time they try to get in touch with me? I'm a 19 year old woman currently in college. I come from a churchy family, and there was a big fight two years ago when I decided to get a septum piercing and a nose ring. My parents thought it was trashy and whore-ish, and that only awful people get piercings like that and display them for everyone.   


I'm not really religious, but I've read a lot of the Bible, and in one of the fights I pointed out that the Biblical Matriarch Rebeccah, the wife of Isaac, wore a nose ring. (Strictly speaking, it's not 100% textually clear that she did; but when Eliezer gives her one and some bracelets in Genesis 24:22, and a few verses later  her brother notices her with the jewelry, and the bracelets are explicitly being worn, I think the reading is much more natural that she just put the jewelry on) And if they're really all about me being godly and following the teachings of the Bible, there shouldn't be any problems with me having a nose ring.  


That did not persuade them, and things have been a bit chilly since then, although the distance when I went off to university has helped some. Still, my folks have reached out on several occasions, once every other month or so, and most of the time, I'll respond, but usually send back pictures of some sort of image of Rebeccah in an icon or something. I have not come home in person since I went off to study.  


This morning, my uncle called up. I've gotten along better with him than most of my family, and he asked when I was going to stop being 'childish'. And that while I have every right to keep my distance from my family, I should either say I don't want to have much contact and stick to it, or push for a reconciliation. And that sending passive-aggressive and catty pictures like this was just stirring up trouble for no actual benefit, and that I should stop. I have a lot of respect for my uncle's opinions, and maybe I shouldn't keep this going.

"AITA for leaving a tube of lip gloss in my male friend’s car? So about 9 months ago, I (25F) moved to a new city and quickly befriended John (21M). He’s struggled with alcoholism and depression and has just had general bad luck with relationships in the past. Therefore, I was extremely happy for him when he told me that was started a serious relationship with Rachel (18F) about 1 month ago.

Due to the new relationship, John and I acknowledged how awkward the whole male-female friendship thing can be, so we quickly established some boundaries. We stopped hanging out one on one, but we agreed that group hang out would be fine. We have also continued to text and call. I also invited Rachel and John to hang out with me and my friends together multiple times, but they always had other plans so I never got to actually meet Rachel.

Two weeks ago, I asked John if he would be willing to drive my roommates and I to the airport for a vacation, since John is one of the few people in our friend group that owns a car. John agreed and he happily dropped us off. Once again, I was never alone in the car with John, my two roommates were there the whole time as well. 

Today I get an angry call from John asking me if I left my lip gloss in his car. I suddenly realized that I must have dropped it or it must have rolled out of my bag on our way to the airport. I profusely apologized and told him that yeah it was probably mine. He then angrily accused me of leaving it there on purpose to sabotage his new relationship.

I quickly tried to apologize and reiterate that it was an honest mistake. I also pointed out to him that he knows I have ADHD and he’s seen me leave things behind at bars and restaurants multiple times before. I even offered to apologize to Rachel and to try to explain it to her. He refused to accept any explanations and told me that he no longer wants to talk to me.

I’m completely gutted that I might’ve just lost a close friend over a freaking tube of lip gloss. I can understand why he might be angry. But it was genuinely an honest mistake and I have no way of proving that to him.

So how should I proceed?? I’m giving him space for now, and it doesn’t seem like he’s blocked me. But I don’t think I’ll ever forgive myself if this little moment of stupidity on my end completely ruins one of the closest friendships I’ve had in my new city.

"WIBTA if I didn’t tell my boyfriend when our baby starts sleeping through the night so he can sleep in our room/bed again.  My boyfriend (Daniel 31) and I (Sarah 31) had our first baby together a few weeks ago. Our baby will be sleeping in mine and Daniel’s room for at least the first year. On the second day of being home with our newborn Daniel decided he was going to sleep in the living room so he could get a full nights sleep, being that he works 6 days a week and I am currently a SAHM. 

I understood the reasoning and we decided once the baby was sleeping longer stretches, at least 5 hours straight, that Daniel would then come back to sleeping in our room.

 Now Daniel is a great partner, and does a lot of other things. I have kids from a previous marriage (so our baby is his first), but he gets them up, fed and taken to school every morning for me while I take care of the baby, Daniel does his own laundry and cleans up after himself.

 That being said I still can’t help that it hurt my feelings when he wanted to sleep in the living room. I also assumed when he moved to the living room that he would sleep in our room on his days off. I apparently shouldn’t assume because he’s not, and tonight (he’s off tomorrow) I even suggested he try and sleep in our bed tonight because he had said he missed our bed earlier that day but then basically laughed at that idea. Then later I asked if he would lay with me for a bit before he goes to bed on the couch. He did but it lasted a whole 5 minutes before he left for the couch.

I may just be emotional from having a baby not too long ago but this killed me emotionally. SO WIBTA if I decided not to tell Daniel when the baby starts sleeping longer stretches to see when and if he try’s to come back to our room?

I told her that not everything could be baked and she kept on insisting that it could because it could be put in an oven and cooked. I told her that it wouldn’t be baking and she kept on insisting it could because if she wanted she could “put a computer into an oven and bake it”.

"AITA for not wanting to invite my brother and his family to my wedding over comments they’ve made? I (25M) am getting married to my fiance (30M) this coming August. Since I’m not close with my brother and neither of us have many male friends, we both opted to have groomswoman instead of the traditional groomsmen. At our engagement party, we both presented our wedding party with “Groomswomen Boxes” with pjs, candles, champagne glasses ect. 

2 weeks ago I asked my brother (33M) and my sister if they’re daughters would be flower girls, my sister was overjoyed and said yes but my brother however said no.

When talking about August, my sister in law referred to my wedding as “little” and “impromptu” even thought we’ve been planning it for over a year and it’s out quite a nice venue.

"AITA for telling my dad to f**k off? This is posted anonymously because I'm terrified of my father.

I (21 M) have had a rocky relationship with my father (40 M) for almost all of my life. I've been diagnosed with PTSD due to some stuff in my teen year's and he struggles with interpersonal stuff since he's autistic.

Both of us have wanted to have a good relationship, so we have this weekly call. Some weeks are great, and we can talk for over an hour about video games or movies or other interests we have. Other weeks no matter how hard I try to have a conversation with him it feels like he refuses to engage. It's been so bad that I'll tell him I've had medical appointments (I have several chronic health conditions) and he will forget my diagnoses, test results, etc. I don't expect him to know everything about my health but I genuinely don't think he believes the doctors. It got to the point where I had over 3000 dollars of medical debt and he didn't even realize. Keep in mind, he provides my health insurance and hears every time I have an appointment or test or whatever. I told him that it was upsetting that he seemed unwilling to help with my medical costs and was apathetic to my health struggles, to which he responded that he 1) had no parental obligations to me now that I'm 18, and 2) I never asked for the money. Despite the fact I routinely said I needed help paying medical bills, but because I didn't ask for his assistance explicitly it didn't count? He did help pay, so maybe that was just the autism.

He brought up that he was told our weekly calls have felt impersonal or hurtful. I said yes, I do feel hurt by how unengaged my father is in those calls. He proceeded to tell me that I shouldn't feel that way because I'm reading into the tone of his voice too much. I told him it wasn't the tone of voice that I took issue with, more than on those bad calls no matter how much I try to engage with him he feels like he wants nothing to do with me. A lot of debating about phrasing and him saying it's not fair to place such an expectation on him, I deliberately asked him for validation. We've been in family therapy, and one primary topic of that therapy for us specifically was the necessity for validation. He often times gets defensive in a way that can feel incredibly hurtful and invalidating, and we were told to ask for validation if it felt too hostile. He said he didn't have to give me validation and that validation isn't necessary if you don't agree. I told him that's explicitly not what validation is (validation isn't approval yadda yadda) he said I was being a dick and that my emotions are not his responsibility. I told him if it's not his responsibility then this relationship was not my responsibility and he could fuck off. Now I'm panicking because I'm afraid he is going to remove my health insurance which would jeopardize my health. Am I the asshole?",0.21
"AITA for swearing around kids? So! Me (30F) and three friends (all around same age) went to a hockey game. Star Wars night, so more kids than normal for sure. Three periods go by, like, legit 2 minutes left in the LAST period. The dude in front of us flips around and starts telling us off for dropping the F bomb repeatedly in front of his kid. He can’t believe after three years of being a season ticket holder he would have to tell anyone to not swear around children. He also kept turning around to keep angrily adding on to his list, but at this point I just held my tongue because really, I just wanted to tell him to F off. Mostly, my biggest gripe was he went that long without saying anything, and then exploded. He very easily could’ve turned around first period and been like ‘hey could you tone down the language around my kids’, and we all could have proceeded accordingly and in good spirits on both sides. Honestly when he first flipped around angrily, the first thing out of my husband’s mouth was sorry and the guy was right. I was proud of him. We didn’t swear for the remainder of the game, obviously, but none of us were raised to think of swears as anything besides words. My mom always said if I’m going to replace a bad word with another word, it’s still swearing. 

I’d like to add that throughout the game, they were laughing, joking, taking pictures. Never at any point did I see any indication that they were even bothered (like no one ever turned around and gave us a look). But also, it’s just swearing? It’s not something you can really shield your kids from, especially at a hockey game. Still, had the issue been brought up right away, I certainly would’ve obliged. Or at least tried. Personally I like getting along with the people around me, it could’ve easily been a fun game of coming up with funny words or something else together. Why wait til there’s three minutes left of the game and then explode? 

How do you guys feel about swearing around kids? I definitely can’t change how I act or talk if I don’t know it’s even a problem. ",0.15
AITA for not wanting to wait hours for my friends So tonight me and my friends planned on hanging out at 8:30pm and everyone agreed. I showed up at 9 and soon found out the one of my friends wasn’t coming until 12 and the other 10:45. Me and my other friend sat around his house for an hour doing absolutely nothing and when I tried to give ideas he just ignored them so I left. Now they are saying I’m impatient and trying to make me the bad guy when I just don’t want to wait 3-4 hours to do something.,0.08
"AITA for not wanting to pay for my sisters wig after I called her a bald headed broke bitch? My (17M) sister (18F) decided to get a pixie cut. She had for about 2 weeks now and now she hates it. She came to me and told me that it's embarrassing my hair is longer than hers and she wants me to shave my head. I told her that I would not shave my head and that if she doesn't like how her hair is she should just get a wig instead.

 She told me that she doesn't have money to buy a wig and so I told her to ask our parents to get her one and she told me that she wasn't gonna do that because they were the ones who advised her not to cut her hair in the first place and it'll be embarrassing to admit that they were right.

She then again asked me to cut my hair and I told her no. She then got mad at me and told me that no man actually cared about their hair and if I wanted to be a girl so bad I should just say that instead. This pissed me off so I told her that it wasn't my fault she was a bald headed broke bitch and if she wanted to get a wig she should just get a job instead.  

She was not happy when I called her bald headed and went to go tell our parents. Our parents got mad at both of us for arguing and then after they got done yelling at us my dad told me that he wants me to pay for my sisters wig.

He told me that I had to pay for her wig because what I said to her was disrespectful. He said what she said was wrong but what I said was worse. I told him that I only said that because she kept antagonizing me. He kept insisting that me paying for the wig was gonna be my punishment and he'll think of something for her. I told him that I've been saving MY money since I started working and I wasn't gonna spend any of it on her. 

I told my dad that if takes money out of my account that I wasn't gonna speak to him until he puts everything back. Because knowing my sister she's probably gonna try and pick the most expensive one. My parents are upset with me because they said I'm trying to run away from accountability and that they find it unreasonable that I would try and punish them for that? I don't see why they can't pay for it themselves. ",0.2
"AITA for chastising my brother after he spread rumors at my wedding At my wedding reception, my husband and I went around to the tables thanking everyone for coming. As we're thanking my sister, she tells me she's pregnant. She added that she had ""only"" found out a week ago and was waiting for the right moment to tell me. I was annoyed at this point, but I again congratulated her.   
  
After the speeches were given, my MOA whispers to me that my brother was apparently going around telling people about my sister's pregnancy. He didn't leave the bridal party's table until he got them to agree that it was trashy.

As people got intoxicated and headed to the dance floor, we started hearing people gossip about my sister's pregnancy with many of them saying they heard it from my brother. My sister hears some gossip and makes a formal announcement. I wasn't too mad, but my husband's family were absolutely furious. My brother didn't help things either, because after that he just went straight to trashing her and our family.  
  
After our honeymoon, we find out that my husband's family has been making comments to my parents about my sister's announcement. Thanks to my mother, a great deal of my family is upset that my sister is getting trashed. Thanks to my brother, friends are getting involved too. It's mostly just a hot topic, but some are taking it very seriously and either supporting my sister or verbally trashing her.  
  
Later, my family had a celebratory dinner at my parent's house. At the dinner, I pulled my brother aside to another room so I could talk with him. I told him to stop talking trash about our family and our sister because it was causing issues with my husband's family and making my friends think bad of our family. He apologized and then told me that he was just telling the truth. We talked in circles for a bit and I started yelling at him while he sat calmly and used the same tone of voice, which made me angrier. Our family interrupted and separated us and asked us what we were talking about and my brother said our sister's pregnancy. This immediately caused my sister to accuse me of being selfish and not letting her celebrate her pregnancy. I tried to explain that I wasn't that mad at her but I kept getting talked over by her and my parents. My brother just started laughing. That ended the dinner for the night. I tried to contact my sister, but found that she had blocked my number and my husband's.   
  
At lunch with friends days later, they said my sister told them that I tried to ostracize my brother from the family over her announcement. They knew the truth and told her but she said they had been lied to. I explained the altercation with my brother, but they thought I had gone too far and was creating more issues. Two of them even agreed with what my brother had done. I got so frustrated I walked out of that lunch. The two texted me after apologizing, but another in the group said I got too emotional and shouldn't have taken what was said personally. I am now a day removed, still frustrated.

"AITA for making a joke that led to losing a daycare client? My wife and I have been running and in-home daycare for the last 5 years. Over the last year or so we have become pretty close with a number of daycare families. These are people who we now consider to be our friends.

&#x200B;

One of these families is expecting a second child and so the women of our group took it upon themselves to start planning a baby shower. It was then suggested by daycare mom Matilda that the shower be held in our home since her home is 30 minutes away from town. We accepted and moved forward with planning.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to the day of the shower. My wife and I sat down at a table with Matilda's husband and another couple. While this is happening my wife is holding Matilda's 11 month old and the other woman is holding Matilda's 3 year old. The conversation shifts to the baby, who has both of his hands wrapped in medical wrap. The couple ask Matilda's husband why his hands are wrapped. Well, as my wife and I already know and he explains, the baby touched a pellet stove at their home and burnt both of his palms (3rd degree burn). My wife very obviously jokingly said “It’s bad parenting really” while he was explaining. To which the other woman responded by reminding herself that Matilda's oldest (5 year old) had also burnt his hand when he was small.

&#x200B;

The rest of the shower goes without a hitch. We clean up, everyone leaves.  
About 30 minutes later, my wife received a text from Matilda saying…  


  
Hey (Wife’s name). I’m a little hurt today to come home and having heard that you’d made a comment to some people and said that “It’s because of bad parenting” that (baby) got hurt. And it was repeated a few times. Even under the guise of joking, I don’t feel like this was an acceptable or kind thing to say.  We have barricades up in the house all the time to prevent him from getting to the fireplace. This was an unfortunate awful accident in which multiple people were over for the holiday and the baby gate got moved. We are INCREDIBLE parents and didn’t deserve that.

&#x200B;

My wife and I were both very surprised at her text and in the moment we both felt everything was blown out of proportion and my wife did her best to explain what had happened and also hold her composure. Collectively, we both decided her joke was in poor taste but we both also still felt that Matilda’s texts were uncalled for after such a long time having known each other, but also having just offered up our home. But are still aware that the joke was in fact in poor taste. The whole thing escalated very quickly and in the end Matilda decided to remove her family from our care effective immediately after 5 years of watching over her children.   


We have cared for a total of 23 families over the last 5 years and are saddened as this is the first time a family has chosen to leave our care...

"AITA for not paying $76 for a bbq I was invited to?  My old neighbor (we used to live in the same apt but I have since moved to a different one and the same town) me over for an egg hunt and bbq on Easter. I said sure, we'll come - my 7 year old daughter & myself. 

Well two nights before the bbq she texts me saying I owe her $60. I responded ""Huh, for what!?"" She called me and said I need to put in for my portion of the bbq. I was confused but said well ok I suppose. And, then mentioned how we would like to have sausages. She then texts me a few hours later and then says I owe $76. Confused even more, I ask why and tell her I need to see what all she's purchasing. 

Mind you, it's the two of us, her, her bf & her 7 year old kid and then 4 grown adults from her family. She shows me a cart worth $228 and tells me I need to pay 1/3rd. She did add the sausages I requested (which were $3.99), but everything else, including the liquor was stuff my daughter & I don't eat/drink. She also has things like hand soap and aluminum foil in the cart. Why would I pay for that!?

After much back & forth, I refuse to pay. She tells me ok, and tells me if I want to eat I can bring my own food and her bf will cook it. I do so, and bf is so mad the day of that I didn't pay. I get there with my sausages and ask him if he can put it on the grill (he's still grilling at the time). He tells me no & to go f myself.

Now this neighbor & I used to host bbq together when we lived at the same complex. We would split the costs, I would be involved in all the planning, grilling, etc. We would never charge the guests (who were casual associates through the kids). She claims all she was doing for this bbq was providing the venue & that she ""knows"" me so I should've willingly paid.

I feel like I'm NTA, but she text me basically telling I was wrong for not paying and asking her bf to grill my sausages. Am I? ",0.13
"AITA for not supporting my gf's habits The conflict between my girlfriend(21F) and me(20M) stems from our differing views on substance use and socializing. Growing up, my parents instilled in me the values of abstaining from smoking, drugs, and excessive drinking. Conversely, my girlfriend's upbringing was more liberal, allowing her to explore these aspects freely. Despite our differences, we love eachother and we have been together for 2 years.

However, since my girlfriend moved away for university, her lifestyle has evolved. She now frequents goes to bars, clubs, and parties with friends, indulging in smoking, drinking, and few times even weed. While I respect her adult college lifestyle, her actions concern me, considering her health issues. Moreover, her occasional intoxication interferes with our plans, such as when she canceled our study session to attend a party, leaving me to fend for myself during a stressful time.

During a recent call, I expressed my frustration with her behavior, which led to a heated exchange. She felt hurt by my lack of support and interest in her enjoyment, while I felt neglected and overshadowed by her social life. Despite attempting to reconcile our differences, there remains an underlying tension in our relationship. 

Recently, we made a plan to be on facetime while i study at late hours and she would just give me company. I get very stressed during my college semesters and i usually need her to be my support system. That night i tried to reach out to her and when i called her she said that she is in a party. I asked her ""but what about our plan?"" She replied that she will facetime me when she comes back and till that time i should study alone. When she came back and called me she was obviously drunk or high and she couldn't really help my situation. I needed her to be sober, sane, and support me while i would study. Instead she started talking about what fun things happened at the party. I already had pressure of my exams going. Lets just say my reaction to her storytelling wasn't very supportive and nice. I acted cold and barely showed interest in her stories and smiled blankly ar times. She noticed it and asked me what's wrong. I told her how her behaviour made me upset but in response she got offended and asked me why i couldn't support her and be happy for her for having fun and show some interest and instead of making her feel guilty by how much i depend on her for my sanity, how i always expect her to be there for me, for going out drinking and having a personal life other than our relationship. 

We hungup the call. Yesterday we tried to make things clear between us but there's still a lingering bitterness in our relationship since that night. I don't know what to do in this situation. How should i communicate with her? And am i really wrong for not letting her live her own personal life? Should i be more accepting and forgiving? Or should she consider her lifestyle choices and be more present with me, sober?",0.99
"AITAH for choosing to crush on my horny male roomie & getting hurt? I (f32) have this crush on my roomie of 3 months (m29) let's call him François. Third is Annie (22)

First I should say only I am on the lease. Annie and I are 2 good looking, goofy intelligent girls. François arrived last, and has been w us 3 months so far, he comes from France & is super tall, socially anxious, introverted guy.

I always thought we had a thing because from the get go, he always asked deep questions & remembered every single thing I ever told him. That's right, EVERYTHING. My sister's name, my middle name I'm embarrassed by, etc. All of this w the fact that he's just my type (nerdy,shy, cute but not too handsome and about as attractive as me) he also seems to mirror me a lot, mentioned wanting kids to me early on and how much he loves babies, which is something I had posted about on my story that week! 
 
After chatting lots more w Francois the past 2 weeks, we recently had 3 instances where we chatted for 4-5 hrs online (while both being in the apartment, in our respective rooms) and he asked me about everything, if I was single, if my guy friend the other day was my boyfriend, what my sexual preferences were, my favourite food ever that I could not live without ? 

I asked him why he wont date his Fwb and he said she wasn't good looking or interesting enough & too young.

Around midnight he was asking me sex things lol, and after my answers he told me the blood wasn’t rushing to his brain anymore. (4 min later heard him go wash his hands in the bathroom) But he’d also mention other girls in passing as well; like how he’d love a 3some ( which is a red flag since we’re two girls 1 guy in the apartment ) I was starting to feel weird about this.

Next day I decided to ask him straight if he has a crush on me or Annie even if they never talk (which would explain the 3some comments) he said neither. He just feels closer to me & likes our friendship. That he has NO intention to seduce me or any crush on me. That he talks to all his friends that way and about that stuff, but that the other night the convo just got out of hand and turned him on only because of the subject matter.

He even says "" i don’t think I have a crush on you cuz if I did I’d do a lot more for something to happen between us knowing we’re roomies, and I have not so that shows I don’t“ whatever that means? I still decided to admit I had a crush & was embarrassed by that. W nonresponse.

Next day, everything is seemingly back to normal.
Francois sends me a meme from his workplace, then an hr later comes home W the Fwb for the second time. They go in his room and both Annie & I start hearing them have sex. 

Mans is clapping cheeks at the apartment the day after I told him I have feelings?!

I was hearing the claps in my room, while Annie in her room could hear the moans which apparently sounded more like mooing according to her.

"AITA for not recognizing written Korean language / thinking it was Chinese? This is most definitely going to sound stupid, but I genuinely don't know if I've done something wrong.

A few days ago, my friend and I were playing a game. On that game, we were """"roleplaying"""" but mainly just goofing around. There was a taco bell restaurant, and I was pretending to be a stuck up customer. I looked at the menu, and I noticed that the language written on there was not english.
 
I wasn't wearing glasses at the time of playing, so everything was very blurry for me, let alone really down-graded pixels, so I jokingly said something along the lines of, ""I can't read your menu, it's in Chinese."" I wasn't even sure if it was chinese, or any language, really. I don't know how else to describe it, I was pretending to be some unruly customer who's dumb.

My friend told me that it was actually Korean, and not Chinese, and I replied, ""I know it's Chinese, I passed my 5th grade geography class with flying colors."" And then we just continued on with our game.

Anyways, yesterday, my friend sent me a voice message saying that what I said a week ago really pissed them off, because I was being ignorant and condescending to him, and purposely ignoring his answer. 
 In the voice message, he told me that, ""Confusing chinese and Korean is a very common thing that people do, especially among racists. It was ignorant of you to keep insisting it was Chinese when I told you otherwise."" 

I responded to the message, explaining that I was sorry for offending him, and that it wasn't my intention to come off as ignorant. I also explained that I genuinely didn't know what language I was reading because of my lack of glasses / and because it was actual pixels on the screen, but I've been left on 'Read' for 3 hours.

I don't know if I've made a critical blunder or not, and I don't know if I'm even in the wrong. This is probably the stupidest post, but this person is my best friend, and I just want to know if I've done something terrible.",0.5
"AITA for asking my waiter to partially refund my tip? I went to brunch this AM with a group of friends and we decided I would pay the bill and they would Venmo me their share. The waiter brought our unitemized bill but did not inform me an 18% gratuity was already added. So, I selected 20% on the tip page of the tablet. Then I asked for the itemized receipt so we could divi up the expenses and that is when I realized that I tipped 20% ON TOP of the full bill with the 18% gratuity. We asked for the additional tip to be refunded and it took 1 whole hour for them to finally just hand me cash. 

I felt bad because I was stubbornly sitting at my table for that entire time; it felt like they were trying to get me to just eat the cost and leave - they even had me DM the owner on IG to try to resolve the issue, which I did. The service was lacking… like, at the beginning I had to find our menus and it didn’t get much better through the meal. But, I only wanted the extra tip refunded, we still gave the waiter the 18% they earned. But it just feels kind of shitty to demand a tip refund from someone who probably got excited by the extra amount. 

It also felt shitty to sit at a large table in a small restaurant during a brunch rush just to get $40 back. I wish they went the cash route earlier, but here we are. ",0.2
"WIBTA for not talking with my cousin after my father asked me to talk with her For context I am 17 now and this happened when I was 15. So my uncle has adopted his friends child (about 3 years younger than me) let's call her Abi after the friend had some sort of unfortunate accident. 

I have never treated Abi different from my other cousins ever since I met her, i have no idea how other people of my family treat Abi as I have never gone to my paternal house during summer vacations when she goes with her family, from what I know my father side of the family does not support his second marriage but from how my other cousins treat Abi I don't think they treat her her badly either.

So this happened two years ago when Abi came over to my house with her two sisters and my uncle (i am not a very big fan of my uncle as his ex-wife kidnapped me once when I was a kid with his help) and I said hello to her I don't know exactly of she responded back but I am sure didn't look towards me went into the other room to play with her sisters and my sister my sister let's call her Bella 7f her sister Ava 7f and the youngest one being Jean 5f and Abi was 12. 

Well my exams for 10th grade were approaching (10th and 12th exams are big deal in my country) and my uncle made me watch some youtube videos to understand some concepts. Uncle made me watch a video for about an hour and let me go after that, after which I went to talk with Abi and her sisters, she chose to not respond so i came back and started playing my video game on my tablet.

About half an hour later my mother came back home from shopping and saw me not talking with Abi and playing on my tablet and started beating me up before I could even explain my side of the story (i don't generally get beaten up usually the last i gotten beaten up before this was 2 years ago) and didn't even stop when my uncle said he was making me study and Abi saw me getting beaten up and didn't say anything even though she was the reason why I was being punished. 

I stopped talking with Abi after this incident, yes we did go to visit each others house even after this but we never talked. My mother apologized infront of Abi after that but I never forgave my mother for what she did to me that day. 

Fast forward to today morning my father informed me of my uncle coming over with his family and asked me to talk with Abi, I said no as I still haven't forgiven Abi for what she did that and she never even stepped up to talk with me after that day and neither have I as I see no point in talking with someone who has no interest in talking with me. 

Me and my father had a screaming match and I still refuse to talk with Abi and my father excuses her ignorance of me as an inferiority complex which doesn't make any sense to me as she was the cousin I was the most close to in my father side of the family.

"WIBTA If I accepted my wifes offer to go see the eclipse with me even though she hurt her ankle? I've (30M) always loved astronomy since I was a kid and when I heard about it, I made plans with my wife to go see the eclipse with my wife (32F).  She was very supportive and it made me feel appreciated for my interests and cared for. We planned out to go see it with some friends and family but they all bailed last second so it'll just be us and our daughter (1F) now. 

I was somewhat discouraged and tried to call the whole thing off but my wife said it was important to me so she wanted to make sure we went so I could see it. I agreed and we downsized our plans and I took PTO to get the Monday of the eclispe off.

Fast forward to yesterday and we were taking our daughter to visit my wifes family and she stepped in a pothole in the yard and heard a loud \*snap\*.  She almsot fell over but she was carrying our daughter and managed to catch herself (love that woman, she's a beast).  She handed off our daughter and I took her immediately to the ER to get it checked out. 

The whole time on the way there she's appologizing because we were going to go get new pairs from the eye doctor of glasses that day so we could both see the eclipse better (our were pretty scratched up). I'm trying to drive quick and thinking she's crazy for apologizing at a time like this but tell her I love her and that there's nothing wrong and that I can go see a different eclipse someday. I feel bad for even bringing it up.

Turns out the next one over the continental US won't be until 2040 something.

She's in too much pain to say anything back and we get to the hospital. Get an xray there and after a while the doctor says its just sprained thankfully but that she'll need to stay off it for a few days.

On the ride home, she tells me that we're still going to the eclipse and that we can just go somewhere that's not a big walk from the car since she'll be on crutches for a few days. It's about a 2 hour drive away and we can probably find a park pretty easily in the path of totality.

I tell her she needs to rest and that it's not a priority but she pushes back and says that i don't ask for many thing or plans and that it's important to her.

At this point I'm conflicted because she has a habit of pushing herself and I don't want her to exacerbate the sprain.  But also, I really want to go still and she's been adamant that we're still going.

"AITA for cancelling plans to meet bf’s dad after a loss  My boyfriend (32M) and I (29F) have been dating for a year. I will preface this by saying that my bf has a complex family dynamic. His bio dad is not in his life much. His step dad (who I have met and get along with) is more of a dad to him. But now, he wants me to meet his bio dad. I want to meet him too. So we had plans set for a few weeks now to get lunch with him.

On March 5, my best friend unexpectedly passed away. She was my other half and like a sister to me, we grew up together and we’re lifelong best friends. I was/am crushed by this.

"WIBTA if I demanded my husband to do more I (21F) and my husband (25M) have a beautiful two month old son. I’m a SAHM mom, by choice of reason, and my husband is the bread winner. That being said I believe my husband is 100% detached from our baby. He claims he loves him, and that he’s the cutest thing in the world but he actions do not. After he gets off of work he will come home, hold our son for about fifteen minutes. 
Unfortunately, around the time my husband gets home it’s the ‘witching hour’ for our babe. He gets fussy and my husband gets frustrated and puts him down to scream and cry. These fifteen minutes feel absolutely vital to me because there’s so much I can’t do during the day while I am alone. I feel the need to finish those things in that time period. But I never can. He only has a conscious three hours at home before he is off to bed and useless for the night. Which leaves me all alone to deal with our baby once more. 
It’s currently 5:21 am on the weekend and my husband promised he would wake up with our baby so I could sleep. Which he hasn’t. I am defeated — I feel like he is only a father when he wants to be. The same goes for his oldest son (from a different marriage.) I’m essentially a single mother and the only thing that sets me apart is not working. 
I am okay with my husband not doing a lot during the week, I can handle that. But on the weekend I expect to be met halfway with parenting. All he wants to do during the weekend is get high, hang out with his friends, and play on the oculus. Just last night I was trying to get our baby to sleep so I could leave to get formula and my husband knocked things off the counter while playing his game and it woke our son into a screaming fit. He just laughed and said my bad. 
I am the only one who can care for our son the way I do. He doesn’t understand. Being a mother consumes me 24/7 and being a father is only a side quest for him. Even though he puts in a total of 12 hours a day for work, and works 5 days a week, it’s not enough. I am blessed to be provided for. But I am struggling and sleep deprived. 
He never talks positively to our baby to other people, he never takes initiative with our son, and has this wholehearted belief the money is enough. Would I be the asshole for demanding more?  ",0.33
"AITA for allowing my brother to pay for his own food? I (24F) and husband (28M) made plans for this weekend. We decided to go out to relax due to current stress in our lives. Tuesday morning, we found out that my mother (56F) and brother (16M) were all of a sudden coming to visit. We were skeptical of my mom visiting as she has cancelled last minute multiple times. I don't have the best relationship with my mom or any of my older siblings, but have a wonderful relationship with my younger brothers.

Saturday comes, I get a message from my brother (my mother had not contacted me once) saying that my mother almost cancelled but told her to stick with her plans. So cool, I informed him of the plans we had already made, asked him if he wanted to hang out with us & he said sure. 

They arrive, I make small talk w/ older brother & mom then leave with my brother. At the arcade, we are reloading our cards & I ask my brother if he wanted to pay or if he wanted me to pay to reload his card with credits. He decided that he wanted to use his money he saved to pay. 

We then go get some food. While we are eating & having fun, my brother offers to pay for himself. I thought that this was responsible of him to ask and decided to let him but told him that I didn't mind paying. So he sends me $35, which covers his portion as it was 32.99 per person & we covered the rest of the bill which totaled $144. 

We make our way back a
& dropped him off back with my mother & older brother. My stomach was hurting (I have IBS with C amongst other health issues) & wasn't feeling well so we went home.

About 2 hours later, I get a message from my older brother about how fucked up it is that I let my ""kid"" brother pay for his meal & that he doesn't work. I call my mother heated, asking her why she told everyone else instead of calling me & asking what happened. She got heated & started saying that this isn't how I was raised and that I should have paid since I invited him out & that he barely has any money. She thought him paying at the arcade was fine but not for his food. 

Im extremely upset as I explained to my mother that he offered & I thought that it was good that he wanted that responsibility so I let him make his own decisions. We continue talking & I find out that he not only got all of the money he spent back but even got way more & my mother has made me this bad person to my older brother & my father (who ive gone no contact for 3 years because he is a narcissist who cheated on my mother amongst other things he has done) & his mistress. 

Im crying & feel horrible & get a message from my brother that he's sorry it got out of hand. He was making a joke about having to spend money and didn't realize that it would cause this reaction and wants to make it up to me. I tell him not to worry that I will continue being the black sheep of the family and that he should look forward to his 1st job and worry about school.

"AITA for resenting my long term friends after they tried reaching out to me after 9 months of zero contact TLDR: friends of 16 years stopped talking to me 9 months ago. A few days of ago, one of them reached out to see how I was and I was very cold and petty towards him

I (22m) have known a group of 3 guys Jim, Bill, and Frank (22-23m) for roughly 16 years now.

During the last couple of years I began to notice them being more distant with me. They would talk about things they did together and I would constantly feel left out. 

I tried initiating conversations in our group chat and hangouts but I would either be left on read or they would make up excuses only for me to find out that they went out to the city without me a few days after. This, coupled with my ever-growing social anxiety and fomo began ruining my mental health.

The very last time I saw them was actually when they came to visit my house after I had a major surgery. They got me some food and we hung out for a few hours. We messaged from time to time after that but it dried up and the group chat was a barren wasteland.

In August they asked me if I wanted to join them for a cottage and they had already picked a place and they just needed a fourth person. I, personally think it was just to lower their costs. So I said no, citing my surgery would prohibit me from doing anything when I reality I was almost fully recovered and I could’ve easily joined them. I was left on read and that ended up being the very last time I had proper contact with any of them.

I never bothered reaching out myself because I believed they were completely done with me as a friend and I’m going to be completely honest, this absolutely ruined me. I believed 16 years of friendship went down the drain and I hated them for throwing me away so easily. For the first time in so many years, none of them wished me a happy birthday and to me, that signified they were done with me.

They would post often of them hanging out on Instagram and my resentment towards them grew. Bill and Frank graduated from very tough programs and I didn’t bother congratulating them.

Fast forward to a few days ago, Jim sends me a post on Instagram. I found it to be very odd as this was the first time any of them bothered to acknowledge my existence for about 9 months now.

I just decide to like the post and leave it at that. Then Jim asks “hey I haven’t heard from you in so long how’s it been” 

I was shocked that after 9 months of radio silence, Jim’s trying to reconnect through Instagram. I wait like 2 days to reply “I’m chilling how you been” and I basically give him very dry replies so that he’s forced to try to keep the conversation. 

To sum it up, it seemed like Jim genuinely wanted to catch up, but the resentment I had of them was still there which was why I gave those dry replies. 

So I was done with the conversation, if you call it that, so I liked his last message and left it as that.

It’s been a couple of days and I’m starting to feel sorry for the way I handled that conversation. ",0.25
AITA for only giving my cat distilled water to drink? My friend who also owns cats saying I'm going to harm my cat by doing this since distilled water lacks salt but I told her we barely get any salt from water so I don't see what the problem is. Then she went on about how it'll dilute the salt in my cat but I told her there's like a hundredth of a percent difference between the amount of water molecules in tap vs distilled. aita?,0.92
"AITA for expecting my friends to split a significantly large bill after a night out? This could be shorter but for you to understand the whole situation, I must bore you with the details.

Couple of weeks ago, four of my friends [let's call them group A, ages between 20-22] and I [22M] went clubbing. Once there, I met bunch of my other friends [call them group B, same age group] and since I was the only link between the two groups and both of them wanted me to hang out with them, I decided to introduce both the groups and we drank together.

Now it was a crazy night and we ate and drank and danced until morning. I was so wasted as soon as I came home, I passed out.

The next day, I got a call from a friend in group B (lets call him Sam) and he let me know that we racked up a hefty bill and since most of us were wasted, he paid it off himself, and he was asking me to pay back my share of it along with the share of group A since I was the link between the two groups. That's completely fair, we're all in our early 20s, everyone's struggling, and the bill was a staggering amount, we had to split it.

So just like any normal person, I asked the members of group A to pay their share of it, and even though two of them did, the other two straight up refused. Their argument: ""We didn't drink or eat much, besides Sam isn't even our friend. Why must we pay so much for someone else's orders??"" and since I make relatively more than them (still not a crazy amount, just slightly more than them), they literally told me, ""why are you asking us to split anyway since you make so much!!"".

Now Sam had been calling me every other day, asking me to settle the amount and bro was really distressed. I asked the guys in group A and they just wouldn't split. So Sam and I concluded there's no point asking them anymore, and we ended up covering for them (I covered for one of them while Sam covered for another).

Now I know the guys in group A were eating and drinking, maybe not nearly as much, but they could have been a little collaborative. I believe the only reason they weren't willing to split was because they didn't know Sam and didn't feel obliged to pay. I was so disheartened by their lack of empathy. What if it was me who had to pay the bill in full, would they still not split?? 

AITA for expecting them to split??

TL;DR: Bunch of my friends and I went clubbing and racked up a hefty bill. We all decided to split the amount but two of my friends refused saying they didn't eat or drink as much, they shouldn't be expected to pay.",0.04

"AITA for being upset at a dinner price? So last night my wife, my sister and her husband and my 18 year old sister took my mom out for her b day dinner.

 My sister and I decided to treat since we both have full-time jobs and live on our own, And we agreed to split the price down the middle since my youngest sister doesn't have a job.

My sister goes on to order the most expensive app on the menu as well as two $45 bottles of wine and her husband orders 2 $15 drinks for himself.

 My wife and I are on a budget and Didn't have any of the drinks only to be greeted by a $150 bill for my half.

I took a moment to look over the bill, which got me a look from my sister.

"AITA for saying to my boyfriend that he should buy the house with his best friend if he so likes it? Me (27) and Carl (30) have been together 7 years, live together. Carl has a friend Sam (32) since he was 16. They are sibling-style close. They used to party together  a lot while they were both single. Now, they do talk and message often, but rarely meet up as they have grown apart.

Me and Carl are buying our home. It is older renovated house on a small plot of land. On our first visit we were very enthusiastic, went home to do more research. We listed the help of friends with relevant experiences. We made an appointment to go look the house with two friends who work in the field. After the viewing, we would go  
to a nearby restaurant to discuss and we will pay for the dinner as a thank you.

A day before the visit Sam finally chimes in with his opinions regarding the house (he talked to Carl not me). Sam moved two-three years ago to an inherited shabby old house but otherwise has no experience in construction. Carl asks if it would be okey for Sam to join in on our visit. Carl does not have a valid reason why he should, so we  agree that he won´t because 1. it would be crowded, 2. Sam hoggs Carls attention.

It´ s the next day and we arrive to the place a bit early, so we drive around. 15 min before the meet up time Sam calls Carl and asks where he is as he has arrived. I am shocked and angry. Carl starts to make up excuses and says they never talked about him showing up. I say that I am not comfortable with it and not happy, obviously annoyed. He says he is not comfortable with sending him away as he is already there. I say that I do understand but I do not like the idea of him coming and explain that he has to be with me not separated by Sam. In the end, I leave the decision what to do with him. He decides not to send Sam away.

We arrive and first 25 minutes Carl is with Sam talking, smoking, and taking pics. We wait. During the tour I am mostly with the specialists and Carl is nowhere to be found or with Sam. Once during the hour, I got in the same discussion with Carl as he was questioning the owner and I stumbled upon it.

In the end, I felt like I did not want to buy the house anymore. It felt like it was tainted and had too many issues. I really tried to feel better about it. It seemed to me like he was buying the house with Sam, not me and I expressed it in the car. Carl got very defensive and clapped back to me that he wasn´t with Sam the whole time and he did not understand at all why we got the specialists involved as Sam was much more helpful to him than the specialists. I said back that most of the knowledge that Sam was talking came from the experts and it felt like a bad play of telephone. We reached home, both of us angry.

Finally, we talked and decided to wait until morning with making the decision. During our talk he said that I am not fair to Sam and have prejudice against him. Also, me feeling like I don´t want the house anymore is unfair to him. Now, I am really confused. AITA?",0.75
"AITA for letting my father walk me down the aisle after he cheated on my mom? We found out my dad was cheating on my mom last year (roughly 11 months ago). They got divorced quickly & shortly thereafter. We were all furious with my father. It looked like this has been going on maybe once a year for 7 years. I learned all the details from my mom. I flew up to my mom to comfort her while my dad stayed in their guest house. 

I didn’t talk to my dad for months & had my mom move into my and my fiancés house to take care of her for a while. I had no financial expectations of her, nor a timeline. I asked for nothing. I made her a welcome basket and tried to do absolutely everything I could to make her feel welcome, showing her around town, introducing her to people.

She eventually moved into her own home but as we helped her unload her storage unit, started accusing me of not checking in on her enough, doing enough to help her and ‘taking advantage’ of her. This is all as I started a new full time job, planned a wedding. When I asked for specific examples, it was the time we all took her in her car to the beach (it was the only one with rear AC and it was a hot summer day). Or that I expected her to buy groceries (She often went by herself, so I’m not sure where this is coming from.) All this to say, I think my mom is directing her in anger toward the people closest to her. I also think she is upset she moved out of state. 

I did tell her fresh after the cheating discovery that my dad wouldn’t be invited to the wedding, mostly out of anger. I decided I wanted him to come to the ceremony later, so I wouldn’t feel any regret. My mom took it extremely poorly. She threatened not to come, said I was siding with her abuser, my father is a liar/cheater and that I can’t act like everything is “normal”. She’s called me a spoiled brat, baby and liar. She thinks I’m punishing her. 

I eventually came up with some compromising rules. He wouldn’t be allowed on the venue without her being notified, He is not coming to the rehearsal dinner, he would not be coming to the reception. And they would not take photos together. And all of his family, including my Nana and Aunt would not be able to stay past the ceremony.

I proposed these rules because I understand my mom is the victim in the situation. Our whole family was torn apart, and I want her to feel comfortable. But even with these, it took her a while to decide whether or not she would be coming. 

My father has been very accepting of all of these rules, and I think it’s just excited to be able to come to the ceremony. He has expressed serious remorse to me. I decided, because of his lack of presence everywhere else, that letting him walk me down the aisle wouldn’t be a big deal. My mom, however, has said that he has ruined her life, and I am siding with her abuser via even allowing him to walk me down the aisle. I’m about two weeks out from the wedding, and now I’m not sure if my mom will even be there.

AITA for allowing him to be at the ceremony & walk me down the aisle?

"AITA for trying to get my wife to spend less time in mmorpg Context - married 22 years, both gamers past and present. 4 teenagers. Last six months my wife developed a playing habit that generally borderlines obsessive, 8-12 hours a day in an mmorpg.

Last few weeks have been constant fights over it, my main issue being the amount of time she spends in it, and the fact that in the game, she has portrayed herself as single and has a bunch of boy ‘friends’ that she’ll regularly most of the day with. Her argument is that they know nothing about her in the real world, she’s just keeping her in game stuff from her real life stuff.  They only talk about game stuff and achievements. 

I do believe in her fidelity, but I’m nevertheless uncomfortable about it so when I try to talk to her about this part, plus trying to get her out of the game more, it leads to fights over me being labeled an abuser for emotionally trying to control her.
It’s to the point where, trying to spend time with her I took up the game as well, but under the condition that it’s never revealed that we are married, she won’t even consider a scenario where I could ever be involved in a group with her friends.

Six months ago until recently I was working through the night so I believe this is when she got comfortable voice chatting to these friends and now that I’m not working through the night, I realized this had been going on and trying to address it. 

I had done a poor job of it initially, which drove her further into the game. But I acknowledged and changed tack to try and allow her to have her ‘me’ time but it is still 10 hours a day on average and I regularly wake up in the middle of the night with her still playing and voice chatting with these boy friends until she’s dead tired and literally comes to bed straight to sleep barely acknowledging my existence. I’ve told her I feel like a ghost in our own home. She thinks I’m being insecure and jealous.

 am fine with her playing the game and having friends, I’m not handling the late night duo sessions she’s having with various pals well though. She always has a justification on why she does what she does with whoever she was with. 
She tells me she loves me, she does show it, even when completely pissed at me for interrupting her in game life, but I don’t know how much I’m willing to timeshare my wife. 
Am I the asshole and should I just let her be.

"AITA for arguing with my GF for bringing two drunk coworkers home at night On Friday evening, me (24M) and my girlfriend (22F) went to one of his ex coworkers’ place for a bbq with all their team. 
As she recently she left the job at the shop they worked together at, she doesn’t get to see them very often so when she asked me to come i was happy for her to have some fun as the last period has been hard for her.

Basically, I am studying at the moment and will have two exams next week, so at around 1 am I told her I was going home, but that of course she should stay to spend time with all her old team. It is a good moment to say that we live together in this small apartment I rent and now she’s staying here with me.
Fast forward to 4 am and I hear the doorbell ringing as it turns out that she does not have keys. When I went to open the door I was met by her and two of her coworkers very drunk. She looks at me in an apologetic way and asks me if they can crash on the couch. 
In my mind,  they must have had no place to stay, and as much as I was mad with her I didn’t feel like throwing them in the streets at that hour. Then they start to drunkingly fight as one of the coworkers wanted to go to party, while my gf kept saying that it was better not to as he was shitfaced. Long-story short, they leave after 30 minutes or so of my gf trying to convince them very hard to stay.

As soon as they leave my gf started saying how sorry she was and all that stuff, and I have to say I was very mad. Everything got worse when I asked why they couldn’t go to their home, and the answer made my blood boil: as one of the coworkers is younger (19 yo i think), she didn’t want his mom to see him drunk. 
I was raging as to me it felt like an extremely childish thing to do, in her mind she had to choose between let him go home and possibly make his mom mad (which every teen ever lived does) or show up with two strangers in the middle of the night, unannounced and while perfectly knowing that tomorrow I’ll have to wake up and study my ass off.
Morever, the flat is basically one big room, with my bed being separated by the couch only by a bookshelf, so no privacy at all.

Now she keeps saying that she’s sorry and she knows she fucked up, but it feels like she knew what she was doing was “wrong” did not care and just planned to say “sorry” afterwards.
It is also not the first time it happened, once I was out of the country and coming back from a coworkers’ party a female friend of her was very drunk and the same thing happened. 
However, in that case I was fine with it as she asked me prior to that, the apartment had room since i was not there and she lived very far so she would have had to spend a fortune on a taxi. I was not happy, but I was good with it.

"AITA for despising my boyfriend’s Duck Dynasty beard? My boyfriend and I matched on a dating app in December of 2022. In his pictures he was clean shaven or had no longer than an inch of beard hair. Legitimately 30 seconds before I walked into our first date, he texted me word for word “how do you feel about beards?” to which I replied something along the lines of “I like them!” That was not a lie, as I do like the common beard. I walk up to our date and see him standing there with a beard that’s like armpit level. I made a comment like “I didn’t know you meant that kind of beard” and he laughed it off. To be honest, I was instantly turned off because I felt both deceived and less attracted. Fast forwarding through the date, we had a great time and really hit it off.

On our second date, I asked him about the beard and he told me he planned on cutting it around May of of 2023. I was thinking to myself “okay I won’t tell him I don’t like it because it will be gone in a few months. I can do this!” But May came and went and the beard was still there. I finally began to allude to not liking it. He told me he’d now cut it in December of 2023. December came and went and at that point, I started to be more open about the fact that I did not like it. Today, the beard is now approaching his belly button. 

Now, my boyfriend has told me he likes the beard because it makes him more recognizable in his business, which gets him a lot of deals. He hasn’t admitted this but I also know he really likes the attention he gets from the beard. We can’t go an hour without someone commenting on it when we’re out. However, he takes the comments as compliments, and I see them as people commenting on a spectacle (like “wow, look at that guy with 3 heads!”). 

I really hate it. My boyfriend is a great guy and so handsome, but it makes him look old and disheveled. Also, for some context we’re an interracial couple with a 13 year age gap. It is to the point where I refuse to introduce him to my family. I live out of my home state so I have been able to avoid it, but my best friend recently came in town and saw the beard in person and she was in utter shock. I know that if he has this beard, my dad will not like him and the age gap will be even more apparent to him. My dad had a very negative reaction to my sister’s now husband who is 10 years older but looks her age. Of course, my dad’s opinion of him should not sway how I feel, but I obviously want him to have a good first impression. AITA for wanting him to cut it and not wanting to introduce him to my family until he does so?

"AITA for ‘deadnaming’ my transgender friend and accusing her of copying my identity? I (16F) have been friends with this person “Soc” (16NB) for a few years. She came out as non binary 4 years ago, and uses multiple pronouns including neopronouns. I’ve always been supportive of her, but recently I’ve noticed that she’s kind of trying to copy my identity.

She’s always had an alt aesthetic - graphic tees, striped thigh high socks, lots of chains and belts, exaggerated eyeliner. In other words she still dresses like it’s 2020. In the past few months, Soc started to drastically change her appearance. My fashion style is kinda preppy, girly, and 90s inspired, and I noticed that Soc has started dressing like this recently. Sometimes, she would go to school in an outfit that looked very familiar, which I realised were directly inspired by my instagram photos.

Soc’s hair was naturally light brown and she has often worn wigs to school and dyed her hair different colours, but her hair was usually unnaturally coloured or cut into an emo style. One day she came to school wearing a long, curly blonde wig, just like my natural hair. A couple months later I straightened and trimmed my hair, and a few weeks after that she decided to dye her actual hair from black/purple to blonde.

Her makeup has changed too, from heavy winged eyeliner that made her eyes look huge, unblended contour on her nose and had blush all over her face, to natural minimal makeup. Except she also started using makeup to give herself fake freckles that look like my natural ones.

I moved to Florida several years ago, but I’m originally from New York, and I still have a slight accent. I can’t explain it, but Soc has been gradually changing her accent to sound like mine.

When our friend group was talking about music, she mentioned how much she loved my favorite artist, despite previously saying that she hated pop music. She’s also talked about liking movies that happened to be my favorites and she said she watched tv shows that I’d once said I enjoyed. At first I was really excited that we shared the same taste, but when I tried to discuss our favorite songs, she could only name the most popular singles, and when I tried to talk about how good that film/series was, she barely knew what I was talking about and could only repeat what I was saying, as if she was forcing herself to like those things because I liked them.

Soc has changed her names multiple times since coming out, but the names were always androgynous, noun names or even made up names. She recently decided that she would change her name to Emelia. Which was suspiciously close to my name, Amelie. This was the last straw and I confronted her and told her that it was making me uncomfortable how she was copying me. She said I was being conceited and I was so basic it was impossible to copy me. She said she was growing up and she won’t always look or act the same as she years ago, and I shouldn’t police how she ‘explores her identity’. AITA?",0.5
"AITA for being the girl my friend's girlfriend can't stand? I (F26) have a very close friendship (over 14 years) with a guy (M27) in our friend group. Let's call him Jeff. There was one point 10 years ago we made out a lot, but that was a phase and didn't last for more than 1 year. We realised we were and should just be good friends. Anyways, I moved away for a good few years and moved back to my hometown and on the first night of seeing everyone again I also met my Jeff's new girlfriend (F31), lets call her Mia. I was excited to meet Mia and Mia said she was looking forward to meeting me too. Everyone also got the chance to meet my new boyfriend.

In the time that I lived elsewhere, Jeff's mother had passed away and I never had the chance to properly speak to him about it. So that night I told him I'd like to speak with him aside. We spoke aside, Jeff told me so much that I started crying. He was also distraught. Mia kept walking passed us and Jeff told Mia that we were talking about his mother's passing. I realised then that we should not have moved to be separate from the group. 

After we all left to go home, Jeff and Mia had a major fight. My boyfriend told me that I should have at least informed him that we would move aside and same with Jeff and Mia. Thing is, I don't believe that would have made a difference in how the night ended because I did tell my boyfriend throughout the night that I really wanted to talk to Jeff aside about his mother's passing. But I let it go and apologised to everyone for this. 

After being back for one year and hanging out with everyone every now and then, Mia told me that she believes that Jeff is more focused on me than on her when we all hang out. I told her that Jeff is more focused on everyone else more than her because they live together and to hang out with other people means that attention will be divided and sometimes prioritised to guests. 

Mia said that Jeff talks over her, focuses on mine and his conversation over theirs, he filled my glass before filling hers, etc. These are things I see everyone do at some point and, honestly, when I hang out with others I will focus more on my conversations with them because I talk to my boyfriend every single day (we live together) and I crave other social interactions with friends.

Mia also said that she told Jeff that if he had to choose between saving me or her in a burning car, he would save me. I told her it was wrong of her to tell him or ask him that. 

Mia continued and said that I am also the problem because when Jeff starts a conversation with me over her, I will just continue that conversation without acknowledging her. I have realised that it is because I do value Jeff's conversation over Mia's.

I'm at the point of not even wanting to hang out with anyone again, I'm so exhausted with having to consider every move I make and every word I say. I understand considering your partner (which I do), but this is really is tiring me TF out. ",0.57
"AITA? Husband follows gross accounts on his TikTok and I now don’t want to go on our family holiday I (33) am upset with Husband (40) because I discovered who he follows on TikTok. 

For context, he apparently doesn’t use social media. His TikTok account he was newly using after a break from the app was suggested to me so I saw it pop up. 

He followed 9 accounts. 3 of them are accounts I run, 4 are retro gaming type accounts, 2 are soft p$rn accounts, both of women with large behinds showing them off. 

Retro gaming and big butts are both his thing. He’s following nothing else aside from those and me. 

I told him I’m really really upset, don’t want to speak to him. It feels hurtful, his profile was public, linked to his mobile number, has his real name listed. 

He says it 100% wasn’t him following them, must have been an accident. 

Completely dismissed me being upset as ‘silly’. Also said even IF it was on purpose and he was consciously following those people it’s not even a big deal, that I’m ‘beyond ridiculous’ and then started saying our marriage is a sinking ship anyway and there’s bigger issues. None of which he’s raised with me. 

I’m really hurt, haven’t spoken to him at all since and he thinks it’s all quite funny. 

Unfortunately, we have a family holiday booked in a few days with our children. I don’t want to speak to him. I also don’t want to go away anymore. 

I can’t bear to be near him and the way he’s responded makes me feel worthless. I am now also left assuming that things like this wouldn’t matter to him the other way round either, and that’s not the kind of relationship I thought we had.

"AITA for requesting my boyfriend to get souvenirs for my mum  I am Chinese (F28) and my bf is Moroccan (M34). My bf will be going to visit his home country to visit family for two weeks. He is someone who likes to travel very light (think only a backpack), and doesnt enjoy thinking what to give to people.

My mum’s love language is gifts, and he has gotten her small gifts (like fruits) when coming to visit for dinner. She is someone where the gift doesn’t really matter, but the thought that counts. I also think in Chinese culture it’s customary / polite to show up with a small gift (be it a dessert or a snack when visiting a house).

I mentioned to my mum he’s visiting Morocco, and she mentioned to me a couple of times that she’d like a souvenir from him. So tonight, after a few drinks, I told him that I’d recommend him get her a souvenir as she has been “pestering” me (the exact word I said) for a souvenir. I told him this because I want to maintain a good relationship between him and my family. He asked what she wanted, and I told him I don’t know, maybe a biscuit or anything, can be even “junk” eg a keychain. As it is not the actual object that counts, but the thought.

He didn’t react well when I told him about this request. He said that he never gets gifts for his parents, and that he has done a lot for my mum before already. He also said that in his family they never get gifts for each other. He said once I made this request, it has become a burden on him because rather than the gift being his idea, it is now something that will be on his to-do list, and it will now weigh heavily on his mind the whole time he is there. He said the meaning of a gift is now lost once I told him about her request. He says he hates travelling sometimes because people will ask him to buy stuff. 

He also didn’t like that I couldn’t give him a specific thing to buy (like type of biscuit or brand). However, I don’t know either, as I’m not from Morocco, I’ve never been there. When I told him that, he says he doesn’t know what to get either because there are many options to pick from. And also the city he his going to, it is a bit of a hassle to go to the shops - there are no souvenir shops, it will have to be a full day trip to a market to go shopping. 

This turned into a heated argument, and I guess I’m not sure what to think anymore. He said it’s better I don’t tell him about her request and that he should come to the conclusion himself. He also said now that I’ve told him about this, he now must be obligated to get her something, and that I should research and tell him what to buy. He said he’s annoyed because of the way I worded the request, which gave him pressure, and that I couldn’t give him anything specific to buy. 

I’ve also recently asked him about maybe getting some spices (didn’t specify what spices) for me and my dad, but his reaction to this was totally fine.

So AITA? I’m not sure how to resolve this? I’m guessing it’s a culture and personality clash too?",0.85
"AITA for my negative reaction at my partner for doing a ""good deed""? So my partner and I live about 2 hours apart. Today, she vanished for a few hours and I assume she was just busy doing her own thing. She then messages me and shows me a huge pile of suitcases and boxes saying she's moving her friends belongings into her own storage unit. 

  
Now a little bit about the friend. She lives on the other side of the world in Australia. She is terminally ill. She is never coming back to our country because of how ill she is. She is also absolutely loaded (her parents were on salaries of $200K at one point via high government roles) so money is no object to pay for a storage unit here. She is currently in Australia and has no plans to come back here. 

Yet my girlfriend proceeds to get the storage unit code from her friend, go to the storage unit, empty it and drive off with all of the contents. This is incredibly illegal. I had absolutely no idea she planned to do this. She never mentioned it to me once. All to save her friend ""a bit of money"".

I immediately pointed out this is highly illegal. The contents owner has to be present while the contents are removed otherwise it is considered theft. 

Not only that, this girl is terminally ill and now my girlfriend is legally responsible for her belongings in a storage unit when this friend does not even live in the same continent as us. Meaning it can be locked away and untouchable if this girl dies while her estate is being finalised, which can take years.   


I am furious. This is not the first time my girlfriend has massively over extended herself to do a ""good deed"" for a friend or family member to the point where it has basically ruined her life. If she had put this plan past me as her partner, I would have immediately pointed out that it is a) illegal and b) a completely downright stupid idea and not do it. 

Girlfriend is now very upset with me because of my reaction pointing out that it's utterly bizarre she has done this. Her heart was in the right place but I'm stunned that she vanished for a few hours and essentially committed a felony in that time. 

Friends are saying I'm the asshole. Not sure I agree. AITA?",0.81
"AITA for making my girlfriend wait outside our house for hours after going out? 
I’m 27M she’s 24F. Context is we only have one set of keys because a few months ago our landlord lost his pair and asked us for one of the ones we had, and since we are moving at the end of this month we decided to not make another copy. 

Yesterday she went out with this new girl friend of hers she met a few months ago to have lunch but ended up spending the entire day out and around 10 pm told me she was gonna go out partying. I told her I was gonna go out too but since she wasn’t home and I had the keys I told her what we were supposed to do and she told me to take the keys and said we could come home together at 6 am when the clubs closed because we was gonna be near each other (clubs were a few minutes walk distance from each other).
I insisted her to confirm me that she was going to come home with me because I told her I was low on battery and my phone would die and she confirmed it. 

I drank a lot and she did too because we were texting throughout the night and I could tell she was drunk. Around 6 am I asked her if she was coming home because I guessed she might be going to sleep at her friend’s who lives near our home (around 15 minute walk). She didn’t reply so I guessed okay she’s not coming home and since I was still active and a bit drunk I went to one of my friends’ place too, drank a bit more and ended up falling asleep on their couch. 

My phone died so no alarms and no calls were received and I woke up around 3-4pm and took a taxi home only to find her sitting on the door and killing me with her eyes. She haven’t talked to me since that day (it was on Friday) and made a big thing out of it. Apparently she came home around 12 pm thinking I was there and I wasn’t receiving any texts nor opening the door so she just stayed there until I finally came home. 

I told her why didn’t she just come back to her friends’ place which is near our house and she said that wasn’t the point and told me to leave her alone and even hinted breaking up because “she can’t believe I care so little about her”. 

I do understand she can be mad because she was sitting there for hours but 1. I did text her at 6 asking her if she was gonna come home as she said but she didn’t even reply until 12 pm. 2. She could’ve just gone back to her friends’? And 3. I did warn her several times that I was running low on battery.

"AITAH for going on a trip with my siblings after just moving in with my boyfriend? I (30f) drove from Salt Lake City to St. Louis to live with my LDR bf (32m), let’s call him Paul. My siblings came with me on the long drive with my U-Haul. BTW, Paul did not help me with any planning, or offer to help me move, nor has he met any of my siblings. He just wanted me to just pack my car, but I had a fully furnished apartment, and I wanted to keep as much stuff as possible.

While planning the move, my siblings and I wanted to go to Nashville for a couple of days. Paul didn't want to go with us. He argued that we as a couple need to save money since I won’t work for a couple of weeks. I told him I saved enough for this trip, and he let the issue go.

We got to St. Louis, and my siblings and I visited some attractions. Paul didn't want to come. We got home late, and Paul got visibly irritated and ignored me that night. The morning we leave for Nashville, Paul tells me that we needed to talk when I get back. I suggested we talk right then because not knowing what he was mad about would ruin my mood the whole day. He ignored my pleas and we go and start driving to Nashville. 

He immediately started texting me how angry he was I left, saying that I ""went against what we had agreed on” and that I should be unpacking my stuff right now. I said it was only for a couple of days and I'll have two weeks to unpack.

He blasted my phone the whole drive, saying “this whole situation is making me uncomfortable.” I even told my siblings to turn around to take me back. My siblings reassured me it would be okay if I still went with them. 

Then he starts to compare me to his ex-gf, saying I was just like her. Some background on this: his last gf's family didn't like him and was part of the reason she broke up with him. He thinks that this was the same situation. He starts showing me his bleeding ear and how his body is reacting to what I am doing to him. There was a point he screamed at me on the phone that was connected to the car, and everyone heard him. They said if I didn’t want to live with him anymore, they’d happily help me move back to Utah. I thought about it because I didn't like how Paul was acting.

I told him I was having second thoughts, and he thinks my siblings are to blame. He changed the locks and does not trust my siblings to be at his place. But I reassured him I would come back, but he didn’t believe me. 

We come back when he was at work. I go in and get the rest of my siblings' stuff and book them a hotel for the rest of their stay (he has a camera by the entrance). He wouldn’t even let them in to use the restroom. I thought we would have a discussion about this, but he said there was nothing to talk about; seems like he just wanted me to come back to St. Louis and for my siblings to leave. He told me that his actions were valid, and he even asked his friends, and they think I am the asshole for not staying and unpacking my stuff, so the question is AITAH?",0.05
"AITA for taking my friend to my place instead of his+ My (21f) friend (21m) is a recovering alcoholist and has made great progress with controlling his drinking. We spend a lot of time together, and one of the things we do is going on car-rides. We listen to music, talk a lot and drive around while he's drinking. Now, for couple of times when he goes past his own limit and falls asleep in my car, I have started to take him to my place to sleep it of. Reason for this is that my place has easier access then his (mine's ground level while his is on the second floor with no elevator). I always make sure he's comfortable when e's at my place, he takes the bed, I sleep on the sofa. So far this hasn't bothered him but now he seemed kinda mad about it while i did explain all I thought in which apartment he would get safely without falling over and/or hurting himself.

So, AITA for doing this?

Edit to clear few things: I'm not enabling him, I'm honestly just looking after him. Those who said he's not recovering at all, he was forced to start drinking when he was 14 and all he drank back then was anything above 80 % alcohol. He has made recovery and only drinks beer now. Because the recovery system is fucked in my country, I'm happy of the progress he has made.

The question I ask whether I was the AH for taking him to my place to sleep after he has been drinking and I'm only looking answers to that particular question. If you won't respect that, I hope you have a shitty life for treating people like crap only because their past is different from yours.",0.88
"AITA F25 for making him M28 look bad in public by saying our personal stuff in public? 
My boyfriend and I been together for more than a year now and yesterday we played mini golf, it was also a bit packed with people. We then had a discussion about how we didn't feel lonely when we were single, and that he told me he would just watch Twitch. Basically he watches streamers who chat with the viewers and do regular life stuff. I then proceeded to tell him that Twitch for lonely people, which impulsively came out of my mouth. He then said that the same could be said about TV shows in which I quickly disagreed because a streamer knows how to make you feel included in their random activities. He then said that he's out of this conversation.

Long story short, I was confused on what I did wrong for a moment so I didn't say anything until we got back to the car. He then told me that that I looked annoyed with him in public and didn't want the attention of other people on us. I told him I was hungry and cold, which is probably why I look more annoyed than I actually was when he told me his opinion on the topic. But he said it got way too serious or heated.

We then walked to pick up my order close by still talking about it and I then said well you told me to stop talking. Other people were around us when I said this and I realized I messed up because I made him look bad in front of other people.

In the car he basically said I made him feel really horrible because there were other people around us when I said that to him. So I apologized. He then told me he's reconsidering the relationship because he hates feeling like this and doesn't want it to happen again. The reason is because I already know he hates talking about anything that could garner any attention from others in public and I made the mistake of doing that twice today.

Do you think that it is normal to rethink the relationship because of what I did? ",0.17
"AITA for humoring my daughter?  My (40f) daughter (15f) recently made friends with a girl her age from a very wealthy family. We're fairly poor, and my husband recently died in a work accident. My daughter has shown a large amount of disdain for our environment since then, and she's been hanging out with her new friend a lot.

One day, we got to talking about what she wanted to do, and she said she and her friend had put together a plan that her friend would make a name for herself online, take over her mom's company, move to Japan, and have my daughter as her ""personal live-in maid"" who will accompany her places and look nice.

I've talked with the friend's mom, seen their house, and I know the friend has the means to live in a penthouse in Japan and run a company. And granted I'm not very smart, but it just doesn't sound...well, sound to me. I said as much, and my daughter said it's what she wants.

I said I understand, but I don't want her being rash.

She said she thought about it a lot, and I said I don't know if it's realistic.

She began to say something about her dad, but began crying and said something else.

She said she had to, because she didn't want to stay in our state and ""die in the dirt before my time like everyone else"", saying she was scared, and this was a chance ""out of hell""

Then the session happended ( not going into details here but you got it). For more informations, this subreddit precisely informed that it's for PAID services. I then asked him for a payment and he asked me what my rate was. Mind you, in his post, he was looking to spend around 50-60 for this session. I told him that for this time, I'll charge 30. He went CRAZY on me. Saying that I'm charging too much and that I'm not worth that. Trying to be understanding, I divided my rate by half and told him that he can pay me 15. He started insulting me and saying that he won't giving me any money since I saw his nudes too? That was so weird. I told him to I'll report him to this subreddit because he's not a trusted seller and he told me that he didn't like my threats. He called me an asshole and blocked me. 
So reddit, I was wondering if I was the asshole because before the payment issue, he told me that it was great and that he wanted to rebook with le again because I was ""amazing"" (his words not mine).",0.3
"AITA for how I acted at Easter? I (15F) celebrated Easter with my family at my aunt’s house, this is my mom’s sister, my mom’s brother was also there with his family and so were my grandparents.   
  
My mom’s sister has 2 kids, her daughter Everleigh (14F) and her son Cosimo (11M).   
  
Everleigh and I don’t get along and this Easter was my breaking point. My parents are saying my fighting with Everleigh was wrong but I think I’m justified.  
  
We were having brunch after Church and Cosimo was talking about what he’s done recently. Cosimo is genuinely impressive, he’s the elementary school president, he’s on the basketball team, he won the quiz bowl at his school and most recently, he won the district-wide spelling bee for elementary, which all 5th graders compete in. He won his school science fair and is now heading to the district wide one. He’s so talented but humble at the same time, he was talking about how he “only” got second place in his school’s art show, and he never says any of this in a bragging way.  
  
Everleigh started to talk over him and talk about what she’s done, she said that Cosimo’s accomplishments didn’t matter much because “he’s a little kid”, and she was talking about how she’s in theatre and all different clubs, but I’ve heard from friends she doesn’t do much in these clubs yet she made it seem like she was doing a lot, it was odd. I tried to call her out on it, but she said my friends were just “jealous”.  
  
After brunch, we went back to my aunt’s house. Everleigh was asking all of us to do TikToks with her, she was being quite aggressive to Cosimo, yelling at him for doing dances wrong. Everleigh is very social media obsessed and wants to be an influencer, which I understand but I didn’t like how she was yelling at Cosimo for his “mistakes”. Cosimo started to cry and she said that “real boys don’t cry” and called him a wimp. She then cried to Cosimo when he refused to film more with her, and was whining about how kids at school don’t like her and all she wanted to do was be popular.  
  
The final straw was when we were getting our baskets from out grandparents, we all got gift cards and gifts related to our interests, like Cosimo getting basketball stuff. Everleigh got stuff for social media and some Sephora gift cards. Everleigh was complaining about how the gift cards weren’t enough and how she thought she’s get more. I told her to stop complaining and she started to yell at me.  
  
I had my parents pull me aside and they said that Everliegh is “just like every other teenage girl going through puberty” and that I should give her some empathy. I told them I didn’t act like that and they brought up a detention I got earlier this year for talking in class. I told them it wasn’t the same but they were still mad at me. We ended up leaving early to prevent more fighting and my parents are still upset. AITA?",0.71
"AITA for being frustrated that my boyfriend hasn't told his family about our relationship?  

I (24f) and my (20m) boyfriend have been dating for two years now,But, it's been 2 years into our relationship, and while one set of his parents know we are together and they support us (His parents are divorced) he hasn't told his other parents. And at first- I totally understood it. I understood any hesitation he had, because frankly, his biological father is an asshole (in my opinion) and his stepmom is alright, but she definitely allows her husband to engage in asshole-ish behaviors, if not instigate it herself. Let me give you an example; Every weekend my boyfriend hosts D&D at their house with him and his family, and because I live 3 hours away, I have to play with them over the computer. Now, I was just thankful that I got invited to play with them at all, let me be clear.  Well, playing with his family... It's not great. I've been spoken over, my ideas have been shut down, attempting to heal characters with my spells have been outright ignored and been told ""No, we'll just long rest."" essentially my character has been turned into a walking, talking lock pick, and I felt... frankly it felt rather dehumanizing. So when I brought it up to my boyfriend the first time, he assured me that he would talk to them about it, and that he would try harder to get me included. well... I don't know if he actually did speak to him, but by the time the next session came and everything was the same? I realized that either his parents were treating me this way intentionally and he wasn't going to stand up to them, or that my boyfriend didn't talk to them at all. So I brought it up to him again! and I was polite about it, I said ""Hey, I don't like the way I'm being treated at the table. I don't want to make a huge stink, you're the DM, but they are your parents, what should we do to fix this?"" and he was like ""I hear you, I'm sorry, I'm working on it."" and I was like- great! awesome! cool! problem solved Wrong.  and that's when I find out, he hasn't told them. he didn't tell them two years ago, and it's been MONTHS since this entire bullshit started! I know I'm the asshole for constantly asking him why he hasn't told them, and to constantly push him to tell him when he clearly isn't ready. but he also literally refuses to let me break up with him?? he's like ""you've made me the happiest I've ever been, I'm not giving up on you."" and it's like, that's lovebomb-y as shit to say, and you're also clearly not ready to be in a relationship when you're keeping this a secret, and allowing your family to treat me like crap? But I also know that I'm being a pain in the ass about it too, by forcing him to say something.
so I seek your advice, oh fellow members of the internet.

I emptied & scrubbed them both before moving the biggest one and left the smaller one where it is.

I think this is an out of sight out of mind problem tbh. They forget to clean them for weeks at a time though. (Currently was @ 17 days uncleaned this round)

I feel bad because they have a lot of stress with their kids and work and I don't wanna nag or be rude.
I don't pay rent either so I feel like I have no right to say or do anything with any of the issues I have.

3 cats 2 boxes
Both are usually in the bathroom attached to my room because there's not really a good place to put them in general without them being in the way of something. But I put them near the cat food in the kitchen 

The bathroom has become unusable for months and I use the hall bathroom for everything instead.  Sitting in my room chilling is unbearable even with the window open 24/7. The entire place reeks. I reek. My clean clothes reek. It's burn your nose when you walk in the house bad and even worse in my room. I think they are nose blind to it. I get comments on how I smell when I shower and leave the house. I'm at a loss on how to get them to remember to clean it without constantly having to ask them to. Even when they clean it the smell lingers and never really clears up. Then it builds up to being really bad again within 3 days.

They were visibly annoyed & moved it back within 10mins of noticing it was there and told me to just remind them if it gets bad but that they're NOT having it in the kitchen. But that would mean every couple days I have to remind them because it won't get done otherwise.

AITA calling out behavior during plane disembarkment Hello I need to ask was I the asshole? Took a flight from New Haven to Raleigh. It was an uneventful flight until we arrived in Raleigh. I was sitting in the aisle seat around row 20. When the plane landed and the doors were open I was sitting and minding my own business waiting for the rows ahead of me to disembark. All of a sudden a group from the very back of the plane run up the aisle and are stopped right next to me. Maybe I should of kept my mouth shut but I asked them” do you have a connection to catch” . They said no and I proceeded to explain to them that it is very rude to do this and they should wait their turn like everyone else. Now while we were discussing this more people from the back started walking up the aisle. So I step into the aisle and said I’m not moving until the rows ahead of me exited. The people in front of me who first walked up the aisle started berating me telling me I should mind my own business and sit down. I refused to move. The discussion continued. I held my ground but in no way was I disrespectful. Now the flight attendant came over. I explained what was going on and she said while she agrees with me I must let the people behind me get off and not make them wait. I really don’t think I was doing anything wrong but to calm the situation down I sat down and let all the people from the back walk out first. While walking out two of them cursed at me. Am I wrong ? Isn’t it common curtesy to let the plane exit by rows? I think my lesson is to stay off discount airlines. Or maybe I’m just an asshole,0.97

I (28M) have this ""friend"" (19M), let's call him Alex. we have been buds for awhile, but lately, I’ve been catching feelings for him. I know he’s straight, but, I couldn’t help but think maybe he’d be down for some experimentation.  
  
So... I started testing the waters, ya'know? Giving him compliments, touching his arm, seeing if he’d bite, and guess what? He started teasing me, so I figured he’s into it.  
  
But things got real weird when I tried to kiss him one night. He pulled back like I just sprouted a third arm or something. We get into a long argument and he straight up tells me he’s not interested, which really grinded my gears at the time, and even after irks me. I felt like he was leading me on, so instead of backing off, I doubled down. I mean, what’s a little kiss between friends, right? It's not like anyone would know.  
  
But he shot me down, calling me multiple words I will quite frankly, not be repeating. Saying I made him ""super"" uncomfortable. Like, who does he think he is? Like... Is that not ironic? You just got done playing with my feelings like this, and now you're calling me derogatory names?   
  
Now, I’m sitting here scratching my head, wondering if I’m the jerk in this situation somehow. I mean, I genuinely thought he was into it, or at least open to the idea. Am I the asshole for misreading the signals and not taking no for an answer? Should I apologize to Alex, or do I have a right to be angry about him leading me on?

So my mom has suspected her boyfriend of cheating on her. She got some evidence and screenshots. She trusted me with this information and said that she still wanted more evidence before confronting him. He has gaslit her in the past. 
It's difficult because there is a 5 year old involved that calls my mom, mom. (his mom passed away and her boyfriend has cancer.) she doesn't want to seem like the asshole that leaves her sick boyfriend. He is also very unstable emotionally, he has had full on screaming matches with my mom infront of my wife and I, to the extent that we had to intervene. I just felt so uneasy knowing that my mom had no one supporting her at home. We can only do so much with FaceTime. 
He made sure that my mom and aunt became astranged after starting a fight one night with my uncle. 
My mom is pissed at me for telling my aunt, but I just want her to have a support system and someone to pick her up after all of this. Am I the asshole for phoning my aunt?

"AITA for ruining boys night I \[33m\] is a relatively new father to a baby girl \[9 months\]  
Recently I was contacted by an old highschool friend, who was planning a get together with our old friend group. The wifey was very excited about getting me out of the house so she could get a night for herself, so being a good husband I agreed.

I arrange with my sister that I drop the kid off at hers, go to dinner and out for some drinks, and take a cab home and pick up the kid up on the way.

The day comes, and I go to meet up with the ""boys"" for dinner at a restaurant.  
  
Shortly on our friend group. It is me + 6 other guys. I keep relatively regular contact with 2 of them, but some of the others I haven't seen for years. But adult life has just caught up with us, and we are all busy with our careers, marriages/relationships, kids yada yada. But out of all of us, I am the only one who has a daughter.  
  
And then there is Skyler \[34m\]. Skyler is the odd one out in our group. He is a pothead, lives in a studio appartement and is a delivery truck driver. The most noteworthy he has done in his life was getting a record deal after highschool with a band that never amounted to much, and the record label screwed them over on their contract. 

But we have dinner and drinks and get to catch up with each other on what we have been up to in our lives. When the spotlight turns to Skyler, he tells us what he have been up to, how he is still playing music and his this quaint little Rock band, and then he tells us that he has an 18 year old girlfriend. He sends a picture of her on his phone and around the table. Everyone just looks at it and awkwardly smiles. I am the only one that reacts with a ""That is gross"". He is ticked off by it, but doesn't say anything. We finish the dinner and head off to the bar.

  
At the bar everyone gets more drinks and the inhibitions are lowered.  
But Skyler keeps blabbing on about his girlfriend, and every time I can feel my stomach turn, and I am getting ticked off. Maybe because I keep imagining my daughter at 18 being with such a loser, or it might be sleep deprivation combined with alcohol.

At one point during the night, Skyler shoves his phone in my face where there is a very suggestive photo of his girlfriend and says ""What do you think about that?"" and I completely lose my temper. I almost flip the table when I stand up, and proceed to chew him up and yell at him, about how big of a loser he is and how disgusting I think he is. He is completely taken aback. And i then proceed to berate every other guy in the gathering for not calling out how disgusting Skyler is being.  
I take off, get a cab, pick up the kid and head home.

The next day i feel a little guilty for my outburst. So I text everyone but Skyler, and apologize for my behavior.  
And the guys are understanding and it is water under the bridge, but I also learn that it pretty much killed the mood for the rest of the night.

"WIBTA if I stayed somewhere else over my boyfriend choosing my roommates side? 
A week ago, my roommates and I (22F) sat down to discuss moving out. All of us wanted to move away from one roommate ""Aaron"" (25M) due to his lack of cleanliness and his inappropriate remarks about women that make me and another female roommate uncomfortable and sometimes borderline worried for our safety. We have all tried to talk to this roommate about this behavior and the change we'd like to see, but slowly over time stopped due to us feeling like nothing we say was being heard.

We had the conversation and confronted Aaron about our reasons, and it lasted all of 5 minutes before Aaron went to his room extremely upset. He has kept himself holed in his room every since and refuses to talk to anyone except my boyfriend (25M), who is his best friend. He's been slamming doors, ignoring his aspect of keeping the place clean, etc.

Fast forward to now, I spoke to him today and apologized for how I handled my portion of the conversation last week, want to recognize that I know he feels hurt and betrayed, and respect him to have his privacy and space and that I want to continue to support him and for him to let me know how to support him. His response was a flat ""okay"" with an eye roll and he stalked back to his room with a slam of the door. 
How my boyfriend plays into this is that he is trying to be the moderator in this situation (which we have said we don't want him to be). However, he wants us all to talk to Aaron to try to make him feel better. After trying today, it reminded me of the discomfort of why we're leaving in the first place. My boyfriend won't stop bringing up how torn he is, and how he's trying to help his best friend stay afloat, and how we really hurt him.

Truth is, I don't feel bad. He's made me compromise my comfort to keep him safe from himself and, to do that, tolerate his mysoginistic remarks about women and disrespect towards me and the other female roommate. All of the other male roommates . moving with us agreed about this, but now my boyfriend is sticking up for his friend more.

So, I want to go stay with a friend for a few days to get away from him and my boyfriend. He doesn't want me to leave because he'd be horribly sad without being able to sleep next to me. Overall, I feel it would be an ass hole thing to run from the situation and that I'm not being empathetic enough to either of their feelings, and that I'm in the wrong.
So, WIBTA for staying somewhere else for a bit to calm down from all this?

DTLR; confronted roommate about his poor behavior towards me and another female roommate (and women in general) and lack of cleanliness. We told him we wanted to move out. Roommate is hurt, boyfriend is picking his side to support him and trying to get me to apologize. I did apologize, nothing positive came of it, and now I want to stay with a friend for a few days. Boyfriend would be horribly upset if I did that, and I feel it's an ass hole thing to do. WIBTA?",0.04
"AITA for refusing to cook for my family? I'm 25F living with my parents. Last week, my mom \[55\] told us (me, my brother \[27\], and dad \[70\]) that she's not going to cook for us anymore and that we should handle it ourselves. She used to be a stay-at-home-mom until she got a full-time minimum wage job 2 years ago. She handled the grocery shopping and cooked twice a week which covered our dinners and my dad's lunches, and we handled the clean up.

Okay so I have to shop and cook for myself, fair enough, but now all three of them expect me to cook for everyone like they aren't all grown. Even worse, none of them like my cooking, but to me, it's nutritionally dense and good enough. What I find unfair is my mom doesn't pay for anything in the house, not even her own car insurance. I never minded before because she did the cooking and that made up for it, but now... what is she contributing? My brother, dad and I have and still do pay all the expenses in the household: rent, groceries, insurance, electricity, hydro, internet, etc. and even though she's working now, she doesn't want to give a single dime AND she doesn't want to cook either. We evenly split cleaning chores, and it's not like her labor went unpaid all those years. My dad put 50% of his savings into her savings, and as the will states she will receive everything after he dies, which I have no problem with; as a SAHM it's what she deserves. I guess it's for my dad to decide if this situation is right or wrong, but I don't think it's right.

And for everyone saying I should just move out, that's a fair point. But my parents are okay with me staying because it's financially beneficial for all of us. We're an Asian family and it's typical for the children to stay until they're married, but I plan to move out in 2 years when I can afford to buy, not rent, my own property. The expectation is my parents help me out by letting me live with them in my 20s, and when they're elderly, they move in with me and I take care of them.

Anyway, am I the asshole for only cooking for myself?",0.88
"AITA for turning a secular, Sexual song into a religious song  It isn’t even a religious song, but I’m a Christian and I actually like the tune of Mary On a Cross by Ghost; I think it is so pretty. I don’t like the hidden meaning of it, so whenever I find myself singing it, I change the sexual parts to something that represents religion. 

(Que: all the priest joke, blah blah blah)

Well, my friend (atheist) came over and we were singing that song as I was cooking and I guess he got annoyed with me changing lyrics in some parts because he started to snap at me that I shouldn’t be listening in to the song if I don’t like the meaning of it. 

Okay, valid. 

I still don’t see it as a problem, but apparently my friend doesn’t like the fact that I, an overt Christian, would even take umbrage with the fact that Ghost, an overt Atheist group, would use the Virgin Mary as a sex allegory. I was trying to explain that while I don’t like that Ghost did that, it is still a song and if they could take a religious symbol for purity and kindness and virtue and turn her into sex, I should be able to take the song and sing it in a way that suits my taste. 

It’s just a fucking song at the end of the day. ",0.32
"AITA for choosing religion over my own child I (47F) am proudly Roman Catholic, and I don't shy away from making that known. My child (24F?M?) is a whole other kettle of fish. They were born with with a mental deficiency, don't even get me started on their gender identity. It's like trying to solve a Rubik's Cube blindfolded.  
  
While attending our prayers. ""she"", in a moment of sheer disrespect, decided it was an appropriate time to spit on a cross during our family prayer time. Can you believe the nerve? Needless to say, I was livid. I didn't waste a single second before kicking them out and locking the door behind them.  
  
members of the church have gossiped saying I'm a tyrant, forcing my beliefs down ""his"" throat. But let me be clear: in this household, God, jesus, and the holy spirit comes first, and if you can't respect that, you're out on your rear end. I've made it crystal clear to ""her"" that they won't be setting foot in this house again until they've recited 150 Hail Marys and begged for forgiveness on ""his"" knees underneath the cross before the holy father Jesus and repented for ""her"" sins.  
  
Am I the asshole here? Or rather the satan. Or is this a completely justified response. To make it very clear, they are not homeless. I didn't kick them to the curb, they have a place of their own. Me and ""his"" father don't want any affiliation with such blasphemy. ",0.91
"AITA for being frustrated my in-laws completely rearranged our house while we were on vacation, without our knowledge? My in-laws are moving into a new house being built for them, but it’s not going to be ready for them for a couple of months at a minimum. They sold their old house, knowing they could stay in our spare bedroom until their house was ready. We were aware of their plans and agreed to them staying over, no charge, just “payment” through watching our little one during the day (which they already do) and they offered to make us dinner every so often.

Fast forward to today. My wife, 10-month old and I went on a week-long family vacation to the beach last week, just got back today. Plan was for the in-laws to move in when we got back. We come back to find them already moved in (which was fine, they did notify us on vacation that they were doing so), but also found  all of our stuff was rearranged.

I’m not kidding, EVERYTHING. Our kitchen appliances were moved or removed (to the garage). Mugs removed from the cupboards (still not sure where they went…), shoe rack moved to the closet, pantry rearranged, furniture in our master bedroom moved/removed (most notably the changing table and rocking chair needed for baby-soothing).

I think the icing on the cake was the guns in the nursery. They literally moved our baby’s bassinet (no longer used, to be fair) and other baby supplies to the garage, moved her toys to the closet, all to make room for the guns and ammo. There are 12 shotguns, rifles, handguns in & out of cases along with ammunition all over the floor of the nursery.
(My daughter uses the nursery on the weekend & nights after work when we’re caring for her, she plays with her toys on the floor)

The fallout - My wife and I, quite understandably, got frustrated with her parents. They were defensive because they thought they were doing something nice. They stormed out of the house and left. They still have to come back eventually because they’re stuck with us the next two months (if not more). Also they are our only form of baby care during work right now.

One argument is they are taking care of our baby free of charge (had been prior to this ordeal, despite us offering to pay them for it), so can do what they want (and it will be temporary, thankfully). Of note, our baby is their only grandchild, so they were very willing to care for her free of charge.
Counter point is that the master bedroom, bathroom, nursery (any areas that aren’t common areas) should be off limits for rearranging - or at least wait until we can provide direction/feedback for how they want stuff. We own our house, pay the mortgage & the bills, shouldn’t have to change for them, our guests.

"AITA for refusing to be a catsitter for my grieving mother because I'm allergic to cats? Alright, so my (M29) mom (F61) is going out of state for the funeral of her childhood best friend who unfortunately has died of cancer. She'll be gone for 3 days and has asked me to watch her 2 cats while she's away. I said no because of my allergy, which she's aware of, and suggested a cat pension or whatever they're called, but she rejected the idea saying that the cats have never been to one before and will be anxious. However, she's never mentioned the cats suffering from anxiety so I don't personally see that being an issue. I'm guessing their aren't exactly cheap so maybe her resistance is money related. 

I then asked if nobody else were able to help, but she just said no and didn't want further questions.  I'm an only child and my parents are divorced btw and I know my mom doesn't have the largest social circle, but it seems odd that absolutely no one would be willing to help out, not even a neighbor or a co-worker. I'm like 99% certain she's never even asked anyone but me. 

Our conversation turned into an argument because I said I thought she was being inconsiderate and then she said ""any good son would be selfless in this situation"". I'm not gonna lie, I hung up after that. Saying something like that is very unlike her and I felt hurt by those words and defeated. It's not like I chose to have an allergy to cats?? But later on, I started to wonder if I really am being selfish. Sure, I would survive a few days of allergy symptoms. It would just suck and probably interfere with my daily activities. But maybe it's a reasonable sacrifice to make because of the sad circumstances. I honestly don't know. You tell me, Reddit. AITA? ",0.24
"AITA for being upset that my roomate invited my boyfriend to our roommate meeting without asking anyone.  I (20f) live with 2 roomates, (Ann and Ben), and we have ""roommate meetings"" to solve issues within the house.

Ann had been expressing some concerns with me about Ben, and id given her possible rputes of solution that involved us all. She said we were going to have a meeting, and have yet to have it. I found out while on a call with my boyfriend, that Ann had invited him to the next meeting. I expressed my feelings on the matter by telling him that I felt that those meetings were there to discuss issues within the household, and he's not our roomate, so I don't feel as though he should attend. He asked why I was, ""being like that"" to which I reiterated my point by saying that he's a guest, anything that regards him in our household is my responsibility. 
It obviously ruffled some feathers, as he thought it was odd and his demeanor changed completely. He did bring up good points by saying that perhaps there was a reason he was invited, but I really don't know, and I've yet to approach Ann because I don't want to come off as rude if it's okay to do. I'm even more put off by the fact that it wasn't ran by the group before the  invite was given. 
I still find myself upset about it because I dont feel as though thats his place.I should mention he doesn't stay there every day. He rarely spends the night and may come over a few times in the month. I could understand if he was there all of the time or shared in household responsibilities, but he doesn't. 
I'm wondering if im wrong for feeling some kind of way, or if it's normal and I should be okay with it. Mainly because I want to approach Ann about it, but I know with my current feelings it may come off confrontational.

"AITA for telling everyone how MIL acted at our wedding? Throw away, husband on Reddit. 

I (26F) got married to Jack (26M) in august. We have been together since we were 15. 

Jack and I decided to have an immediate family only wedding. It was extremely small, my dad and brother, his parents and sister/husband. My dad paid for everything. 

MIL/FIL ask if they can stay with us the week of the wedding, we say sure. They show up and they brought MIL sister, husband and niece (14). The 5 of them are in the entry of the house and expect to stay with us this week. I’m annoyed, especially since they weren’t invited? but I say nothing. MIL walks right past me then turns to me and asks if we invited Jacks cousin, we will call her Jane. I tell her no, we just invited you guys and my family. The reason Jane is not invited is because she’s drama, wore white to Jacks sisters wedding and made a scene. 

The day before the wedding, I get up and notice my car is missing, I had last minute things to get, turns our MIL helped herself to it, so she can go shopping at the mall. I call Jack, he calls his mom, she returns the car 4 hours later.. The mall is 15 minutes away from our house.

I was able to get everything I needed and head home. When I get home, Jack pulls me aside and tells me MIL yelled at him for having a camera in the house. We have a camera facing the back door, we check it to make sure the dogs aren’t outside and it’s locked. Either way, it’s not hidden and it’s our home. To me that was sus, so I check the footage and hear how MIL/Aunt are absolutely berating me and our house. I show it to Jack and he says to say nothing. 

The day of the wedding arrives, MIL opens our bedroom door asking for an iron, I go grab one for her. I close the door and start getting ready, I have a picture of my mom (passed away) next to the mirror and I’m just in my head about it all. Then MIL open the door and asks for an ironing curler, I get her one. I close the door and lock it. I call my dad to linger outside the door. 

The limo arrives to pick me and my husband to bring us to the church, before I get out the door, MIL, FIL, aunt, uncle, niece get in the limo and open the special bottle that my dad kept from his wedding. So now it’s me, Jack and all his family in the limo on the way to church. Like a clown car. They drink the whole bottle which I wanted to share with my dad and brother. 

At the reception, Jack and I catch MIL going through the wedding envelopes to see what everyone gave. She is pulling money out and telling Jack his sister is cheap. Again, I say nothing. The last straw was when I looked around and MIL/aunt were missing. I find them hiding calling Jane who didn’t even know about the wedding to tell her she wasn’t invited. 

Lastly, I got my photos back from our photographer, Aunt/MIL/uncle are doing the peace sign behind our heads in every group picture.

I've never taken care of a dog before, and even more so, not for a week, let alone the 2 she originally told me to take care of him for. Before that though, I had told my grandma I was planning on cleaning our home (because it's very cluttered and unorganized). But when I heard she wanted me to watch our dog, I had told her I had some concerns and asked if anyone else could, but ultimately I told her it was fine, but not to expect a lot done for the house. Then when she headed for the door, she reminded me about our one rooster we have as well (I really regretted not having her find someone else to look after our dog even more, apart from the fact I had a lot of online school work she knew I was planning on doing over spring break, and this was already taking up all of mine plus 4 days).  
  
Anyway, I'm here today halfway through when she told me she'd be back because someone broke into our barn when I was asleep, causing our dog to go off, and my uncle came (he lives next door and hates our dog). Well, I stayed up all night after telling my grandma what happened. She wanted to come home understandably, and I was about to get ready to clean our kitchen. I hate to admit it was getting kinda bad, but nothing terrible, only a half-hour clean if anything. But I had managed to pass out in the living room when I sat down with our dog to comfort him and woke up at 4 pm. I started doing the few dishes I had left from the night before and getting ready to eat since I hadn't yet, but my grandma had just arrived before I could finish cleaning. When she saw the kitchen, she started yelling at me, asking but really not why it was as bad as it was. Knowing I can't talk to her like that, I went to my room and stopped talking to her while she kept looking around the house for other things to yell at me about, and I felt sick from how she came in and reacted to me (literally i didnt know i could get an upset stomach from that). So, she started calling me a “lazy fucking slob“ and said she'd break my fucking door down plus that she had every right to bitch at me for all this. She tried, but failed to break my door because I was so used to this I was able to keep it from breaking. and she left for a while and i managed to finish cleaning the kitchen before she got back.

I ended up driving at 5:40pm and got home around 6:15.

When I got home my husband didn't talk to me or look at me. Our 3 year old was very happy to see me. I was exhausted at this point from the sun and alcohol. I actually dozed off a few times on the couch. Around 9pm I finally asked him what was wrong. He shook his head. I told him I could tell something was wrong. He said "" you were gone all day, then came home trashed and exhausted."" I told him I wasn't trashed, I wouldn't have driven if I was still drunk. He told me I ""reeked of alcohol."" I said yes, because I drank a bit and when you drink you're still going to smell a bit like alcohol. He shook his head again and hasn't said anything to me since. It's 11:30pm and I want to go to sleep, but I can't because he's still in the living room ignoring me and I can't fall asleep with him like this. 

AITA? I could have not had that last drink and been home an hour or so earlier, but I was celebrating my birthday and now I feel like an a-hole.


Edit: I see many people are a little confused on a few points. It wasn't my actual birthday.  My husband, child, and I celebrated on my actual birthday and he knew about the brunch weeks in advance. 

I texted him at 11:15 to let him know both my friends were running late. I also texted him around 4:00 to let him know I was still drinking water and unable to drive.

 4 drinks in 7 hours does not mean I was trashed or drunk. Could I have waited another hour? Maybe but I could tell around 5:00 that the buzz had gone away and I waited another 45minutes to actually get behind the wheel. I am confident that if I had been pulled over I would have passed a breathalyzer. I probably smelled more of alcohol because of the drink one of my friends accidentally spilled on herself and a little on me. 

He and I talked last night and he told me the reason he was most upset is because he was worried for my safety and he also would've taken our 3yo out somewhere if he'd known I was going to be out all day. He said he felt like a jackass just waiting around all day. I apologized for drinking as much, especially the last drink. I should have  said no or discreetly dumped it, but I was intoxicated and made a bad judgment call. Both of us admitted we should have communicated our feelings and plans better. 


Edit 2: It was suggested that I edit again with additional information. 

I normally work Sunday nights, but took the day off to do this instead. He would have had to be responsible for our kid for most of the day anyway. Brunch where I live is typically something that can last late into the afternoon. That's why I texted again at 4:00 to let him know I was unable to drive but drinking water. 

He goes out on his own about once every two months. He typically gives me a time frame and tbh, goes over that time-frame be an hour or 4 on a regular basis. When that happens, I ask him if he's alive and safe and simply tell him to have fun and take his time. It's not a big deal to me. I on the other had get a chance to go out without him or my kids once to maybe twice a year. 

He works out of the state for 16 days a month. I am fully responsible for childcare, work, day to day home operations, and any issues that arise during that time. Although it's stressful I don't complain to him about it and just do it. 

According to the BAC chart with my weight I would have been around a .02bac when driving. Again, this is not drunk. I was well under the legal limit. I still agree, though, that I should have gotten a ride as I was exhausted and tired. ",0.4
"AITA for telling my husband he’s overreacting? For background: my mother lives with me, my husband and our kids and is our primary childcare. My mother and I switch off between a minivan and a smaller car depending on who has more kids with them when I’m home (I take the smaller car for work, she takes it for weekend trips). 

The smaller car was due for maintenance. My husband scheduled a service for a weekday morning on my weekday off. It ended up being bad weather that day so no one was happy about driving. We planned for my mother to bring it to the mechanic and he would pick her up as I am considered the least comfortable driving in snow. My mother left for the mechanic and told my husband to eat breakfast then come get her so as not to rush him. He left about 15 min after her. 15 minutes after he left we got a FaceTime call to a group chat with a neighbor, my husband and myself from my mom.  No one there when I answered. 3 minutes later my husband calls yelling that my mom got a ride from the driver service and he didn’t need to get her, tells “I can’t do this anymore!” and hangs up on me. 

When my mother gets home she says the mechanic ride service offered her a ride last minute and she took it and tried to call my husband. She did the accidental FaceTime call and he called her right after. They connected as she was pulling out and he was pulling into the mechanic. She apologized but said he could head straight to work if he wanted to now and he hung up on her. 

He came back home furious she had taken the ride and saying she was inconsiderate. I was surprised he was so angry- I pointed out that it was annoying, sure, but really no one’s fault. My mother had figured at best he hadn’t left yet, and worst case he would be spared the return trip and could just head to work with a better time cushion. He didn’t bring his work things so neither ended up working out.  I told him he was being out of line, we argued. I pointed out that it was annoying to have the wasted trip but it was more a “mad at the universe” for not being better timing and the only difference was him not having company for the second leg of the ride. I would understand if she had left way earlier and didn’t call when his trip could have been prevented entirely. I didn’t think it was fair to be angry with my mother who had good intentions and called him as soon as she knew. 

So am I the gaslighting asshole for telling him he seemed too angry for the situation? Is my mother the asshole for taking the ride?

"AITA for telling my husband his sister’s kids are misbehaved? My (37F) husband’s (41M) sister and her husband and their two daughters, 3 and 9, were in town visiting this weekend. They came over for dinner. Husband insisted on throwing a “pizza and ice cream party” for them. I made a salad so there was something remotely healthy. 

The 4 of them came to our apartment and the children began terrorizing my cat who retreated to my bedroom and hid under my bed. They spent the majority of the time in my bedroom (which I wasn’t planning to have guests in) trying to get her. When she wasn’t doing that, the 9 yr old was doing cartwheels off my furniture. Her mother asked her to stop but she argued with her and continued anyway.
 
After having pizza, they were even more hyper. The 9 yr old had this sort of evil voice she was speaking in. Sounded like the exorcist or something she learned from a movie. She pushed the adults (including me) around. My husband gave the 9 yr old two of his childhood books. She jumped onto his lap, & then laid down on him as he was sitting in the couch. I felt so uncomfortable sitting there watching this. I just couldn’t believe the parents were letting her run amok like this. It felt like she was way too old to be doing this and needed guidance.

My husband asks 9 yr old, “[her name], how do you like your ice cream?” And she hissed at him in her exorcist voice. Hissed. Then she goes “and that’s me taking it easy on you, mister.” Nothing from the parents. 

After the ice cream, now they’re on an extra sugar high, & the 9 yr old starts chasing the 3 yr old around my kitchen island while diabolically laughing and screaming. The 4 adults in the room can’t have a conversation over the noise. 

Then she comes over & tells us we’re going to play her game now: all the adults are prisoners and we are not allowed to laugh or smile. We try to ignore and continue our convo, and every time there’s a smile or laugh she gets in our face with her magic wand & tells us to stop it. No intervention from parents.

 Eventually she and the 3 year old throw themselves on the ground next to our table.. Then, one or both of them start FARTING and the 3 yr old begins crying because she’s so tired. Finally, the parents register some embarrassment and say it’s time to go to bed (it’s like after 9pm at this point.) Then the 9 year old starts crying because my cat won’t come out “to say goodbye to her.” So I had to fish my poor cat out from under the bed and have her make an appearance.

They left & nothing from my husband other than “so glad to catch up with those guys. Thank you for being a wonderful host.” I told him how uncomfortable I was, especially about how muchthe 9 yr old was touching him, and especially that a child was allowed to boss me around in my own home & not be corrected by her parents. “they’re just kids, they can be a lot, and [9 year old] just sees me as her fun uncle” he said. He didn’t feel the touching was inappropriate. 

I’ve shut him out of the bedroom since and feel so repulsed. AITA?

"AITA for tell my sister she doesn't get a plus one to my wedding? I 26F am getting married in 5months I come from a big family and so does my fiancée 27m. We decided we would only be having 150 guest max at our wedding even though our venue allows up to 200. We got engaged almost a year ago and right off the gun we announced to people to get a plus one you had to have been dating before we got engaged. We figured that would be a safe cut off so we only had people we knew and loved at our day. 
Here the situation we are dealing I have two sister one 27 and one 32 both bridesmaids. Both got into relationship in the past 3months after I got engaged. 
My sister who is 27 called me one day early in the engagement before she got in a relationship and asked if she could have a plus one so she could have someone to help watch her son the day of the wedding. I told her as soon as I get an rsvp no I would be all for it as long it was someone I knew not some stranger she understood where I was coming from and said a couple of her friends name one of whom is her now boyfriend who we know most of our lives. 
The problem lies with my other sister 32 no kids posted in our family chat about travel plans for her boyfriend and her for the wedding. She has not reach out to me at all about wanting him there and just assumed. I call her and reminder her of the rule I said if we get a few rsvp no I would be okay with her bring him but since I have only meet him once I was hoping to be able to use a couple of the rsvp no to invite a couple other friends who couldn't make the 150 cut with how big our family is. She got annoyed with me but didn't fight me to much on it. She then went and called my mom and dad who in turned called me and said I should just tell her he can come since I pretty much already agree to let my other sister boyfriend come. My parent are assisting by paying for our photography but they are not paying for anything else. My parents have been supportive our cut off rule until now and they are saying we are being unreasonable. I don't know am I being the ass whole?",0.2
"AITA for beating my wife? Me (33) and my wife (25) are recently married (2 years in december). I am from a western country, she is from an Eastern one and currently doing LDR until her spousal sponsorship gets approved and we can live together. I say this as a preface because we can only live with each other for 1 month at a time because of my visa requirements to visit her, so we talk literally every day.

A few months ago and on one of the times I visited her, we tried to play boardgames together, since I was knowledgeable with chess we tried that, but she didn't really understand it so since she is very passionate about checkers we started playing that. At first, she was always winning, but after a while I started learning the rules and such (she prefers flying rules and such) and now I can't stop beating her.

I love her to death and after I started beating her, over and over she started getting very upset and no longer wanted to play with me, now I tried even playing with different restrictions on myself (no taking corners, playing quick moves for me) but more often than not, I end up beating her, ruthlessly. She also noticed when I throw games, and now she won't play with me at all.

"WIBTA if I confronted my bestfriend on how shit she treats me? A bit of backstory- Me and my bestfriend, lets call her ""A"", we've known each other for 2 years. We're really close and love each other a lot. I won't call myself a ""loner"" or something but I have a decent amount of friends, whereas A is really popular. She has a lot of friends, atleast wayyy more than I do. So, I got to know in November 2023 that I'm moving to an entire different country.

When I first told her which was the moment I found out, she got so mad at me- I genuinely didn't know what I did wrong because she was screaming at me saying ""why didn't you tell me earlier"", which I thought was obvious, because I didn't know? then after that she started telling me how hard she has it since ""my bestfriend is moving away"" and she started completely disregarding me saying stuff like ""you don't even have it that bad"" or ""you'd probably get bullied"".

Then after that, in december she got in a relationship so I don't blame her for not being able to spend time with me. Also she keeps on talking about ""my replacement"" which is kinda weird, but maybe that's just me. But then, on my last day of school here, I recommended her that maybe we can hang out in the cafeteria for the last time, and then she told me that she doesn't wanna go to the cafeteria today so I went along with it and stayed in class, and then 5 minutes later when I came back with my lunch and started looking for her, someone told me she went to the cafeteria with one of her other friends, which just made me feel bad, because I just gave her this really long heartfelt card on this day itself and I just felt like that my efforts were useless.

On my birthday, she was on a school trip so we couldn't talk. I didn't go on this trip and I told her that we could spend my last birthday here together but she thought that was ""boring"", which I don't blame her. On my birthday party too, she didn't talk to me at all, probably just ""happy birthday"" ""thanks"". I told her we could get photos but she was busy with her other friend most of the time. And when I casually asked her about this she told me that ""I'm finding a replacement for you"", she keeps on talking about ""Oh I think (some girl) will be your replacement"" or some stuff like that, which I guess that's nice you're making more friends but I don't wanna know about MY OWN replacement?

(this just sounds like a rant now I'm so sorry) lastly, she has really bad jealousy issues. I went to hang out with a few friends who didn't go on the trip so I had company on my birthday and then she started complaining when she saw my photos with them, ""you have more photos with (some other friend) than you have with me"", when she herself has an entire highlight about her other friend??? I vented to some other friend about this and when I told her that I'll confront her about this, she told me not to since I'm moving away in a month and that ""I'm being inconsiderate of her feelings""",0.06
"AITA? Wife says I have to wait for her to watch a movie. So I keep trying to watch different movies and my wife suddenly will ask why I'm watching them without her. She does this with TV series as well and tells me I have to wait for her to watch them together.

I finally just told her I don't have to wait for her to watch anything as we work alternate schedules and she only watches anything with me for like an hour at most 3 times a week.

She was very upset and said she didn't understand why I couldn't wait for her because she feels like she can't watch anything without me (I told her it wasn't true and she could watch whatever). She then said that she has too much anxiety about watching anything alone since our baby was born.

"AITA for kicking out my sister out of my house for not complying to my house rules?  I (26F) live in a two bedroom apartment and I was living alone for the most part until last month when my younger sister (23F) started living with me after my parents kicked her out due to her not contributing to the house. 

She had nowhere else to go and she pretty much begged me to let her stay with me. I said that if she wants to live with me, she needs to follow my house rules. She is in her last year of university so I said that she didn’t need to contribute financially but had to contribute to household chores. Something that she didn’t do when living with my parents. I am a clean person and I like my house to be neat and tidy. At first, she complied. She kept the kitchen clean, did her assigned chores, and would always clean up after herself. Then recently around two weeks ago, she started slacking. 

She wouldn’t do the dishes on her day, trashed the guest bathroom, messed up the living room by leaving her clothes everywhere, and would not put things away. For example, she made a sandwich and she didn’t put away the bread, the vegetables or the condiments! It was infuriating. I work 5 days a week and I’m exhausted. So I spoke to my sister and told her she needs to help me out by keeping my home clean. She just went “okay okay!” 

My sister did start cleaning but it was only after I start nagging and being ‘annoying’. I then sat her down and warned her that I will be kicking her out if she starts slacking and turning my apartment into a pigsty. I said this is my house and she needs to follow my rules if she wants to continue living with me. 

Fast forward to two days ago, I invited my friends over and I told my sister to clean the guest bathroom and the kitchen, and just tidy up the living room because my friends were coming over and I was at work. So I wanted the house to be clean when I got home and I would just prepare snacks. Well, my sister didn’t do any of that! When I came home, the house looked extremely messy and it was not like that before I left. Dishes in the sink, food in the countertop, blankets in the living room, even the guest bathroom was messy. I lost it. I screamed at my sister and told her to pack her shit and get the fuck out of my home. She cried and begged me to give her another chance and I said no. She had one fucking task and she didn’t do one thing! We argued some more until she tearfully agreed to leave. She packed her bags and left. 

I quickly cleaned my house and had my friends over like normal. My parents are on my side but my relatives are giving me grief for kicking my sister out and they called me evil and a control freak asshole. My sister is staying with my aunt as my parents refuse to let her stay with them. 

Am I the asshole? 

Edit: another issue is my sister would hog the washer and dryer. I do laundry once a week or sometimes twice a week. She would be so lazy to do her laundry that she would wait until her laundry basket is extremely full and she would take forever to finish. This would cause me to sometimes miss my day to do laundry as she would take an entire fucking week to do her laundry and I did speak to her about this and told her to stop. Of course she didn’t listen so I locked the laundry closet by purchasing a lock with some sort of rope to prevent her from opening and it worked. She had no choice but to go elsewhere to do laundry. 

I’ve also been super pushy with her regarding the kitchen mainly because my kitchen is open space and it’s the first thing that I see when I come home. So seeing the kitchen messy is quite an eyesore for me and makes me anxious. 

Edit 2: as for the dishes, I told my sister I didn’t care how she did them. Either hand washing or using a dishwasher. I don’t care! I want them clean and out of sight! So I did give her some options on how she did the dishes. 

Update 1: my mom called me about 20 minutes ago telling me that she wants us all to meet sometime this week to have a talk with my sister about her not following house rules and perhaps see why she acts so defiant when it comes to following them. My aunt also called me explaining that she can’t have my sister stay with her for long because there’s just no room. My aunt has 3 kids and there isn’t room for my sister so she will also be coming over this week so we can all have a chat and figure out a solution together as a family. I have no intentions on letting my sister stay with me again and neither does my parents. My aunt is letting her stay with her in the meantime. ",0.05
"AITA for ""making our dorm unlivable""? I (19f) met my roommates Tiana (20f), and Cara (19f) two years ago. For context, our dorm is two bedrooms, a bathroom, a living room, and a kitchen. Each person cleans their bedroom space as they see fit. We split up tasks for the shared spaces, and alternate on buying shared stuff (ex. paper towels). We used to have a fourth roommate, Rachel (19f), but she moved out.   
Originally, we didn't have issues since we're similar socially/academically. Tiana and Cara are pretty messy (leave dishes in the sink for weeks, takeout wrappers all over the place, etc.) but Rachel and I are on the cleaner side. Tiana and Cara also create a lot more trash, simply because they order takeout/microwave food, while R and I cook and have our own dishes. Tiana and Cara also procrastinate on their jobs. Rachel and I's jobs (bathroom and vacuuming) worked as a buffer, however, since we could ask them to move their stuff when we needed to clean. Since it was 2 on 2, Rachel and I could also remind them if it was their turn to buy something, so we had a balance at the start of the year.

The problem started a few months ago, when Rachel moved out. I picked up a lot of her slack, but since the dynamic shifted to 2 on 1, it's been a lot harder to keep a consistent routine of cleaning. I've also had an insanely busy second semester (job + research + intense class load). When I bring up alternating on chores, splitting costs, or remind them to do their jobs, Tiana/Cara say ""just do it yourself if it bothers you."" I've been so busy this semester, so I just stopped. I've been cleaning my own things and the bathroom, but I haven't been buying shared things that I don't use, sweeping, wiping down shared surfaces, etc. I also moved some of my stuff, like food supplies, into my own drawers and told them not to touch them.

Within a week, we had crumbs all over, spills on the tables and in the kitchen, takeout food left out everywhere, etc. The trash bags aren't being taken out - Tiana just leaves them on the balcony. We've also had ants show up again (semester 1 problem, that I dealt with), but since my classes/work end after call hours for pest control, no one has called. The sink drain is clogged and smells gross. Tiana and Cara have been ""finding clean utensils"" from the trash. I also haven't been doing some of the ""aesthetic things,"" like organizing shoes or picking blankets off the floor. It's honestly been pretty gross, but I have a sister on campus and I just sleep with her now. 

Tiana and Cara invited friends over yesterday, who were (understandably) grossed out. The friends left pretty quickly, and Tiana and Cara freaked out. They turned on me and said I haven't been cleaning as much as I was first semester (kind of true, but I was doing too much anyway). It escalated into a fight, hence the unlivable comment, and it's since spread throughout our friend group. Most people haven't visited and agree with Tiana and Charlotte, but the ones that have are siding with me. So AITA?",0.01
"WIBTAH If I took my sister's wedding money that my mom gave me to send to her? I (25F) loaned my sister (29F) a lot of money a few months ago. I have a decent job but I have many bills to pay, one of them being my student loan so I don't like to spend frivolously. I however decided to give my sister what would be about six months of my pay from my savings after she had a major house accident and needed repairs done.

I was hesitant at first but she promised to repay me. She had borrowed money from me before but never this much and she didn't pay me back fully those times but she promised she would.

After 3 months she hadn't given me a dime and when I confronted her about it she told me I was cruel to ask her for money at a time when she had wedding preparations and a child, my niece (7F) to take care of. I suggested she could pay me in installments but she said she budgeted her money and there was no extra cash left to pay me in monthly installments.

I was fuming when I heard this but there was nothing I could do until my mother (58F) transferred a large sum of money to me suddenly and told me to forward it to my sis. It was money for her wedding and she couldn't find her account number so sent the money to me.

I didn't transfer the money because my sis owed me. This money though wasn't as much as what she had borrowed but I decided to keep it. My mom called to ask if I sent it and I told her I didn't and why.

She said I couldn't do that because the money wasn't mine and this was stealing. She said that if my sis wanted to give me some of the money after I transferred it, that would be good but I couldn't take her money. I strongly disagree. My sister found out what happened and is angrily demanding the money but I refuse to send it. AITAH?

"AITA for refusing to take a test with my friend? I (18F) and my friend (19F) are both law students. My friend failed her first year so she had to repeat it but that's not the case for me. Nobody really cares if they repeat their first year of law in my country as the success rate for going from the first into the second year in one try is less than 10%. However, repeating the year hurt my friend's pride and she has completely stopped putting in effort in her classes. She doesn't show up to lectures and leaves our mandatory classes early with shitty excuses then complains when she gets bad grades in tests. 

At first I thought this would be temporary and that she'd pull herself together which is why I sent her my homework three times and helped her in our online tests over 5 five times already. However I noticed that because I help her in this way, she has stopped studying altogether and completely relies on me, then gets mad when I have wrong answers. 

My grades aren't the best either, I'll probably end up repeating the year as well but I don't think I'm past the point of no return yet so fingers crossed. However, this really annoys me because she has lost all her ambition and relies on me for everything which brings me to this morning. 

This morning, we had an online test for our family law class and she called me 3 minutes before the start of the exam asking us to do it together. I said no because it makes me lose my concentration and told her that she won't have me to help her in the final so she should get used to doing exams by herself. She got mad and called me a B\*tch and said that if I had asked her for help during an exam, she would've given it to me.

"AITA for not wanting to throw a bachelorette party like the bride wants?  First of all, excuse any grammar mistakes, English is not my first language :)

Before I get to the story, I want to clarify some things about bachelorette parties in my country. First of all, they are not 'tradition"" and the whole concept is 'stolen' from American romantic comedies. The party usually is thrown by the best friends of the bride, the bride doesn't pay anything, she shouldn't know where the party would be or how it will go. Everything should be a suprise.

Now that I've clarified that, let me describe the situation that I'm involved in right now.
So my best friend's wedding is in a month, and last week I was told (or reminded) by her that I should plan the party. Before that I didn't know for sure that she wants this party, it was briefly mentioned some months ago but it was never confirmed that the party is desired. Turns out the bride wants the party and she doesn't want it a week or two before the wedding, so it has to be in the last two weekends of April. 

I gathered all her friends and started making plans. The budget that we agreed on can only cover a dinner in a restaurant or night at a club (we live in a country with low standard and low salaries so we can't throw an extravagant party). We considered renting a house/apartment but the prices are too high. 
So the group kind of realized that we can only afford getting dinner and drinks. But, yesterday the bride told me that whatever we are planning, she hopes it won't be a dinner at a restaurant or a night at the club, because she doesn't want that. She indirectly told me that she wants a weekend away from hometown, or a party that goes from AM to PM. That is impossible because some of the girls aren't available for the whole day/weeked due to work, and she said that 'work is only an excuse, if someone wants to be part of this, they will find a way'. I called her out on that, saying that not everyone can get a weekend off just like that. Then she said that if someone can't come then they shouldn't, we can party without them. 
So now, I'm left with a small budget, a week before the party and no free (and affordable) apartments/houses for rent nor in our city, nor in a different city/town. 

I don't have any other option, but the dinner or night at the club. In order to fulfill her wishes, we need to spend much more money that some of us don't have and leave some people out of it because they can't get a free day.

I'm angry and disappointed. I really think that this type of behavior is ungrateful and out of touch with reality and it seems like for the bride it's more important to have a good looking party (for instagram and other social media), rather than good feeling party. ",0.53
"AITAH for changing my mind about wanting children? When my girlfriend and I got together one of the initial things we discussed were children. We both wanted two children in the future. We said we'd likely look to start a family when my girlfriend is in her early 30s (She was 22 when we discussed this and is 24 now, I am 27 now).  
  
  
Since then we've been on a few holidays abroad and there's a long list of places we want to visit and there's a lot I want to experience. Obviously with work and money, we can't really do a lot of it each year. We're managing between 1 and 2 trips abroad each year (we live in the UK) alongside some weekends away within the UK.   
  
  
Recently I've been thinking about everything we said we want to do and experience and to tick everything off the list it will take a long time. Having children will massively hinder that as we'll obviously have a lot less free time and when the children start to get older, our holidays will be more family focused and when the children are younger we'll be going away less.   
  
  
That doesn't seem as appealing to me as it did originally and I'd rather go down the list of places I want to visit and see as much of the world as possible and and just be able to know I can book a holiday without needing to think about if it is child friendly or if family can look after the children etc. I told my girlfriend I wanted to talk and she asked what it was about.  
  
  
I told her I no longer think I wanted children and told her the reasons mentioned above alongside some others. She asked if I was sure and I said while I'm not 100% certain, I am still pretty sure. She then asked what it meant for us and I said that obviously I'd love to do everything together but I know she wants children so it might mean it is the end for us.  
  
She accused me of stringing her along and lying to her from the start about wanting children and trying to pressure her to stay and give up on the idea of having children which isn't true. She just kept repeating that I have been stringing her along and expecting her to give up on wanting children.

"AITA for not paying these vet bills? So I have a roommate who has a small breed dog. I have a large breed Mastiff. In the year that we have lived in the same house, we have known that sometimes our dogs don’t get along they get into little scuffles. It has never been anything serious though. It’s easy to break up. 

His small dog will instigate things with my big dog. follow him around and stand under him and sniff his junk. it bothers my big dog and my big dog has snapped on him. If my dog and my friends dog are playing, this little dog, aggressively join in and it causes a dog fight. Sometimes the dogs are completely cordial, but we all know how they are and we all have to keep a good eye on these dogs when they are together.

 The other day I was at work, and apparently my roommates girlfriend had let my large mastiff dog into their room, while their small dog was in there. Their room is small there’s not a lot of space for my mastiff to be comfortable in this room. a dogfight broke out between this little dog and my mastiff, and the little dog had MINOR bite wounds, and the girlfriend brought the little dog to the vet. 
No stitches were needed. The girlfriend has messaged me and asked me to pay for vet bills because my dog injured the little dog.

 Am I the asshole for not wanting to pay these vet bills and saying no because it is a known fact that these dogs sometimes don’t get along?  I wasn’t home, the dogs were technically under her care. And in my opinion, she wasn’t watching them properly because you can tell when my mastiff is getting fearful or anxious. I don’t think that they should’ve been in the room together.

"AITA for telling my husband to stop acting a fool in front of my parents?  So I (25f), my husband (23m) and my two kids (ages one and two)  live in a different state than my family. My mom came to visit me for the first time since I’ve moved and she’s staying here for a week. 

My husband has never gotten along with my mom, they both dislike each other and it’s very obvious but since my mom has gotten here my husband has said some remarks for example “yea she’s a woman  she gets so emotional and indecisive” “I don’t even care I am racist these people are so f’ing ghetto” “I didn’t care when the baby kicked or when the baby was learning to do something like I didn’t give a s**t” and “I hate hate hate babies I didn’t like my son until a couple months ago (on my baby’s first birthday) and saying things like “yea I lick her toes” which is not true but that was a joke. 

We have a gaming set up in the living room and we live in a small space and he’s always yelling inappropriate things like “suck my ****” and cussing left and right in front of my kids. I have talked to him about this before and it never changes I hate it when he cusses. Anyways my mom talked to me on the side concerned because he said he didn’t like babies when we have babies and the constant phrases said above in front of my children. He’s been super negative and tries to debate with my mom about the Bible (she’s very involved in the church). 

I have pulled him aside and have multiple conversations about the way he’s acting and it’s grown into a huge argument of him claiming that this is his house and my mom has known him for years he shouldn’t have to impress her and that I hate who he is and I’m obviously am embarrassed of him. 

I told him I don’t care what he says around me together we are a safe space but you should always respect my parents and he’s honestly acting a fool and if this were my dad I would be ten times more mortified. I told him he should have respect and boundaries with my family and I would never talk like that in front of his parents. 

Since that conversation he’s yelled at me saying that if I don’t like who he is then I should just leave and I am being offensive and a huge AH and has since then left the room.  so I want to know if I am being an AH or unreasonable at all? 

I would like to add that we’ve been together for four years. ",0.33
"AITA for harshly warning my fiancée that she's been financially taken advantage of by her mother and sister? My (34M) fiancée (40F) has a sister called G. (34F) and a mother called A. (60F). Her dad died tragically around 10 years ago.

My fiancée is a good-hearted, smart and loving girl who is often taken advantage of because she's sometimes naive and doesen't really like to argue even if that means defending herself from unfairness.

Her sister is narcissistic, cunning and takes advantage of others for her own good.

Their mother A. is not economically indipendent for a multitude of reasons that include health issues and low paying-low skilled job, therefore she needs around 500-700€ extra monthly that so far have always came from my fiancée's monthly paycheck.

Her sister, while economically indipendent as well, working a good paying job and in a financially stable relationship with a richer guy, does not help the mother because she claims that her kids are draining her finances and she's too busy paying her house mortgage and her travels/new car.

On the top of that, in the past, my fiancée's mother has had some justice issues that have caused her to pay a 25.000€ fine, who could not pay on her own due to, indeed, a poor financial situation. This fine has been fully covered by my fiancée while her sister did not contribute at all.

As a result of this monthly sustainment all by herself, my fiancée is not able to save up some earnings for a new car (her poor 17yo Suzuki is about to break down) and she's not able to fully achieve some of her dreams, one of which is buying a house together with me because right now she wouldn't be able to afford half of a mortgage due to the fact most of her paycheck goes for her mother.

When I try to have her understand how this situation is unhealthy and how her sister is taking advantage of it just to fullfill her life without any ""family duty"" towards her mother, my fiancée reacts aknowledging this situation but she struggles and she is scared of trying to fix it because she does not want to argue with her sister.

I'm very frustrated and I believe there's a big unfairness, where one of the daughter has to sustain the mother and the other one is living her life freely and carelessly.

I do not like to have these arguments with my fiancée and when we do my heart feels heavy and full of pain, but I believe she needs to be ""shook"", to ""wake up"" and stand up for herself in an abusive, toxic relationship that's unfairly draining her hard-worked money.",0.1
"AITA for ignoring my friend because of her spouse? So I 29 (F) have a group of friends who hang out every weekend. We used to hang out a lot at our friend “Ana”’s house, but recently her husband has been making really creepy comments towards us (not going into detail but it’s to the point where everyone who goes over there gets really uncomfortable) 

Ana never says anything to her husband and seems to think it’s no big deal. This issue has gotten progressively worse. Along with this, Ana has been expecting everyone to pay for her food, activities, etc and I think we are all just really burned out from it. 

As a friend group, we decided to make a new group chat and stop communicating with Ana. I have been ignoring all of her texts.  I feel like I might be TA because we did not directly share with Ana what the issue was and she has lost her entire friend group. She has been posting a lot about being lonely lately, which has made me feel guilty. 

So what do you think? AITA for ignoring her?",0.78
"WIBTA for keeping the tutoring money when I didn't actually tutor? I tutor the (14F) daughter of my parents' neighbour in English every Monday for an hour and a half. She is one of the students left behind by the pandemic - her literacy skills are about standard for a 10-year-old. She is generally reserved but polite and obedient. I'll call her Ella.

I'm not a teacher or tutor - just a family friend with several degrees in Eng Lit and Creative Arts. 

Ella's mother usually lets me determine the content of my tutoring sessions, but today asked me to get Ella to write a short piece and grade her spelling, punctuation and grammar. I had a similar exercise in mind anyway.

Ella's father dropped her off at my place and she paid me in cash before we started. She was quiet, pale and passive. In under five minutes, she began sobbing, saying that she already has a 2-hour English class on a Monday, an extra 90 minutes is awful, she doesn't understand why her mother is insisting on this and she is exhausted.

I knew a) her parents weren't home and b) trying to force her to knuckle down to work when she is exhausted and sobbing would be a waste of time at best and an asshole move at worst. I'm not a slavedriver. I calmed her down, listened, validated her feelings. Then I got her to text her dad to let him know I was taking her to the public library instead and would drop her home after (her family are my parents' next door neighbours and friends, I've driven Ella around before, I went to school with her mother, so this was fine from a safeguarding standpoint.)

I maintain you need to read to be able to spell, punctuate etc., so at the library, I showed her how to use the catalogue to look up the author of the only book she's ever mentioned liking. I let her borrow it using my card and we searched for more. We spoke with a librarian about similar titles, picked up some brochures about library services to help school students, I set her a book report on the YA novel she borrowed, and then it was time to drop her home, which I did.

I promised to talk to her mother later in the week and negotiate a shorter tutoring session on a different day. She was worried if I did it today her mum would think she had been whining or misbehaving or whatever. So I haven't got back to her mother yet about the task her mother wanted me to set/how tutoring went. I am worried ""We didn't do it, as Ella was sobbing all over her exercise book"" will get Ella in trouble or sound like I'm criticising her parents' parenting and cause tension, so I don't know what I'll say yet.  

Given:

 a) Ella did not write a single line for me today, 

b) I definitely didn't give her the task her mother asked me to, but 

c) I did give her an hour and a half of my time, an outing, a sympathetic ear, and some guidance and tasks in literacy and study...

Should I address this with her mother and offer to return part of the fee, or say nothing until prompted? I am not supposed to know this officially, but *do* know the family's finances and morale are being stretched by the high care needs of an older child. My mother thinks Ella just played me with the old waterworks.",0.14
"WIBTA if I insist on having a parking space over mothers and grandparents? 
My in-laws moved here first, with 3 parking spots(MIL, FIL, GG(grandma). Hubs and I moved next door 9 years ago with 2 parking spots and had 2 kids(4y & 1y). The whole family has decided to live together so my 2 BILs and their families are moving in. One BIL has 2 kids (10y & 2y), One BIL has a newborn. We agreed to swap houses and live with GG since they had more people and our place had more bedrooms. 

Now there are 5 parking spots and 9! cars(MIL, FIL, GG, BIL, SIL, BIL, SIL, hubs, and me). We live in a neighborhood/city that allows street parking but its not the safest and obviously not the most convenient. When we talked about switching houses we talked about keeping our two spots and them sharing the 3 spots + street parking but my SILs weren't part of the conversation and that went out the window pretty quick after moving in.

My BIL towed his truck into my spot in garage bc he can't leave it on the street and cant get it fixed(its sentimental- hes been trying to fix it since grandpa died during covid and isn't ready to let go). He asked first and i said yes bc i didnt want be an asshole and i could park in FIL's spot which was in Hubs' spot and i guess the parking spots are all of our spots even though it felt like mine bc ive been parking there for years. My SILs dont want to park in the street bc theyre reasonably scared and loading/unloading young kids isn't easy. But now we're all swapping spots and tetris-ing and i dont want to be worried about who's parking where and when and need to coordinate with everybody's schedules.

"AITA for fighting my dad on his girlfriend and her son coming on a trip? Me and my dad are fighting over a situation and I want to know if I am the asshole.  
I (24f) have a fiancé (26m) whose work is taking him to a Southern American country this summer. He will be engaged there for 4 months. We are currently in Europe.  
I am going to join my partner for 1 month, taking a 2 week holiday and then working  remotely for 2 weeks. On mutual agreement, I invited my dad (who has always wanted to visit the country we are going to) to also join us for 2 weeks. We were all excited to go and spend some time together, especially as I only see my dad a few times a year (we live in different countries). Additionally, my fiancé and I just got engaged and he and my dad (my only living parent) have only met each other four times over our 2 1/2 year relationship. This would be important bonding time between them.   
I have just found out from my dad that he ‘floated the idea’ that his girlfriend (of 9 months) should maybe join him. I was very hesitant and politely tried to tell him I’d like for it just to be us. However, he already mentioned this to his gf and she got very excited. She also told her teenage son (19) about this and ‘he got all excited’. Now all of a sudden these two people are committed to coming on this trip as well. For context, I have met my dad’s gf twice, quite briefly. She’s ok but I found hanging out a bit awkward. I have never met the gf’s son, and my fiancé (whose work-trip this is) has never met either of them.  
I am quite upset at this turn of events as   
1. I was looking forward to spending some time with my dad and my fiancé in an intimate way (rare opportunity) and now we have to spend our time getting to know new people and small-talking, and also accommodating a teenager in a country that is not the safest.  
2. Flights to this country were not cheap and this is my only holiday this year. I wanted to spend it relaxing instead of with the expectation of ‘hosting’ and curating activities for strangers. My dad says this will not happen but they are already relying on us to book activities.  
3. This is my fiancé’s work trip that he invited me on, and we together invited my dad. These people invited themselves, never having talked to me or my fiancé about it (we have never even exchanged numbers as we don’t really know each other) and I find this quite rude. I simply do not want them there.  
Me and my dad got into a fight about this and he wants me to chill out. I want his gf and her son to not come (nothing has been booked by them, flights are booked for me and dad). AITA for being upset or should I just get over it and let these people come? I can’t tell if I’m over-reacting.

"AITA for getting pissed off over my sister-in-law charging her Tesla? My sister-in-law recently married a physician who owns a Tesla. Naturally she now drives it quite a bit. She lives 2 hours away and comes to visit a fair amount. 

Every time she comes to visit, she immediately backs her car up to our shop and plugs her car in. She never asks if it is okay. She just does it. 

I have looked it up and it is only about $7 to fully charge an EV and we are financially fine. But as I see it, this would be no different than if when we go to visit, I just walked into their garage and helped myself to a couple gallons of lawn mower fuel without even asking if it’s okay. (I don’t have an EV)

Of course if she asked, we would obviously say yes but there is never any mention of it.

I want to just secretly flip the breaker in the shop the second she gets here and just play it off like it tripped it. She never seems to offer to drive while visiting so if I did, she’d get into a car with a really low charge…

I just get the impression that she is entitled to the charge and zero appreciation is given.

"AITA for accidentally starting a fight over laundry (posting for a friend)

I (24f) live with my boyfriend, Ben (25m) and his roommate, Mike (22m). Ben and I have been dating for five years and Ben has lived with Mike for 2 and a half of those years. I moved in with them 1 year ago. The three of us are very close as friends and Ben has even joked about Mike being his best man for our wedding in the near and distant future.

However, since January Mike's behavior has steadily turned for the worse. Mike has become more snappy, more irritable, more controlling, and more aggressive in his mentality towards people getting in his way.

Two days ago, when I was working in my home office and Mike barrels in and very strangely demands for me to unload me and Ben's laundry from the washing machine so he could wash his laundry. I don't normally touch the laundry as Ben is very particular about the laundry and I usually let Ben do it for both of us.

Ben is about ten minutes away from returning home, and I ask Mike if he can wait ten minutes for Ben to return home. He can't wait and continues to demand for me to unload the laundry because he hasn't washed his laundry in weeks citing that Ben and I are always doing our laundry and that's the reason he hasn't done laundry in weeks. Ben and I do laundry maybe once or twice a week.

Sensing the strange urgency in Mike's voice, I oblige and go to unload the laundry. Unfortunately, I open the washing machine and it smells AWFUL so I tell Mike that there's something wrong with the laundry and I need to wash this load again. 

I then offered that if he wanted to just put his laundry in a pile in the laundry room, I would load his laundry in right after so he wouldn't have to.

No this does not work and Mike again demands he get to do his laundry RIGHT NOW.

We live in a very humid place and when laundry smells bad and we don't wash it immediately, the smell tends to stick to the clothes. 

I explain this to Mike and ask if it's okay if we wait for Ben to return home to resolve the laundry issue because Ben knows more. Ben is five minutes away and Mike, getting more agitated, says no and demands I pull out the laundry so he can do his laundry.

I ask Mike if there's something in his laundry he's embarrassed about or something that's time sensitive that he needs to get washed and he just yells that he needs to have his laundry washed because he hasn't done it in two weeks.

I call Ben again because I'm getting a little scared. Mike is at least three times my size and I've never experienced him yelling at me so aggressively without knowing why. Mike, now frustrated, throws his laundry in the guest bathroom and stomps away and locks himself in his bedroom.

Since then, Mike and Ben haven't spoken. Mike just stomps around the apartment ignoring us, even if we're all in the same room.  It has been two days and no one has washed their laundry since.

"AITA For not inviting my grand daughter to Easter because of her Own Wishes? I had all of my children very young. My daughter Lynn is currently 44. She has had a history of mental illness since she was a teenager. All breakups ending in her pulling crazy shit like breaking into ex’s houses and her having to get hospitalized. 

In her early 20’s she told me she was pregnant. That’s when she had her daughter, Sarah.
I knew from the moment Sarah was born that she would need me. 

We lived at the time in a two family house until Sarah was 3. Those years were rough. I heard Sarah screaming and crying almost every night because Lynn would kick her out of the bedroom (they had a 1 bedroom) and she would sit on the hallway floor. In the dark. Banging on the door for me to come upstairs and “save her”. 

Many times, this would end with my daughter and I screaming through the door because she wouldn’t let me upstairs to get her. One time I came upstairs, and found her in a closet. I asked my daughter what that was about and she shrugged.

She screamed constantly, called her daughter horrible names, bullied her.

After my daughter moved out into her own apartment, things got worse for Sarah. I’d come over and see disturbing things that didn’t make sense to me or anybody in our family. She made her sleep and eat on the floor. Couldn’t use her bedroom and I’d scream at her and tell her that I treat my dogs better than that. Eating on the staircase by the kitchen.

She never got her any essentials. I bought her pads, bras, school clothes, anything she needed. I picked her up when things got bad at home.

She didn’t let her shower every day. She threw her in dark hallways and told her aliens and fictional ghosts were coming for her. She kept most of the food hidden or didn’t buy groceries. So I would get her food.

Years later, Lynn kicks her out before she turned 18. I took her in. She had no bank account, license, car, or job. She got on her feet, moved out and she’s 19 now. And she cut me off. After telling me all the stories I felt so angry towards my daughter.

Because she has younger children whom she doesn’t treat anywhere near as badly, I keep a fake relationship with her so she doesn’t isolate her children from me. She comes over for holidays but Sarah cut her off completely.

I’ve told her to please come to holidays for us. For her siblings. She won’t. I told her that she should think about forgiving her mother to free herself. And reminding her that she’ll never know how she will feel years down the road. But I accepted she will have a holiday with her for now.

So on Easter, my son invited myself, my husband, my other son, and Lynn and her children. We all went up there and had a nice dinner.

Sarah texts me yesterday and tells me off. Telling me how horrible I am not not inviting her. But she’s the one who made it clear she will never have a relationship with her mom.  
 Why does she want an invite? I was the only one there for her. Now she’s disrespecting me. Not answering my calls. Nothing.",0.97
"AITA for telling my girlfriend I don’t think she should be friends with someone who bullies her partner (me)? My(28m) girlfriend(25f) has few friends, but her best friend is this girl she met playing video games.

Long story short I started getting bullied relentlessly by her friend. Called stupid, ugly, told “every time you speak it makes everyone else seem smarter”, told “it’s hard to be your friend because you’re so cringe”, and became the butt of every joke, including saying I was a girl, bottom, feminine, etc…

Anyone else and I would have cussed them out but for the sake of my GF I let a lot go, until I’d finally had it and told her friend to fuck off and leave me alone. She responded by belittling me and saying “oh baby boy is angry” and I left their group chat. 

She responded by blocking me. She told my gf she was tired of me and that I was mean to her because one time when she insulted my height and said I was too short for my opinion to matter I told her she was 4’2 and legally not even allowed to ride the kiddie rides.

This wasn’t really resolved but my gf told me her friend said she was sorry, and though I never got an apology myself I let it go.

Some months go by, she falls back into insulting me but less direct. Just comments about how I’m dumb or feminine again. 

I let it go. Again. Until the other night when we were playing this Fortnite tycoon thing my GF wanted to try. 

To summarize this entire situation she spent 30+ minutes killing me, stealing my stuff and ensuring I couldn’t progress in the game despite me asking her to stop and leave me alone. I ended up getting pissed off and just leaving the game for the night.

My GF told her I was mad and she, again, blocked me and said she was “tired of dealing with me” and wasnt “going to walk on eggshells to protect my ego”.

I found the entire thing pathetically immature and she’s blocking me for her own shitty behavior? 

Initially my gf tried to say both sides were in the wrong and i told her that’s bullshit because I’m always getting insulted or the butt of some demeaning joke from her friend and I never say anything.

Ultimately my GF told me she didn’t want to call her out because “I’m not confrontational” and so she, at best, told her friend it was a little mean of her to block me but her friend said she didn’t care and it wasn’t her problem. 

I told my GF I didn’t think it was right for her to be friends with someone who consistently treats her partner like shit and the fact she keeps hanging out with her is condoning this behavior.

I told my GF I still think it’s shitty she would even consider being friends with someone who treats her partner like shit not once but TWICE. Her only answer is she doesn’t really have any friends and it’s fine now because she won’t be mean anymore. 

Our mutual friend says it isn’t fair for me to say they shouldn’t be friends just because of how she treats ME and I say it’s absolutely fair, because if I treated my best friends partner like shit I’d expect them to chew my ass out and drop me.

And lastly, I dislike the pressure that can be felt when your child is invited to a birthday of a person you don’t know, what do you buy them, how much do you spend etc. and that times 20! 

If ppl wanted to give a fiver in card id be totally fine with that, or give nothing but a card, again totally fine. I can’t help but still feel like a shitty parent. So, would I be the asshole if I stated ‘no gifts necessary’ on their invite?

"AITA for setting up a security camera in my rented out bedroom? I have two roommates with pets. One pet in particular absolutely loves me and hangs out/sleeps in my room with me.  When I leave for work, I leave the door ajar to ""close"" my door but the cat can still get out if wanted. 

The other day, apparently, the other animal was in my room without me noticing -- freaked out when I left and shut my door, locking himself in.  

Important piece here is that I had a bag of menthol cough drops next to my pillow that morning as my throat was killing me all night from allergies. 

I end up getting a text later that morning saying the dog was locked in my room, with a bag of cough drops that he could have gotten into and made himself sick.

The dog is tiny with leg issues and my bed sits high. Plus, in my experience with dogs, they're not interested in menthol. 

I get annoyed at the situation and buy a security camera for me room so next time I can verify the dog was actually in my room and that whoever opens the door isn't snooping around my room.  It only takes 2 days for them to find my camera and freak out, kicking it off the wifi claiming I'm violating their privacy in THEIR bedroom.  My camera view barely goes past my door because of the adjacent walls placement to my personal bathroom. Plus, my door is normally mostly barely opened.  I'm also attacked for feeling the need to have some sort of idea what goes on in my room when I'm not home...  My thought is that if you're not in my room, why do you care that I have a camera monitoring MY room?

I have no interest in what goes on beyond my room and bathroom but man are they trying their hardest to pay the victim here. 

And I am looking to move out ASAP after this incident. It's apparent they want the house to themselves and can't just ask me nicely for a time frame I'd when be able to find another place as they'd like to be alone in the near future.",0.17
"AITA for refusing to change my last name?  I divorced my ex husband a few years ago, but never changed my last. I have four main reasons for this: 
1. I like having the same last name as my child. 
2. My qualifications are all in my married name and can’t be changed. 
3. It’s been my last name for so long that I’m just used to it now. 
4. And finally it’s a lot of hassle to change a name (bank, mortgage, doctors, passport etc…) 
Also in my mind it’s just a name, I don’t think of it as belonging to my ex husband or anything, it’s been my last name for well over a decade to me it’s just my name now. 

Here is where the issue comes in. My ex husband is re-marrying this year and I’m re-marrying next year. However I won’t be changing my last name.

My fiancé has no issue with this at all. He agrees with me that it’s just a name. But my ex husband is very unhappy with me keeping my last name. I told him it isn’t his business what my last name is, but he said it is his business as it’s his last name and his bride to be is very upset and angry as it’s her right to have the last name, and not mine. I told him she can have whatever last name she likes, my last name again has nothing to do with her. 

I then started receiving texts from her asking me to please change my last name. I politely, but firmly told her that I won’t be changing my last name and explained my reasons again. She got angry and called me an AH and said that I’m ruining her wedding. 

I’ve since spoken to my friends & family about this. And it’s pretty split on what people think. I believe it’s mostly because it’s probably somewhat unusual to keep a married last name after marrying someone else, but my fiancé honestly doesn’t care and neither do I. So personally I’m not seeing the issue.

"AITA for not letting my husband hang out with a new friend who is a girl? I have been with my husband (29m) for 7 years, married for 1 year this June. We have 3 kids together and have had a very good relationship. 

Late last year he started a new job and has a new friend group. They are all a bit younger than him (early 20s-27) and he has been going out with them often. I don’t mind though because it’s good for him to have a friend group and be social. Last night he asked me if he could go out with his female coworker (22) to get ice cream. I said no and that it would make me uncomfortable him going out with a girl, and he kept on trying to convince me, saying gender doesn’t matter they’re just co workers etc. This exploded into a huge fight, but we did make up.

 I still feel horrible about it and have a gut feeling something is up. I know my husband loves me, and he says he’d never leave me or cheat on me but I just feel uncomfortable knowing he wants to go out with other girls. AITA for not letting him go out with her? ",0.69
"AITA for asking my fiance to split my Amazon prime subscription with me? Me (24F) and my fiancé (26M) have been together for nearly 5 years, splitting finances equally via Venmo. However, I often forget to request reimbursement for shared expenses, and reconcile my receipts at the end of the month. Which frustrated my fiancé. 
A few years ago he asked to use my Amazon prime account which I've paid for since before we dated. He used my account for some orders over the next year or two so one day I asked if he would be willing to split the account. He declined, opting to use his parents' account instead. After this conversation he continued a few orders on my account as well as amazon video. This made me feel kinda of taken advantage of. He tends to be very frugal and will Venmo request me for everything down to a $2 game of pool. After realizing his consistent use of my account, I asked if he was willing to pay 30% of the subscription fee, but he refused, stating he never agreed to it and could use his parents' account. I really don’t like how possessive he is over money and I question the reciprocity in our relationship, as I feel I often contribute more than I receive. 

AITA for wanting him to help pay for the subscription? 

ETA: I can change the password, but I really don’t want to build resentment and a “this is mine don’t touch it mentality” in our relationship. 

He said I can also use his parents account and delete mine if I want, but 1. I haven’t heard this from his parents 2.its not a “household account” so he adds and deleted his CC info every purchase so his family doesn’t accidentally use it (this seems weird to me but idk). Also, to me it feels a bit intimate for his family to know all of my purchases, Amazon tv shows, etc. And I don’t want to know theirs as we aren’t super close. We’re grown adults in our own house and this feels like freeloading off of them to me.

For more context, we both work full time, I make slightly more than him but he has significantly more savings. We split things like rent, utilities etc down the middle. His dad is incredibly frugal so I know where he gets it from, and I’ve even told him I’m not ok with him acting the same way after hearing some of the “financially controlling” issues he has had with his wife. I feel my fiancé has made significant progress in trying not to carry on that tradition, but progress doesn’t mean the current situation is ok.

"AITA for insisting my BF gets rid of his unibrow?  
My [30M] BF has unkept facial hair, particularly nose hairs and a unibrow. He has waxed before but does not maintain it. He shaves his head and is generally good with overall skincare routines. Whenever I bring it up, talk about my own (ie I’d like to set up a wax), or ask him if he’d like help, he immediately shuts down and says that he would never comment on my looks or my body and that I should back off. 

So I do. 

And now I’m stuck dating the man with nose hairs and a unibrow. I find the resistance to it, childish and not sexy. I understand his side of not wanting to be criticized and will try softer approaches, but to me this doesn’t fall under body critiques, but rather under general hygiene. Would he say the same thing if I was asking him to brush his teeth or wash his hands after using the bathroom? I’m not sure what to do next.

"AITA for confronting my girlfriend's adult son? So my girlfriend and I been dating for several months now. Things are picking up and getting a bit serious and there's been talk of me giving up my apartment when the lease ends and moving in with her. To be honest its not my initial preference but she doesn't want to leave her home because her son lives there in the basement and, despite being almost 30, he's not capable of living on his own.  


Her son, who we'll call ""Tony"", has caught wind of this is becoming very irate. Tony and his mom have had some pretty intense shouting matches these last few weeks, and I stay out of it because its not my place. His attitude towards me has been mostly passive aggressive with comments like ""Its not gonna last"" and ""can you keep it down, people are trying to sleep"". I mostly brush it off and don't engage....until this past weekend.  


Tony and his mother had one of their shouting matches and as usual I just step outside for a smoke until its over. Now I should mention that my girlfriend is white, and I am black. I was a little apprehensive at first but it didn't seem to become an issue.   


During this shouting match and despite my efforts to ignore it, I over hear Tony say ""I'm tired of you being a whore, and I'm not interested in having a little n\*\*\*\*r as a brother"". This is the first time I've ever heard him make a racist comment.   


I immediately stormed inside and told Tony that he will not speak to her like that when I'm around. I then motioned to my girlfriend that we should leave. As we're walking out, Tony shouts ""you're just another pile of n\*\*\*\*r trash she brought home"".  


I calmly turned around and tell Tony directly to his face that this ""n\*\*\*\*r trash is worth more to your mom than her 30 year old man-child son currently living in her basement playing video games 12 hours a day"".  


We then proceeded to leave and just went for a drive. She was very upset about the whole situation but eventually calmed down and I basically just gave her the whole ""not room for the two of us"" conversation. She said she needs to sit down with Tony and have a serious conversation with him and that's pretty much where we left it.   


Part of me feels like I majorly over-stepped, but at the same time I feel like something has gotta give. I cherish our relationship and want to fight for it but sometimes it feels like too much and I'm not sure how I feel about her son always being in the background.

"WIBTA if I told my MIL I'm not making her anything else when I found out she let her dog chew up something I made her? My MIL lives with my husband and I. She has dementia. I am an avid crafter and have made her many things in the past that she has either lost, or her dog has chewed up because she sleeps with him and doesn't pay attention to what he is doing. 

I have been hesitant to make her anything for the past few years for this reason, even though she ""loves"" the things I make.

Recently, I crocheted her something, a stuffed toy, and today, a week later, I woke up to find the stuffing all over the house. I checked my box of stuffing which has yarn and stuff on top of it, with no teeth marks, so I know this isn't from our dogs. 

I asked her about the thing I made and she just shrugs and said, ""oh, the dog must have gotten it."" 

I got really upset because it took me FOREVER to make this as I don't typically make stuffed things. 

I have made her blankets, pillow covers, slippers, cardigans, many things. And each and every time, she allows her dog to chew them up or she loses them.

"AITA for being annoyed that my partner came to the opera in gym attire and ate during the play? Due to a project we recently did at work, my colleagues told me we can get free opera tickets, with a plus one. I was really excited, since I love opera, and asked my partner to join me. He told me he would join after the gym and we will meet on the spot. So we meet at the location, and he is wearing gym stuff - sports shorts and a sports vest. He joked how it is probably too snobbish of a place for it, and he took a pair of jeans with him and a shirt, but he doesn’t really want to bother. 

Now, since I was a small kid and we went to the theatre with my school or parents (where I am from theatre/opera/ballet tickets are super cheap for school kids, and it is a very common school activity to go with your whole class) - I knew that it is  basic common sense to look decent at such places. I am no fan of fancy overdressing myself, and my partner knows it, however is it not ok to expect at least plain jeans, and not sweatpants? And not to talk loud, EAT OR DRINK during the life performance on stage?

So seeing all the actually nicely dressed people arriving to the venue, my partner annoyingly said that I would probably want him to wear the jeans, and now we have to find a place for him to go change, even though he is not so keen on it. I was relieved and did not want to argue, so I did not say much about it, and we had to go around the corner for him to change. 

The first act was good, and we went to get some snacks in the break, but due to the long queue we did not have the time to eat them. So we come back to our places, my partner sits between me and my colleagues and with my side vision I see him taking the food out. Now as I mentioned we are adults in our late 30s, and as far as I am concerned I do not have to tell a 35+ year old adult basic etiquette, but I had a bad feeling about it so I turned to him and whispered “don’t!!”. He laughed and I was relieved thinking he was just doing a weird joke or whatever. 30 seconds with my side vision I see him EATING the snacks. I was absolutely mortified and speechless, I poked him with my elbow, but he just kinda laughed and ignored me. I was ready to melt though the floor from embarrassment - I can not BELIEVE I am seeing a grown ass person EATING during an opera, and even worse - that being my partner, right next to my colleagues who invited me here.

A few minutes later my partner leaned to tell me something, but I was still burning from shame and anger and did not reply, so he asked “is it about the food?” and then rolled his eyes, sighed loudly and stopped talking to me. I could not enjoy the rest of the opera at all, and when my colleagues gathered to discuss it afterwards, I was still feeling too embarrassed, excused myself and left asap.

My partner caught up with me outside and was annoyed at me “being so stuck up about such a petty thing”. According to him it was dark, and he wasn’t sitting direct in front of the stage so “who cares, it is ok”. 
I told him it is about how far he sits, it is common sense to not do such things in a theatre, he rolled his eyes and told me “there is no such rule, it is not written anywhere” and that I am “making up some imaginary rules just to go at him”. I really can not wrap my head around this, so I started questioning my sanity. He also told me that in his opinion it is me, who has a problem, and I should discuss it with my therapist “that I care too much what people think” (I am in therapy for different reasons, he was actually the one who encouraged me to start therapy in the first place). I mean it is not just about “what people think” - as an artist myself I find it insanely rude, uncultured and disrespectful both to actors and people next to you to bring food to the opera and eat it DURING the live performance! We came here specifically for this live event, can you really not wait for like an hour?!

"AITA for being upset about my proposal? So (25F) here, me and my boyfriend (24M) have been in a LDR for almost 3 years now. I finally flew down to meet him back in December of 2023. His mother wanted him to fly me back for valentines so I went again then. After that trip we already had plans I'd fly back down the first week of April because he wanted to take me to Disney World for my birthday.

I plan on moving down to FL to close the gap in a year  or 2. But he has made it clear if we are to live together we must be married first to respect his parents religion. I have always not viewed it the same way I find that you should live together first. But I agreed and said if thats how it has to be fine since I do love him and all. I told him back then that I'd still want a proper proposal for it to be romantic and not feel unplanned if that was the case in the future. He knew my dream ring its 500.

Fast forward to 2 weeks before Disney World. I recieve a text from his mother asking for my ring size. She was saying she has lots of rings that dont fit her anymore. Now I started def thinking okay am I getting engaged? I went to my mom and best friend and they said its probably a promise ring which is different from an engagement ring or that maybe she really does have rings for me.

 My trip finally arrives and everything goes good on my birthday and throughout the day we saw ppl get proposed too and I found it so sweet and even said teasingly ""omg you should do something like that for me"".

Once we arrived home. it was 1am and I was tired from walking all day and felt sick from being so full. I was half asleep when he was like nudging me saying I can't sleep yet. I ask why and he says he got me something and asks if I wanna know what it is. I say sure and he pulls out the ring. I look at him and he tells me its a promise ring. So I am already thinking oh its not a proposal, He didn't get on one knee and it wasnt romantic to me since I was in bed tired. But I still found it sweet for what it was.

We arrived back home to his parents after Disney and his mom is hugging me saying congrats and making me show everyone. I am a bit confused and ask my bf whats the big deal its just a promise ring, he looks at me with a certain expression and thats when I get really confused. I ask him again if this is a promise ring or an engagement ring. He says its the same thing. His mother chimes in saying its same thing but Ill get another one closer to wedding.

 I ask oh will I get a proposal then? And she says no that was the proposal. I then talk to my bf in private and start crying saying if a proposal only happens once with us I want it to be special I didnt even know that was a proposal. It wasnt even the ring I wanted not same at all but same price. Plus it doesnt fit me. Id be okay if this was a promise ring but now suddenly Im learning this is my engagement and that was my proposal and after telling my family oh it was just a promise ring now I gotta tell them I misunderstood my own proposal?

"AITA for asking my partner to pay for half of the grocery bill despite using my credit card points to pay? My partner and I have been together for 7 years, and we split our expenses 50/50. I have a credit card that I've meticulously chosen for its rewards points system, and I use it for most of my purchases to rack up points quickly. These points can be redeemed for groceries/goods at our major store.

Here's the issue: when I use my points to pay for our grocery bill, I can't help but feel some resentment that my partner benefits from something I've earned through my spending habits and research. While some shared expenses go on my card, he hasn't contributed nearly as much to the points as I have.

"AITA for being upset I was ditched during and after my own wedding? It was actually a vow renewal,  we got legally married last year with just us there no family or friends, so just now got the “party” all planned.  We had a really short ceremony at the beginning and then partied!
I specifically asked him to please stay with me and to hang out with me as we mingled around because I know how he gets around his friends and usually I hang by myself if they are around.  And he’s like “yeah of course we will go around together”.  That didn’t happen.  He took off and was gone and I legit spent the majority of party standing by myself. ( 98% of the people there were his) Then at the end of the night it was over around 9 so fairly early,  there was a plan at some point,  a lot of the attendees,  were going to go out to a bar to which he decided he was going.  I wanted to go home, with him, and have our “wedding night” .  This was absolutely not acceptable to him because “his family was in town and going to go out too”
So, I stayed home by myself and went to bed while he went out to the bar. 
Next day, I’m upset of course and he keeps asking me why, what did he do? Like how did he not know?  When I explained, it got pushed back on me that I should have kept up with him and he found me 1 time outside when I was trying to cool down cause I was super hot.  So he keeps bringing that one time I “left” and he found me outside. Then told me that I was making stuff up and I wasn’t alone and that if I was it was my fault.

We met online on a friend making app.I was just looking for friends as this is really what the app was made for. My boyfriend and I matched and started texting all the time and i met him in real life at a baseball game as he is a pitcher. I went with my older sister and i met him and his mother. His mother is extremely clingy to her son and definitely gives off the mother in love with her son vibe. I understand as she raised my boyfriend and his brother mostly alone though their dad has always been in the picture just wasn’t bt allowed to see the kids a lot. I know that this is a lot of information and back round but i felt like it needed to see if i’m actually a asshole or not. So i will get the to point. My boyfriend in 2023 lived in boston for about 6-7 months as he wad going to college their while i was in my senior year of highschool. We had a lot of difficulties as he wasn’t communicating the best due to baseball and school though i also was dealing with a lot like my epilepsy and watching my nephew and school. Though i still made my time for him. Face forward to when he moved back. I had lost one of my childhood dogs around the time he was back and i was a reck and i tried to get him to stay the night and i made sure he wasn’t busy the next day with family or work and he wasn’t. He called his mother and she said no as the temptation was still there (he hasn’t been a virgin since we started dating). I was in disbelief that she thought I would want to have sex the day I lost my dog. I lost my shit as my boyfriend doesn’t drive so his parents bring him everywhere. I was annoyed as he was 19 at that time and he was an adult yet he cannot make the decision him self and there have been a bunch of other incidents like this. Now recently i have just been so mad at him as he has been busy with online school, work, family, baseball and “music”. He says that i am not a priority right now as i asked him why he doesn’t try and i am always the one trying to make plans and he never asks about it till the day of and its 99.9% a no. I am sick of trying to plan things and asking to hang out and being shot down. I try to plan things months in advance yet he still forgets to ask.I have so many horrible things going on in my life and all i want to do is see him and he doesn’t put the effort into it.Most of the time when I see him its late at night like 9-11 and i know lost people don’t see 9pm as late but my epilepsy does . I just think I’m the ass hole for trying and trying ti see him when i know he is busy a lot but i feel like as a couple we should see eachother more than 1 time a month. I just don’t want him to feel like I’m pressuring him. I have talked to him about this but we haven’t gotten anywhere.

"WIBTAH if I told my roommate to stop hogging the bathroom? I (f19) live with my roomie (f18) “M” for about 6 months. We live in our schools dorms together, which are basically 2 rooms, 1 is bigger and 3 people live in it, the other is smaller and 2 people (me and M in this case) live in that one. These 5 people share one bathroom and one toilet.

When M comes back from school she immidiately goes to the toilet for her “afterschool poop”. She spends up to 30 minutes in there, every day. I don’t usually use the toilets at school, I don’t think I have to explain to anyone why, so when I come home I need to pee. So if I have to go somewhere immidiately after school, which happened multiple times, I have to leave with a full bladder, damn near pissing myself. Not to mention most of the 30 minutes she spends on the toilets are spent on scrolling trought reels, and not actually doing her bussiness. 

The same goes for the shower in the bathroom. She is usually either in our room sleeping all day, or she is out and returns only in the evening. When she is out I don’t blame her for waiting until last minute before our curfew to shower, but when she is in, it pisses me off when she waits until the last moment to take a shower, especially since she, just like on the toilet, takes forever.

The last drop was when she slept in our room the whole day, didn’t go anywhere, and was mad that she didn’t get the chance to take a shower in the evening because everyone else needed to use it as well. She could have gone whenever during the day, but still chose to wait until last minute to do so. The worst thing is that since she takes such a long time, if I am out the whole day and come in late in the evening, a lot of the time she showers for such a long time that I have no chance to take a shower until curfew starts. She is also hypocritical as she complains about the other girls taking a long time in the shower in the evening, while she once took damn near an hour in the shower.",0.5

My girlfriend is seemingly jealous of this girl who got included in my friend group last year. Which was a shock because my friend loves my girlfriend. 

My friend group and I love indie bands so we go to live shows, concerts, festivals, movies, just typical friend things. 

Sometimes at concerts I get really “messed” up on substances. My gf doesn’t come all the time because she works early in the morning. 

This weekend I went to a show with my Buddy Trey and we met up with the “new girl” in our group.  Carla. 

While I was having problems functioning (I was messed up) Carla held my drink. Then an older woman approached me and started flirting asking for my social media.  I guess my gf got pissed when I told her because I didn’t immediately say I have a girlfriend. 

The three of us (my buddy and Carla) hung out in a hotel room my buddy booked for the night. Carla and I talked and drank. Nothing else. There were other dudes there and Carla and I just happened to spend some time chatting. 

That’s what our friend group does. Nothing happened in the hotel room. And I just asked her to hold my drinks for the night because I needed help. 

I guess then she saw I was messaging her innocently about future festivals outside of the group chat. She asked me which ones I would be attending and other questions about some of the events. 

Apparently everything is “inappropriate to do” in a relationship my gf told me. So I told her. That her insecurities aren’t my issue. She knew I enjoy traveling to festivals and music is a huge part of my life. I don’t think it’s wildly inappropriate. ",0.92
"WIBTA if I asked my boss to make a rule about using headphones in the break room? I’m new at my job (been here just over a month) and I don’t feel comfortable asking people to do things like that. I’d rather request something and have my boss instigate the rule anonymously.

Anyway, there are several people who play music in the break room, and who watch TV on their phones/tablets, all without headphones. As I’m typing this, there’s one girl who’s listening to music I can’t stand, and another girl who’s watching TV on her iPad. To me, it’s just common courtesy to use headphones. I feel like there should be a rule that if you’re going to watch and/or listen to something, you must have headphones. WIBTA if I spoke with my boss about it and requested this be a rule? I feel weird about asking since I’m so new, but I work childcare so I listen to children screaming all day, and the last thing I want on the bit of time I have to myself is to listen to someone else’s audio. Like. Stfu. Some of us are trying to relax and you’re ruining it. So what do you guys think?",0.8
"AITA For Cutting Him out of my life after his seizure  

My (30F)  best friend (31M) had a seizure Saturday night, he had a seizure while showering fell through the shower glass on to the floor, somehow he got up and called me, I drove like crazy to get to his place and rushed him to A&E. I had to leave him there for the night, but was quick to grab breakfast and rush there in the morning, when I got to the hospital I was told he had a 2nd seizure, he couldn't talk or stay awake he was in a horribly rough state. I left him to rest but returned late afternoon when he let me know he was awake, I waited while they checked him out and then we were told he will be moved Into a ward and be admitted, while we were walking to the ward a notification popped on his phone a message from J. I know J had tried to baby trap him with another man's baby, while she was seeing a different man a few years ago, she also taunted him about his ex wife divorce and the fact he was unable to see his kids, which caused him to over think fall into a deep depression and caused a seizure in which he had to have the 1st of its kind arm surgery, I was picking up the pieces for months after she p*ssed off, After this seizure we spoke and he cut her out of his life for his health I told him if she's back I wont be around to pick up the pieces. back to the hospital I see a notification from J and ask him why he's doing this to himself, I don't think it's a coincidence he had another seizure as she is back in his life. I went to his house picked up his stuff and saw the state of the bathroom, I don't know how he survived that, the bathroom was something off of a TV show crime scene, it scared  the life out of me, I dropped his stuff to him and left promptly, this morning while he was still in the hospital I told him I can no longer help him or be a part of his life as its no coincidence he has a seizure as soon as J is back in his life and blocked him from everything.

"AITA for skipping my kids birthday party because I was sick Story goes just like in the title. I have whatever upper respiring infection is going around and called out sick from work Friday. My son’s birthday party was Saturday at our home we just bought. Grandma and great grandma come stay with us and I maintain my distance and avoid contact as much as possible since I’m sick.

Saturday, I skip the party after installing a faucet the wife wanted replaced and resume quarantine. I missed the whole party. Wasn’t there for presents, piñata, cake, greeting or saying goodbye to any guests. It was mainly family as my limited friend group is exclusively in online games. I played video games for the first time in several months. I may play here and there with my oldest kid but I haven’t talked to my friends in a long time, bordering on years. One actually reached out to make sure I was doing ok since I hadn’t been online at all. I had a great sick day. Picked up right where we all left off and had a good time while a birthday party rages downstairs and outside our 2 story home. 

The wife tells me I should have done more to be present at the party even though I was sick. She was upset I didn’t come to eat at the dining table when she made me a plate or even watch the piñata or presents or anything else after I installed the faucet. So, Aita even though I was sick?",0.6
"WIBTA if I ask my bridesmaid to not bring her newborn to our wedding? I (26F) am getting married in October 2024 and I have a bridesmaid Kate (27F; fake name) that just recently officially announced that she is pregnant! We actually found out a few weeks prior but she asked us to keep it quiet until they officially announced it - but the topic of having a baby at the wedding came up and I feel like an asshole because I don't want their baby at the wedding.

Some context, I am having a minimal kids wedding. The only kids invited are the kids in the wedding and their respective siblings, and my niece due in May. I wanted to minimize the amount of restless kids and screaming babies at the ceremony specifically.

My issues: Kate is due 2 weeks before my wedding. I don't mind that she is having a baby, I'm actually really excited for them because they are the first couple to have a baby in our friend group, but I don't really want to have baby at the wedding ceremony. I don't want to ask her to step down because she is a good friend and I want her to stand by my side. Kate's parent aren't close to us so they are not coming to the wedding so there are close relatives that they can have babysit baby for the ceremony at least. I would ideally like for them to watch baby for the reception but I already know asking for the ceremony might be a stretch...

So WIBTA if I asked my bridesmaid to not bring her newborn to our wedding (ceremony at least)? ",0.4
"AITA for thinking my Fiance's career will put her parenting in jeopardy? My (32M) fiance Jenna (28F) aims to receive her PHD in Cancer Biology next year. I couldn't be more proud of her! She lost a loved one when she was little, and since then it was her dream to work in medicine and help save lives.

But her career plans make me worried she could be overdoing it, pursuing goals set from childhood without rethinking and prioritizing.

I make good money, 2-300k/year. I work in business-to-business data science. It's extremely technical, with no work-life balance and my job satisfaction comes from solving puzzles; there no soul in it, I'm just here for the money.

Between Jenna's job and mine, it's pretty obvious she should be the bread winner and I should be the homemaker. I couldn't care less for my job, I love kids, and I'm excited to spend my life working on passion projects, entertaining our kids' obsession-of-the-week, coordinating sleepovers.... I love it all.

So on to the juicy part...

We want a lot of kids but we don't know how many yet... we both agree putting a number on it is just pointless pressure... we plan on playing it by ear and deciding if we want another after each. But we both want as many as we can handle. 

My fiance has lots of options.

Option 1: Soon  
After finishing her PHD, she could become a post-doc while she has our first child, and safely neglect her work for the sake of her kids without it threatening her career or our income. Then once she feels it's time and the early mother-child bonding is over, she leaves academia, enters the private sector as a researcher, and pursues her dream while I retire early and take care of the kids.

Option 2: Delayed  
Jenna freezes some eggs and hits the workforce right away, then down the road we do IVF, she takes a pause from work for pregnancy/early childhood, and we mix in some adoption to get our big family size (bandwidth permitting).

Option 3: Traditional FI/RE  
Jenna steps away after graduating, and is the homemaker while I keep grinding at my job. I'm on track to retire early, in 10 years.

Option 4: Jenna's favorite  
Jenna goes back to get an MD and is the patient-facing spearhead of her own studies. But this just ruins the whole plan of having kids... she won't make enough to support the household, so I'll have to keep working. Meanwhile, she won't be present enough to be a homemaker, and anytime she sacrifices for the sake of the kids, she'll be further *delaying* getting that income, only making the problem worse. I've read enough horror stories of residency to know it can destroy good families.

I don't think this last option is compatible with motherhood.

"AITA For “micromanaging” my girlfriend?  
To keep a long story short, my girlfriend and I are both 25. Living together for a few months. 

She has a vacation coming up this week and made a last min hair appointment. She ended up doing that after work and coming home 1 hour or 1.5 hours late. 

Sometimes I worry with things like that. That’s just how I am. I call her on my way home from work to let her know I’ll be home out of respect. 

So I asked her where she was, nicely. And told her it would have been nice to let me know. 

Then she said she forgot, and said it kind of feels like she’s being micromanaged by me. I asked her to explain and she basically said “When I go out to get a coffee or go to the corner store you ask me where I’m going and when I’ll be home”

I explained that’s what people who live together do. It’s not me micromanaging. It’s just common respect. AITA? ",0.38
"AITA for not wanting to pay my friend back?  about a month ago my friend told me about a party going on at a college that’s about 4 hours from us. we didn’t really talk much on it as she just showed me a couple of videos but we had gotten distracted and the subject changed. the next morning i woke up to a text saying that she booked us bus tickets to go and that i didn’t need to pay her back right now. i never actually confirmed that i wanted to go and was a bit taken back but just said okay. 

last week she reminded me to take off of work the following saturday for the party. i told her that because of financial hardships right now i can’t afford to take off of work and i’ll pay her back for the ticket. the tickets was $83 and i sent her $43 and told her i’ll give her the rest on friday. but throughout the week i really sat on it and don’t really understand why i should have to pay her back for it. i never agreed to go and she brought it without ever really speaking to me. and i can’t exactly afford to give someone almost $100. im a big people pleaser and im learning to break those habits and set some boundaries but i just don’t know how to tell her how i feel.

"AITA for being upset at my friends for celebrating my birthday?  My friends surprise celebrated my birthday with me but invited all their SOs

For context, I am a 30F and happily single (or so I thought), and have had a hard time embracing that I’m turning 30, and I didn’t really want to celebrate being 30. But my two closest friends wanted to celebrate my day with me and make it special and I feel really grateful to have them, so I wanted to reach out to this subreddit to see if I’m being unreasonable for being so upset. 

Last weekend, I celebrated my 30th birthday with my friends. They (my two closest friends) organized a surprise party but then included their significant others in my birthday celebration, neither whom I am close with. So it was the five of us - the two of them with their significant others and me. 

A few years back when we were all single, it would always be the three of us but now that everyone has significant others, we often all hang out together. I have never said anything because one of them will always ask to include their SO and then the other one will then invite their SO and I feel like it would be rude of me to say that I would really value time with just the three of us again, so I’ve never really said anything. I also think it’s difficult to think in a single persons perspective when you’re in a long term relationship. I have been there and realized that. 

They hosted a party for me, got my favourite cake, the present was so thoughtful too. But I never felt more alone in my life. Everyone was holding hands singing happy birthday to me and I just felt so sad. I just can’t understand why we couldn’t celebrate with just the three of us. I never truly feel comfortable when everyone’s SO is there. I felt so left out and third wheeling when the day was supposed to be about me? When I got home I just started crying and now it’s Monday and I still feel upset. I would’ve rather not celebrated my birthday. 

Is it wrong of me to feel really upset that my friends organized this party for me, knowing that they did this because they genuinely wanted to celebrate me? Is it wrong of me to feel this way? I haven’t said anything to them about it and I tried my best to look happy the entire time.   ",0.86
"AITA for yelling at my dad and telling him I hate his dog? For some context, my dad got his dog, Bella, a few years ago. We had two cats (three now) when Bella came into the house. My dad isn't the biggest fan of cats so he got Bella. Everyone loved Bella for a while, but issues started coming in when she got older.   


My dad kept Bella on training pads up until late 2023, which led to her refusing to go outside for a long time. Though, my dad blamed it on me for not bringing her out when it was his dog. He made Bella my responsibility even though I am more busy than him. She's started to go outside normally now, but it still is a struggle.  


Another issue is that Bella's obese. My dad lets her eat anything, like his leftovers, just a lot of human food in general and my cats food. She now refuses to eat any type of actual dog food because of how much non-dog food my dad let her eat. I have tried to get her to eat normally, but to no avail.  


Lastly, she's very grumpy and loud. She barks at everything, unlike most dogs I've seen. Her barks hurt my ears, and it's a pain to get her to stop barking. Bella also growls at literally anyone for just petting her. She gets angry very quickly and I've been bitten by her for no reason more times then I could keep track of.  


Those are some of the reasons I hate her, but my dad disagrees with all the reasons. Now onto what happened this morning.   
Both me and my dad had today off of work, so we sat down at the table and ate breakfast. We usually don't have time to do this, so it was nice to do. My dad started some small talk like how work was and such, all while feeding Bella half a plate of food that we made. I got angry, mainly because he knows I hate when he does this, and he did it right in front of me. So I scolded him, telling him that it's his fault Bella is the way she is. But he only responded by yelling at me, calling me any name he could think of for ruining the mood and judging him, my own father.   


I don't know why he yelled, but it really upset me then, so I yelled back, letting him know I hated Bella and how she was. My dad went quiet, and I did too. I instantly felt guilty, but didn't know what to say then so I ran off to my room.   


It's been a few hours now in my room, I've calmed down a bit, and now thinking about it I don't feel guilty about telling him that I hated Bella now. My dad since then messaged me multiple times that I'm an asshole for 'lying', and that I should go back out of my room to apologize to Bella and him, even though I find it pretty stupid.  AITA?",0.4

I also saw that my boyfriend had just texted me, asking me to read about his nightmare on his channel. I started to read about it, but then received another message from our school chat, which was an important message about our friend asking for help with a lesson.

"AITA for being frustrated about someone else’s wedding logistics? To preface this, I would like to say that I recently got married and understand that guests have unreasonable accommodations and opinions about weddings. I personally think that I am justified by my frustration, but want to hear other opinions!

My partner and I are traveling to a wedding out of state (3+ hr plane ride). Wedding is being held 1.5-2hr outside a major city with no public transport to get us there, so we are renting a car. This was all understood when we decided to attend this wedding and we have no problem renting a car. The real issue comes due to my partner being in the wedding party. The bride is requiring all wedding party members to stay at her house the night before the wedding (1 hour to venue/1.5 hours to hotel where wedding block recommended by bride and groom is, and we are planning on staying). This does not include plus ones (me). Again, totally ok with that. However, my partner will have to take the rental car with them to travel to brides house and to the wedding, with no time in between to pick me up. There are no Ubers available in the remote location the hotel/wedding is, transportation is not being provided to anyone (including wedding party). The only suggestion that was provided by the couple was that we get two rental cars so we can both make it to the wedding! My partner does not think this is a big deal and we should not cause issues by refusing the brides request, but I think it is incredibly rude to expect us to pay for two rental cars on top of the already few thousand dollars to travel! So, AITA for requesting that my partner not stay overnight at brides house before wedding so we don’t have to rent two cars? How would you approach this situation? ",0.02

However, when she asks me for something she will say, for example: “Can you pass me a glass of water?” Or “Can I have a look at that?”

My view is that you should always say “Can you pass me a glass of water please?” Or “Please can I look at that?” She never says please in these situations.

"AITAH Gym Shower Heated Argument Hello, happened a few hours ago I’ll get into it and try to be as non bias as possible, and include only pertinent details. 

Background: ’is a nice gym $112 dollars a month with 80 a year annual fee so it has a clientele which can afford that.  

I was using my gym’s shower, and I was finishing up. I exited the shower stood right outside it and grabbed my towel from the hook outside the shower I was using and began to dry myself off.  I wear underwear to the shower, and I hang my underwear from one of the hooks adjacent to my shower I am using.

As I am drying off I notice a man, elderly but fit, standing in the threshold of the shower hallway about 5/6 feet behind me.  Of the 10 shower stalls I’d say, 8 were available. However the doors automatically close so it could be hard to tell which ones are occupied, I have trouble some times.

I can tell he is getting annoyed and he is looking at me.  I can tell he is waiting for me to finish to use the shower.  I take maybe 1 minute to 2 minutes to dry off collect myself and walk passed him out of the shower hallway.  As I am leaving I tell him “the other showers are available” in a neutral tone.  

He spits audibly into the shower I just used, and mutters something which grabs my attention. I turn around, he states in an aggressive tone, “I don’t want those showers I want this shower”.

 I respond: “I was just letting you know I wasn’t trying to be rude”

“Well you are rude and I didn’t say anything when you hung your nasty ass underwear on the hook.”

“Sir I’m trying to deescalate the situation I wasn’t trying to be rude”

“You escalated it when you made a comment”

I go to repeat myself and he interrupts “*says something I can’t remember*. Then waves at me “bye bye now”

I leave get changed and leave the gym.

It just bothered me to have a conflict like that at my gym.  And I wanted some strangers to weigh in.  Needless to say I won’t be using that shower stall again lol.

"AITA for accidentally finding out my girlfriend has screenshots of her sexting her ex two days before we got together  (Mobile, im sorry) So i 19m and my girlfriend 19f have been together for about ten months, we have always had a really good relationship and havent ever had any significant problems, but recently i got a new job and needed an app for work and my phone couldnt run it so my gf let me use her old phone. 
   While i had her phone i went through her camera roll just out of curiosity to see if there was any good memes to steal cause i thought there might be and while i was there i found some screenshots of conversations she had with a previous boyfriend 2 days before we got together that were quite raunchy, no nudes but just raunchy. 
    Aswell as pictures of him again no nudes just like selfies. So wherein lies the issue is i dont like that she still has them; yes i understand i found them while going through her phone which i generally agree is toxic but i was looking for memes it wasnt because i didnt trust her but, i dont like that she has pictures and screenshots of her previous relationship still when we have been together for this long and now i am having trouble trusting her.
 i dont have ANYTHING from my past relationships at all, no exceptions.

"AITA For refusing to pay for my soon-to-be step daughter's jaw surgery I (38M) got engaged to my fiance (36F) about 5 months ago after dating for 2 years.  We don't have any kids together, yet, but she does have 2 kids from a previous relationship (16F & 12M).  I get along great with her kids, especially her son.  Her daughter, Jane, is definitely in the middle of the angsty, moody teenager stage where she wants nothing to do with her parents.  But we've never had any major issues.  

However, Jane does suffer from Micrognathia.  It severely impacts her self-esteem and confidence.  She's been bullied quite a bit and it breaks my heart to see her upset.  My fiance has dental insurance through her job, but it wouldn't cover the entire corrective surgery, not even half.  They've done consultations and gotten the go-ahead to proceed with the surgery, but the cost is incredibly high.  Even after insurance, when everything is said and done the bill will likely be over $25K.  My fiance has looked into financing for it, but money is tight these days and we've both been saving for the wedding and honeymoon.  

A couple weeks ago, Jane came home from school in tears again after being teased.  My fiance and I calmed her down and during the conversation Jane expressed how much she wants the surgery because, in her eyes, everything in her life would be so much easier if she did.  

That night, my fiance and I were talking about Jane and she asked me if I would be willing to help pay for Jane's surgery.  I have a good job and make a decent living, but I don't have that kind of money saved.  I asked her how much she has saved to put towards it and she said about $5K.  

I told her that I feel terrible for Jane and what she's going through, but I don't have that kind of money.  And the money I do have saved is earmarked for the wedding and honeymoon.  My fiance said she would be fine with a courthouse wedding and no honeymoon if it means that Jane can get the surgery.  

I reminded her that I want a real wedding, not a huge one, but a real one.  And that we've already been brainstorming honeymoon ideas.  She got upset at this point and told me I was being selfish for putting my own wants over Jane's needs.  She told me that if Jane was my own daughter then she bets I would pay for it in a heartbeat.  That comment pissed me off because it was a low blow and I told her that was a BS thing to say.  We kept fighting for a bit after that without resolving anything and I ended up leaving to calm down.  

The next time we talked she did apologize for what she said.  But she also said that she still believes that's true.  She said if I'm going to be a step-dad that I need to treat the kids as if they were my own, which means sacrificing things I want for them.  

I told her that while I love Jane, I can't help but feel like I'm being treated like an ATM here.  My fiance said this is the first time she's ever asked me for financial help and that this will be life-changing for Jane.  ",0.91

The day after my birthday, I expressed how disappointed I was that she had forgotten it again. I told her ""Wishing me a happy birthday is the bare minimum of friendship."" Some of my siblings and friends seem to think I am overreacting and was an asshole to say this as it must have offended her. She's even ghosted me for over a week since I expressed how disappointed I was.

"AITA for saying I never liked my friend's tattoo? We're both F 20s. Sarah got a floral tattoo in 2021 on her upper chest. She's very into fine linework, and that's what she went in to the tattoo parlour wanting. I saw the reference images and while the piece she wanted was quite large, the design style was meant to be very delicate. She went to a licensed but inexperienced artist and they ended up making the lines quite thick and a little shaky, and it didn't look at all delicate. It almost looked kind of like an american traditional style of tattoo. She asked if I liked it when she got it and I said yes; I didn't, but I didn't want to hurt her feelings. It's not an absurdly bad tattoo but you can tell it doesn't match her style or her other tattoos and that it was done by someone who hasn't really honed their skills yet. We only had a couple conversations about it but I always told her it looked good because I think it's in poor taste to tell someone that something they can't change looks bad.

This year she's getting it lasered off for all the reasons I mentioned, and so that she can get it replaced with a more delicate piece. She told me she never really liked it and that this whole time she had been trying to convince herself that she did in fact like it, but now she's realized it wouldn't work and she should just get rid of it. I told her that I was glad she was removing it and that I never thought it suited her. She seemed kind of hurt, and she's being going through some body image issues recently. A few days later, she told me it really upset her that I said I didn't like the tattoo, not because I had lied previously, but because my comment made her feel worse about her body. I said that I understood and I apologized for saying it, but now she's kind of holding it against me and telling me that I'm mean and judgemental. We had a (separate, unrelated) conversation about how I find it very difficult to lie when people ask me for me opinion and I said that I wouldn't tell someone I thought they were ugly if they asked. Sarah was very insistent that I would actually do that and was clearly hinting about the tattoo thing. I wanted to say that I purposefully didn't mention not liking her tattoo (even when she asked me!) until 3 years later when she was getting it removed, but I held my tongue because I didn't want to make her think about her body image any more.

Two of my other friends who I've grown close to, Rory and Lane, are great friends but it's annoying eating out with them. If we're getting coffee it's fine cause we order seperately. But in the three times I've gone out with them to a restaurant, I've had to put my card down cause they just avoid looking at the bill on the table. And they'll take two weeks to pay me back even when though I'll remind them a couple times. Two of the times they  both didn't pay for tip/tax AND rounded their cost down. So I just stopped asking them to go eat out and we probably haven't been out for a month now. I still hang out with them while studying/shopping but not a restaurant.

However I still eat out weekly with my other friends and I'll post pics of it so Rory and Lane know that I've been going to restaurants, just not with them. One of them brought up trying out a new place in town and I said I couldn't make it. They asked if another time would work and I said no sorry. Eventually they were like what's wrong because I'm normally down so I said it's really annoying splitting bills with them and being stingy and I just prefer to avoid that. They said sorry but said I'm making a big deal out of nothing and they're avoiding me.

I come from a wealthy family, which they know, but I work a job on campus and am  careful with my spending money. I'll treat my friends to dunkin or bagels because I love them and I'm not stingy but I can't just pay 80 bucks for their food every time we eat out.",0.14
"AITA for asking my bf to come home earlier on my work nights? My bf (m27) and I (f27) have been together 4 years and live together. 

My bf and his group of friends are pretty close. They work together, take classes together, and in general spend the majority of the week together. Several nights a week (decided spontaneously) they go to the pub and are often there until around 2am (give or take an hour or so).

Two days almost every week I work 12 hour days where I have to be up at 6am and don’t get home until 9:30pm because of the commute. It’s always mid week, never lands end of week or on weekends. I always know in advance and communicate with my bf about these days. This is not new, I’ve been doing this for a couple years. 

We have a very, very small (I can not emphasize enough how small) apartment and a cat that loudly sprints across the floor when the front door opens, so my bf coming home at night wakes me up pretty thoroughly and it can take me over an hour to get back to sleep afterwards.

Any other night I let it slide, however the nights before my long and early work days it becomes a problem. I struggle to get up the next morning and have a difficult time staying awake during the day. Without going into too much detail about my job, I need to be awake and alert during these days as a lot of time and money is at risk if I screw up. Not to mention it just plain sucks to be tired on a long work day. 

I’ve asked my bf to not stay out late the night before my long work days and to come home at around 11pm-12am instead of 2am, so that my sleep on those nights isn’t disrupted.

He initially agreed but isn’t sticking to it and claims that it’s an unreasonable ask when he sees it as only a few hours difference. He says he really enjoys his time with his friends and that it’s unfair for me to police how and when he does it.

I feel that it’s not a big compromise and not an unreasonable ask for anyone living together, not just romantic partners.

It’s caused several big arguments. I see him as being unwilling to compromise and put my needs over his time with friends. He sees me as trying to police what he does. We don’t usually argue and have an overall great relationship so if I’m wrong I would truly like to know. 

So AITA for asking him to come home earlier these nights?",0.12
"WIBTA if I changed me and my best friend's summer trip for a roommate I haven't met? Me (18F) and my best friend, I'll call her Hannah, (16F) are childhood friends; however, I moved away in 6th grade, so our friendship has been solely through texting and calling since.

We haven't seen each other in person for years so we have been planning a type of ""make-up-for-lost-time"" summer trip since November. Ever since the beginning of planning this trip Hannah has really wanted to be there at my graduation and l agreed. This was before I chose a college and started the whole orientation/roommate process.

Now, I found a potential roommate (Emma) I really like online. My college's orientation is overnight, so it'd be perfect to see if we were a good fit as roommates, which Emma was interested in. However, because of the summer trip date, we'd have to go to different sessions.

Let me add that me and Hannah haven't bought tickets yet for anything yet.

I tell Hannah about the orientation and how if she just came two weeks after my graduation I would be able to meet Emma and see if we could be compatible roommates, but Hannah was immediately upset. I feel like she doesn't understand my point of view of going to college and trying to find a good roommate as she's a sophomore. Hannah's been my friend for a long time, but finding someone to live with for a year is more important to me than having her at my graduation. I want to spend time with her, but pushing the trip back two weeks doesn't seem like a big deal to me. I told Hannah I didn't want her to feel like I was choosing Emma, a person I didn't know, over her, but we didn't reach an agreement and llet it go.

The trip would be a month long, which I thought was too long, but Hannah was set on this time frame. We're spending two weeks where I live and then flying to where she lives. Either way while Hannah stays with me l'd have to go to the orientation, so she'd be alone for a night anyway.

We're buying tickets in 2-3 weeks and I'm thinking of telling her that it would just be better to push the trip back.

"AITA For not paying my nana back for my mums funeral costs?  I (f19) lost my mum to a heart attack in June last year. Her funeral was mostly organised by my mums parents, my nana in particular. She offered to pay for everything as she just wanted us kids to have a our final goodbye to mum to be easier, which I was more than appreciative as I don’t really know her as well as my other grandparents.
 (For context my siblings and I grew up in another country and we never really heard from her while we lived there until we moved back 6 years later, even when we moved back we didn’t hear much from her) 

It’s now been months since the funeral and mum didn’t leave a will so my nana and I have had to hire a lawyer to get mums estate sorted out. (She hired the lawyer and said she’ll pay for fees for this too) When I got the paperwork to sign from my lawyer to release the money from mums account into the estate, she called me. My nana called me asking if we could reimburse her for what she payed for having my mums funeral at the family hall ($1700) as she was having money issues. 
I wanted to give her the money but the money isn’t just mine but also my two younger brothers As well (15&17), so I wasn’t gonna make the decision without their input . My brothers and I  decided to put it to a vote and they both decided not reimburse her (which I respect given our past relationship with her). Despite me explaining why I felt we should reimburse her, I couldn’t change their minds. I still feel like an asshole for this but at the same time my brothers keep giving me reasons why I shouldn’t feel bad over it. Am I the asshole though? 

Edit in - I’m aware my brothers are both minors, I knew that when I asked them. The reason I asked was Simply to give them a choice, when I asked my dad on what I should say he said the same thing my brothers did, that’s why I called the vote. ( my brothers and dad have the same view of my nana) 
17yr old brother has a son who was born a month after my mum passed, I asked him because he not only has himself to think about but also his son and we all wanted to split it so my nephew had money for when he’s older as well. I will also add that when my nana called she said we didn’t have to give her anything and I know that could’ve just been her being nice, but I truly feel like she would say something if was really important. If you want any more info just ask, there’s a bit of background information that I’ve missed but I don’t think my thumbs can type for that long. ",0.91
"AITA for dancing with random men when I have a boyfriend I am 23F and my boyfriend is 24M, we both live in a US state known for its country music and southern appeal. I am from this state while my boyfriend is not. We’ve only been dating 4 months, which I don’t think is a very long time but this is the only argument we’ve had so far so I want to know if I’m in the wrong.

One of my hobbies is swing dancing, which (for those who don’t know) is very popular in southern US culture and swing dancing involves 2 people, usually a man and a woman. I’ve been dancing for a few years now, I’ve taken classes and I would consider myself to be decently good at it. My boyfriend has never danced before but I’ve been teaching him the basics. I go to a country bar pretty often, I’d say once a week, and my boyfriend has accompanied me twice. This bar is very popular and a lot of experienced dancers come here just to have a few drinks, dance, and have fun. 

Usually, men will go around the dance floor and ask women to dance, and as someone who enjoys dancing and is always looking to improve I always say yes. The men who ask me are 90% sweet older men who have danced for years and love teaching new moves, otherwise it’s guys my age who vary in skill level. I never thought twice about saying yes when I’m asked to dance with someone, even when I started dating my boyfriend, as I just think of it as a hobby and it’s not like I’m making out with a random man on the dance floor. Usually we just exchange casual introductions, dance to a song or two, then never interact the rest of the night.

Anyways, the problem started when I went to this bar with a couple of my girl friends while my boyfriend was working. I was asked to dance a few times, and during one of these times one of my friends took a video of me dancing with an older gentleman (50’s?) and sent it to my boyfriend with a caption like ‘watch out he’s coming for your girl’. I thought it was funny and I watched the video before my friend sent it. He did not find it funny, he asked if I danced with other men often and I told him the truth (a paraphrased version of above). He got pissed at me and told me that as a taken woman, I should not be dancing with any other guy (even if they’re like 30 years older than me?). He just said it was a respect thing and other men could get the wrong impression.

Obviously, if someone were to try to make any moves I would stop them and tell them I had a boyfriend, but this has never happened as I don’t take conversation with them further than casual talk. I do really love my boyfriend, we have a great relationship and he has never made any other comments like this before, so I’m wondering if this is just a boundary of his that I’m crossing without thinking about it fully. AITA?

TLDR: my boyfriend doesn’t like the fact that I practice dancing with other men at a country dance bar, even if the interactions are completely casual. I find nothing wrong with it and I just think of it as practicing a hobby. AITA?

Edit: those who have no idea what swing dancing is, please look up a video before commenting. Also to add, I never drink at this bar as I have an allergy to most types of liquor and it makes me sick. I’m always DD for my friends and I. I have never once been intimate with a man at this bar and not once have I continued a relationship with a dance partner after we’ve danced, even before I started dating my boyfriend. My boyfriend is the first boyfriend I’ve ever had, and thanks to those of you who asked but no I am not a whore and I am very picky about the people I spend my time with. Also for all of you asking if I would fuck a 50 year old please get off pornhub. After reading all of your comments I will agree that letting my friend send that video was a bad idea, I will apologize to my boyfriend when I see him again. ",0.33
"AITA for wanting updates on travel details from my partner. I, (23f) have been dating (25m) for 4 years. And within this time he has never understood my anxiety over travelling. He's a care free guy who doesn't seem to worry about anything ever which is usually a good thing.

For some back story, I got into a car accident when I was 8 and even though no lives were lost it has left me pretty fearful of cars. Additionally, I also have a very strong fear of flying to the point that to avoid flying, for my 18th birthday my family and i went to Spain, but instead of flying there, we had to take a bus trip because of how petrified I was of planes.

My partner often drives home to visit his parents, they live around 6 hours away from us so I always ask him to let me know when he gets home so that I know that he's safe. But this never happens, usually I message him after about 7hrs and don't hear back from him till about 3hrs later. I can ignore this now, because I am used to it. But at the begging of our relationship this would give me extreme anxiety and I'd pretty much go into full blown panic mode unable to do anything but stare at my phone screen waiting for a ding. 

Last week my partner went on holiday with his brother and some friends to tenerfieff, which I was very excited for him. However he refused to tell me when the flight was and which airport he was flying from, even though I asked him so that I could track his plane because I knew he wouldn't let me know when he landed. I wasn't even told how long the trip was and when I could expect him home.

When the day came for him to leave I begged him to let me know when he got there (I had managed to find out he was flying around 5pm). But I didn't hear from him until the morning after (he apologised and said he was busy unpacking). For the whole trip I got about 1-2 messages from him as check ins which I honestly didn't mind because we're not usually big texters anyway. 

Three days ago him and his friends messaged me to pick them up from the airport to say they had already landed. I had no idea that they were flying home that day and I was at work so I couldn't pick them up. He told me he was going to get an uber back to our place (this was early morning). When I got home from work he was no where to be seen. So I called him, and it went straight to voicemail. 

It wasn't until 2hrs later that he called me back saying his phone was on silent and he was at his friend's house. When he came home I did my best to calmly sit him down and explain to him that I'm happy with him going wherever and for however long he wants as long as he communicates with me effectively about it because I have some level of traveling anxiety and I worry about him.

He said i overreacted and told me that I'm to controlling about this and that it was a turn off in our relationship. Later on his brother messaged me and told me that I was being too clingy and overprotective and I should let him off the hook. 

Aita for being too overprotective?",0.14
"AITA for Giving My Steak to the Dog at Dinner? I (19F) am a vegetarian, which my boyfriend (27M) knows and Im pretty sure i told him to let his family know that before. Last night, his family invited me over for dinner, and they made steak. I just tried to make the most of it and cut the steak up it make it look like I had at least “tried it”. My boyfriend seemed annoyed the whole time and it stressed me out that he seemed to be upset that I wasn’t eating my food even though I’ve been vegetarian since I was 15! I just tried to ignore him and focus on making good small talk with his family as I was too embarrassed to say I couldn’t eat the steak.

Here's where things get complicated and I feel like I might the the AH for. During dinner, I noticed their dog looked extremely hungry, so towards the end when everyone was clearing their plates in the kitchen I gave my steak to the dog under the table. I thought this might have been a good idea of the time so I wasn’t just “wasting” the steak. 

Of course, after we went home my bf got a call from his mom and he basically told me his mom was upset that I didn't eat the steak and she also asked about why the dog might be throwing up, and that she suspects that I gave their dog my food. So now my bf is furious with me. I guess the dog is a greyhound and they just “look like that normally”. I was really stressed in the moment and I feel like my bf is gaslighting me because he was stressing me out about trying to make a good impression with his family even though he knows that I’m shy and have a hard time speaking up! At the same time I also feel awful because I might have gotten their dog sick, and my boyfriend is blaming me for causing it by giving it steak. He says I should have respected his family's meal choice and not giving food to the dog without asking.

I feel terrible that the dog is sick, but I genuinely thought I was being kind. I love my boyfriend a lot and want to make a good impression on his family, so maybe I should have known better. AITA?",0.86
"AITA for scoffing when my wife said she works harder than me So my wife and I have been married for a year now. We have an apartment together, and no kids so we don't have any big responsibilities other than bills. I'm in the military, I work 5-6 days a week and my hours vary based on maintenance priorities and my duty schedule (some days i have to stay on the ship for two days when I'm in a duty status). I get up at 0430 am every day just to get to work at 0630 because of traffic. And the military gives me a housing allowance to make sure we have enough for rent.

My wife was living back in our hometown for a bit after we got married because I was on a deployment for a while, but after i got back I moved her up and she quit her job down there. I made it clear that it was alright to have a grace period in finding a job because i know it is stressful moving to a place you've never been to before and not knowing anyone etc. But really i just wanted her to get a part time job at some point so she can at least pay for her car and insurance because me paying for it all would be a stretch.

Fast forward, she finally got a job even though she kept complaining that she didn't want one, saying thay she could sell her car and stuff so we wouldn't have to worry about paying for it, but I pretty much told her that she needs to get out of the house because like i said before we don't have any kids or anything and I want to help her make some friends and have social interactions that aren't just me. I really want to help her get comfortable here but she isn't making it easy. 

Today we ate dinner, everything was cool, and then i got up to put our laundry in the dryer and I was about to go to my desk and play some video games and she said ""why don't we sit on the couch and cuddle"" i scoffed and said ""but it's video game time"" (something she gets cuz she's always glued to her games too) and she said fine and to play my ""stupid"" game. 

I said no and decided to sit on the couch anyway and cuddled up to her and she was being cold. I asked what was wrong and she said ""if it's such a chore to hang out with me just go play your game, i just wish you would cuddle with me after a long day at work"" and i said i had work today too, and she said ""i worked longer than you, my shifts are always 8+ hours, you always get off at around 2pm"". I reminded her that i get up at 0430 am for work for 5-6 days a week and only get 2 days off a week max while she works part time(and she just got this job 3 weeks ago) and she then added that her job is more physical and I just ""sit at a desk all day"" and I scoffed and said ""yeah you work SO hard"" out of anger and she went to our room. 

I'm aware i could have been more mature in my response to this but it's been really frustrating me that she has to make this seem like a competition instead of us being a team. It makes me feel like what I do for us isn't enough for her. Hell I take care of pretty much everything financially except her car and insurance and I even help around the house chore wise.",0.93

"AITA for essentially wishing death upon my best friend right after I cancelled our planned trip together? Me(16F) and my best friend(17F) have been dreaming about this trip forever. It was supposed to be right after our SSCs(board exams). So because our SSCs are over(a month ago) we've been planning for this trip since. My mom(40F) was supposed to go with us as our guardian since we're both minors.

2 weeks ago, my mom had a heart attack. She didn't die, and was admitted to a hospital. Needlessly to say, I am devastated and not in the mood for the trip anymore. My best was sad for my mom too obviously. But I didn't think I needed to formally tell her that the trip is being cancelled. 

It's important to mention at this point, my best friend's mom died giving birth to her but it doesn't affect her too much. The closest thing she had for a mom is her aunt and my mom, neither of whom she cared for much. She said, and I quote, ""it's whatever. I don't really miss her because how do you miss someone you never met? I hate it when people look at me with such sorrow as if I'm this pitiful being, like wtf dude?""

Our flight was supposed to be yesterday, so the conversation I had with her is of the day before yesterday- she asked me if I needed help finish packing (bc I already started packing before the whole incident with mom happened). I then realized she was under the assumption that we were still going on that trip, so I told her I couldn't 'because of mom'. She thought I said that in a sense that we couldn't go since we didn't have mom as a guardian anymore, not because I wasn't mentally in the state. So her solution was, to bring her older cousin as our guardian. Idk why, I got a bit mad that she really didn't understand so I went into depth and patiently explained all the details of why it wasn't possible for me to go, and that we should give the tickets to someone else.

After all, we were both looking forward to this trip and I get why she was upset this trip wasn't happening anymore. But she was bitter about it. She was ranting a lot, and at a point she told me, ""at least your mom isn't dead, you should be grateful."" I got mad when she said that and the next thing I knew, we were hardcore arguing. It reached a point where she said ""I wish your mom fucking died"" and I only remember seeing red and not thinking properly, I told her ""I wish you died instead of your mom"" The argument stopped and she looked at me with such hurt in her eyes. As I said, I wasn't really thinking properly at that moment. I was so mad at her. 

But now, giving more thought into it, her annoyance was justified because we put so much effort into this trip and for it to be cancelled so last minute and she doesn't know how painful it is for me to see my mom so sick bc she can't relate to the feeling. I know she didn't mean what she said about my mom and I didn't mean what I said either and the guilt is eating me up. I want to apologize to her but I think I need to give her space. I hope she knows I never meant to intentionally hurt her.

We have two kids under 5 who are champing at the bit to see him by his arrival. Often times he comes home right before bedtime and it would just be easier if I could track his return rather than ask and wait for his response, especially if it’s the witching hour and my kids are nipping at my ankles (and the less I’m on my phone the smoother my solo-parenting parenting experience is).

Additionally, he occasionally goes out very late on a weekend night and doesn’t look at his phone or check in for hours at a time. If I wake up and check his location and I see his dot moving around I feel confident he’s safe and go back to sleep.

30 minutes after he was supposed to arrive I texted him asking if he was on the way to my place. He replied saying that he wasn’t coming (He did not tell me that he was not coming and was saying he would come before) and I asked why. He said he was with another friend who he just met a while back, and won‘t come for the sleepover at all.

I was extremely upset so I wanted to ditch him back sometime later. I got a chance to do this when he also invited me for a sleepover (the friend he ditched me for was also invited) so I did almost the exact same thing that my friend did to me. The only thing I did different was instead of ditching him for another friend, I just went back home and relaxed all afternoon because I had barely any friends.

"WIBTA if I filled out a kidney donor questionnaire without my dad’s knowledge? I (30f) am a single mother living with my parents.

We (as in siblings and I), knew something was wrong, because a kidney transplant place (dialysis center? I’m an idiot, whatever) left my sister a voicemail, they somehow had her number on file but not his.  

We weren’t supposed to know anything, apparently. He didn’t want us to. Didn’t tell us.

In passing, a couple of weeks ago, with zero knowledge of what was going on, I said, “you know, Dad, if you need a kidney, just let me — “

“Shut the hell up,” was the response. Okay. Good pep talk lol.

So, the other day, I took it upon myself to snoop in his room. I understand that that’s not cool of me. But to know my dad, you have to know, he’s a man of few words. This isn’t information he would ever volunteer to us. So I invaded his privacy and found the answers I needed.

I found the paperwork for his recent kidney transplant evaluation. I took a few pictures, and it says, verbatim:

“Please note that you are in the evaluation phase. You are not yet listed for a kidney transplant. Your listing status will be determined once you have completed your work-up and your information is presented to the team. I will then contact you and send you a letter notifying you when you have been placed on the kidney transplant waitlist.”

A few paragraphs down, there is a URL for a questionnaire, for any friends/relatives interested in applying to be his donor. 

Would it be wrong of me to apply? Knowing he wouldn’t want me to? Clearly doesn’t want me to?

I also understand in doing this, he will eventually find out. But I’d give him my kidney tomorrow, assuming I’m able. AITA for approaching it like this? Behind his back? WIBTA if I filled out the questionnaire?",0.62

Meanwhile, an hour or two passes by, and I hear a sound, so I take off my headphones, and I look and see that the door is opened by these two random strangers. I walk over, and they say, 'We are here for the speakers and maintenance.'  
So in my brain, I think, 'What are these two strangers, but they also have a master key to unlock, so they must be legit.' So I don't question them, and I put back my headphones and continue gaming since they even have their uniform. I'm still gaming, and they ask me, 'Is someone in this room?' I say, 'Let me check,' so I knock at the door since it's Janet's room and say, 'Some guys are here for maintenance and speakers.'  
Janet is confused and says, 'What do you mean? Give me a second.' A while later, Janet comes out and lets the random guys in, and they leave after a minute or two. A few hours later, Janet tells Leo what happened, which then Janet is upset with me and says, 'I should've let her know and should've stopped playing, and those guys could've been robbers.' I should also mention these guys mention that they sent an email ahead of time, and my sister claims she never received one. So am I AITA?",0.98
"AITA for asking for MY money back I loaned a close friend some $ for her rent numerous times. It’s been since Oct 2022 (3m after my late-boyfriend passed & I was in distressed still), when she first asked me and I helped. A few months later another loan. The last time was in May 2023. I was struggling but still gave her what I had.

For the past YEAR, I have reminded her about paying me back but never blew up on her about it. Every time I reminded her, she would say she’ll pay me back in the next couple days and never does. She has asked me numerous times about method of payment. We live in 2024 and she still tells me she waits on $ transfers from account to account that takes several days but never actually sends me the $ she owes me. She is constantly taking flights, Napa, lives in the most expensive cities in the U.S. and has been unemployed for 2yrs now. Since it’s coming to be a year since I last loaned her $, I got annoyed and pulled up all the receipts of times she told me she’d pay me back. It was at least 2-3x a month. Are people really THAT forgetful? I feel like owing ppl $ is one of the last things I’d forget. Anyway, after pulling up receipts, I confronted her about it and expressed my frustration, telling her she is leading me onto believe she’ll pay me back but never does. She calls me crying and saying everything I’m telling her is making her anxious etc etc, saying we should discuss this over the phone but I don’t feel like there is anything to discuss? Other than she owes me and won’t pay me back. We do talk on the phone and it’s literally full circle, leads to nowhere and she says she doesn’t know what to say??? LMAO??? We’re both damn near 30 and I don’t want to have these issues. ",0.01
"AITA for not letting my mom pick a movie? My (45f) mother (88f) is staying with me for a few months. She, I, and my son (15m) were going to watch a movie together. My mother is legendary in my family for both failing to clearly communicate her wishes and also pouting/crying/yelling/silent-treatmenting when she doesn’t get exactly her way.

My son and I tried to find a movie that all three of us could enjoy. During our search, she mentioned one movie in particular. She asked if we had seen it and mentioned that it was supposed to be really good. My son and I had already seen it and didn’t love it. We kept looking for something else for about 15 minutes, but she wouldn’t really give her opinion on any other movie. Her response to every other suggestion was “fine,” “whatever,” or just silence. We found something that I really thought she might enjoy and that my son and I were also interested in. She said it was fine, and we put it on. If she had said no, we would have kept looking.

She got up immediately and went to her room. I tried to stop her by offering to find something else. After the movie, she came out, seemed sad/mad like she does when people don’t do exactly what she wants and said that I shouldn’t have told her that we could watch anything she wanted. I don’t remember having said that, and I don’t think I did. I explained that my understanding was that we were going to try to find a movie that we would all hopefully enjoy.

Now she’s sad/mad (which is kind of  her normal state), and I’m feeling guilty for not letting her watch the movie she wanted. My son and I genuinely didn’t want to watch it again, but she is my guest and my mother, and I feel like it might have been petty of me to not just watch what she wanted. Honestly, if she were a nicer person, I think I would have happily watched her movie. That’s what makes me think I may have been petty by not watching it.

AITA for wanting to save and buy my boyfriend a PC for our anniversary?  This recently happened about last night and today. I wanted to buy my boyfriend a 1200$ PC for our one year anniversary or for Christmas but he told me that he didn't deserve nor want it but I kept pushing it. We eventually got 3 of our friends from our friend group for opinions and they said that I should have respected his decisions the first time he said no. I honestly don't know what to do and I need people's opinions on this cause I feel like he is eventually going to break up with me for wanting to buy him something. AITA? ,0.5
"AITA for telling my wife that “being tired” is not an excuse skip meals? So recently my wife (we are both 34 I’m not sure if that matters) has been skipping cooking meals or preparing real food in lieu of eating candy, chips, and whatever other easy snacks come out of a bag, when I’m not home. 

My wife works from home and I work noon to 9pm, so she typically eats lunch and dinner alone at home. I have a cafeteria at work so I’ll usually eat a sandwich and soup there, and whatever dinner option they’re serving (pretty good food, all “real” food and chef prepared. It’s a good job). 

I’ve noticed lately that the kitchen has gone unused for about a week on end aside from the toast we make in the morning and the coffee pot. Normally there will be some activity of cooking, leftovers in the fridge or pots in the sink or something. We have a routine, if my wife makes a meal with an extra portion to feed me, I’ll wash the dishes when I get home. Often I’m peckish after work and she doesn’t feel like washing up, so this is typically a 3-4 night a week occurrence.

Recently however the kitchen has gone unused and I’ve thrown away quite a bit of moldy food from the fridge. I asked my wife what she’s been eating (joked that it must be good since it’s always gone and the kitchen is sparkling clean) and she tells me she’s too tired to cook and doesn’t feel like it, so she’s been eating chips and snacks for all her meals.

I’m concerned that I have noticed a downturn in her energy (presumably from not eating much actually food and just eating candy) and I’m concerned that her diet will not have any balance whatsoever and she could get sick from only eating garbage for most meals. I told her that being tired isn’t an excuse to not eat enough real food. This somehow became me being an asshole for telling her that she needs to be proactive and be having at least 1 nutritious meal per day otherwise she could get sick. She claims this is “insensitive”. I told her that frankly her body systems don’t care about that and can’t function off just candy. We are both fairly active and health conscious and I don’t want her to start losing the energy to live her lifestyle from avoiding real food over some tiredness/possible laziness of not wanting to prep (I obviously didn’t call her lazy I just don’t know a better word for it).

"AITA  for not wanting to take my girlfriend AND her friend to the airport? I (25) live with my girlfriend (24) and have been together for 3 years. I only recently got my driving licence and for most of that 3 year period she has been driving us about, for which I am genuinely grateful. She is going on a girls trip to Thailand to visit a friend that lives out there who she rarely sees anymore and has planned the trip for well over a year so is excited.

She asked if I could take her to the airport (for context, the airport is roughly 50 miles away and would be 1hr15 mins considering traffic). I was more than happy to take her to the airport. Why not, she drove me everywhere for a long time and I was looking forward to returning the favours. She then asked if I would also take her friend, who is staying locally. I said I would be uncomfortable doing so as I have only recently passed and I wouldn't like to drive her friend as even though it is the same trip, it makes me feel uneasy especially as they would be talking (which is normal), laughing (also normal) but I feel it would be distracting. I said, couldn't her friend just make her own way there. However, my girlfriend told me that she would feel weird going separately as in the past when they have gone on trips together, her friends dads would take all of them and she would like to do the same. I said I wouldn't be comfortable and she was understanding and said that she would ask her friends dad to take them.

  
Fast forward to today- she has again asked if I can take them there, with the assurances that they won't be overly loud and I could play my own music (not the headache disney musical stuff I suspect they would want to play) to make myself feel comfortable. She also said that the return journey is at Heathrow... For any UK readers, you know how daunting this would be (TRAFFIC). I would genuinely do it if it were just her but I don't know why it feels daunting when its her AND the friend. I said that I would drop them off for the flight but not pick up from Heathrow as it is too much of a journey. She is very grateful but I only said yes because I felt bad but I am seriously considering going back to her and saying, I'lll just take you and your friend should find her own way.

"WIBTA if I threw away an ex’s family album. So, I was going through a rarely used closet and found some boxes I just threw in from a previous move. The box was placed there 13 years ago and promptly forgotten. I’m doing some spring cleaning and rediscovered it. Here lies the problem, in this box is a family photo album belonging to an ex I haven’t spoken to or seen in 20 years. I was a degenerate bastard when we dated and she to this day has me blocked on social media, rightfully so. We have no mutual friends, I have no way of getting it to her without stalking her social media…. This album predates digital, if it’s gone it’s gone… Should I just toss it?",0.56
"AITA: Commenting on SO’s spending habits I (27F) and my SO (26M) have been living together for 2 years. We earn the same income. 

I previously owned the house we live in before my SO moved in, and have no student debt. My SO has a significant amount of debt: student debt and otherwise. 

We both want to move towards buying a different house together; my current place is a small condo. My SO especially wants this. 

Due to the above (that the house is legally mine, and my SOs debt load), we’ve agreed that I pay 70% of all household expenses (mortgage, utilities, property tax, etc) where as SO pays 30% - in order to allow him to pay down his debt and get us to our goal of getting a bigger home together. We arrived at the 30/70 as well as this makes our total monthly expenses equal - so factoring in his debt payments for him. 

However, my SO is not only failing to pay down his student debt but:
-has repeatedly extended his loan term to lower the payments 
-often is late making his portion of mutual bill payments and asks me to cover it till he can pay (he always does eventually though frequently weeks late)

And - this is the main source of contention - in my opinion, he has a severe online shopping habit with parcels showing up nearly daily. 

If I mention the financial issues (ie how I don’t feel he’s meeting our agreement) or question his shopping he gets upset and has told me I’m making him feel controlled and that I’m infringing on his financial autonomy and that my behaviour is abusive - that I own the house so why should he pay more? 

I’m worried I am being controlling/abusive. I admittedly don’t always handle the convos around his shopping well; because trying to discuss it so often leads nowhere I try not to say anything but I know I get noticeably upset and he’ll pick up on it and he says he feels like he’s walking on eggshells as a result. 

I do believe in partners having financial autonomy with discretionary income… I just feel like I’m really supporting us both. I also know I own the house and thus am the one building equity, but when we buy a house together it’ll be owned 50/50 so he is also benefiting equally from the equity in this home, even if his name isn’t on it… and with rules around common law in my state, if we did separate he’d be entitled to 50% of the houses increase in value from the time he moved in despite only contributing 30%… a fact he’ll sometimes bring up when we fight. 

So while I do feel some of my concerns are justified… AITA for nagging/getting upset/questioning him on his spending?

"AITA for thinking that my bridesmaid tried to hijack my bacheloretteweekend? i recently had my bachelorette weekend and one my friends (who bless her, she helped plan and organize it) behaviour is leaving me feeling super dissapointed and mad. we travelled for my bachelorette and i feel like she made this entire weekend about her. in the beginning i did not look at it like that but after reflecting on it I feel mad at the fact that she did stuff purposefully to hijack this weekend and maybe just fantasizing about it being her bacheloretteparty.

so this all started with the fact that she was on her phone on the intire flight to our destination which i just dismissed and thought maybe they all were planning what to do on the weekend. we get to the hotell and get ready for bed and she is on the phone while my other friend is trying to sleep right beside her. I went to their room after 30 min as everybody could hear that she was on the phone. she informed me that she recently started talking to this new guy and that was who she was talking to. this was after i went to ask what was happening and she got annoyed by me and my friend talking so she went to the bathroom to finish talking to him before coming back to inform me. i was honestly happy for her but couldnt understand why she would bring it up and make this 4 day situationship a big deal. she ended up talking to him for two more hours after we all went to bed that day. this constant talking to him kept happening the entire weekend. (talked to him the next morning, texted him throughout the day, sent him flirty pics of herself all while being with the entire bridesquad).

that night we ended up going clubbing and while we were in the club she talked to him on the phone for maybe (15/20 min) and this was right infront of us.  when we got home and got ready for bed she ended up talking to him again. this also happened the morning after.

this particular day i got super annoyed as we all got ready to check out of the hotel. while some of the girls cleaned up the rooms she was under the covers (in the same room) TALKING TO HIM. that felt so disrespectful not only to me but also to the girls that were cleaning up. at that point i couldnt even look at her but we got through the day and at the airport on the way home she came up to me and said: i am sorry if i was talking with him to much on this trip. as if she did not notice how annoying it was and how embarrasing it was for me to explain to my other friends that this was all for a freaking 4 day situationship. just by reading this story you would guess we were all 18-20 year olds, but we are all 26!  
sorry for the rant but i feel defeated and do not know what to do about her. do i tolerate this? do i just ignore it considering she did such a good job planning it and everything? i can not stop feeling like she purposefully did all of this to take the attetion away from me.",0.96
"AITA for thinking my bestfriend is jealous? Hey, I have a best friend called adam for almost two years. Adam is so sweet, helpful, every good sign is in him. I love him with my whole heart, but I just started noticing that since we ever talked, he always wanted to shine while putting me behind his shadow. 

For example, me myself, I have confidence issues about my looks through a history of bullying that he knows about. Whenever we talk, I hype him up, but he doesn't do the same back. 

Then, when I talk about myself or bring up my looks in a good way, either adam says ""you're not all that"" or changes the subject. When I tried doing the same thing to him, he became savage and brought up how I am insecure and that I always need attention to feel pretty. 

I said sorry because it was me who started the fight, but then this always started to repeat every single time. I talk about myself, adam changes the subject or says ""those people hyping u up are so dumb"". Or when I tell him about a guy I like and the attention he gives me, he says ""oh hahah you're not special"".

One time a guy wanted to be in a relationship with him right after the first convo. I went up to adam and told him how the guy complimented my looks and how it went. He said ""don't worry, that guy is a player and surely didn't choose you for your looks"".

Well, okay let's say that the guy is a player, but why would he mention my looks and bring me down? He should've said the guy is a player and shut up! This repeated over and over until I realized that my best friend is a narcissist.

 I told myself to never bring my looks to our conversation. Until yesterday, I fought with another friend who is both our friend. I went up to adam to tell him the problem. It was clearly jealousy because the dude I fought with told me: ""why does everything you want becomes yours, why you and not me"". Literally, that's what he said. When I told my best friend that this is clearly jealousy, he told me "" you're so dramatic, he isn't jealous, it's just you who likes to always be a show off. Trust me, you're not all that and all those hyping you up are dumb. Stop this fake confidence, you're not all that, you're going worse"".I copied this message; it's literally what he said. I simply said ""okay bye"".

 Talking about looks, I look better next to him, but he's a narcissist, and deep down, I know he's insecure. But couldn't he just not put me down when he knows I have terrible self-confidence issues?

 Whenever I wear something new or change my hair, adam is negative. The one time he said ""you look gorgeous"" and I said ""ohh thank you"", he said ""oh just kidding, you ain't all that"" and he was dead serious. Through those situations, please tell me, is my best friend secretly a hater?",0.62

i talked to all her teachers and they all said the same things. my daughter is amazing and extremely smart and never gets anything other than a perfect 100. one of the teachers even said that she has never had a student as smart as my daughter. imagine how proud i was. so i told my daughter ""you know what? you are getting that ps5 you always wanted"" and she was so happy.

I.E, I openly have very bad adhd and I was joking about it (gotta laugh instead of cry) and she berated me infront of the entire group because I “don’t seem like I have adhd and it’s disgusting that I would make fun of people with it” .. that’s just one of many instances she has done this..I met Tracey through her ex boyfriend who we’ll call George.

"AITA for asking to see my girlfriends texts to her “friend” I’m not very good at explaining things or telling stories, so please bear with me. My girlfriend and I haven’t been together for long, but we have been seeing each other for years. Before we got together officially, there was another man who liked her, and she liked him. After we got together, they still decided to stay friends, and they are in a group of friends, so I guess it would be a bit awkward to stop talking fully.

 Staying friends with each other was fine with me until he decided to kiss her, and she did nothing to stop it, which obviously upset me a lot. We had a conversation about it, and she said she made it abundantly clear to him that they are just friends and that can’t happen again or anything like that, so I trusted her to stay just friends with him. However, then I caught them sending very flirty messages to each other, definitely not stuff that friends say to each other, and hanging out together behind my back without telling me, even though I said I’m not comfortable with them hanging out alone, to which she says, “I won’t be told what to do; I’ve been in controlling relationships before,” which I guess is fair, but I just don’t like the lying. 

After that, she then made it very clear again to the guy that they both have to respect me and can’t keep talking like that, so all was forgiven. I ask for proof that they still aren’t talking to each other that way, but she hides her phone and won’t let me see. “Out of principle,” she says, and makes me feel like an asshole for asking.

back in with parents after a month long hospitalization

ive been having a lot more flashbacks lately because of this. i wont lie, when im having flashbacks or just feeling super depressed/overwhelmed in general, i act like an asshole. im only aware of myself in the moment, and i either go super quiet and moody or lash out when ppl try touching or talking to me

i had a really bad flashback the other day while out shopping with my dad. i completely shut down on him and couldn't communicate, just got really pissy and wanting to go home. we've had a talk in the past about me needing to communicate my needs and experiences better, which ive been trying to do. sometimes talking is really really hard tho, even when im not having ptsd moments

i have a lot of nonverbal communication cards i made to explain, in detail, what im experiencing and what i need in the moment. when we got home, i unloaded the groceries, went to my room without saying anything, sent one of the cards in our family groupchat, cried for a bit while i rode it out, then napped

they had a talk with me later that my behavior is unacceptable and that its not fair for me to ignore them and treat them like ""emotional punching bags."" they dont want me to use my cards, they want me to explain out loud what is going on 

i agree that i should be kinder to them because they usually show me nothing but kindness even when im really grouchy. i dont want them to feel like im mad at them or dont love them

however i also wish we could at least compromise on the card thing. my therapist is the one that gave me the idea, and i thought it was really helpful. i dunno. i feel like an asshole but i also feel like they could be a little more understanding about how hard it is to stay chipper and nice when im in fight or flight mode",0.09
"AITA for describing a c-section as ""easy""? I (F28) am a proud new mom of a baby girl (F 3 months), but my husband (M29) and I are also new arrivals to the country and don't have any friends yet. Leading up to our arrival to our new country, we both spent a lot of time working on our English skills, but sometimes we both make mistakes.

To try and get out of the house, I joined a mom and bub book club at the local library. I was so pleased to be meeting people, especially other moms who have been through/going through life with an infant. The other ladies at the book club seemed really welcoming and we all went to a cafe afterwards for a general chat.

At the cafe, the topic of birth came up and someone asked me if I had delivered my daughter naturally. I said that I had and mentioned that I had been terrified of the idea of a c-section so I really only wanted that as a last resort. One of the other women said that her c-section was scheduled after watching a birth video and she decided it looked safer than having a natural birth. I don't know what I was even saying at this point, but I said something about c-sections looking easier and it was nice not being in labour for so long.

I honestly didn't mean it to sound like natural birth was better and that I was stronger or something. I just translated from my native language and the word that came out was ""easy"". I certainly don't think any birth method is easy. I did apologise in the moment and said that wasn't what I meant.  The conversation moved on and everyone seemed fine.

After arriving home, I received a message from one of the ladies saying that it was best if I didn't come back because I had hurt some feelings and made myself a superhero. I messaged back that I was very sorry to hear that I had offended some ladies, I was genuinely just looking for some friends and didn't want to hurt anyone's feelings. I also explained that I just translated directly in my head. Unfortunately my message was read but not responded to.

"AITA my mil left my daughter with her BF Throwaway in case people I know are on here. My mil watches my 2yo daughter 1-2x a week at her house. I’ve asked multiple times for her not to be left in a room alone or the house alone with her boyfriend because I have past trauma that makes me want to protect my child.

She seemed to understand it, except yesterday I went 1.5 hours earlier than I normally do to pick my daughter up and my mil wasn’t there. My sil was on the other side of the house and my daughter was laying on her boyfriend on the couch in the living room lights off. Her diapers were next to her, so I’m assuming he changed her.

I grabbed her and left and a few hours later messaged my sil asking where my mil was. She was 40 min away.. my sil said my daughter was only with the boyfriend for 3 min after she told me where mil was, because she knows my rules as I’m not shy about it. I messaged my sil and not mil because I didn’t want to blow up on her and needed to cool down.

My mil called me today to apologize, after she talked to my husband, & said my daughter was alone with bf for maybe 10-15 min tops before my sil arrived home… which I just discovered this am. I was willing to forgive before I knew she was completely left alone. I basically said thank you for your apology but a huge trust/boundary was broken and I no longer trust you with my daughter because the only reason you’re saying sorry is because you got caught.

My fiancee said we could do an extended cocktail hour and/or start the reception later so there would be more time for quiet socializing, or even start the whole wedding earlier in the day so it wouldn't go as late. She also suggested that we could take our wedding photos before the ceremony so that we wouldn't have to miss cocktail hour to do them. 

I suggested that instead, we find a venue with two separate rooms. That way her family could have a louder party in one, and mine could have a quiet reception in the other. It would be in the same venue so each side could still go over to the other to socialize. 

My fiancee said she ""actually really hates"" that idea. She said she feels like that defeats the purpose of a wedding, which is supposed to symbolize the union of two people and their families. She also said she doesn't want to do that because she worries I'll spend the entire reception with my family and that she'll have to chose between spending the night with me but ignoring her family, or being with her family but us ""basically being separate at our wedding.""

She also said she feels like the wedding we're planning is becoming less and less ours and more mine. She said this because she originally wanted a child-free, non-religious wedding but compromised on a church ceremony with children allowed because that is what I want.

"AITAH for not doing as my parents say I am a 24m who lives in a poor European country.

Here it's normal to have a shared income as a family and live with your parents.

I've been working on heavy labour jobs since 16yo getting avarage income and gave all my earnings to my parents.

When i would ask them to give me some money to hang out with my friends they would deny it, they would give like 2$ every week or 2 and most of the time i would stay alone inside my room playing on my phone.

One time at 17yo i decided to keep around 20% of my earning for my self to save up and use it when needed and the rest to my parents but then my dad told me that i was living at his house and i should do as he said or else i should leave.

At that time i was scared because i had no place to go and couldn't afford to live by myself and decided to stay until 2 years ago when i got to a point that i didn't care if i was alive or not and decided to keep everything i got for myself.

They stopped talking to me for like half a year eventhough i was still living with them and spread the word to relatives that i had gone insane (like actually) just because i didn't do as they wanted.

These 2 years i decided to save up (like 70%) and eventhought its not too much it's better than nothing.

I still live with them because why spent on rent when i have a room to sleep despite them being annoying, now i'm used to it.

But now all my friends have stopped talking to me because some are engagged/married and some got good jobs and i am here alone doing they same job i did 9 yrs ago because its the only thing i know and i feel like i will never be able to find my peace as i'm missing so many things.

I got a job that just gets me food and nothing more, no house, no friends, no money no nothing just myself and when i think about my future i get so stressed that i've made up my mind that i have failed so hard that now i'll just eat food and pass the days alone until the one comes.",0.75
"AITA for calling someone out on the plane for cutting the line? My husband and I had a full day of travel yesterday where we took 3 planes to get home from our honeymoon. Each ride I noticed just how rude and self centered people are. Beyond the using phones with no headphones and letting your children run amuck, one of the most frustrating things I noticed on each plane were people getting up as soon as the plane landed and cutting in front of everyone to get out. This happened on every plane we took but the last one, I was fed up. We had a connecting flight boarding in 5 minutes, so we were in a rush to get off but we still sat and waited our turn. Obviously I completely understand people needing to get off the plane for a connection, but these two men (late 20s, early 30s?) immediately jump from the very back of the plane to the middle (next to me) as soon as we land. I heard them talking about hitting the airport bar, so I knew they were in no rush. At this point I am peeved and we are trying to make our flight and I ask them why they think they can just cut in front of everyone. My husband is not one for confrontation (and honestly neither am I usually) and quickly shushed me. But I turned to my husband and told him that I was sick of selfish people thinking their time is more valuable than anyone else’s and that if they wanted to get off early they should have paid for a seat that was not in the back of the plane. The men ignored me and continued to cut in front of more people and my husband said I was being an asshole and to just let it go. While I think I could have let it go, it felt good to call them out.

"AITA for asking my fiancé to stop being high 24/7?  Hi everyone, first time poster (usually lurker) but i have to know. TLDR: fiancé is always high and unengaged in our life, gets SO angry if i suggest cutting back or taking a break. 

My (27F) fiancé (31M) met 5 years ago and were both daily weed smokers at the time. We smoked a little bit all day and would partake more sometimes for fun. We started dating, moved in together, and had a fantastic relationship. We did tons together, he helped around the house without asking, and he was so thoughtful. 

Fast forward 4 years, we have 4 animals, are house hunting, and are engaged. I've quit smoking weed as it started making my anxiety worse. I feel much better, have so so so much more motivation, and generally am happier. The only downside is i tend to have a bit worse chronic pain.

 He has increased smoking to the point he goes through about .5-1g of concentrate a day, and smokes from literally when he opens his eyes until he passes out at night. He is ignoring important things in life like missing appointments, putting off others for over a year, and leaving the stove on after cooking. He also hasn't planned or taken me on a date in months and months, and never even asks me to do anything with him. If we leave the apartment it's because i asked to, and 3/4 the time he doesn't go with. All he wants to do is sit around on his phone. He doesn't even play video games anymore like he used to! Just smoke, scroll, repeat. This doesn't even touch the money part as were trying to buy a house.

Ive talked to him about all of these things bothering me to no avail, and today i tried one more time. Im convinced its being high 24/7 thats making him lazy, forgetful, and torally unengaged. I asked is he would be willing to cut down or take a break, and he got SO angry at me, told me it's what makes him happy, told me its the only way he's ok (he has mental health issues i've encouraged him to see a therapist about- i do therapy and its helped tons), belittled my job, belittled all i do to run our household. It devolved into me sobbing and asking him to act like he cares about me and be reliable and him saying he wont ever quit, take a break, or cut down and that i'm asking too much of him. He said i'm asking him to change his personality and who he is. He then took off to work. 

Am i an asshole asking too much of him? Should i accept being high 24/7?

"AITA for telling a woman to shut up after hitting her car? I I (34M).was going to work with my wife and because of my fault, I hit a woman's car. 


I stopped the car (my wife stayed) and went to ask if she was okay, if she had been hurt, etc. 

I barely got close to her and she started shouting asking if I was stupid or blind,  I should lose my driving license because of my stupidity and went far far far.

This was while it was raining and I was trying to have the talk in a covered are and she was continuing to shout insults. 

After almost 2 minutes, I lost my patience and shouted at her to stay quiet and go to something covered.

 She was quiet and made a shitty face, but we went to a covered area and sorted it out. 

When I got in the car, my wife said that I shouldn't have done that, because I made the mistake and that was an explosive reaction from her, but it doesn't give me the right to tell a woman to shut up and I should accept it if I caused the damage

 I really don't see the point of so much offense if it's not going to change the fact, I took the blame and the offenses weren't useful. 

It wasn't a bad crash, no one was hurt, but the car is already at the mechanic and I'm paying for the woman's transportation until the car leaves the workshop.

"AITA not checking on my sister for her dog losing an eye? My sister texted me that her dog, that I quite often looked after,and had an aye infection that I was aware off, lost one eye.I expressed my shock and how sorry I am,but thats it. At the  time the dog was in her ex's care(they share the dog), about 5h drive.I let her handle that herself and didn't ask again,thinking she'll update me or that this is the end of it.

I texted her in 2 days on another matter to which she responded rude and I pointed it out.She responded that she isnt,that I didnt even call her or texted her if she needed anything,or support her morally and writing to her as if nothing happened when her dogs life is on the line.

I said sorry I didn't call,but I didnt know her life is on the line,only about the eye.Sister said thats because I didnt ask anything about the dog or her own state.I defended myself saying I didnt know I should,as if there would be more to it I would expect my sister to tell me the details herself and shes blaming me for stuff I dont know.She pointed out that this is a serious matter and I shoudve called,check how my sister is and if she needs any help, cause she nearly fainted when she found out and her BF had to take her from work.

In the moment I said Im sorry and that Ill call her after work to talk, feeling guilty cause she made me sound an real AH. But then thinking about it: 1.I didnt know it was that serious, 2.what help could I provide as the dog is not even in her care at the moment and I dont drive 3.I know my sister is a bit of drama queen

After talking to her I found out that the dog is fine,but the eye infection spread to the other eye,so there is a risk of losing that as well,but not life threatening.The dog is deaf as well btw,so if she loses the second eye shell probably put the dog down as it wont enjoy its life anymore.She also seemed to be very bothered that the dog lost its eye kind of because is not pretty anymore(the doggy was and still is super cute),shes scared to look at it and asked me to look at the pics from her ex and tell her how is it.She also started to tell how hard its going to be to take care of her,that she cant be left alone now,with eye drops every couple hours,how shes so stressed about it,cause she has to go to office for work.I tried to calm her down that I or her mom can dog sit when shes in the office,she was thinking to switch jobs,so maybe shell find one remote or bigger salary to afford sitters when we cant,ask a neighbor,solvable matter and that this situation is not forever and shes overstressing.

She continued saying its not forever but near future-difficult.Which I would understand, but she wasnt even taking care of the dog then!And wont even drive 5h to her ex to help/take care of her own dog! She won’t take the dog back for another 1-1.5 months btw.

I got a bit pissed after, as to me seemed like she just wanted pity while actually doing nothing for her dog,making me an AH for no emotional support...",0.1
"AITA for calling out a friend for not giving me a wedding present? Hello reddit, first time user here (38M). So I have a situation with a friend of mine (38M). We both had our weddings last year, and we have a discrepancy around wedding presents. He got married in May 2023 and I was a groomsmen in his wedding. He was fairly demanding around his bachelor party, including asking the groomsmen to cover all his expenses related to his bachelor party. He also had us all rent specific tuxedos ($200) to fit his vision for his wedding. I decided with my wife that the right gift was $250 in cash. The wedding itself was out of town, we had to fly and pay for a hotel, which is more than fine. The wedding itself however, was lacking. There was not enough food or drinks for the guests, and I even had to buy additional alcohol for the bar. 

I was married in June 2023 and it was a more extravagant wedding with 5 different events. Each event covered the food and alcohol for all the guests. While he was not a groomsmen, we did not have wedding attire requirements for anyone. However he did have to fly and pay for a hotel, just like us. Given our wedding was three weeks after his, I thought I would have gotten at least some present from him since we had just given him a present. Not only did we not receive a smaller gift, but we received NO gift. Of note, like us, he and his wife are financially comfortable. 

Fast forward several months, I am happily married, but this situation from our wedding does weigh on me. In addition to the gift discrepancy, I had created a group chat with 15 of my friends that remains active to this day during my own bach party. The group of friends are those closest to me, and includes people from all parts of my life. This specific friend has no other attachment or previous relationship to any of the other friends in this chat other than me. We recently started a NCAA tournament betting bracket, and this friend ended up winning $220. So, not only did he and his wife attend all my wedding events without reciprocating a wedding gift, but he’s now befriended my friends and profited off them (fair and square I know).

Now that enough time has passed since our weddings, I would like to reach out to him and let him know how I feel about him not giving us a wedding gift after we had just given him one. I know you are not supposed to talk to people about gifts, but I feel this situation is an exception. I need to know, AITA?",0.83
"AITA for asking my mom to leave all her friends on her birthday?  It happened yesterday night, it was my Mom’s 47th birthday so few of her friends decided to plan a 3day trip to a nearby resort.(kinda waterpark) It was two of her female friends, one with her husband along with me and my mom. 

Background check: I don’t have dad, as moms divorced long back, since then it’s been me and my mom only(no siblings). I’m in college and mom works at a women’s parlour. We both live together as of now. Now, back to what happened last weekend. 

So, we all were drinking in the night, after cake cutting and celebration, sitting around the pool all of us. Moms not heavy drinker, but because it was her birthday her friends forced her to drink a lot of vodka shots and mom was absolutely dizzy, like I remember her friend had to take her to the loo.(I was also a bit drunk, we all were) Anyways. By midnight, we all went to our rooms. 
[I was having a separate room, Mom having her own room and her friend also all in separate rooms] 

I woke up before everyone, by 7 in morning and was sitting just outside rooms(poolside) smoking. And I saw some random man (well built, Indian kinda looks) leaving My mom’s room! I was shocked(First I thought I forgot my mom’s room, but then I realised it’s indeed my mom’s room) That guy again came back after 5 minutes and locked the bedroom! I immediately tried calling mom’s mobile but it was off. 
Then I called Linda(her friends) mobile, she answered and I asked her to come out to talk! I just told her what I saw and Linda smiled at me. 

She said, that guy is Rohan(38m) he’s her husbands friend who was “by chance” there at the resort. Till now I was clueless as why the hell he is sleeping in mom’s room. Linda said, as all the rooms were booked, Linda and her other friends insisted Rohan to stay the weekend with us, and as My mom was sleeping alone so they asked Rohan to sleep with her! I was like wtf are you talking about? Jeez. I told her even I was sleeping alone right, Linda didn’t said anything smiled and said she is sleepy. 

I was mentally screwed at this point, how the hell moms friends made a stranger sleep with mom in her room? Also the fact that mom was absolutely not in her senses? For a minute I was almost ready to knock on mom’s bedroom and ask him to leave, but I waited an hour for everyone to wake up. Rohan came out, along with everyone else for breakfast and mom came out a bit late, and everyone, her friends just teased and kept asking her “if she slept well?” And mom looked very embarrassed and uncomfortable. Just after breakfast, I asked Linda that it’s not alright what they did. 

I didn’t wanted to make a scene at mom’s birthday bash so I stayed calm somehow. 
Her friends didn’t even let me speak with mom in private(mainly Linda as she know that I’m mad at her). I’m planning to ask mom to leave with me tonight. ",0.84
"AITA for telling mine and my exs mutual friend that he wasn’t happy about us hanging out alone AITA so basically me (27f) and i guess my ex? (25m) have been in a weird together but not together relationship on and off over three years, he called it off a few weeks back. issue is we work together so we decided to be civil and stay friends and avoid making the office awkward due to us all being good friends with the others in our workplace.

everything was fine until our colleague (a male) who we are both friends with asked me to go to a sports class as he knew i’ve been wanting to try it and he was going, my ex got super weird and yelled at me about it making insane claims about us having an affair or something which is ridiculous. we had two of these arguments about various things to do with the same friend of ours and he apologised after both times claiming it was because of the medication he was on (antidepressants) messing with his head.

 so one day in particular our work friend asked me again to go to the class and i felt bad that i had to keep making excuses about it and coming off rude, so i shared a bit of honestly about how my ex was feeling a bit weird about us being close and i’d rather not risk upsetting anyone and simply not go, he agreed and said to keep out of it. alas he did not keep out and messaged my ex saying how he meant nothing towards asking me and he sees us both as friends, to which my ex completely flipped on me screaming about how i’m a fucking bitch and how i should never speak to him again because i crossed a line mentioning it to ‘his’ friend. 

AITA? i’m honestly confused still and i do feel like i probably shouldn’t have mentioned it i just didn’t know how to keep everyone happy in the situation and attempt to be a bit honest about everything and now i feel really bad and the office is uncomfortable.

"AITA for not telling my parents I borrowed money from my in laws to help pay for my house? I got hit with some unexpected closing costs for a house I bought with my dad (I’ve been managing everything for the house, and I just had him on the title because I wasn’t married at the time I signed the pre-construction and needed to make sure I had extra safety when it came to the mortgage approval). 

My wife and I live with my parents currently, we are going to move out eventually once we get our finances in order. We help with house expenses and I’ve even offered to pay rent to my parents but they refused. 

The issue came about when I realized I would be short some money, I already feel like a burden living with my parents while we save money and didn’t want to borrow money from them (I also know they don’t have any money to give me besides from lines of credit), so my wife suggested she ask her parents if they can help (we are planning on paying them back). 

Now I will say I feel like I should’ve told them I was going to borrow, but at the same time I honestly don’t think that’s any of their business, but they’re Indian, they have a different mentality. 

My parents found out and got angry, saying they feel embarrassed, saying that they don’t want my in laws thinking they’re poor. They’re saying they want to use an existing line of credit to pay them back. 

I think this is stupid because we’ll be paying interest, whereas my in laws were nice enough to give us some money they already had, so that we can pay them back without interest…

"AITA for breaking my friend's confidence by telling the school counselor about their struggles? I genuinely don't know if I am the AH here so please please help me out. 

I (13F) have been friends with Amy (13F) for around 5 years. We are classmates and go to the same school. We see each other and speak to each other very frequently.

I value mental health a lot. I have two moms, one of them is a psychiatrist, the other is an OB/GYN. They have always taught me the importance of taking care of one's mental health and caring for that of others.

Lately, I have noticed that Amy is very short tempered, angry, and overall tense. She gets mad about things she never even cared about before, cries with the slightest emotional trigger, her schoolwork and homework and grades have dropped a little bit. Even thought I told her I would be there for her she said she was fine and would get mad when I asked if she was okay after a while.

I was really concerned about Amy, so I went to our school's counselor and told him I was worried about Amy. I said I would appreciate it if he could have a conversation with her and see if she needed any help. I also specifically asked for him to not mention my coming there to see him. I  did not say anything to Amy's parents because I know they have some issues together and they would probably exacerbate the situation, also it was not my place to say anything to them.

A week later, Amy was furious with me because the counselor told her about me going to see him regarding Amy's mood. She won't talk to me. She says I crossed a line and I should have kept it all to myself because she did not want any godd##n attention at the moment.

I have been crying for days. My moms have been wonderful about this as always, and they're helping me deal with this. However, I really feel like I broke Amy's confidence in me no matter how many times my moms tell me it was the counselor who messed up and they are going to hold him legally responsible for breaking confidentiality like this

"AITA for lying to my boss about why I took a day of bereavement? I (22f) have been working jobs since I was 16. In that time I have had a lot of really shitty bosses who have treated me like crap, berated me and not made my life very nice. Well for the last two years, I’ve been working the front desk at a physical therapy place and for a lot of reasons, I am very weary of my managers and bosses. Part of it is because of previous jobs and part of it is because of the actions I have witnessed firsthand at this company. Over the weekend we had to put down my childhood cat, Kahlúa, and I was really struggling. I went into work on Monday hoping it would be a good distraction, and it kind of was, but later that night, I just felt like I couldn’t do it anymore and I texted my direct manager that I needed a day off for bereavement. She was incredibly nice about it and there were no issues. The issue comes from my interaction with my  clinic Director. I texted her to let her know that I wouldn’t be in today to take some bereavement. 
Here’s where I may be the asshole. She followed up her confirmation that I wouldn’t be in by asking who had passed. In the past I’ve had bosses refuse to give me bereavement leave when an animal dies (and one threatened my job over it) so I panicked and I said I had an uncle who died. Well, unfortunately, my mother is a patient of my clinic Director, and let the truth slip. 
According to my mom, my directors not mad at me just disappointed and my mom is saying that I should call her and apologize, but I honestly don’t think I need to.  I’ve had a handful of issues with this Director before and there’s not a lot of trust between us so I’ll admit I didn’t wanna tell her the truth in fear that I was gonna get in trouble or told I couldn’t take today off.

"AITA for freaking out a girl sitting on my fiancés lap  AITA for stating to my partner that I found it disrespectful for him asking/allowing another girl, who’s a friend of mine to sit on his lap? 

A few bits of context…myself  an my fiancé  were originally in a poly relationship, and said girl in question (I’ll call her Kate) was once even discussed as a potential play partner years ago. My partner expressed that he was not attracted to Kate and this never happened. Myself and Kate have been friends a while and often work together, though she can be hard to read! . I mention this for context, and that also more traditionally ‘monogamous’ rules may be blurred due to our past and social context. We are now monogamous. 

My partner was attending a show I recently put on.

Kate was helping for the evening, and after the show I had hugely mixed emotions. It did not go as well as I had hoped. Some of the cast and mates decided to go out for drinks after, as my partner came along would have to leave early.

 The bar was extremely busy, and seating was lacking. I was sitting opposite my partner, when he offers his lap due to the lack of seating. Kate took him up on this.  I had felt a little disgruntled at the time, but was super stressed and emotional, Kate had added to some of this stress earlier 

I went out later that night and let my hair down after and had a great time. I wasn’t overly worried about this but it did niggle at me. This same girl had also, earlier that night said my partner had left halfway through the show and been quite disruptive. Another friend of mine had checked ‘we were ok’ during the night…which seemed odd…wasn’t sure why.. 

A day later we were discussing the night when my partner mentions that a lot of my friends were touching him up at the bar and comenting on his muscles….

I bought up feeling a bit disrespected that Kate was sat on his lap half the night, and that he didn’t think to ask me to do so… I just felt like I should be able to express feelings of discomfort. 

He was almost angry I had bought this up. He bought up how I was not giving him any attention through the night, and he only did it as there were no seats. He bought up previously that he had made clear he wasn’t attracted to her so why was it a problem. 

I tried to explain it wasn’t that I didn’t trust him, but that it was a bit disrespectful, and that t can set a president and power dynamic etc. I asked how he would have felt if I had told him a bunch of guys were touching me up at the bar, and then I went to sit in another guys lap not with him if no seats. 

He’s taken this badly, and messaged from work later that he wanted to chat about which never happened.

. Am I the asshole for making such a big deal out of this? Perhaps I should have said something at the time but did not wish to make a scene… We are both quite tactile people and I have some male friends I’m very tactile with, but his reaction to my upset has played on my mind more than the incident itself….am I just being a lot?

"AITA for getting my cousin fired from her job? My cousin used to work for a pretty big tech company whose name I won't mention for privacy reasons. Coincidentally, her boss was my best friend from high school and college.


There's this project their team has been working on that is quite confidential and obviously that means you cannot leak information publicly. However, during one of the family gatherings, my cousin was openly talking about it, actually more like boasting about it. I told her not to talk about it and be more careful but she didn't seem to take my advice.

You may say that it was just family so it's fine, but there we like dozens of people there and some of them aren't the most reliable people imo. They could spread the information and it would only put my friend's job at risk since he's the team leader and responsible for everything.

So I let him know what my cousin was saying and he fired her yesterday. My cousin must have put two in two together and realized that I was the one who snitched on her.

She was quite angry with me and called me slurs over the phone. To make up for this I offered to give her referrals so she could have an easier time finding a new job but she didn't want anything to do with me anymore.

Even my own parents are angry at me for getting her fired. But from my point of view I just reported what happened and how she broke an NDA and he did the rest. I thought my friend was just gonna warn her but I never thought he would do what he did.

"AITA for deceiving two of my friends  a few weeks ago i (f) have done some sexual stuff with a friend of mine (let’s call him james) and after confessed to him that I have liked him for a while already and that’s the reason why i broke up with my ex (let’s call him aaron) (his best friend).  James told me that we couldn’t continue like this because it’s unfair towards Aaron. 

We had talked about it and came to the conclusion that if Aaron is fine with it, he would give us a chance. I talked to aaron and he said he doesn’t mind. Later James rejected me telling me ‘you’re really nice and i really like you, but I want to remain just friends.’ I was confused cause why would you lie in my arms one day while i’m stroking your hair and then suddenly reject me?

 A few days later I had a strong feeling that i should check his spotify, and to no surprise i found something. There was a playlist with his initial-heart- and another initial. My thoughts went immediately to the girl Aaron was with after I broke up with him (let’s call her mia) Because i knew mia and james are friends. I stalked her insta and accidentally liked one of her posts. She immediately followed me and started texting me. She turned out to be really sweet and we have become good friends.  

I asked james about the playlist and he told me that he likes mia, but to keep it a secret from her and not tell her about what happened between him and me. The thing is I had already told mia everything at that point. Mia really wants me and James to get together and she is doing everything she can to make that happen. So now i’m stuck in a love triangle where i like james, James likes Mia and mia has a bf. I’m pretending to help James with getting with mia, while in the meantime she is helping me.

They also overflow the machines with soap regularly. They walk over floors I’ve just mopped and make messes they don’t attempt to clean when they just saw me clean. They take huge stinky shits and spray poop all over the toilet/tank/ floor and leave the toilet seat up. They don’t bother to out trash in the four trash cans we have half the time.

Would you like a mop/broom/dustpan/rag/towels for the mess you made? Using too much soap? “Hey ma’am that’s way too much soap.” I’ve also stopped letting men use the bathrooms since they are the biggest serial shit and leavers. If I do let someone use the bathroom I check after they are done and make them clean up any shit left behind.  I understand some of this  is my job as a laundromat attendant but people straight up treat me like a personal MAID. And I’m not. People do stupid shit and nobody ever says anything so I do and it feels good. People need a reality check and I’m more than happy to be that person. I don’t care if they get upset and neither does my boss. 🤷🏻‍♀️ If you’re gonna use the laundromat while I’m here you will be respectful and clean. Period. AITA? ",0.71
"AITA for wanting to set boundaries for my girlfriend talking to a mutual guy friend My girlfriend and I (together for 2 years) are in a friend group and we have both become friends with a new guy in the group. My girlfriend seems to talk to him a lot more than my other friends in the group when we’re out and seems to always gravitate towards him. Being a bit of an anxious/ paranoid person I already get stupid thoughts about this occasionally. My girlfriend today however told me she’s been talking to him over private message and wanted to ask if that was okay out of respect. I said yeah it’s fine and that I trust her, and I do, but I can’t help but feel anxious. Another thought I had is why has he started talking to her but not me?

AITA For liking my stepsister So I’m 14M and for a few months I’ve becoming attracted to my stepsister Sarah 17F! I love her personality voice hair eyes and I love her body too and I’ve become so attracted I get horny every time I look at her talk to her touch her anything and I masturbate  to her IG every day and moan her name too! But I’ve come to learn that she is a women and I must always respect her and her boundaries and I’m probably never going to actually get with her and I should treat her as a sister and nothing more. But I see nothing wrong with fantasizing about her and wanting to have sex with her as long as I don’t try to make it happen. I’ve been masturbating in my room for weeks and Sarah walked into my room yesterday while I was beating my meat to her IG and moaning her name and unfortunately I didn’t notice her until she saw and heard everything and she said I was a creep and told my parents and now I’m grounded for allegedly being a creep and Sarah won’t even look at me anymore or talk to me. I’ve tried explaining to Sarah my dad and my stepmom that it’s ok to like someone as long as I don’t try to make it a reality but they don’t care they just call me a creep and now I have no idea what to do.

"AITA for not reminding others of my friends' birthday? Long story short, me and my friends almost always tell each other happy birthday in our group chat. Instead of me saying it in the group chat like I usually do, where everyone would automatically be reminded it's his birthday, I text him happy birthday individually, so not to set off a domino effect of everyone else wishing him a happy birthday after me.

The reason for this being is because his wedding is coming up and as a way to increase my chances of being picked as one of the groomsmen (or best man), I wanted to be the only person to wish him a happy birthday. This would serve as a double edged sword - making me look better for being one of his only friends to remember and also cause him to potentially resent the others, bolstering me in status in his eyes.

He hasn't announced his groomsmen and best man, yet, but the plan was ""successful."" Successful in the sense that people did seem to forget it was his birthday for the majority of the day. The next person to wish him happy birthday was around 7 PM and then the domino effect took place with a couple people completely forgetting and telling him the next day. He did seem upset/annoyed by it as well...

I don't usually do things like this at all. I'm the type of person that'll shoot my friends texts to remind them to tell other people happy birthday because I know what it feels like to be lonely and have people forget my birthday. This was more a spur in the moment, crime of opportunity and I just thought I could weaponize this situation for my benefit.",0.84
"WIBTA for canceling plans with friends that already did said plans behind our backs? I (20F) have a friend group that I’ve made plans with recently and I don’t know if I have the right to be mad and should cancel. I’ll refer to these girls as A, V, and T. All of us made plans for the following weekend (April 14) to go to a different town, go to the farmers market, go bowling, etc. 

Last Sunday (April 7), I found out that V and T went to the town and did all of the plans without us. We just found out through social media that they both went to most of the places that we had planned to go. I’m a little upset about it because I wish they had just told us they were going that weekend. However, A is really mad because she got into it with her partner as he wanted to go to this town. A turned it down to hang out with us the next Sunday, only to have this happen. 

I don’t actually know whether I should keep these plans open? I feel a little hurt that they did all of the plans we were supposed to do and expect us to rinse, wash, repeat it the next weekend. It’s just that I don’t see a point in going if they’ve already done all of those plans together? It feels weird to me, I don’t know.

"AITA For Wanting To Study in Silence? Okay Reddit. This is a pretty tame AITA post but I must ask it because people I tell are divided.  
  
It is exam season and I (F20) am at one of the toughest universities in Canada. I decided to go into one of the buildings on campus today and find an empty classroom to study in because I need to leave the house to study productively but wanted total silence and I find even when libraries are meant to be silent, people studying in groups tend to be pretty chatty there.  
  
I found myself an empty classroom and about half an hour into my afternoon of studying, a girl walked in. We smiled at each other and she went and sat at the opposite end of the small classroom. I didn't mind that she came in, but I did mind when she joined a Zoom call and started talking loudly. I texted my mom and told her the situation and expressed my frustration. I told her that I sort of wanted to call someone and talk too because I thought that it was rude of the girl to just take over my quiet space and so my mom immediately called me and her and I started having a conversation too to give the girl a taste of her own medicine.  
  
A few minutes into our conversation, I heard the door rattle and realized that the other girl was walking out of the room (clearly not happy). I felt a sort of pride and satisfaction wash over me. I felt like I was in the right for doing this because: 1. I was in the room first and had specifically chosen that room for the silence it could offer and 2. I didn't feel it was fair for her to think that in this silent room, she was allowed to speak loudly and that I shouldn't.  
  
If she had asked me if it was okay for her to take a Zoom call, I wouldn't have been happy about it, but I would have said that it was fine and put on headphones. I suppose that I could have put on headphones anyways and just ignored her, but she was talking really loud. My headphones would not have drowned her out unless I played music really loud and there is no way I'd be able to focus and study with music blasting like that. I also felt that her talking loud was disrespectful as she clearly didn't care to try and talk in a hushed voice or show any sort of apologetic behaviour for being so loud.  
  
After telling this story to others, I've been told that I could have left the room, or that I could have gone over to her and asked how long the meeting was going to be and then set a plan of what to do next but I don't think that either of those courses of action are fair. I was in the room first and don't feel that I should have had to give up the room or put up with her entitlement.  
  
So, am I the asshole for talking too and making the girl have to leave the room in the middle of her Zoom call? Who is the entitled one here - me for expecting to have a silent classroom all to myself, or the girl who came in after and took advantage of my silent classroom to take a Zoom call?

"AITA for making my mom uncomfortable by being affectionate with my wife? My mom is an unusual person. She’s stoic, awkward around most people, and barely interacts with people she doesn’t find interesting. She wasn’t an affectionate parent. She finds a lot of things embarrassing and uncomfortable.

On the other hand, for people she does like, she’s childish and immature. She needs to be babysat by every man she dates.

My wife is the exact opposite of my mom. She’s warm, kind, affectionate, intelligent and mature.

My mom and her fiancé came to our house for a visit. They were supposed to stay for two weeks. 

My mom pulled me aside and told me to stop making her uncomfortable. 

Basically my wife and I are affectionate people and we’re often overlapping limbs, hugging, talking to each other, sharing food. My wife says I’m touch deprived which is why I’m clingy. It’s all PG.

My mom said it made her embarrassed and uncomfortable and I should stop. She also expressed uncomfortableness at my wife’s presence in the house.

We got into an argument and she called me a hypocrite for policing her behavior in the past but not changing mine.

I don’t see why I should police my perfectly PG behavior in my own house nor my wife’s? AITA?",0.09
"AITA for letting my wife starve? Backstory: I(38m) have been married to my wife (38f) for almost 16 years. We have four kids, 11, 9, 6, and 4 months. My wife and I decided to try a plant based diet about 9 years ago, and while I shortly decided the health benefits didn't seem all that great, she took it and ran with it, so now we are all devout vegans, avoiding animal products  in everything from food to clothes. I don't mind the diet, but it causes a lot of complications. 
First, organic, non-gmo, vegan food is expensive. Add to it that gluten is bad for you and my wife has a medical condition that could be worsened with soy, we are now eating organic, non-gmo, gluten free, soy free food. I routinely spend $500 each week in groceries
While the expense is a problem, the much larger issue is the planning and work that goes into it. My wife has spent much of the last decade pregnant, taking care of babies, or suffering from her medical condition (it basically goes on hiatus when she's pregnant, but otherwise, leaves her incapacitated a week out of the month), so we are at the point now where I work from home and do all the cleaning, cooking, shopping, laundry, bedtime routines, and caring for the homestead (we have goats, chickens, ducks, and rabbits. No garden this year cause there just wasn't time). My wife is focusing on feeding and caring for the baby and she does about an hour of homeschool with the older kids each day. 
I don't mind picking up the slack, and she's mostly appreciative for all I do, but planning and cooking meals is wearing me out. I usually get up around 5am on the weekends and pick up groceries for the week, and I have to plan very carefully to find groceries we can eat that everyone enjoys. I typically have to make a couple meals for dinner each night as there are only one or two meals that everyone will eat. I try to plan leftovers for lunch in order to keep the budget down, but that just makes everything more complicated.
So today, I did the usual shopping and made burritos last night. Meals have gotten harder because my wife typically eats while carrying a sleeping baby, and she can't eat burritos and tortilla chips while he's asleep because the chips wake the baby. We were able to work around it last night, but today, she needs lunch, and the burritos are the only thing I have fixed. Now, she is angry at me because I didn't plan ahead and I don't have anything she can eat. She needs to do homeschool with the kids in about half an hour, so there's no time to fix anything else, and the numerous dietary restrictions makes it so there aren't really any quick options. 
Now, she's angry with me for asking her to just deal with it and either do her best, try to eat it when the baby wakes while I change him, or just try to eat while doing homeschool work. She says I'm being a bully for not just supporting her and believing her when she says she has no choice and will just have to go hungry. 
So AITA or is this whole situation beyond ridiculous?

"AITA for not wanting my very elderly 2x great grandpa to drive? I (19f) live with my 2x great grandpa “George” (102m). Fortunately he is still in clear mind and amazing health for a man his age, but he has some physical and cognitive issues. His body started to give up on him and he was advised to use a mobility aid, but he is ashamed to use it in public and relies on his car instead. I was the one to drive him around.

Five months ago we were in a small accident. Nothing really big, I just miscalculated the size of a parking spot and scratched another car. But George, who unfortunately has some old-time bias, is now very much against me driving, saying that it’s the man’s job.

George isn’t exactly the safest driver. He is a little bit slow to react, it takes him a few seconds to assess the situation. He also can’t see well anymore, he can’t see without glasses and can only see shapes out of one of his eyes. His body is weak and he is very slow with his movements. Despite all that, he still gets behind the wheel almost daily. He was a truck driver all his life up until he couldn’t pass the health examination for the CDL and he misses driving very much. Sometimes when he doesn’t even need to go anywhere he still takes the car and drives around town mindlessly.

I confronted him about him using the car and he said that he is still an amazing driver and he never ever was in an accident as silly as mine was. I told him that it’s still unsafe because of his slower reaction. He said that driving is his instinct and even if he goes senile he would be still able to drive. Eventually it escalated and he said “no woman will order me what to do in my own house”. It wasn’t aimed at me personally, as I said he still has some bias straight out of 1930s, but I was still very upset and worried about him. I love him very much, he’s an amazing person, but he’s very stubborn and reckless, mostly due to his cognitive changes.

I told my mom about the conflict and she said that I shouldn’t pester him and that I shouldn’t stress him out more than necessary, especially after his daughter (my great grandma) died. She unfortunately passed away a few years ago and it was very traumatic for George, since then his health deteriorated and he became more stubborn and short-tempered. Now I’m wondering if I was the asshole for confronting him.",0.07
"AITA for treating my female friends the exact same way I treat my male friends. That title has basically all the information. If I'm friends with someone I treat them all the same. 

It came up because I became interested in a girl from our friend group. When a bunch of us would go out I might pick her up and drop her off. I might pick up her tab for that night. 

At that point we were still just friends and I was fine with that. We did eventually start dating and we were together for about five months. 

After we broke up we remained friends. However I no longer did the stuff I did before we started going out. 

Her and a few of the other girls said I was an asshole for acting different with them when sex wasn't on the table. 

I said that I was treating all of my FRIENDS make and female the exact same way. And that yes when I was pursuing a relationship I went out of my way for that person. 

I asked them how often they picked up the tab for myself or any of the guys. Or how many times they offered to pick one of us up and drop us off. 

They said that wasn't the point and that I'm just being nice to get sex.

"AITA for helping out my SIL Me and my husband migrated to my homecountry to start a new life. Since I'm back, my whole family is -according to my husband- ""using me"". My brother is since 2 weeks hospitalized (bad case, coma, he will need months to be able to get up and work again). Since then, my SIL brings their son (1) over. First it was for 20 minutes, now he stays 4 hours even during dinner (so she could take the dog for a walk and visit my brother) . Since we're childfree, our home isn't prepared for little kids that touch and break everything, so I constantly am at his hand to pay attention. I can't keep sitting properly during meals as I need to look after him.
Now my brother asks me to do his paperwork (as his wife is overwhelmed with their son and dog). Every few days there's something new I should help them out with. 
My husband is giving me the silent treatment  for 3 days now. Today he spoke up that I'm being stepped on and have no backbone. Since I'm always saying yes. And that we came to my homecountry to live a better life, not me to serve my family. That it's their responsibility not mine. If my SIL is overwhelmed with a dog and a kid, she should give one up to adoption. Or she should talk to the whole family so everyone takes the kid for a day.

"AITA for not wanting my ex to be friends with my sister i (21f) have an ex (m25) who currently lives with me in my parents house. we broke up over a year ago after being together for three and a half years and i no longer hold any romantic feelings towards him whatsoever (even helped him set up new dating profiles and such). when we broke up he went on a tirade about my younger sister (18f) and how he loved her. i had to sit and listen to that every day, she never knew about it and he ultimately decided that he didn’t actually love her he just wanted someone he couldn’t have (or something equally ridiculous). he has intense mental health problems that her refuses to deal with which influenced these feelings greatly.  during this time he would ask me why i would be annoyed if they ever got together (my sister would never do something like that) and would get super angry when i said it would never be something i was okay with. 

over the past 8 months while she’s been at university he’s always complaining and crying about how she ignores his messages or only talks to him when she wants something (in typical teenage girl style- which i honestly respect she’s got him paying for things and giving her free drugs etc). but now that she’s back he’s gone straight to hanging onto her every word. only the other week did he tell me he got concert tickets for the two of them to go and see a band that we all like and then proceeded to be confused when i was annoyed. i ended up buying my own ticket and now he’s mad at me for that because there’s ‘certain songs that they’re going to dance to and that will upset me and ruin the vibe’. his words not mine. 

earlier today he told me that if he didn’t have a girlfriend within the next six months he was going to take my sister to a wedding which is out of country and then proceeded to tell me that i had no right to be annoyed (when i didn’t even say anything).

"AITA for getting pregnant and expecting my friend to recommend me and “hurt” her reputation?  I was working at a non profit as a clerk and a customer success position opened up at a company my friend works at. My friend is a team lead for their product dev branch.

I asked my friend to recommend me and she said she would and was hunting down who the hiring manager was. I found out I was pregnant around this time too. I’m already 11 weeks pregnant but never had regular periods to I just found out. I announced it on Facebook and my friend called me and told me she can’t recommend me due to the pregnancy. I was shocked and asked her why and she told me if I get in and leave for maternity 4-5 months than it looks really bad on her. I was furious because what does me being pregnant have anything to do with her? According to her it would hurt her reputation and I’m going to have to apply without her if I wanted the position. I think it’s so discriminatory for her to not want to recommend me just because I’m pregnant. Reading through the job description I don’t know if I could get in without her as I have almost no tech knowledge but she knows this and for her to drop me because of this seems so gross.

"AITA for not taking my friend with me to see the eclipse? I (40 F) live about a 2 1/2 hour drive from the path of totality of yesterday's eclipse.  I've been looking forward to it for months.  I missed out on making reservations to camp because I forgot about it until it was too late.  My simple back-up plan was to simply drive to the edge of the path of totality, bum around, watch the eclipse, then come home the same day.

My friend (35F) has been asking to come with me for a couple of months.  She doesn't own a car, can't afford to rent one, and none of her other friends were going.  I said it might be possible, but that I wouldn't make promises until I had firm plans.

About a week ago, I checked for openings at the state parks, and, amazingly, there'd been some cancellations.  I was able to grab a campsite for 2 nights just outside of the path and a day pass for a different park about 3 1/2 hours further west, where the forecast was a bit more promising.

I'm a huge fan of both camping and hiking, so I booked both state parks in a heartbeat.  So, the new plan was to drive out early Sunday AM, spend the whole day hiking.  Camp.  Get up at 5:30 on Monday so I could beat traffic.  Go to the second park.  Hike & watch the eclipse.  Hike some more.  Then go back to the first state park.  Camp.  Hike more.  Come back today.

Once it turned into a multi-day trip, I started rethinking my quasi-invitation.

A) My friend doesn't mind camping but hates hiking.  

B) I prefer solo hiking anyhow.

C) I only have one tent and it only fits one person.   Rain was forecast, so one of us would have had to sleep in the car.  My seats fold down, no big deal, but I also only have one air mattress, so one of us would have had to do without.

D) She wouldn't have contributed to the expenses.  Granted, it wouldn't have actually cost me much extra to take her with me, but she wouldn't have paid for so much as a tank of gas, maybe not even her own groceries.

E) I like her.  But not enough to be stuck in a car with her for multiple hours, multiple days in a row.

In the end, I didn't invite her.  I just played it off as ""Wow!  I can't believe I managed to get the very last day pass! I'm so lucky someone cancelled!"" and implied that the day pass was just for one person.  I went without her and had an absolute blast.

But somehow, she found out that the day passes are per CAR, not per person, and I could easily have taken her with me.  Now she's mad that I went without her when it was a once-in-a-lifetime event and she's been begging to go.   It was rainy in our hometown, so she didn't even get to see the partial eclipse.   

I tried to explain my decision - how she hates hiking, no tent, etc - but she came up with workarounds for each of my arguments (I could have dropped her off at a picnic area to relax while I hiked, etc), except for the (unvoiced) ones about how I was going to have more fun without her.  

Now I feel like an asshole.  Am I?",0.52
"AITA for pretending to be a skinwalker to terrorize some tourists who were camping near my property? Background: I (27f) live in a small town in rural Nevada. My house is kinda on the outskirts of the town so if you walk like a mile or so away from it, you’ll be in the middle of a mountainous desert.

I’m unemployed and got nothing to do, so I mostly just take walks to not just sit in front of the phone all days. I’ve noticed a car with Cali plates and two tents about half a mile away from my property on my daily walk, and my idiot ass brain decided to go there in the middle of the night and mess with the campers.

So it was about 2AM, they were having a campfire and I put on my worst clothes ever and came up to them. I was like “hey, can I borrow a lighter?” when I realized they were high ASF, probably tripping balls. I kept repeating the lighter line and they were getting more and more unsettled. It was kinda amusing watching them get terrified, I’m 5’2 and really skinny btw and the guys were quite sizeable, but they were shaking from fear. Eventually they yelled at me to fuck off and I slowly walked off, and when I was far away, but not far enough to not be seen, I got on all fours which was kinda embarrassing but added to the spook factor since I’ve heard them screaming afterwards.

Next day, I met up with my friend and told her about my antics. She was appalled and said that I could’ve triggered a bad trip and that I was terrorizing people for no reason. I told her that it was just a prank and that some girl pretending to be a skinwalker is the safest thing they could’ve encountered in the desert (we have rattlesnakes, mountain lions, just local creeps etc). She said that it was disrespectful to the native culture (she’s white like me) and that someone could’ve had a heart attack from the fear and die. She called me an asshole and said that I’m immature and that I should get a job instead of being a local menace. I’m not being a menace and I’m planning to get a job real soon, my other friend is about to get on maternity leave and I’m most probably going to replace her temporarily even though I’ll have to move to Reno.

"AITA for telling my landlord multiple times about our neighbors dog barking? I (16M) and my mother (44F) recently moved into a new apartment about 3 months ago. We had about a month previously taken a tour of the downstairs apartment and decided against it for personal reasons. We now headed back to the property to tour the upstairs, everything seemed great. The size was perfect, the backyard was great, the land was gorgeous and the landlords were a very nice old couple, the one problem being that the whole tour (which lasted around 20 minutes) the downstairs neighbors dog was barking. They had apparently moved into the apartment in the one month between our first tour of the house and our second. We needed up signing the lease the same day and even signed a pet agreement for our cat (4F😂)

A few weeks later me my mom and brother had finished packing up from our old apartment and rented a U-Haul to take everything over, I’ll spare you the boring details and cut to the chase. Our new downstairs neighbors pulled into the shared drive through just in time to meet the three of us. We talked a bit and they seemed relatively nice. There was a newly single mother (we’ll call her Amanda) two daughters, and obviously their dog. Amanda mentioned as they got out of the car that she was “afraid of men” and that might be why she was barking for so long earlier. 

A few days pass living in our new apartment and their dog (Sophie) is stil barking for about 15 minutes every time we enter or leave the apartment. (This is very frequently because I’m big hiker and my moms a big smoker) My mom made her first complaint to our landlord which was followed by a relatively quick response from our neighbor getting a bark collar for Sophie. I thought this was very kind of her. 

Another month or so passed and the bark collar randomly stops working (it was not the battery’s) My mom reported the dog again and the landlords said they can’t really do anything. After the snow started to thaw out we realised that the whole time the neighbors had been staying here they hadn’t been cleaning the dogs poop up in our shared yard. 

My mom made a direct complaint to our neighbor Amanda saying how “you’re violating the terms we agreed to” and “you need to take care of your dog” which definitely could be seen as a bit out of bounds. Amanda promptly responded by saying “it’s out of our control” and a rude “you violate the lease too” by saying that she can smell the weed from our apartment and hear my mother having sex from upstairs. (The lease said no weed in the apartment but nothing about sexual intercourse or volume levels before 10)  My mom shut this down by saying “you should have thought about that before renting a downstairs apartment” and there havnt been many follow ups since.


I guess what I’m asking is how could this have been handled better? Am I (my mom in this case) The asshole for how she felt with the situation?

"AITA for Googling a Guy I Was Seeing?  
Okay, so I, (19F) think I might have made a huge mistake. I met this guy (30M) on a nutrition subreddit, where we immediately hit it off. He was so kind and considerate. This blossomed into a really great friendship, which blossomed into something more. Very quickly we realized that we had feelings for each other, and exchanged “I love you”s. He even said he thought we were soulmates. We would talk on the phone all the time, and we seemed to have a ton in common. Plus, very similar goals for the future. 

Here’s where things get messy. We hadn’t video chatted, because he had a stalker a few years back, and he’s still recovering from that trauma. I’d seen plenty of photos of things he owns, meals he’d made, etc. but he never sent me a photo of his face. I asked for one, but he never ended up sending it. We communicated via Telegram, and he showed me a screenshot of his version of the app, which does not allow video calls. I was getting slightly suspicious, given how fast things were moving. So, I googled the info I did have, and found an exact match to what he had told me. I felt a little guilty, so I did admit this to him. That’s when he wished me well, but made me promise to never contact him again, as I brought back his trauma.

Because the details he gave me about his life  were SO accurate according to what I’d found, I’m not sure this was a catfish. Plus, his identity wasn’t one a typical catfish would acquire, and he never asked for photos, money, etc. I believe I might have drove someone away someone that really cared about me because I couldn’t respect boundaries. I think verifying someone before you meet up with them is a pretty normal step, (we were talking about that quite a bit) but I did go against his wishes, and I know trauma can be very difficult to deal with. 

Was I the asshole here? ",0.07

My Wife and I were already discussing this possibility. so we speak to her father and he agreed to it.

"AITA for blaming my parents about some of my failures due to them not being strict Important clarification : I’m not an adult, I’m still under 18 years old(15)

At a young age my parents never really helped me in anything and they really weren’t strict at all. They never told me to lose weight when they knew I was fat. They expected me to study, when they always knew  that I could play video games at anytime. They always compared me to other kids who were more successful. Most might say that I’m the one who is lazy here and that I blame everything on my parents, however, why is it that most kids In my age are successful because they have strict parents. It surely isn’t a coincidence. These kids keep boasting that they are the ones who worked hard, while their parents literally manage everything for them. I know some of the blame falls on me, but i personally think that until the age of 15, parents are supposed to discipline their children in most things such academics and sports. Which sadly my parents have failed to do, which has resulted in me suffering at an older age. What do you think.


Edit: just to clarify, my grades are good, and im physically okay, and im overall satisfied with my life. I’m just saying that if my parents were more strict, things would’ve been much easier. And I’m still a teen since some appear to have misunderstood. Sorry for the misunderstanding.",0.82
"AITA for expecting my mom to pay for my meals? I (22F) am a senior university student and have a scholarship that covers my tuition and my mom pays my rent and other living expenses. She’s well off and covered my older brother as well during his education. She complained to me a lot about my brother’s endless DoorDash use that would cost her up to $60/day but she never really yelled at him about it. She’d praise me about how I’m such a good kid and that I’m never wasteful. 

I worked hard recently to get an internship where I was paid and saved up some money. I wanted to put it into my savings, use it to get my teeth fixed, and for a post graduation trip. I use it for all non living expense stuff (recreational shopping) and most of my groceries now too. 

The other day she said she basically doesn’t want me to use her card for anything if I can help it and that paying my rent is enough. She says since I have my own money, I need to use it so she has less expenditure. She called me a miser for not wanting to spend my money.

I’m honestly really confused because she covered my brother fully when he was in college but expects me to cover myself. I really wanted to save this money :/

"AITA: How would you handle a complaining husband.. We have a dog who is 11 years old. She is a mixed breed. We got her at 6 1/2 weeks old. My husband has never really wanted dogs. He has many dogs in his family but never really cared for them much. However after numerous discussions on me wanting a dog..

 I finally made the plunge. Over the years he has complained about the shedding, the feeding and the money. Which I have just shrugged off until recently. He always would say “that’s your dog” when he didn’t want to help out with feedings or cleaning up messes. 

Now mind you he has done both of those things but still would complain sometimes. He has moments where he would cuddle up next to her and be sweet to her but he doesn’t have the same bond I have with her. That unconditional love. I have had issues with pregnancies in the past and having a dog was a way to semi fill the void missing. 

Recently my poor dog was diagnosed with diabetes, we had numerous vet visits. Which lead to us having to put her on special food and insulin twice a day. So it has became expensive. With all that being said, I feel it is worth it because she is family to me. 

My husband on the other hand sees her accidents in the house - about once a month, her feeding schedule and her newly developed cataracts as a bother. He will make comments like “she needs to be put down.” All while having a tantrum around the house cleaning and slamming things around. Then gets mad when I don’t help him and go in the other room to avoid his attitude. It’s becoming a real issue. 

I still look at her and see she has a couple more years left. She does have struggles, but to me she has managed well with it and I don’t see a reason to put her down yet. I just really need some advice. ",0.29

"AITA Former office fling upset we stopped hanging out after she got married AITA I (28M) have been working with this girl (26F) for the last 2 years, and  from day 1 we have always had a very flirtatious relationship, in and out of the office we would always spend time together, grabbing coffee at work, drinks and dinner after work, movies and hikes on the weekend etc.

About 6 months ago, we hooked up and a week later her bf at the time proposed and she said yes.  When I found out, I told her while I felt there was a deep connection between us, I had no interest in being the other guy, so if she was engaged then I would need to put some distance between us. 

 Over the past few months have pulled back, and few weeks ago she got married and I have now cut all contact other than what is required to remain professional (ie daily interaction as colleagues, calls / meetings with clients etc.).  

This week she confront me saying that I am being an asshole for cutting her out of my life, that we were ""soul mates"" and that I need to get over myself and accept that her husband is just a different part of her life.

"AITA for screaming at my friend when she kept asking me the same question? Okay background info, I (28m) used to work in the film industry as a freelancing wardrobe stylist/costumer from I was 21yo. I met said friend (26f) on set early in my career where she also just started off her career.  2+ years ago, I left the industry of years of near non existent work life balance, being taken advantage of and pay issues(underpaid or constant late payment which is common in my country due to no unions exists here). Doesn't help that I had worked 3 months with my pay being withheld for a project at the end of my film career.

 So I left the entire scene for an office hour job that pays significantly lower than freelancing but stable with benefits. My current job is something many are surprised that I took it up (I work in libraries now lol). My friend lets call her Ally. So Ally is a nepo baby in the industry. Her father is a long time video editor and her aunt was someone prominent with strong  influences in the local scene so she doesn't face any issues that I faced, who had no one to protect me from the nonsensical business practices of the industry. She couldn't seem to grasp the concept that I left my passions to work in corporate. I tried to explain to her my situation (I'm the oldest child and only son in an Asian household, and I am the main breadwinner of my family of 6) and the fact my passion for creative work had died. I was more interested in stability. Still she questioned my choices.

Ally kept asking the same questions for 2 years. Kept trying to coax me into joining back the film industry, kept saying that working for passion is better suited for me or she has no friends in the industry anymore (there were a good number of people who left?). I kept trying to get her understand that I'm happy and comfortable with my current job. Recently, she asked me the same question when we met for dinner and this time i was kinda in a bad mood. So I snapped at her in public. I called her out her blatant disrespect for my choices and the fact she saw how much I had to endure working in film, how I was unhappy in the end. I told her that she's an idiot and to fuck off. Paid for my meal and left.

Now that I have managed to cool down, I feel guilty for causing a comotion in public and embarrassing her. AITA?",0.47
"AITA for thinking my bf has a too close sibling relationship? I (25f) have been with my boyfriend (25m, I’ll use J for him) for about 4 years and it has been the best relationship of my life overall but especially when it comes to accepting family, on both sides. (I’m typing on my phone so for any mistakes, I apologize. Also this is my first time here after much consideration)

 I have come from a big family and while some of us grew up close as kids, we grew apart as we got older especially my (24m, I’ll call him A) brother who was my best friend growing up but that isn’t the case now as he’s married now. So that is a bit of back story to where this is going, J and his sister (23f, I’ll use D for her) grew up super close and I’ve never found it to be anything more than what I had growing up with my own sibling but the further and closer I’ve gotten to J and his family, I’ve noticed some things that have me feeling uneasy and borderline uncomfortable. 

For starters, my J and D would slap each other’s butts in front of me and when I wasn’t around and  upon calling  J out about it, which resulted in an argument which we got over (though it did stop a good while back after my conversation with J) but I still think about it here and there. Another time would be (you can judge me I know it’s bad) where I went through J’s phone and found messages where his sister was saying that she was jealous of me and that I’m “stealing him away” from her, she also called me names which I don’t think were ever talked about between them two. 

I read where she gave him compliments beyond what a sister should call her brother which wasn’t the norm of handsome or “you look good.” Also where certain emojis were used which I feel were inappropriate. I’ve told him that I have no intention of being a “brother stealer” or anything like that and that my dream is to have a close relationship with the sibling of the person I’m dating because while you date and be with the person you chose, family is important as that’s where you came from (if it’s healthy that is.) 

The list goes on but every time I’ve confronted J, he just shrinks into himself and seemingly acts guilty or embarrassed and it’s not my intention to make him feel bad but to get what’s really going on. It keeps me up sometimes or it’ll be plaguing me for hours and I don’t know what to do anymore. I want to ask for him to create more boundaries with her but she doesn’t seem to be the type to budge with her family.

I just don’t want to get too specific about anything but i really just want to know how should I talk to J about it because we’ve had this conversation plenty of times but i still feel bothered by certain things and I’m at my wits end at this point. 

So am i wrong for thinking my bf is too close to his sibling?",0.38
"AITA For Asking My Sister To Stop Hooking Up At Home? For some context me and my sister share a wall between our bedrooms and our bedrooms are located on the other side of the house than my parents, we do live in a pretty big house. We are also white(will come into play later). My sister has brought guys over since since basically start of high school but I never minded since I wouldn't hear anything and I believe that people should live and be who they are. The past year and a half, from time to time when she and a guy would go in her room I would hear the bed making noise or the guy letting out a groan but rarely my sister which I am glad that she was mindful/respectful and would keep it down but I would just put on headphones anyways or play music in my room. It was always the same type of guys that she'd hook up with but a few months ago she brought a guy that was nothing like her usual type and the hookup was significantly louder. It's clear to me now that she has shifted her preference/type in guys and the hookups in her room have been much louder and longer due to this. Her headboard keeps hitting the shared wall and she is not quiet at all and seems like she isn't even trying to be quiet. The hookups seem to last twice as long as usual but I am not sure if that is because it really is or if it is because I am stuck hearing it happen. I tried to not be bothered by it but it has gotten to the point that I am unable to do homework during it, have trouble going to bed on time, and in some cases get woken up by it. I went up to her a few days ago and told her that since she started hooking up with the new type of guys that it has been really bothersome for me and explained to her. I asked if she can move her room around so then her bed is on the other side of the wall which I thought was fair. She looked confused at me and said that she won't change her room just because she is enjoying it more and can't hold back the noises and that it will be something for me to deal with and figure out on my own. I got upset by this response since I thought my solution was fair so then I asked why she can't just hookup at their house or somewhere else instead of her room so I don't have to hear it go down and she got really upset and started yelling how I'm being an annoying brother and selfish and then called me a racist saying that I have an issue with the type of men that's doing it to her now and not the act that is happening.

He helps me with the little things for my work whenever I ask. He’s there if I need help that doesn’t involve money . I provide everything and more for the family. He is financially irresponsible.

"AITA for telling my girlfriend I'm uncomfortable with her drinking habits?  My girlfriend (20f) and I (20m) have been together for a little over 4 years now. Our relationship has been a happy one and I realize that I am very blessed to have her. However there has been one nagging issue throughout the entirety of our relationship, my girlfriend's drinking habits. She has always been the more outgoing of the two of us and likes to go out with her friends a good amount, something I have never had a problem with. However, about a year ago, she started relying on alcohol more and more every time she goes out. 

Now, growing up my older brother fought with alcoholism and drug addiction (weed, cocaine, pills etc.). He has since cleaned himself up and I am very proud of him but being exposed to that sort of thing growing up definitely effects me still. I am not super comfortable with copious amounts of drinking/drugs around me and prefer not to drink as a result. My girlfriend knows this, and we have talked in the past about my feelings towards these things and I always felt she understood and listened to my feelings.

Until recently, she's been going out more, including more alcohol, staying out later, not letting me know where she's going (which is not a requirement by any means, it would just be nice to know sometimes in case something happens), saying she's been thinking about trying drugs, and generally feeling sort of checked out/dismissive when I try to bring up how it makes me a little uncomfortable.

We had a big fight the other night about how she just wants to live her life and how I shouldn't be controlling, during which she yelled that she was "" not gonna end up a junkie like (brother's name)"". Hearing this upset me and I decided to spend the night at a friend's instead of escalating because I was not in a positive mindset to have a conversation.

I do not want to seem like I'm trying to control or limit my girlfriend at all, I'm just trying to find a way for us to both be comfortable and it feels like she goes out and drinks more without letting me know as some kind of ""in your face"" kinda thing I suppose. I love her and love our relationship, but I don't want to keep feeling disrespected. AITA?

"AITA for getting mad at my younger 19M brother for leaving dirty dishes in the sink? My younger brother (19m) has a  habit of leaving a dirty spoon he uses to scoop peanut butter into his shakes in the morning, and leaves it into the sink. He does this literally every single day, even on weeks where he's home all day. This ""shake"" he makes is literally 2 packets of instant oats, 1 banana, 1 scoop of protein powder and water. He's fairly skinny and underweight, maybe like 135lbs and hes 5'8, so my theory is that he's taking this shake to try and gain weight, but hes been taking it for the last 6 months and nothing changed, he's still a skinny looking kid, he hasn't told no one in my family yet why he is even taking this shake in the first place but thats not the point lol.  This whole spoon thing has been going on for maybe 8 months now  
I already told him to stop leaving dirty dishes in the sink and leaving it for someone else to clean, and to just take the 1 minute to wash that spoon, yet he continues to do it.



My mother works from home however it's a very demanding stressful job, she usually just eats breakfast at 8:30 am, starts working at 9am and skips lunch, so she eats when she finishes work which is around 6:10pm - shes at her desk upstairs from 9am to 6pm, so whenever she has spare time to grab a snack down from the kitchen she ends up washing his dishes. I told her to stop doing it because you're telling him it's okay to leave dirty dishes in the sink, but she doesn't understand and doesn't think its a big deal and being the kind loving mother she is, washes it for him anyways. She doesn't really even see the issue that I see with hi leaving dishes in the sink, and my dad doesn't think its a big deal. I should also say that whever one of us leave something in the sink and he goes to wash his dishes, he purposely only washes ""his"" dishes and leaves whatever that he didn't use in the sink. If you're gonna not wash other peoples dishes then why do you leave ur stuff in the sink?



Is it not common sense to not leave dirty dishes in the sink for someone else to wash? I understand if you're in a rush and you don't have time to do it, but he literally only makes his shakes on days when he doesn't go to school so he has plenty of time. Why would you leave stuff for your 55yr old parents to wash when you have plenty of time?

I told him off multiple times, but he doesn't even acknowledge what we are telling him. My mom asked him why do you leave the spoon in the sink and he says in a childish voice ""No I don't"". This is how all conversations with him go with my mom dad and me, he just doesn't acknowledge any of it and literally ignores us all.

"AITA for selling my family 'heirloom' jewellery? I (F33) inherited my nans earrings when she died 10 years. My sister (F35) was given the matching necklace. We have both loved them very dearly, nan wore them on her wedding day so I wore my earrings on mine, and my sister wore her necklace. My sister was very, very close with our nan, closer than I was, and dreams of passing her necklace onto her own children some day. She has always been a little put out she didn't get the full set.

I recently had some financial issues that were mostly my own fault. I bought a dodgy car that blew up on me last year, which ended up needing replacing. In my new car, registration completely slipped my mind and I ended up getting fined for driving an unregistered car. Then to top it all off, our rent increased and I had to buy a new laptop and phone (essential for my work) after dropping mine down a flight of stairs.

I haven't been on a good run.

Anyway, as much as I really didn't want to, I ended up selling my earrings a month ago to help cover some costs. I sort of had a breakdown and didn't want to tell anyone, most of my family is very well off but my job really isn't paid as well as I wish it was. I love it though, so there's that.

Last week my sister came over and while we were chatting, she asked where my jewellery box was ( I used to have it on display, she wasn't snooping). I sort of froze up before explaining what had happened and how I sold them. She didn't yell but she got very quiet and asked why I didn't say anything, that she would have bought them from me and matched the price.

She went home shortly after, and won't answer any of my calls or texts. This morning I got a call from our very, very upset and angry mother asking why I sold the jewellery. That I should have been more responsible and how could I do such a thing without even telling anyone. She says that my sister is pisssed, she is pissed and that I am an irresponsible asshole.

We were laying on the couch and she was watching me doom scroll on IG like we do sometimes, but we came upon this post that was describing a personality trait for my astrological sign (cancer) and it said “I will not beg anyone to stay in my life… If you leave I might be upset, but I’ll get over it.”

She laughed a bit and said that’s good to know and hugged me saying you’ll be okay. 

At this point I was confused, thinking like okay maybe it’s a joke but I don’t find it all that funny and so I say, “what do you mean by that? Why will I be okay?” 

Which she hugs me tighter and restates what she said. At this point I’m feeling like I need some validation that she’s not being serious so I tell her I don’t find it all that funny and she responds saying that she isn’t laughing and at this point I’m feeling upset. So I tell her you can’t say stuff like that to me in such a serious manner. 

Which she now responds, “what did I say?”

I went nonverbal for a moment because I am unsure how to restate our whole conversation to her which she then throws the blanket off herself, says fuck your life and that I ruined her night before slamming the door to our bedroom. 

I can see how maybe she was having like a moment of humor that I misinterpreted as something serious and she didn’t know how to explain it maybe. 

Also I don’t make posts like this usually so I apologize if it’s laid out weird or anything.

"AITA for calling my bf the worst after he didn't want to keep something I made him? I (f21) realized a fun way to hang out with my bf (m20) while hes doing his own thing is by making clay charms or mini sculptures for him. recently I spent a few hours on a little frog holding a knife, I sculpted it, baked it in the oven and painted it but when I was placing him on my boyfriends desk he said I should take him home. I asked why and he said its because he ""doesn't like a bunch of little things hanging around"" I got kinda sad because I spent so long on that charm I made it just for him so I packed it away in my bag and said ""you're the worst"". he seemed kinda hurt by that, we moved on quickly but now I still feel bad. so AITA",0.93
"WIBTA If I went into work just to see my horrible CEO get fired?  I (24F) am an assistant at a small blue collar business. There are 4 employees: me, my manager Tiffany(41F), the CEO Jane(44F), and the owner Dave(66M). Dave takes care of the field work and the rest of us take care of the paperwork.

Jane has been working for Dave for 20 years and was his 1st employee. Tiffany joined a few years later, and the two of them basically became Dave’s daughters since he doesn’t have any kids.

Now, Dave is a straight shooter who doesn’t care as long as everything gets done.

Tiffany is a great manager who’s always on top of things and together we do everything at the office. Unlike Jane, who does absolutely nothing. 

She comes in a few days a month for a couple hours, and disappears for weeks at a time. For instance, this past month, I saw her 1 day when she came in for an hour. She is getting paid for 40 hours a week at a good rate.

How does she do this? 

Well, she’s an excellent manipulator. She has talked and cried her way out of several huge mistakes. One time she didn’t bill a client for a $10,000 job. When Dave found out, all Jane had to do was start crying and all was forgiven. 

She also has faked countless illnesses and injuries. She’ll tell us that she’s on bed rest because she’s having heart problems while posting herself and her kids riding roller coasters on FB. The kids are always sick, the pets need the vet, etc. She also has a habit of copying whatever actual illness Tiffany or her kids have.

And every time, Dave believes her. He’s not on social media, so he doesn’t see her posts. He’s also in the field a lot, so he’s not there to see how often she’s absent. On the rare occasion she is in, he’s certainly not getting details about the Brazilian wax she got when she skipped work yesterday (not all of us are so fortunate). 

Tiffany has tried to tell Dave so many times, but he never listens.

It’s gotten worse, as over the course of the year, she’s started giving me her invoicing, she’s never there to send payroll out, so Tiffany took that over. She just has the annual report due to the state. 

This week he sits me and Tiffany down for a meeting (Jane has not been in, of course).

The big news: he’s firing Jane. 

Apparently Jane majorly fucked up. The annual report she had to do? She never did it. So when Dave walked into his meeting with the state inspectors to discuss it, thinking Jane sent them the report, he was chewed out for never submitting it. She didn’t even start it. 

He tells me he’s going to fire her on Thursday, but told me I can take the day off to skip the mess.

I want to be there, but I’m not sure it’s the right thing to do.

My friends want me to go, but my parents say I shouldn’t. The shitshow might be entertaining, but it’s still a woman losing her job. Her husband has a very lucrative career so she’ll be fine, but it’s still a human being losing their income. 

I’m going back and forth on what to do. Am I a terrible person for wanting to witness my boss lose her job?",0.8
"AITA for making my daughter (19F) break up with her BF (20M)? I'll be using an alt account since my daughter knows my main account in reddit.

To start this, I (39M) have been in semi-good terms with my daughter (19F). Me and her mother separated when she was still a child due to personal reasons. I didn't get to contact my daughter as I cut contact with her and her mother back then until she contacted me back when she was 17 informing me that her mother passed away. I was devasted not knowing that her mother passed away for a year and my daughter asking me if I could take her in as she wanted to go to a better senior highschool and college for her future. During this time, I remarried to her now step-mother (31F).

When my daughter got into college, she met a guy from her class. They hit it off quite well. She was dividing her time to spending time with me, her friends, studies, work and her then boyfriend. I then asked her before new years if I could meet him. She then set up a dinner for us at a restaurant. As me and my wife were sitted at a table, her and her boyfriend were 10 minutes late due to an appointed she had with work. My wife started hating her boyfriend as she thought being punctual is a high standard to have. I shut her off saying that my daughter had an appointment that day and to be patient. When they got to the table, I remember seeing and hearing my daughter being happy that she got high honors. I was so proud of her as she worked and studied hard for her time and attention to be divided for people to be happier than her. Then me, my wife and her boyfriend got into the talk. I thought her boyfriend was nice and all. As for my wife, she hated her boyfriend. After the talk, we finished dinner and went home.

As we got home, my wife talked to me saying I should tell my daughter to break up with her boyfriend because she hated him. I called her unreasonable until she exlaimed that my daughter has to focus on her studies and work rather than her happiness. Saying stuff like what if she gets pregnant, be distracted, etc. We then argued all night and I ended up having to agree as she brought up points of how my daughter is always happy with giving more time and effort to her boyfriend and always in a playful mood rather than using it for her work and studies.

I then had a talk with my daughter the next day. She started off being happy and planning for her upcoming birthday. I then brought up that she has to break up with her boyfriend or else we won't fund her college and her birthday. She started crying and breaking down asking why. I then told her what my wife told me, and ever since then, they broke up and she hasn't been the same since. She stopped being overly happy, her grades started going down, she started giving empty responses and started smoking. My wife's cousin called me and my wife an asshole when we consulted to her. My wife then argued about how it's unfair for us. Now I'm feeling immensly guilty for all this, AITA?

Update: I tried posting an update, and it turns out I can edit here. So, I talked to my daughter without my wife being there, and as you guys probably expected, she couldn't salvage their relationship, and she found out that he cheated on her. So now, I told her to tell me anything without my wife being there or she doesn't have to know. I apologized to her profusely, and she said she's mostly pissed at my wife for what happened. For now, we decided to have a more father-daughter time bond to make up for everything. As for my wife and I, I'll have to have a serious talk with her later night.",0.8
"AITA for wasting my parents' money on therapy? My adoptive parents make me go to therapy and I hate it. It sucks and I make up dumb things to talk about.

Today, I went in and I told my therapist I was giggling over someone who provides 40+ dating coaching services and I laughed the whole session about that uncontrollably. I'd start to say a few words and then I'd just double over laughing. I was laughing so hard that he was gonna charge $10k for 3 months of coaching and I needed 58888 tissues to wipe away my tears from laughing so hard.

Well, I told my dad about it and he cracked a smile and was like ""Okay, just hope you won't end up needing it lol,"" and whereas my mom completely went ballistic and told me I was wasting her money on therapy (but she's still making me go).",0.53
"AITA because I don’t go to a family crawfish boil 5 hours away? My grandpa was an alcoholic up until 5 years ago. Before that, he did not show up for much and he always creeped me out because he had naked pics of young women all over the house and a lot of porn on his computer amongst him being just plain weird making comments about sexual stuff all the time. 

Since he got sober he has been way more involved which was nice so last May me and my husband invited him and his wife and my parents to our beach house and it was pretty fun. He mentioned there that he has killed people when he was oversees working at an oil rig, beat up a girl in class, and other horrific things. He’s also just always lying about random stuff like seeing Dolly Parton naked so it’s hard to decifer truth and lies however I do think based on how he said it that he has killed and he has beat up a girl. 

Anyways… he’s not my favorite person but I do care about him. He’s recently become super emotional because his health is starting to fail and I think he is worried about going to hell. (Before he was sober he got into a car accident and says he went to hell and they did change him ALOT) 

So back in February he calls me one morning and I was caught off guard so I answered and he announced he’s having a crawfish boil in March. I let him know unfortunately we could not make it because we were busy. This is true, we’ve had weddings or other friends and family life events every weekend for several months which is already stressful because we have a lot of home renovation projects going on so our house is always in a mess and we are struggling to keep up with everything. However he told me that he would move to date to April 13 since that was the first weekend I was available. (I slipped up and mentioned that) so I was forced to say yes. (Looking back I wish I would have just said no or we will see because of how busy we are but I was trying to be nice and actually wanted to make it work) after I said yes he told me he would be inviting my uncle and cousin who I do not speak to because of a big falling out. Which I found rude to say after I accepted the offer but just said okay. They decided not to come.

I just found out a few weeks ago that I’m pregnant with our first baby! I’m super excited but also extremely exhausted 24/7 and have headaches and some nausea but just definitely not in the mood to drive 10+ hours this weekend and spend yet another weekend away from home neglecting our projects. 

He has been texting almost every day asking me if I’m ready for this weekend etc.. :/

I feel bad for leading him on. But I really do not want to go. Being around my family gives me a lot of stress and due to being pregnant I just think I should focus on being happy and getting my house in a better state instead of doing what I really don’t want to do. 

Am I an asshole? Does anyone know what I should do to get out of this in the most polite way possible?
Thanks in advance! ",0.09
"AITA for being jealous of my Mom's weight loss? I (14F) have been overweight/obese since I was young. My Mom (53F) had also become overweight ever since we moved back to our home country, around 9 years ago. Before that, she had been relatively skinny her entire life. We have a very close relationship.

We decided to lose weight together in September of 2023, with her seemingly losing much more weight than I did. It made me confused, considering we both ate the same diet and had similar levels of activity.

Turns out, she has Stage 4 Metastatic Cancer. We got the diagnosis in November 2023, explaining her rapid weight loss in the months prior. 

Since the diagnosis, she has been complaining to me about how much weight she is losing. She often asks me for my old clothes that I have grown out of, because she has become too slim for her own clothes. 

I often complain to her as well, instead about my struggles losing weight. After she was diagnosed, I put back on the weight I had lost, which made me frustrated. I've only began losing weight again recently, but the number on the scale is always fluctuating. 

She often tells me that she understands where I'm coming from, but I don't think she understands the way I feel.

Earlier today, my Mom told me that she thinks I've been acting weird about her weight loss. She told me not to be jealous of her, because it's due to the cancer. It made me annoyed, because it's true. I don't want to be jealous of her, especially because of her situation, but I am.",0.83
"AITA for badmouthing my mom to my therapist? I (15M) was having an online therapy session that was paid for, we were having a trial period and it was the 3rd session. The therapy was done in my room on my bed, While my mom stays in her room. It honestly helped me feel a lot better about myself when I was dealing with self-confidence due to my grades hitting lows and pressure for college. 

In the 3rd session I was talking about how I felt like I was on eggshells near my mom, because small things can make her angry, leading to more shouting and I didn't feel comfortable near her as much, leading me to avoiding her. When my therapy ended I walked out of my room when I realized that my mom was listening in through the door with tears in her eyes, my siblings said she put her ear on the door after she had to help them with something. She understandingly got angry, shouted at me about how much she did for me and how she didn't deserve this.

She went to her room and didn't want to talk to me, I felt horrible about it because I realized she was crying, the next day I could see she didn't want to talk to me and was crying over it. I honestly felt horrible and felt like I should've never said that, but at the same time I felt like I lifted a huge weight off of my shoulders

"AITA for telling my bio sister that I don’t feel comfortable taking baby gifts from her? For context, I am completely estranged from my toxic family (both parents and siblings) and have been since I was a teen. Household was super abusive, we were constantly in & out of foster care and it was a cycle I wanted out of. Over the years one of my sisters and I got close-ish, she had a baby and it was pretty traumatic for her so I spent a lot of time helping them out so she could heal and adjust .. she ended up making me the godmother and I was thrilled. I love that little boy with everything I have! A few years after he was born, I found out that I was pregnant… around the same time I found out sister was feeding information about me to our abusive parents, which led to them harassing and stalking my partner and I. The stress caused me to miscarry. It was an incredibly devastating time, we ended up putting a restraining order on my parents and I moved away to a different province to be safe as I tried to heal from this. This is when I fell out with my sister. Long story short, she texted me to tell me that she was pregnant again & that she cannot trust me with her kids (after I spent my last few days in their province with her son/my godson). I was grieving the loss of my own baby, grieving the loss of my parents ever being healthy normal people, and now grieving the loss of the relationship with my only biological family that still risked talking to me. 

Flash to now, about 7 years later, I am back in the province with my partner and found out we are pregnant. Currently I am in 3rd trimester and baby is doing amazing, I want to do absolutely everything and anything I possibly can to protect them. Since announcing we are expecting, sister has reached out here and there congratulating me and asking how I’m doing through the process. I’ve been keeping the conversations very surface level and haven’t gone into details, I guess I’m scared to get attached or risk my baby getting attached just to be disappointed again. Last night out of nowhere she told me that her and my other sister whom I haven’t spoken to or seen in over a decade have bought me a baby swing and asked if I was having a shower or if I just wanted them to give it to my partners mother (she works with her) & this is where I might be the asshole. 
I told her that while I’m grateful they’re trying to help, I’m just not comfortable taking gifts from people who are practically strangers to me. We don’t know each other like that anymore and I would like to at least be at a stable talking point with them before we do anything extra. She responded with “I thought we were grown enough to move on from that” but … we haven’t even talked about it so how can we move on? I’m not comfortable with pretending nothing happened and I don’t want to risk extra stress during this pregnancy but I’m feeling guilty for “holding a grudge”. AITA? ",0.06
"AITA for telling my best friend to keep the present she bought me? I(20m) have been friends with 'Jessica'(20) ever since we were 13.

Yesterday was my birthday. She gave me a bottle of Hugo Boss cologne.

I was quite surprised to see what she got me as a gift and asked her why she spent so much money this year. 

Jessica told me she feels bad about breaking my heart and thought she could make it up to me by getting something extra nice this year.

I told her I don't feel comfortable accepting an expensive present from her, that I don't want her money to be involved in what we have(her parents are loaded) and that I don't need expensive gifts to get over her.

"AITA For calling my best friend a behemoth. I never thought I would have to post here but I’m truly lost on what to do next so time to ask internet strangers for help. So my (20f) bestie (20f) have been inseparable since childhood. We went to all the same schools all the way up to our current college. You would think we were twins if it wasn’t for the height difference. I’m 5’2 while she is 5’11.

She always got bullied since she was taller then everyone else. Despite that she never let it get her down and is the most bright and bubbly girl ever. I always envied her for that since I’m more introverted but still did manage to make my own group of friends. In high school her bullies would use me as a comparison since we were always together. 

They always would compliment me on my small, curvier frame while bashing her for her height and smaller assets. We never let this get to us and she began to embrace herself while I still kinda lagged behind. When we got to college she always switched up her outfits, makeup, and hairstyles. While I kept to my skirts and dresses with a low braid. The only thing I really switched up was my hair accessories. 

Despite her always looking awesome and making friends with almost everyone she had trouble finding a boyfriend. Something she complained to me about daily which I don’t mind. And I genuinely think everyone is crazy she’s stunning yet all they see is her height.

This is the case with her current crush. Let’s call him Brad. Brad (21M) is your typical college guy. He’s friends with one of our mutuals so we hangout with him often. And they seem to really get along whenever we all hangout. 

So one night after a party I felt my social battery run empty so I called my fiancé to come pick me up. I made sure that she had some way to get home and she had the whole friend group with her so she was fine. I hugged her told her to get home safe and went home.

I woke up sometime in the afternoon and went to her house. She smiled and acted like normal. I asked her how was the rest of the party since I left early and she said it was fine. This is when I knew something was very wrong. She would usually tell about the party in detail, so I asked her about it. She said nothing but I kept pressing her until she finally blew up at me.

She went on and on about how everyone always likes me because I’m so small and cute and how it’s not fair. She went on to insult my personality and even called me fat. She said she confessed to Brad but she wasn’t his type because of her height and that he liked me instead. 

I then said something I’m not proud of and said that it wasn’t my fault she was a fucking behemoth and stormed out. After about 10 mins I regretted what I said and tried talking to her but now she has blocked me on everything and won’t even answer the door. I don’t know what to do I sent her paragraphs apologizing and no replies. I even asked our friends for help but she blocked them too I don’t know what to do now so AITA?",0.5
"WIBTA if I tell my friend to stop messaging me so often I have this friend who sends me a message on a certain messaging app approximately 5-6 times a day. Almost all of the time it’s something totally irrelevant. Like an emoji or a meme or a link to something she finds funny. Often she sends me selfies of herself at work, at home, pictures of her food, screenshots of conversations she has with other people etc.

I’ve noticed that she is always on her phone talking to people and that’s fine for her but I don’t see this as an option for myself. I feel no need to update her multiple times a day as to what I am doing nor to discuss what she is doing. I see no point in having long conversations over chat. Mostly I see no point in any conversation over chat which does not have a concrete topic. Want to ask me something specific or ask advice or make arrangements to meet or whatever - that’s great with me. But doing that several times every day? Too much for me. 

So her messaging me is wearing me down and messes with my concentration at work. I don’t want to be rude but I really don’t care what she had for breakfast or what new clothing item she bought everyd day. Maybe I would have cared if she did it like two-three times a week, but multiple times a day is too overwhelming.

Or maybe I’m a bad friend. Anyway I’m thinking of telling her that I do not have anything meaningful to chat about 6 times a day so she should stop mesaaging me so much. WIBTA if I did that or should I find some way to restrict her / remove notifications?",0.11
"AITA for booking a family holiday without my partner I (30F) just booked a family holiday next year for me, my son and our soon to arrive baby, to celebrate one of my oldest friends weddings abroad. My partner (30M) and I have been very on and off recently, he is the father of the unborn baby and has only been intermittently supportive throughout my pregnancy, I am currently 27 weeks pregnant. 

My partner became very nasty towards me because my ex (the father of my son, 33M) stabbed someone before Christmas and I am now currently going through court proceedings to gain sole custody of my son. Unfortunately my ex has been a nuisance throughout mine and my partners relationship and has ruined previous events such as Christmas, it's safe to say my ex has a lot of narcissistic tendencies. So my partner was extremely upset when my ex stabbing someone happened at the same time as when we announced our pregnancy. However my partner since then has become quite nasty, saying things like I've ruined his life or that i trapped him. Therefore he has caused me significant stress and upset throughout my pregnancy. 

When it came time to book for my friend's wedding, he was extremely hostile with me and even normal conversation turned nasty, so i made the decision to book the holiday on the basis that me and him were no longer together and that he would have minimal involvement, since i was having to prepare for that likely outcome anyway.
 
Fastforward to this week and my partner has been supportive for the whole week with only one argument about the whole situation (it's been 4 months and he still makes every issue about what happened). So I told my partner about the holiday and explained that if he wanted to go as we previously discussed before the incident, then he just needs to pay for himself and we can ring up and amend the booking. 

My partner fell into a rage and started calling me the most selfish person he's ever met and started to list everything he feels I've taken from him, including now his first family holiday. I pointed out that I'm not taking away his holiday and offered to add him to the booking, but then he argued that he can't spend money when I'm 'wasting money for baby on selfish and ridiculous expenses'. Keeping in mind that the only money I have asked him for towards baby is that if he wants brand new baby items then he will have to buy it, as I have stuff from when my son was a baby and have no issue buying second hand. He then stormed out and has continued messaging me since to remind me of how selfish I am. 

I understand that firsts with baby are important and a sensitive issue but I'm not trying to take that away from him. But he seems so upset and confident in saying what I'm doing is extremely selfish, where as I feel I had no other choice considering the situation, am i the asshole?",0.61
"AITA for being tired of living with my sister?  I [21F] have been living with my grandpa in my home country for last two years. I moved for uni. My sister [18F] moved with me and my grandfather in fall 2023 to start uni, same one I go to. The last two years I have done the bare minimum of house work bcz the house is too big, I get overwhelmed,easier to ignore, get a cleaner every  few weeks. But since my sister moved she complains about the mess sow we agreed to work together.
 I am in my last semester and so the pressure is on. The thing is she gets icked when washing dishes or basically anything that involves something wet, when I try to give her tasks that are simple and “clean” like folding laundry, she procrastinates until I get overwhelmed and have to do them to relax or I call my parents asking to talk to her and she still procrastinates.

A lot of times she says she wants to shower and I would too and the bathroom would need a light  cleaning. I ask her to shower I’ll have my turn after  and I will clean the bathroom too. She will keep delaying until it’s late and go take a long shower. This is very irritating as we usually have classes early the next day and I need my sleep (otherwise I get migraines for days) when she seems to be able to run on no sleep. The few times I got fed up of waiting and showered and slept before her I have woken up to the bathroom floor full of hair and water. 

I admit to sometimes getting angry and shouting but  i am trying to it control, by calling my parents, which feels wrong as we are both adults, who say “you are the oldest you need to be patient she is new to this country and away from her parents “ or get mad bcz we are bothering them. The thing is I was once new to the country and was depressed have been away from them for 3 years now and have been complaining since summer how tired I am and that I miss them and they tell me “it’s fine it’s almost over” and now I am looking for a job in the country they are in to be close to  and my dad is saying “no need to worry about that since you will soon have your own salary and will want to live alone or you will get married and move out so don’t think about living with us”. 

Another thing that really annoys me as that whenever I have a call with my parents they bring my sister up, I have asked them multiple times not to and they humor me for that single phone call only.

It’s important to note that both of us were born and raised abroad before moving we only visited our home country in summer. We always had help in the house doing all the cleaning. 

With all this in mind I am tired and am asking my parents to furnish their  apartment here just so I can have somewhere to go when I need a breather. And they are saying it’s not a big deal and to calm down and it’s not fair of me to ask them to get the apartment furnished for such small issues. So am I over exaggerating the issue? ",0.65
"AITA for not wanting to lend my sister my friends computer monitor For context my (24F) sister (22F) just started her first full time job and is working from home a few days a week, so she wants a monitor to plug her work laptop in, and does not have one yet.

In February my boyfriend came to visit for a month (he lives overseas) and my friend lent me a monitor specifically for him to use as he was working remotely during his trip, and also likes to play games. This is an expensive monitor and retails for over $1,000. My friend is now overseas till June so I still have the monitor until she returns.

Me and my sister share and car and I have had issues in the past where she doesn't take care of it properly but does not take responsibility and says it wasn't her (e.g: leaving the car lights on overnight and ruining the battery when she was the last one to use the car and i found the car with the lights on, the next day) or random damage to the interior of the car like a cracked entertainment screen that was not there when i last used it and she was the only one to use it since. I've also had issues of lending her things in the past and then after using it for a while she says I never lent it and it was always hers.

I told her she could borrow the monitor until she gets her own/until my friend comes back and needs it but on the condition that if anything happens to it she is responsible to replace it (which I felt necessary to specify for the reasons above, and also because its not mine to start and I wouldn't feel comfortable giving it back in any condition worse than it was given to me in) and she complained to my parents. My parents told me i was being selfish and ridiculous for specifying it and that it was rude of me and I shouldn't have any problem lending her the monitor. My sister then preceded to say how I let my boyfriend use it who I should trust less than I trust her, and made fun of me and my boyfriends relationship due to our long distance.

I feel like my friend specifically lent me the monitor for my boyfriend to use and almost uncomfortable to just let someone else use it without her permission. I also feel like i no longer want to lend it to her after how she reacted to the situation. So am I the asshole for specifying that she is responsible for it if she breaks it, and would I be an asshole if I now don't let her borrow it?

EDIT: I initially told her she could borrow it if she covers any damages if she breaks it AND if my friend says it was ok - forgot to mention that. My family also thought it was 'ridiculous' that I wouldn't give it to her immediately and I wanted to check with my friend. I Was never planning on lending it without asking with my friend first.

It basically all came down to her starting an argument why I would wanna leave my home country anyways, which has been on my mind for years btw, and blamed it on my closer surroundings. Sure, I’ve had friendships fall apart, people becoming more flaky and so on in the past year, work has been shit, my education suffered and I dislike the city I live in. But it’s the bigger picture for me. Simply moving to another city won’t do the trick for me and she doesn’t understand it. I’ve grown out of the mentality most of my fellow countrymen and -women have and I enjoy living in my other language. I already got a taste of it and it’s absolutely clear to me that I don’t want to stay here. She said I’ll be all alone and I told her that I’m well aware of this and she said “well if that’s what you want”. She said she can’t understand why I’m abandoning my family and she will act “accordingly” by never visiting me. She said something along the line of “you don’t want us, so we’ll act accordingly”. I told her I’m abandoning nobody, I’m simply moving away to live a hopefully good life in a place where I feel like I could actually belong and asked her what difference it would make to her if I moved to city XYZ in our country or a different place a couple of thousand kilometers away and she said “you could get in a car if something is up” and I said “what would I get in a car for?”. What’s trains and cars now, would be airplanes in the future - where’s the difference? Then she said it again, that I’m abandoning my family and she’s never gonna come visit me so I dropped her shoppings and said “you can go home alone” and walked off. She shouted after me “but you have the ticket” and I said “I know” and kept moving. We’re going by train and she’s sitting nearby so if anyone checked for the ticket, I would’ve told them there’s an elderly lady in a white coat, she’s on my ticket. 
But I’m generally just so fucking disappointed. I’m a grown ass woman, who maybe doesn’t act accordingly all the time, but for her, nothing I ever do is right or good enough…",0.97
"AITA for refusing to throw my brother’s fiancée a bridal shower? Wedding season brings out the absolute worst in people, so here we go. 

My brother Jay is marrying his fiancée Debbie in July. Debbie asked both me and my sister Christina to be bridesmaids, but we both turned it down (this becomes relevant later). 

A couple of weeks ago, Debbie contacted me and Christina and demanded we throw her a bridal shower, though this was more directed at me as Christina is currently in university. Her reasoning was that it was the least we could do after we said no to being bridesmaids and didn’t have any costs and hadn’t contributed to the wedding yet. I told Christina I would handle it since she is very conflict averse, and I sent Debbie back a polite text saying we will not be planning, hosting, or attending any such shower. Debbie got very angry and implied that she would try to uninvite us from the wedding. 

(I don’t think I am wrong in thinking that this is something the maid of honour unusually does for the bride so I’m curious why this evening came close to landing on our plate in the first place)

Jay asked both me and Christina to reconsider, and even said he would pay for it if we’d just pretend we did but I said absolutely not, and Christina can’t really plan it all on her own. Jay is now getting pressure from Debbie to react to this in some way (I guess she wants us uninvited or to have some kind of “consequences” for us not helping).

This has caused a fair bit of drama. Jay’s mother (not my mother) has used this as an excuse to lay into him about Debbie, whom she dislikes. Jay’s dad and best man are giving him shit for letting her treat us this way, and Jay is digging his heels in because he feels like we’re all ganging up on him. He’s accused me of pretty much ruining the wedding planning experience and thinks that he won’t end up with a lot of family there if this goes on. 

I don’t think I’m in the wrong for not wanting to do the shower. Am I? 

Edit - we said no to being bridesmaids because we are busy. Christina is a full time student in a different city. I have a start up to run and the construction of a house to oversee. Neither of us had the time for dress fittings, her bachelorette trip, all the ancillary brunches and lunches etc.. Christina has a significant age gap with Debbie and she is a shy person, she wouldn’t have wanted to do it without me since she doesn’t know anyone else. From my side, I don’t have the bandwidth and even if I did, being a bridesmaid isn’t fun unless you’re close with the bride. But the overwhelming reason we said no is because we couldn’t dedicate time to it and thought it was best to leave the position for people who wanted it and would have felt honoured. Debbie picked two other bridesmaids. ",0.33
"AITA reducing wedding gift My wife and myself are living in country x and have migrated there for job reasons. A few years ago a friend of my wife decided to follow us with his fiancée. 

We helped in finding a job, we helped in finding a flat, we helped with the move, we helped with all bureaucratic stuff.

Originally there where some issues with the flat and we were more or less blamed for that and even nowadays it's brought up here and there ""as a joke"".

We generally feel like all the help and effort we did was not well enough appreciated, because it was an additional stress and instead of thanks we get more demands of things we need to take care of or were we might be responsible for.

Recently i feel it's getting even more of an issue, i.e. my wife baked a cake and shared with them and got more or less critic on how weird it did taste from her friend. The critic is not the issue per se, but it was brought up in a setting where my wife was already clearly upset and stressed due to outer circumstances. 

My wife tries usually rants a bit but then asks me not to get also upset, once she has calmed down again. She is also pregnant (have not told anybody as she is in the critical beginning weeks), so extra stress is not the way to go.

Now the situation at hand : Said couple got recently married at the registry office and we gifted money. A few month later they also wanted to make a party and as we are nice - or stupid - we wanted to top up the original amount as we know how costly something like that can be.

As the wedding is abroad we did already spend around 1000USD + 800 USD for the bachelors party. We have agreed to go there, we could have - And should have - refused retrospectively.

2 nights of the wedding party were supposed to be at the venue (the one night we pay is because we arrive earlier as a security reason). And both my wife and me had understood that this was covered by the groom and bride. My wife is a maid of honor and they said something along the line they have a few special rooms reserved directly at the venue for her and me as they have booked the whole resort.

I admit, this was more a misunderstanding and we assumed we didnt had to pay extra. Nothing was added here, so it never occured to us to ask about a price. Also it came never up in the month where we talked about the wedding preparations.

So yesterday we got the question on how we actually want to organize ourselves for the paymentd of the room. Needless to say we were confused here and mad on top of that. We will first ask this evening what the price expectation is here.

WIBTA if I reduce the wedding gift accordingly if we take the room? (Let's say it's cheap 100USD, to reduce the wedding gift by that amount).
If the planned gift doesn't cover it, we tell them to find someone else for that room.

I know exactly I might be irrational because of the things that have happend before. My brain is arguing between : Their expectation is insane vs. Why were you even assuming the room was free.

"AITA for eating meat behind my wife's back? My wife is Indian and I am American. We met in college and during our dating she was originally fine with me eating meat. My wife has always been a strict vegetarian.

When we began talking about marriage, she was very clearly when she said she would not marry me if I continued eating any meat. She said she would not marry a non-vegetarian under any circumstances, fish and eggs are off-limits as well.

I was happy giving it up for her. It did not matter to me in comparison to losing her.

We have 2 kids, both of which have been raised strictly vegetarian as well. 

Last week I went to the doctor for a check-up. I asked for dietary changes I should be making and he mentioned that I should be eating more protein. 

Now, normally, for protein I have eaten daal at home. But the doctor suggested some more, he said chicken or eggs are a good idea. 

Since the last week, I have been stopping on the way to work to grab a non-vegetarian meal. I feel really guilty but don't want to tell my wife because this is one thing she feels very strongly about.

I know there are vegetarian options but it is really costly. We are saving up.

"AITA to complain about my teachers because they favour our seniors more and don't even care about us? I (17F) got pissed off because our teachers like our seniors more than us. I mean they can like but there's shouldn't be injustice. 

1. Teachers give the seniors more attention and more often take them for study trips whereas for us they sometimes insult us in class and don't even take us on study trips.

2. They say that there is no fund therefore they can't take us anywhere but then they take seniors all the places they want to visit. We told that we would contribute to our trips but they didn't agree. 

3. They laugh with the seniors and make all the noise they want but when we talk to our friends, they be like 'You all are too loud. Are you all in fish market?'

4. We have labs where we are not supposed to eat. One day just because I didn't get time, I was eating in lab. The teacher saw me and told me to go outside and eat. But when it comes to seniors, sometimes the teachers themselves get food for them and they eat in labs. 

My classmates are really fed up of all the privileges that the seniors get. We are treated like we are nothing. I know this injustice is there in most of the schools but it just doesn't feel fair.

"AITA (and my husband) for recommending my SIL gets Botox? My (34F) and husband (35M) have upset my sister in law, Anne (38F) by recommending she get Botox. Which to be clear we would not of done had she not asked for advice. 

For reference, my husband both work out regularly, and follow a skin care regime. I have been consistently getting Botox, and other facial beauty treatments since I was around 25. My husband started when he was 29. 

We look natural, you would not know we had these treatments, but we are honest about getting Botox etc. 

Anne has never been into these things, and has always very openly called this a waste of money and vein. Recently Anne has been going through a self proclaimed ‘glow up’, as part of this she asked me for skin care advice. 

I have given Anne advice on products, but said she would be better going to see my dermatologist who I love, Anne didn’t want to spend the money. This was around a month ago. 

Last night she was round and was saying how I looked a lot younger than her, I told her it was honestly probably the Botox, and that she could give it a go and it would help with her frown lines. My husband also said the same and pointed out how prominent his were before getting Botox. 

Anne did not say anything last night, however today we have had a message calling us rude and disrespectful for calling her ugly (we didn’t) and that we were out of touch with our attitudes.

"AITA for asking a transgender an interview about exclusion?  I’m currently in 2nd semester in social work studies. One of the requirements is an client-centred approach to psychotherapy about exclusion. I follow a mtf person on insta, after listening to a podcast about trans identity. So I thought I will give my shot and ask her about the possibility of doing an interview with her. My message was polite and I never mentioned her trans identity. My thoughts process was that she’s willing in participating in a podcast, I could shoot my shot. My message was very formal and didn’t mention her trans identity. Well she blocked me. I’m afraid to be labeled as transphobe now. I thought that since she spoke about her journey in a podcast, she’s willing to talk.

"AITA for cancelling dinner while my husband was at work Context: my husband owns a coffee shop that usually closes at 10PM but sometimes he would close it earlier if he wants to.

Tonight, my (24F) husband (25M) told me that we should eat out for dinner since we didn’t have food at home. I said yes, and suggested that we go out around 9PM and told him I’ll put the kids to bed at 8PM with the house clean and everything. He agreed, and by 8:30 both kids were already asleep and the house was clean. I messaged him that I’m ready and if we could go now.

He said that he still has a customer, and I was fine with it and mentioned something about the food. However, he didn’t respond then 9:30 rolled around so I message him again. Nothing. At this point I was STARVING and getting hangrier by the minute. I kept messaging and calling him but no response, I was getting upset bcs he does this all the time. I would usually be fine but tonight I was hungry plus the kids woke up. I messaged him that I was going to just fry an egg and this dinner is over, he can eat out alone.

That’s when he started messaging me again telling me he was busy and he could just order me food, but I told him to forget it bcs I’m not going to starve myself again waiting for him.

He got upset and said that I should be more understanding bcs he was working but he does this so much that I don’t want to deal with it anymore. AITA?

I’m not mad that we didn’t go out, it was the principal of just telling me if we were going to eat or not.

EDIT TO ADD:  
I didn't mention a lot of things that yall want an info about so here goes,

**1. Who was looking after the kids? this one cause a mass panic lol**

* my dad lives with us, he usually looks after them *when I'm not present* *(edit)*

**2. What did the kids and granpa eat, if there weren't any food?**

* the dinner I cooked earlier that night, I didn't cook anything for me and hubby cause he wanted to eat out.

**3. Why not have a snack?**

* I did, but it wasn't cutting it cause I was an exhausted mom that needs more than just snack at that point, plus, if I eat anymore I would've lost my appetite.

**4. Why not just go to his place and bring food?**

* We live in a small town, the shop was located in a neighborhood that is unsafe to walk at night. I don't have any means of transportation, and doing a 20 walk isn't really a safe option.

**5. He said he was busy with a customer.**

* he said that around 8:30, dinner the date was 9 which was the time the customer left. However, relatives came by and he wanted to entertain them but he didn't bother to tell me that until around 10:30

**6. Why suggest dinner at 9, when shop close at 10**  
**-** the place he wanted to go to closes at 10, but since we often go there around that time, it has became a habit for him to message the resto beforehand, so when we arrive the food is ready and where out of there after 30mins.

**7. Don't plan a date during the work hours.**

* I agree, poor planning but earlier in our convo he was complaining that it was a slow night and should just closed the shop early.

**8. What do u mean ""he does this all the time""?**

* I mean, he would make a plan and not go through with it, and that's not just when his working. He would make plans with me then be out with others friend/family later, when our time come to do something, he would stop responding and would respond much later.

**9. Ungrateful for being a btch that he had to work late, while I just sat my spoiled butt waiting for food in my mouth. I was going to ruin the business with my attitude.**

* where did yall get that? I was fully capable of feeding myself, but he insisted on the dinner together. Also, why would I want to ruin a business I initially funded? I also work, and am the main provider. I didn't think this info was relevant, yall are wild for making that assumption. The part that I was upset was not giving me a quick update, not the part that he was still working.

Thank you for everyone's response. I appreciate it. I will discuss setting hard boundaries regarding set times for dates. Also, it was hilarious seeing yall making assumptions about me. Thanks for the laugh.

**ETA:**  
I live in a southeast asian country where (1) living with a relative is the norm, hence why I didn't mention it I honestly forgot that it wasn't the case for other countries. (2) Covid restriction have been lifted years ago, so that's why most of the food businesses here close around 10PM or later. It's normal.

The neighborhood we live in isn't the safest for a woman to walk around alone that late, but that doesn't mean that a couple of people wouldn't go hangout at a coffee shop. It's not that deep. Also, I would appreciate it if you would actually read the part that stated it was his idea to close early, idk why yall keep saying that I was forcing him to close early lol",0.25
"AITA for telling my sister I don't want to got to concerts with her and her partner because we are too big to sit together and would rather go by myself regardless? I (26F) love to go to music concerts. My sister (29F) and her partner (30M) and I usually go as a group as our music tastes crossover.

To preface; I am a massive introvert and have struggled with with pretty bad social anxiety since the pandemic. I have certain sensory issues which makes it so I hate to be touched, it makes me uncomfortable and itchy and can sometimes trigger an anxiety attack if I'm over stimulated. 

So I find it much better and less stressful to go by myself.

Lately however, we've been going to so many, that its become a more tiresome than a fun activity.

There is also the issue of us being on the bigger side. I'm the smallest of the three of us but because the size of the venue seating is usually small, my weight is probably the biggest you can be while not encroaching onto others space and still remaining comfortable. But my sister has larger thighs that usually spill over into my seat and trigger my anxiety, and since her partner is kind of the same he cant move over either.

So most of the concerts I've been to in the last 6 months or so have been an overall not so great experience because of my anxiety. I stress about it the night before.  but this is increasing my misery tenfold, as something that once brought me immense joy is now filling me with dread.

But on this particular occasion, one of my favourite bands announced a tour and I wanted to go. My sister, however doesn't really listen to them, so I thought that this might be a good opportunity to go by myself. 

But when she asked if I was getting tickets I said yes and she replied 'okay, you convinced me' like I begged her to come with me. SO this kind of made me upset, because she does that a lot. Like she always invites herself over without warning, has me drive her home without asking me and little things like that. And I've said to her before that I don't like it but she still continues to do so. 

Like for instance;  I enjoy a specific local artist who does shows every few months or so and I like to go. I invited her to one of them once and now every time they're playing a show she wants to go, which is fine but sometimes I just want to go by myself and have her not be there!

(I also get pretty much zero alone time as I work with my sister and my housemate is WFH and never leaves the house)

I said 'You don't HAVE to go' and 'its fine, I can go by myself' but then she kept on like dismissing the fact that I didn't invite her along or anything. So I told her 'I want to go by myself so I don't have to be worried about being squished the whole night' which made her upset because she is very self conscious and it's something I never comment on. But I was just so annoyed that it slipped out. She told me to go fuck myself which like fair but also not as she's very aware of my no touching issue and that I get extremely agitated when touched and that I am usually in a bad mood at concerts

I've since apologised, but AITA?

"WIBTA for suggesting to my friend she only pays what she was supposed to? My best friend ""Elaine"" is a bit of a people-pleaser. She's been slowly growing a back-bone, but it's still a work in progress. She planned a trip with another friend, ""Camelia"", who's always late and does things last minute (running joke amongst our friend group that we have to give her an earlier meeting time, and she still manages to show up last).

They were planning to take a train, and there was a promotion on the train tickets (19€ each). Elaine was busy, so Camelia said she'd get them for the both of them. Now, turns out she didn't, forgot, and just bought them today at about 25€ each. It's not a big difference, but Elaine was miffed that Camelia asked for the full reimbursement with barely an apology for her mistake.

At first, I figured, no big deal, it's 6€, they'll even it out with a drink or something eventually. However, Elaine started saying it was her fault, that she should have been more responsible and booked the tickets herself, etc... It annoys me that she switches back to blaming herself, and I want to tell her to only pay what she was supposed to (19€) ans stand-up for herself.

Camelia is pretty laid back and I think she'd understand the issue (especially since it's only 6€), but at the same time, I'd be interfering in their business, and possibly stir up conflict when Elaine is *very* conflict-avoidant. However, I do think it'd be good for Elaine to stop blaming herself and start advocating for herself, and it'd be easier in this setting, when they know each other pretty well, get along great, and she knows Camelia is probably going to be chill and understanding about it.

"AITA for not wanting to forgive? So I had a situation yesterday and I'm super conflicted about it.

Right now, I'm injured so I'm staying with my grandparents. They basically raised me so this is my home. Since I can't drive (shoulder injury) I let my grandmother borrow my car. When she was coming home, something happened and the key fob wasn't working. I gave my grandfather the other fob and he went to go give it to her. She was 10 minutes away so it should have been a 20 minute trip. 

An hour later, they finally get home, after not communicating with me AT ALL. Turns out they went to a dealership to get new batteries for both FOBs (which I would not have agreed to if I'd known) and instead learned it wasn't the FOBs messing up, it was the car being weird. The dealership told them how to use the hidden keys and get into the car and start it (which I'd tried explaining but I didn't do good enough I guess)

My grandfather said something about it and I replied negatively because I was upset at the lack of communication (I did try and text them, got no response) and the fact they made a decision about my car without my consent. This isn't the crux of the issue though. 

During the fight, he told me ""go home"". To some this wouldn't be a huge deal but it sent me into a depressive spiral. I can't ""go home"". I can't safely drive between the pain and the pain meds. I can't turn my head to check when changing lanes. I can't ""go home"" because my grandmother would be devastated if it left. I can't ""go home"" because my grandparents house is supposed to be my home, it's where I was raised and where I'm supposed to be loved...

Obviously my grandmother has told him he needs to apologize but I don't want to hear it. In the past his apologies have always been ""I'm sorry but..."" apologies which aren't genuine. He never owns up for what he says or does wrong. He thinks he's always in the right and if someone dares point out how he did wrong he gets loud and shouts over the other person (which is why this turned into a fight because he'd interrupt me in the middle of my sentence to give some BS excuse and I'd try to continue my sentence so we'd both be getting louder)

My wife and I have been together 5 years, and got engaged last year. When discussing our wedding, my wife was very adamant about wanting to elope.

"AITA for calling my ex irresponsible for losing a dog he had for only 2 weeks My ex (24M) and I (26F) broke up amicably, & agreed to stay in tough. Prior to the breakup he was in the process of looking for dogs to adopt. Agencies rejected him because he had to work in the office 3 days a week. I agreed to vouch for him & say I would stay at home with the dog while he's at work, so that he would get approved. He then got approved and the dog was on its way from Ukraine, but there were delays & we broke up before the dog arrived.

After the dog arrived we were still in contact so I got updates. She was traumatized & is scared of everything.

After 2 weeks I got a message from him saying the dog was lost, she slipped out of her harness while they were on a walk. I couldn't believe what I was reading.

I told him it was irresponsible of him to put her in a harness that she can slip out of, & that he should have learnt his lesson when he was fostering a dog who also slipped out of her collar on a walk with him(that dog didn't run away thankfully), & that the poor dog must be so scared&hungry. He replied ""don't you think i'm beating myself up enough? the adoption agency said its not my fault and the dog is so happy to be outside, she's been seen a few times enjoying herself.""

His reply sent me into a fury. I understand it was a mistake but he's taking 0 accountability for his part in it, & to say that the dog is happy outside alone with no shelter & no source of food is so delusional.

I then said I don't think he's beating himself up enough after hearing his reply, &reminded him I played a big part in him getting this dog so I am allowed to be mad that he lost her after 2 weeks.

He replied saying that the organization that helps people find lost dogs also told him its not his fault & it happens all the time, that the sightings of her are her happy and running about, that dogs go into a feral state after a very short period of time and revert back to their instincts of hunting and surviving, & that he's out looking for her all the time. He then calls me rude and says it shows my character for judging and having a go at him, & he regrets ever telling me, & that in the future if i ever ask about the dog he'll just lie.

I said I don't care how many people tell him its not his fault, he should have known better than to put a dog that's scared of everything in a harness that she can slip out of. Also that not all dogs have the ability to hunt and survive on their own which is why many rescue dogs are found close to starvation. I then said I'm glad he told me because I am now reassured in ending our relationship because his inability to accept and handle criticism for a mistake he made shows how childish he is.

He then calls me mean, manipulative, and hateful. And says that I'm the only one being disgustingly horrible to him.

"WIBTA if I showed up to my sisters friends house to retrieve something that’s mine? WIBTA if I showed up to my sister’s friends house to retrieve something that’s mine? 

I, 16M, recently lent my sister, 17 (almost 18) a THC pen, that she could let her friends BORROW for a party 

Sooo, backstory, my sister doesn’t go out much, she’s never drunk, and when she does go out to parties it’s to help people who are drunk and to hang out. She doesn’t like the idea of alchohol, which is completely understandable. She recently moved to a new school, and so, she was invited to a party (by a ‘friend’ of whom I doubt is genuine at all). My parents in response wanted to help her so organised providing alchohol etc for her to bring. 

In my opinion, I felt like my sister was being a bit exploited here, she can be a real suck up to be frank, and has trouble saying no. She is never in charge of plans, and will cancel basically anything if a friend opens up any time for her. 

I lent her a thc pen that she could let her friends use, at this point I thought it was a ‘meet-up’ of 3-4 people. I said just don’t let them have too much and I’ll be awake for you when you come back to give it back. 

So then I realise it’s a party right after she’s left, I text her saying, I didnt realise 40 people were going, please only let 1 or 2 people use it. 

Then, my dad picks her up, 2am by the way, and she texts me saying she gave it to her friend and she’s keeping it for the night. I ask when she’ll be able to get it back and she says she’s next seeing her at school, in a weeks time. At this point i’m kind of pissed, this was something I owned, and I believe she had no right to give it to someone.

So I ask where she lives, and she is a 30 minutes cycle away, so I’m like: “It’s okay, don’t worry, I’ll be able to just pick it up, I’m sorry I got angry, I hope you had a good night, just pass over her number and I’ll text her in the morning as it’s probably too late right now” 

I feel bad for my sister, and knowing how she is, I probably should have seen it coming. This girl obviously plans on using it a fuck ton, which would be a lot of money which she wouldn’t even be paying. 

So it comes morning, I know she’s been drinking a lot and so I text her later (even though usually you wake up considerably earlier after a night like that) and she doesn’t respond. Keep in mind, I have her address, I text her saying may you please reply otherwise I might just show up at your door. (I get I sound like a dickhead but i’m kind of angry with her having exploited my sister knowing she’d say yes + the fact that she knew it wasn’t my sisters and that she was taking something without the consent of the owner) 

It’s currently 2pm, I think I’ve given her enough time, WIBTA if I just showed up at her door asking for it back? The interpersonal conflict here and the issue is the fact that I could cause conflict between my sister and her ‘friend’, and that my sister might hate me because her friend may stop talking to her",0.6
"AITA for showing a photo of me in a bra to my stepfather?  I am 28F and I was spending some time at my mother’s place over Easter. We were discussing the fact that I wore a bra as a top for a date and that I think it is a stylish thing to do if done properly. I was saying it didn’t work really well on me because I am quite flat and the bra was gaping, so basically one could see inside the cup if taller than me.  My stepfather was sitting with us but not commenting on it, he just listened. Then my mom asked me to show her a photo so I showed a few pics from that evening, that I had taken before leaving home. She acknowledged that it looks nice but that the cup size isn’t the right one for me. She joked that my date probably had a good view on my nipples. She then stood to go grab some tea, and my stepfather said « I didn’t see the outfit » and I naturally turned the phone to him. Then my mom came back and said « I hope you aren’t showing your tits to my husband ». I was shocked, I started to shake, and I said well no I’m showing the outfit as I just showed you. She said I should maybe take the next train and go (which was anyway the plan as I had said I’m leaving soon) but I really felt bad and she was literally kicking me out.  It’s been more than a week now and we haven’t spoken.

"AITA for accusing my MIL of faking being hospitalized and refusing to let her stay with us My husband is 57 and I am 49. My MIL is 81. She used to be very independent but since my FIL passed away a few years ago, her health has been declining (she can walk and take care of herself, she’s just frailer) and she’s become much more softspoken and generally nice. Being perfectly honest, she never used to be easy to get along with, and my husband agrees. But anyways that’s alright. I didn’t have much contact with her and she had her own life, my husband visited maybe once every few months because we live very close to her, about half an hour. 

Recently though she wants him to visit more often and she gets upset when she isn’t invited to things we are doing. For example we recently went on a trip to celebrate my husband’s birthday, and he didn’t want to bring her as it would really limit the sorts of activities we could do. She insisted we should have gone on a “chill” trip and brought her. 

Last week we had gone to visit my family. My MIL called my husband and said she was really sick and admitted in the hospital, my husband obviously panicked and we both took a flight that evening back home to see what was wrong. It turned out she was totally fine and apparently had a mild cold. We spoke to the doctor and she said my MIL had said she “couldn’t breathe” and when the doctor said she could go home, she insisted on being admitted. 

I told my husband it sounds like she just wanted to be admitted so you would come back to check on her. He was appalled, but later on agreed that it did kind of make sense and sound like something she would do. She wants to stay with us now because she is “sick”. I said no, she is faking it and I don’t want to deal with her all day. My husband thinks I’m being a selfish asshole.",0.53
"AITA for not wanting my girlfriend going to the lake with other guys? Here’s some context for you. We’re both 17. Her friend John (straight, single) asked her if she wanted to go to “jump tree” with him (Smth involving jumping into a lake from a tree or smth idrk). She responded saying “my boyfriend probably won’t let me.” This already was a little hurtful. I would never ‘not let’ her do anything. Just makes me sound more controlling than I am.
Anyways, she then asked him if she could invite more people, making it more likely I’ll say yes. They invited one other guy and there’s a couple girls invited but they haven’t said yes yet. 
As of now it’s her and two other guys going to this together. I told her she can do whatever she wants but it’d make me uncomfortable and I’d rather her not.

I’m mainly frustrated because the easy solution here would be to invite me. John openly told her to invite whoever she wanted, and she decided to best answer was inviting more guys that aren’t me.

"AITA for telling my (30f) coworker (24f) that destination weddings are tacky? The first mistake was discussing our personal lives at work, but our job has a lot of downtime and I knew my coworker was getting married this summer so I started asking her about the planning process and what she and her fiance were leaning towards for a venue. We live in a pretty large city (think state capitol of a highly populated state) and I was assuming the wedding would be local since we have so many great bars and restaurants here. She talks all the time about how much she and her partner love their neighborhood and how important it is to support local businesses - but she's getting married about 2,000 miles away, and is expecting all of her friends and family to stay for a four-day weekend at this relatively pricey tourist destination.

She asked me what I thought, and I was honest - I told her that in my experience, destination weddings cause issues. She got upset and said that it wasn't a real destination wedding, since her fiance is foreign and his family will need to fly in from their homeland anyway. But that doesn't make traveling for that long any easier for her family, so I tried to explain that that's what I meant, and then she ran away crying. Later on, one of our other coworkers that's closer to her came over and chewed me out - apparently her family is small and she's self conscious about that, her parents are divorced and she's not inviting her father, and also apparently it's racist of me to say that her fiance being foreign doesn't give her an excuse to throw a destination wedding - which isn't even a fair representation of what I said. My point was that what's normal in a family with a child overseas isn't normal in a family that's local, and that I personally wouldn't attend a wedding where I had to take two/three days paid time off, AND rent a hotel room, AND attend several days worth of activities, unless it was like my sister. I know from other conversations with her that the guest list is like 200 people long, and I've had many more friends get married than she has - she's going to be disappointed when the RSVPs come back! 

Now the atmosphere at work is icy, and I'm not sure if I need to apologize and if so for what - she shouldn't have asked for advice if she didn't want the truth! I'm sure her special day is going to be special to her, but it won't be special to other people to the same extent, and that's just the truth.",0.95
"AITA for telling my son his boyfriend isnt a good influence on him? My oldest ""Caleb"" (16M) has always been the closest to me. We bonded over sports and he's a natural and I've loved bring his coach  from football to wrestling to soccer and track  kid does it all. Sports helped us get through his mom dying and what ""happened"" to him his 9th grade year with his 1st boyfriend. But now all of a sudden hes become this whole different person  this year painting his nails  and doing musicals and dressing differently and coloring his hair. Its like its just not him anymore.

It all started a few months ago when he started dating this pushy goth boy ""Ian""  (16M).As soon as they started dating all I hear him saying is that Caleb can stop pretending to be so butch or that hes overcompensating etc. I originally thought you know hes almost 17 maybe Caleb is just exploring a bit but he just started changing so fast. Then last week he tells he wants to take a break from sports for a while  and I was just flabbergasted. I mean the kid loves sports. I never made him go out for anything he chose to ppay and I know he loved and he keeps all his trophies shined and up on his wall and out mantle piece.

I immediately ask him if this has anything to do with Ian. He gets defensive and says so what if it does. I tell him that he used to love sports and how it was our thing. He tells me its not about me or us.Confused I  tell maybe Ian isnt a good influence in him. Ian seems to be constantly pushing him to be someone other than him.

""Ohmygod! Can I get some chocolate milk?""

And I was like ""no??"" 

And she kinda pouted and was like ""Why not?"" 

And I snapped ""because I got this cause we're fuckin poor and you don't ask for shit from someone in a situation like that?"" And she kinda scowled and rolled her eyes and said ""Bro, I literally live in a hotel."" As if it's some kind of poorness competition. I just walked away and went home and want to know if I need to apologize to her tomorrow when I see her again or not, because I feel kind of like an asshole right now.

"AITA for kicking out my wife's identical twin for showing up to my room completely naked? My (31 M) wife Lisa (31 F)  has an identical twin, Laura (31 F) She doesn't wear much clothes. Both Lisa and I are traditional. She told Lisa that she wants to visit us as it's been a while. I asked her to let Laura know that she has to dress decently. She conveyed it to Laura, who agreed. She was to stay for a week.

She started to wear short clothes again. I was mad that she broke her word, but I did not say anything anyway.

But it came to a head yesterday when she began to wear clothes which displayed cleavage. She said ""It's my choice to wear whatever I want to."" And then  ""I bet you don't mind when it's my sister at night.""

We managed to avoid an argument. But this morning Laura decided to play a ""prank."" She knocked on my room where I was working & said she's brought me coffee. I thought it was Lisa as I'd asked her for it some time back.

She showed up completely naked, and I was shocked. And that's when I learned about this ""prank."" I got mad and she said she just wanted to teach me a lesson. A huge argument resulted and I kicked her out. She's mad at me, though.

"AITA for telling my wife to quit her job because she could do it with our sons instead? For context me (M29) and my wife(F28) have been married for the past 4 yrs and have been blessed with two sons. Recently my wife has been complaining about the difficulty of her job more and the amount of work she has to put in following a workday. I work about 50-60 hrs a week whereas she works 40hrs a week and I have tried to increase the amount of home work I do over the weekends lately.

The problem for me lies in the fact that we take both kids to daycare which costs a pretty big chunk of our budget and is more or less 70-80% of her income per month. I make enough for all of us to be more or less in the same financial situation with a few more overtime hours a week if she quit her job. 

And since she has been complaining recently when she started venting yesterday I told her she might as well quit and just take care of the boys, and id bump up a few hrs since it's pretty much the same type of work (she works in social care). According to her I'm minimising her work and just not focusing on the real problem.

I've tried to talk with her about why she doesn't want to just quit if she keeps whining about the job in the first place, but haven't had much success today. AITA?",0.8

My mother agreed with me my father said "" that's just the way she is"" and went to make her breakfast. I told him to grow some balls and pick a side, cause while he doesn't do anything to help, he expects me to do whatever he asks me or else he'll throw a fit about how bad I am.  
I can't move out because I'm still in a university and just don't have the funds.

"AITA for not wanting to wait anymore and leave? I really like my bf but w've been dating for a month and haven't had sex yet and I am getting tired of waiting. He is 20, I am 19. I don't know what to do because when I bring it up to him he says later or when the moment is right but it seems like the moment is never right for him. I feel like there has been a lot of good moments so far. When I ask him, he says that he doesn't want to wait till marriage but he does want to get to know me better. He says he needs to be in love to be able to have sex.  
It really sucks for me though and I'm thinking about leaving but IDK how I can deal with this. The thing is we got together because my close friend, Matt, introduced us and I asked Matt if I could go out with him and he said yes. But when I told him about how I'm not sure I can wait any longer, he got mad at me.  
He said a man in the same position would be called an asshole, a jerk, all these horrible things for leaving and I was a jerk for not being able to wait for a few more months. I guess I see where he is coming from, but I'm confused because personally I would not think a guy was a jerk for walking away at that point. It really hurts to think the person you are dating doesn't want to have sex with you. But Matt is not bothering to understand me.

It just feels like we're incompatible. But I dunno.

"AITA for being pissed off my step mum invited to me her wedding on what would have been my dad’s birthday.  My dad died from prostate cancer just under 4 years ago now. Since then I (M34) have tried to maintain a decent relationship with my step mum even though we never really connected. So today I received an invite to the wedding with her new partner. No worries about that, she has the right to move on, he seems like a decent guy, loves my baby sister (F16) to pieces.

My problem is that yesterday would have been my dad’s birthday, and the postmark shows she sent it yesterday by priority/first class mail. It’s not just me but my uncle (dad’s older brother) also got the same treatment. 

My dad and step mum were married for 16 years and together for nearly 20. I refuse to believe she didn’t know what yesterday was. I’ve got no issue with her moving on, it just feels at a minimum thoughtless to send the invitation at this time. She can move on that’s her right, but I’ll always remember my dad at this time of year, and my uncles birthday was 3 days ago. 

They were always close being 2 years and 2 days apart and always sharing birthdays. To make it worse, I’m seeing her on Sunday and she could have given it to me in person. AITA for being pissed at the timing of her invitation and wanting to confront her? ",0.92
"AITA For how I spent my lunch? Today, I had a work lunch with my mentor, a senior manager, which we had arranged from three weeks ago after postponing. I work from home, so this was important face time. Last night, my wife asked me to reschedule, because our two kids (5 and 2) would be home from school so we could have a family picnic. I said I would see if we could move later this week, but the lunch was important and I didn't want to push it back again. She repeated her request, and I said again I would see about later this week, but I didn't want to push it another week.  
My mentor was unable to reschedule if we didn't meet today, so we agreed to meet. I told my wife 30 minutes before I needed to leave, and she started tearing up. She said it was really important to have this time together. I said it was too late to cancel, and I wished she had said how important this was the night before, so I could have canceled. She said I should just go, and I said if it was this important I would cancel. She said I was being mean, and it was too late to cancel and to go. I said I could get off early and then go picnicking, but again she just told me to go.  
After driving, I arrived at the restaurant, empty. Long story short -- he had the wrong restaurant location (same chain, different city). We agreed to reschedule to next week at this point.  
I left, heading to the dry cleaners. I'm traveling to a funeral Friday, and needed to get my suit cleaned. I always planned on doing this after lunch, or it wouldn't get done before the trip. Afterwards, I was literally across the street from my son's school, so I ran in to pick up something we left there. I called my wife afterward I left the school (45 minutes after I left the house) to say I was heading her way, but wanted to stop at the store since we have 1 roll of toilet paper and no paper towels, and need some urgently. She didn't answer, so I stopped by the store. She finally called back and I told her I was picking up the items, and asked if she needed anything. She didn't, and I checked out and headed home. I arrived home about an hour and 15 minutes after I left.  
I knew how upset she was about me leaving, so I moved some meetings and spent another hour and a half with her, her sister, and the kids. I returned to work later, and even though I had told her I wanted to finish early, I wasn't able to since I took so much time after lunch.  
After work, we talked. When she heard about the lunch mix-up, she said how I ""hurt her twice"", and I knew how sad she was, and when the lunch was canceled I should have come home immediately. I said I needed the dry cleaning and had called her to check in. I said the groceries were important and I would spent time when I got home, but she said because I didn't immediately come home, she was so hurt, and I should have known given she had cried about it before. And then she was upset I didn't get off early, because I spent an hour and a half with her and the kids when I got home.

"AITA for telling my mom that it’s her fault i don’t have a job for context, over 5 years ago in middle school i went on a ski trip that was hosted by my school. While i was there I had a pretty bad fall on one of the harder hills which resulted in me breaking my spine, however, probably because of the adrenaline i didn’t feel it at first and told the employee that saw me fall that i was fine. By the time i got down the hill i was in so much pain i was crying, since i got down the rest of the hill the teachers that were supervising the trip told me to just go home and if my mom wanted to take me to the hospital she could. 

I got home (it took me almost 3x longer that normal) and over the next few days i begged my mom to take me to the hospital but because the teachers said i was fine my mom thought i was over reacting. (i literally cried in bed for a week before i could get to the bathroom on my own). 

A few weeks ago my mom and i got into an argument because i didn’t have a job, i tried to explain that because of my back pain i have limited options. I had also just recently found out that i broke my spine a while ago and when i was at the hospital they said it had looked older and ask if i had any injuries in the past few years, i told them what happened with the ski trip and they confirmed my suspicions that my chronic pain is being caused by that (i now have a fractured spine(it didn’t heal) a herniated bulging disc, sciatica and scoliosis all diagnosed by a doctor). 

The doctor had also told me that if i had gotten medical attention when i really needed it that i would have been fine now and wouldn’t be having back pain (it’s not just a i’m out for a day and i’m fine, it’s gets so bad that i can’t control my bladder and bowel movements).

During the argument she started getting angrier and was purposely pissing me off and i eventually snapped back at her and said that most if not all of my back pain was her fault along with some other not nice things i shouldn’t have said. My mom said that i should be great full that she kept me and raised me before storming away. 

So am i the asshole for telling my mom that my chronic back pain is her fault?

"WIBTA for not paying prorated rent to my son when I move… Apologies in advance for the length of this post. I (f46) currently live with my son (24) his gf (23) and their two children (4 years old and 18 months old) in an apartment. We’ve lived here for over a year and a half. The apartment is a very nice 2 bedroom with a huge closet in the master bedroom, a beautiful fireplace, a large bathtub with jets and an electric floor heating system. Our rent is $900 a month and includes all utilities except internet service. The whole time we have lived here I have paid 50% of the rent. (Which I have never had a problem with until now).

We have come to realize that we cannot continue to live together (they are extremely messy and have cluttered every room but the bathroom and clutter triggers my anxiety so as you can imagine we don’t see eye to eye on cleanliness) and I am getting ready to move into another apartment in the same building. I am just waiting on the landlord to get it cleaned out and ready for me to move in. 

Due to the messiness I stopped using the kitchen  months ago and purchased a small fridge for my room to keep my food separate. I usually eat at work or at another family members house 95% of the time. I also stopped using the washer and dryer since the clutter is in the floor it makes it hard to walk without tripping on stuff, so I do my laundry at work. I stay in my room and only really use the bathroom and do not sit in the living room at all anymore. 

8 months ago, my son and his girlfriend allowed a friend (m26) who was down on his luck to move into the apartment. He doesn’t have a job, and lives on the couch in the living room. To my knowledge, he has never paid them anything this whole time and has not looked for a job. He is permanently planted on the couch 24/7. All three adults play their Xboxes every waking minute and my son is the only one who has a job. His gf stays home with the girls and their friend. 

They know I have been trying to save $1500 for the deposit and 1st months rent on the new apartment. But yesterday my son asked when I would have this months rent, and since I have no idea the exact date I will be moving, my son and his gf decided they were going to prorate my rent if I am still there after the 22nd of this month. 

This was decided without even a discussion with me and I am very upset about this. I don’t feel I should be expected to pay $15 per day after the 22nd and feel I have been paying more than I should especially since there are now 5 of them and only 1 of me. I am planning on having a discussion with my son about this but im not sure what to say, so WIBTA if I refuse to pay after the 22nd since I can’t afford to keep paying rent when we have agreed and decided together that we can’t live together and I can’t afford to pay rent there and come up with the money I need to move.

"AITA For getting fed up with my friend? (NSFW mentioned) I'm (20f) getting tired of dealing with my roommate's and I's shared friend (19f). 

I met my friend in university this year through my roommate introducing her to me and due to interpersonal conflicts with her own roommate, I've let her stay the night multiple times at my dorm sleeping under my bed. 

She'd start staying nights very frequently, sitting at my desk and making a mess on it when I wasn't there that I'd have to clean up, keeping me up at night by blasting tiktoks from under my bed, not letting me focus on studying because she'd ramble on and on about problems in her life, oversharing information about her and her sex life/girlfriend we'd rather not know, only ever talking to my roommate and I about negative things and essentially using us as her personal therapists. I have a hard time being confrontational so I'd just shut up and listen.

She's said that she has autism in passing so maybe the oversharing and the lack of social understanding might stem from that but at the same time I feel as if I shouldn't excuse her actions with her nuerodivergence. The way she talked to us reeked of selfishness and she'd shut us up about certain topics (divorce, death) only to continue discussion about it with our friend group herself.

I put up with it until the recent passing of my beloved lizard, I had my baby for 8 years and she had stuck with me through thick and thin but she ultimately had to be put down due to cancer. This absolutely destroyed me. I just wanted to be alone and cry my eyes out but she never took the hint even if I was curled up sobbing under my blanket. After one particularly lengthy cry session she said something along the lines of ""I know what'll cheer you up"" and showed me a voice message of her girlfriend talking to her. I didn't care. I didn't know her and I still don't. The girlfriend you've spent lengths talking about what nasty shit you've done together isn't going to bring back my baby. I didn't get mad, I was too spent that night so I passed out. 

I didn't think about it all too much when it happened but now looking back on it I realize how messed up it all was but at the same time I feel guilty because she's a sweet girl who's going through problems of her own, I'm very conflicted but at this point my patience is running thin.",0.03
"AITA For asking my wife to acknowledgement the things I do for her and our family? So for some backstory me(23m) and my wife(21f) have been getting into it over her always telling me I do nothing for her and not acknowledging anything that I do. I started getting super irritated with it recently because I'm tired of hearing it all the time its degrading and I feel like it's frankly not true. I am a mechanic I work 8am to 5pm Mon-Fri and am home for an hour everyday for lunch (12-1). when I'm home I play with the baby(7months) because I know she needs a break I help feed him when he is having baby food and not breast feeding.

 I help put him to bed but I do not wake up at night with him. I take our daughter(4 almost 5) to school every morning even though half the time it makes me late (my wife is supposed to get my daughter ready while I'm showering and getting ready for work) but most the time she just snoozes the alarm and sleeps until the last second. She usually only ends up doing her hair because I'm horrible at that shit I can hardly get a pony tail to look right after 10 attempts XD. I cook sometimes its not often but I do cook a sometimes, and I make her special Mexican foods that take me all day and night to prepare because she like's when I do the low and slow cook method for them.

Little things like I've given up my vape for her because she bought one that didn't taste good even though it doesn't taste good to me either. I help clean its not a whole lot I mostly help pick up trash/take out trash, fold up blankets, clean up scattered toys around the house from my daughter. putting dirty clothes in the hamper, sweep or mop, vacuum, I clean the guest bathroom (it is smaller), Get baths ready for the baby, Any time she asks for help I help her even when I'm tired or not in the greatest mood ETC. I do everything for her family (Her parents own a farm, her mom works all day everyday as a nurse at a correctional facility, her dad is crippled from back pain and surgeries done on his back. and have all kinds of animals and 6 family members living with them.) I fix all the cars that need work.

She keeps telling me how I do nothing for her and I don't help her. I've expressed many times how this makes me feel and that I don't agree, but she just keeps saying that the things I do are just my job so they don't count. I understand that's my role as a husband and a father but am I wrong to want some kind of appreciation or acknowledgment? As a stay at home mom its her job to cook for and care for the kids but that doesn't mean that I don't appreciate the things she does. I tried telling her but nothing will change her mind. she's always saying how she could find someone who was so much better and I really didn't think I was that horrible... and I used to be terrible I can admit that. We were parents at a very young age I had just turned 18 and she was about to be 16 and I was shitty its not an excuse but I had no idea what I was doing and I was terrified.

My Sister is doing her social service in a children's hospital and her ""salary"" is 700 pesos (roughly 41-ish USA dollars) monthly, 350 pesos per fortnight; on April 30th, in Mexico, we celebrate Día del Niño (Kid's Day) so schools and everything children related places make parties with bouncy houses and food and all those things, the hospital is not the exception, and the staff is going to dress up in a Circus theme because ""they are original and Disney Characters or Superheroes are a no"", my sister chose to be a lion tamer and the celebration at the hospital it's going to be on the 26 not 30.

&#x200B;

Yesterday, we went looking for the costume, to rent it, I mean she's going to wear it for half a day after all but we couldn't find one she liked or fit so she looked for one on Amazon and asked me to order it, I did, mind you the listed price was 350 pesos (roughly 20 USA dollars) and then (after shipping) it ended up costing 600 pesos (roughly 35-ish USA dollars), with an estimated delivery time of April 23- May 8, and my mom asked her to look for it somewhere else because that's a lot of money they don't have right now to spend (we need to fix the dryer and we don't know how much is going to cost) to which my sister said: ""I did and Amazon is the only option"".

&#x200B;

Today, I was at work, doing nothing and I looked for the costume on AliExpress, for half the price, free shipping, and estimated delivery of April 20- April 28, so I told them and the convo went:

 Mom: order it too, and we'll see what happens

Sister: Why are you going to spend double?

Me: It's cheaper and it's your fault... I won't order it but YOU should pay for the costume from Amazon.

Sister: yeah, sure, because I have the money... asshole

Me: No one has 600 pesos for a costume YOU are going to wear for 2 minutes.

So now she's refusing to talk to me but I still think she should pay for it, at least for the shipping, AITA??",0.83
"AITA for wearing crocs to a formal event? I (25f) got invited to join the honor society at my college, and they held an induction ceremony last week. The dress code was business casual, and I wore a dress shirt and tie with black pants. And… crocs. I know, I know, but hear me out. I have chronic pain and can’t wear most shoes. They’re extremely painful, to the point that I’m unable to walk after 5-10 minutes. Crocs are the only shoes I’ve found that are somewhat comfortable.

My family was giving me shit about my choice of footwear, and my friends made a few lighthearted jokes in the group chat. And then the school posted a photo of all the inductees in stage and my crocs stuck out like a sore thumb, which caused my mom to call me an asshole for ruining the photo. Is she right? I’m not thrilled that I wore them (it was kind of embarrassing tbh), but if I wore any other shoes then I wouldn’t have been able to walk or go on stage for the ceremony.

"AITA for telling my father off for taking my money while I was asleep? Me (14, tm)

Let's start with an explanation. 
I don't like school, I don't think anyone here actually does. waking up is a pain for me, I cannot fully wake up until I play a game or something at school.
the setting is...god knows the time, all I know is it was dark blue outside. I wake up to my father's voice and him sitting on my bed. grogy me can't even open my eyes, I'm like half asleep practically.
""hey, can I burrow some money?""
really...? you woke me up for this...? ah whatever. usually he only needs a 20 for gas and pays it back after a weak with interest, so I'm 100% good with lending him money. 
it was my birthday on April 4th, and I got what a 14 year old calls 5 months rent (200$ CAD in adult language). it was all in a zip lock bag on my nightstand.
anyways back to the story, so tired ol' me is -like yeah...sure...it's on my nightstand....- I barely remember saying that, like I said, I was half asleep. thinking he's gonna take 20 - 40... no, this bugger takes it all, all of it, every last dime. WHAT ON EARTH COULD YOU POSSIBLY NEED THAT FOR?!

obviously I'm mad. after school, I confront him. he offers interest and I'm like fine...
next day, curiosity. what did you need the money for?
apperantly to PAY MY MOM...and nothing else. this man took 200$ from me, half to pay my mom and the rest for his own damn pocket.

I flipped out. 
I was rude.
my dad is the nicest guy you'll ever meet, he didn't deserve what I had said to him... and now I feel like an asshole.

"AITA!?!? My girlfriend thinks she’s not important  
AITA 
I (34m) and my girlfriend (33f) went through a rough patch last year and separated. We have started seeing each other again for the past 3 months. We have had several major arguments and she thinks it’s my fault. It’s the same argument, I apologise and say I know I’ve done wrong. I take full responsibility for the making the mistake but I won’t do what she’s asking of me. 

I have a son, he lives with his mother and I have visitation. A few times I have had plans with my girlfriend (she has a child too so we are keeping the kids out of it until we are stable, so that means our time together is already hard to come by) but I have forgotten the plans and have told my sons mother that I can have him when she needs. Because I have forgotten that I had plans with my girlfriend, I also forgot to tell her on these occasions that I have organised to have my son instead and when she’s found out it’s been by accident and she flies off the handle. She says that she feels like I don’t care about her and that I should tell my son’s mother then I forgot I had plans and I’m no longer available. 

This time it’s happened it’s been a weekend where she’s working and her son is staying with family. We worked out two weeks ago that we would have time together this weekend. I assumed it would only be late Saturday night so I have said I can have my son while his mum has tickets to an event. 

My girlfriend has gotten upset and angry and is demanding that I say no to having my son as we already had organised to spend the weekend together. She works in the afternoons and has said I should compromise by saying I can have my son in the afternoon instead of the morning. I think she is being selfish and overreacting. Am I the asshole?

I don’t socialize with family much as by the time I get home I pass out from exhaustion. Life can get repetitive and time passes.

After todays fight with my mother which involved her calling me out on neglecting spending time with family and her putting my efforts to achieve my goals down and saying they are a waste time, I want to distance myself further away from everyone.

"AITA for not wanting my gf of a year to take a guy friend to her prom while I’m running at a state-qualifying track meet Me and my girlfriend are seniors who go to rival high schools and I just qualified for regionals for the first time, which is one race away from the state meet (so a big deal).

The only problem is that regionals is at the same time as her school’s prom and they are 5 hours apart so there’s no possible way of going to both.

When I told her this, her first concern was to figure out a guy friend to take as a date to her prom, insisting that they must be from her school and it must be a guy because the “aesthetic” of prom photos wouldn’t be the same by herself or with a girl friend plus the fact that the girl probably wouldn’t get a dress in time, which upset me greatly.

"AITA For Changing My Apple ID Password So my sister (22f) has used my (25f) Apple ID for years. Sometimes our phones will totally sync, she will get all of my texts, photos, and calls, and I would get hers. I have mentioned multiple times over the years that she needs to get her own account so I don’t have to worry about it anymore, but she refuses to do so.

For a little context, I moved far away from home after graduating, and currently wait tables as a survival job. My sister is in her senior year of college for engineering. She doesn’t have a job 80% of the year, but during holiday breaks and some weekends she will wait tables at her old restaurant. So, she has been mostly financially supported by our mom through college.

About 10 days ago our phones synced and she got my entire camera roll and texts. She had bought a new iPad and linked it to my Apple ID, causing the sync up. She calls me and tells me to delete everything that I don’t want her seeing, and I beg her to make her own account. She says she will in 6 weeks when she graduates, because she’s too stressed out right now.

Towards the end of the week she texts me that she is getting all of my texts again, and I tell her to fix it. She says that she is busy and that I need to wait until the next day. I’m livid and tell her she needs to do it now. She calls me a bitch and says if it’s really such a problem then I need to deal with it myself. So I got on my account and kicked off every device that was using it and changed the password.

She starts blowing up my phone with calls. When I answer, she’s hysterical. She went on about how terrible of a sister I am, that I have never supported her college career, that she has more friends than I do, made fun of my career choices, and so on. She kept saying that if i don’t give her my password that I’m not allowed at her graduation and she doesn’t want anything to do with me. I told her that she’s fucked up for holding our relationship over my head over something like this, and that she wasn’t going to get her way by being mean and manipulative.

I decide to change the password to my email and Amazon account (she has a history of “accidentally” using my credit card for her Amazon purchases). And this is when I find out that 2 days prior she opened an Apple Credit Card using MY Apple ID, and purchased a $1,500 laptop with a 12-month payment plan. It’s her name and social security on the card, it won’t affect my credit, but it’s connected to my account that she no longer has access to. This credit card cannot be transferred to another account, payments cannot be made without the Apple ID login, and you can only have 1 card per account.

She never mentioned this card, I can see now that her laptop was getting my texts and pics for 3 days before she said something. I told her that this puts me in a bad position, and she told me I was dramatic and selfish. Our mom also thinks I’m being dramatic, but she hasn’t heard my side of the story. AITA?",0.21
"AITA for Not Covering Everyone's Meals on my Birthday? Using a throwaway account because the involved parties know my main account.  
For context, last week was my (20F) birthday. I invited around 8 people to go out to dinner with me to celebrate, including Alyssa.   
The night went well and everyone went home happy, or so I thought. The next morning, I received a text from Alyssa letting me know that in the future, they would appreciate me letting them know they would have to pay for themselves. They said it was fine since it had already been done, but that  spending on dinner out had put them over budget. They also told me that some of our friends felt the same and that they had been talking about it, saying they felt it was a 'little rude.'   
Although they didn't seem extremely mad, it's been somewhat tense whenever we all hang out. I get the vibe that Alyssa now views me as somewhat selfish, or a bad friend.   
So I'm just wondering, AITA? Was it on me as a host to cover for everyone? In my culture, everyone just splits the bill or pays for their own meals, but maybe I AITA for assuming everyone would agree. I do feel guilty because I would never want my celebration to put someone in a bad place financially, and I don't want our friendship to be awkward now. ",0.5
"WIBTA if I called out my cousin to the whole family about the name she’s chosen for her baby?   
Sorry for any mistakes, this is my first reddit post. I (32 F) come from a fairly large family. With my dad’s side being Italian, we’ve always been extremely close. I have two older siblings, a brother and sister, and a younger half brother. Growing up, we were thick as thieves with our cousins. They were as good as sisters to me and my siblings.

Me and my older siblings lost our Mom when I was 10 months old. My Dad was driven into alcoholism, which lead to us being put into foster care for a while. With how hard our mom’s loss hit my family, no one from the extended family ever talked about her. No one brought her up or really mentioned her to us out of fear of sending my dad back into alcoholism. On top of all of that, we also lost our dad back in 2016.

A while back, both my sister Stacy and cousin Beth (fake names) announced they were pregnant. With Stacy having a boy and Beth having a girl. About two months ago, Stacy reached out to Beth and asked her about baby names they’re thinking of. Beth and her husband had gone back and forth on names but the first one they agreed on was **our dead mother's name**. Stacy nicely told Beth that me, her, and our brother have all talked about using our mom's name for one of our own kids. And if she were to use it, it would hurt all of us a great deal.

So you’d think that would be the end of it, but no. I imagine growing up with parents that made a lot of money and rarely told you “no” can sometimes make one lack empathy. After Stacy and Beth talked, Beth ghosted Stacy for 6 weeks. After which, she sent me and my older siblings a group text where she stated that they're moving forward with using our dead mother's name. Not because they want to honor our mom, and not because it holds some family significance on her husband's side. It's literally just the first name the two of them agreed on.

Stacy has always been the one to speak for our sibling pack, but she's pregnant and need to stay calm. I already dedicated myself to my Disney Villain Era, so I went up to bat for me and my siblings and bluntly responded to Beth. (If I can, I'll post the messages in the comments cuz character limit).

I love my family, but if my dad were still alive, he’d be raising more than just hell upon my cousin. I really want to bring this up with the entire family. I want to make it perfectly clear where me and my siblings stand, and what my boundaries are. I don’t want to be at any gathering with Beth or her child. I don’t want anyone to mention her child’s name around me. They didn’t mention my mom around us for 23 years, they can do it again. I feel bad because my uncle (Beth's dad) has always been there for us. He got us back to our dad when we were in foster care, and he helped with all the legal shit when our dad died. I just don’t know if I'd be an asshole if I brought this up before Beth announces the name to the whole family.

"AITA for refusing to cook for my BIL who lives with his gf My husband (32m) and I (28f) have been living in our apartment for more than a year now. Recently, my BIL (27m) and his gf (25f) decided to live in the same apartment building (we live in a separate apartment unit from them). 

My husband and I used to live with my BIL, MIL and FIL. When we used to live with them, I would usually cook meals for my husband and myself. I would also sometimes cook meals for everyone if I feel like doing so. During those times, my BIL would ALWAYS ask for food even though I only cooked enough for me and my husband. My husband and I would give him food anyway. We would try to split the food in three. There are also times when my husband would get mad at my BIL and tell him that he should start cooking food for himself because I am not his wife.

Fast forward to when my husband and I started living in our own place - whenever BIL visits, the first thing he asks me is, “so what’s our dinner/lunch today? What are you making?” I started getting annoyed by this. This happens almost every time he visits us.

Now that he lives in the same apartment building, he still asks me what I made for lunch/dinner and expects me to save some food for him, or invite him to eat with us. As I’ve mentioned earlier, he lives with his gf now, but his gf doesn’t know how to cook. Both of them are lazy when it comes to cooking.

WIBTA if I straight up tell my BIL that he should really start learning how to cook for himself? Because who is gonna cook for their kids eventually, when him and his gf start building a family of their own (they told us that they want kids)? I just want him to stop asking or expecting food from me. My BIL and his gf also have decent jobs and even earn more than me and my husband, so it’s not like they can’t buy or cook food for themselves.

"AITA for refusing my friend to join our Japan vacation Some context: Our friend group has been planning to go to Japan for quite a few years now and we feel 2024 is the right time as we are all mostly in a good spot financially (age group 25-29). One of our friends, we will call him ,B, wants to join our 12 day Japan trip. B has a lot of financial troubles, making a few bad decisions over the last couple years and now being around $7500 in credit card debt.

We are starting to book accommodations such as hotels and Airbnbs which require a bit of payment up front. Unfortunately, due to his financial position, he can’t pay his portion for the accommodations and “hopes” to get the money together by November. When I approached him on how we will get the money, he told me will probably just take out a personal loan and use that to cover his trips finances, all while being in the red for credit card debt.

B doesn’t have a very stable income , making about minimum wage so I cannot foresee the debt being paid in the next few months. I don’t want to see one of my good friends ruin his future, just to go one a vacation to Japan.

"AITAH by reminding my mother that I look unhappy so often is because of her?  From when I moved out of home and into my own place. I still regularly visit my mother and my step father approximately once a week, sometimes once every 1.5 weeks. (Me currently M30) 

This is mostly to maintain some form of low contact, a short visit usually only 10-20 minutes in duration. Primarily I do this to help and make sure things are ok around the house and deal with any documents on their behalf as their English comprehension is not great (and they are what I'd consider elderly now).

My relationship with my mother and step father is a complex to say the least, but she recently made a comment (one she makes fairly often with the same results)

She will ask why I look so miserable or never display happiness around her. She will repeatedly continue to ask (ignoring my polite and clear requests to change topic) untill I give up and eventually reply that is what I look like around her, and if she'd wanted me to have a happier outlook and more positive memories of her then perhaps she should not have left me twice as a child

 The first time when my biological father died (me aged 7) and she demanded that I should have been taken instead of him and then left for two weeks on a mental health break.

And the second instance was 2 years after marrying my step father, they had several huge fights and she demanded I immediately leave home with her as she was leaving, and when I stopped to ask why, where how, she got in the car and left for about a month with no contact. (age 14). 

This naturally sends her into a crying and miserable fit for the afternoon. My step dad says nothing about this. Mostly because he himself is NC/LC with his own 3 bio kids and because of our own truce and settling of our history independently of this. 

I'm mostly asking as it's been weighing on my conscience lately. I don't want to hurt my mother as I see the pain this continues to cause her. But equally so, I refuse to simply accommodate her poor behaviour and lack of meaningful change. 


My family are not well equipped to handle emotional issues and language is not their strong suit, I believe with a high degree of certainty that she lacks the language and emotional tools to properly reconcile her actions and the effect it's had on me, but I feel like if she didn't want to suffer, maybe stop throwing yourself on rocks.

"AITA for making a joke about my GF because she talks about my friend?  We’re all early 20s. I’m just curious, but I regularly play online with my friend, and my girlfriend for the last 3 months has been playing as well. 
She never seen me play outside of her, so she asked could she watch me play with my other friend(s). It happened to be him. He’s not as good as me, but I don’t mind because compared to my other friends he’s the best team player. She watches us in a way where only she can view but he can’t hear either of us. It started off as “Why do you play with him I’m better than him”, and I’m not in the department of talking about people, so I’d say hey don’t talk about my friend. 
The next time she was going harder “He’s so stupid, why do you play with an idiot” and even worse things like dumb ass etc. I defended him even harder here. I just said what I thought was a joke, and called her butt stale. She obviously took offense to that because she got mad and started calling me gay for defending him.

"AITA for calling my sister's friend a coward when she refuses to address the insults she has been publicly saying about me? I'm 25 and my sister (S) is 24, as is her friend (A). A lives halfway across the country and we don't see her very often. I know of this friend but we aren't very close. S and A grew up together as children when my family and I still lived in the same state and maintain a friendship online through discord and games.  
Last year I was going into some relationship troubles and spoke to my sister and vented to her my frustrations. A wanted to know what was happening because she sensed that the conversation became stilted when she entered the voice chat. At the time I felt I could trust her so I opened up to her about my issues as well (relevant for later)  
I have since resolved these issues and didn't have much of a presence on my sister's discord until I noticed that A posted a meme captioning ""S's insane sister"" in the general chat. I saw that my sister didn't reply, but her boyfriend reacted with a laughing emoji. I felt disrespected as this was a general chat and not a private chat, but this is well within A's personality as she and S have the sort of relationship where they call each other scrubs, bitches and make fun of each other in general. I didn't want to start anything up so I let this incident go, until a month later where A posts yet another meme captioning ""Just like (my name) right"" and follows up with A telling S to just go find a new family.  
I sent A a DM and told her I didn't appreciate what she said. We haven't spoken for months as I have stepped away from the discord and I told her that if she can't muster up the courage to DM directly about her issues then she shouldn't be posting things and talking about me in public chat rooms where I could also see what she was saying. I didn't care if it was a joke, or if the intentions were not malicious.  
A told me that she didn't mean anything with malice. I told A that malicious intent or not she was making fun of me in the general chat and to please have some respect. A says she will not talk about me anymore, but months down the line she starts posting memes about me again on the same general chat. This time without dropping names, but hinting at ""an entitled 25 year old loser we know"".  
I flat out call her out this time, telling her since she cannot stop talking about me I can meet her in person to chat about her issues with me. She has immediately responded with airing out intimate details of my relationship issues in the general chat, saying I'm going to be cheated on again, I have low IQ and thanking me for being entertainment for her, S and S's bf. A has also said it's been a great laugh to see how salty and butthurt I got over silly jokes and I'm a deadbeat.  
I reiterated that all I want is to meet A in person (I'll be going to her state next month for an unrelated trip) to talk about these insults and that she lacks courage if she cannot. My sister says this all blew up because I called A a coward and what A said were just jokes. AITA.",0.1
"WIBTA for not working? TLDR I (20F) work for a family member (Ryan) who gave me a job in January. I told Ryan when I started that for my 21st birthday I wouldn’t be able to work for 3 days because I have a friend coming into town that I haven’t seen in almost a year. Ryan said it was fine - he’s known about the trip since November because our family is close and I can never keep things to myself. Plans for my birthday have changed multiple times except for my friend’s flight, so I still need the three exact same days off. 

Last week, Ryan and I were talking and he asked about what I was going to do when my friend was here - if I was gonna take my laptop home to work or if I would come out to the office while she was at my house. I looked at him in confusion and he asked again, so I shrugged and said I didn’t know. He let me know that he was doing me a big favor with letting me have one day off because we were coming home from somewhere, and I didn’t respond. 

I talked to my dad and he asked if I wouldn’t have taken the job if I had known I would have to work those days, and I said yes. It’s a big birthday for me because it’s the first one I’ve shared with my friend and I feel like asking for three days off before I even started working for him is not a big deal. This trip cost money and I’d hate to waste half of it from me working. 

My dad rolled his eyes at me and told me that this is the real world and that I can’t just decide not to work.

My job requires my attention at all times, and most days, I end up working long hours and through lunch.  Admittedly, this is my choice, it’s stressful but pays well and we are living on my income at this time. Also I get personal satisfaction for helping people’s lives with my profession (ITA for choosing a stressful job for income).  My partner, is at a development stage in their career and has free time throughout the day as an unpaid apprentice.  

Regarding phones, I am horrible. I occasionally check my phone unless for emergency, as I spend lots of time at work on computers, phone, and people.  My loved ones have my office number for emergencies.  At work, I rarely check my phone, then on my way home I like to listen to music and unplug to decompress.  My partner on the other hand, uses their phone often, social media, texting, phone calls, etc.  We have had disagreements before regarding work hours, and phone usage.  My partner is no slouch, does a bit more than me around the house, helps prep breakfast for me because they know I’m busy.  ITA for time management, forgetfulness, as I usually rush out the door to work, and forget some things.  


Now onto the header: recently, my partner got notice of a BIG advancement in their career and recognition.  They texted me this during my work hours, and I never read it.  When I got home a little late from work, they appeared upset, I asked what was wrong, they expressed they were annoyed I left some hair trimmings in sink and my breakfast.  I apologized and expressed I cleaned up most of trimmings and admitted I rushed out without thinking of breakfast, was going to clean when I got back; we argued a little back and forth then things went quiet, and went our separate ways.  They did not mention the text or the accomplishment.  


Later in the day, I asked what was going on and they let me know about their accomplishment, I was ecstatic!  They were still upset I didn’t check my phone, even on my way home from work, and I did not come home with excitement for it, which was exacerbated about the items in the morning.  They said I should be checking my phone more often.  We went back and forth on work, stress, phone communication and now this argument has turned into multiple days of tension and small arguments.

I could feel my heartbeat raising faster. He got in and I yelled at him to get out, but he said that he needed to get on the lift. He told me that everyone was entitled to the lift, also animals, and if I was scared it wasn't his problem. He told me to get out if I was that scared, and I did, running to another neighbors house (as by this time I was lightheaded and shaking). She helped me out and I calmed down, then got a day off work.

   Later in the afternoon, I went to his apartment and knocked on the door. He opened it and asked me what. I berated (slightly raising my voice) him, telling him fears are real things and I could literally die if that fear had turned into a panic attack. he brushed it off and said I was fine, telling me I was overreacting and asked why I was yelling at him.

He could've just took the next elevator, I said. He still called me dramatic and trying to hog the lift for myself, and discriminating against animals. AITA?",0.92
"AITA for asking my boyfriend to cut all contact with one of his childhood friends? So i (15f) and my boyfriend (15m) have been together for almost 9 months. We’ve never had any issues except from fights like everybody else. But the last couple of months he has shown me a lot of disrespect and It’s really starting to get to me. We both go to the same school with a lot of his childhood friends, and I’ve never had any problems with him speaking with them until recently. There’s this girl that we’re gonna call Amy. Amy has always been really close with guys and she loves male attention. She has a boyfriend that she has cheated on several times and she says that she texts a lot of guys. Which isn’t any of my business. Until she started asking a lot of questions about my boyfriend, telling me he is the prettiest in our grade, asking questions about his house and she started snapping him a lot. She sends snaps of her in the shower and mirror pics in different outfits with and without a lot of clothes. And I asked my boyfriend if he could stop answering her because it made me uncomfortable, and he decided to remove her, and then tell her I told him to remove her ( I didn’t) he then added her again and started snapping her and sending me snaps of her in school when I went home. I got mad and asked if he could have just a little respect and he threw a tantrum about it, so AITA? ",0.55
"AITA for not caring that I 'offended' my pregnant friend? So I was unaware of this until today but apparently I've been 'offending' my pregnant friend with IG Reels for months. My friend, Amy, got pregnant 8 1/2 months ago. Her and her partner do not have many friends or a great support system due to them not having a relationship with his parents.

I've been trying to be a supportive friend the entire time. I've taken Amy to her appointments when her partner can't, I've taken her clothes shopping for the baby and whenever a pregnancy/young mom baby Reel comes across my page I've sent it to her for ideas. Apparently, this is where she takes issue.

I want to preface this by saying that these tiktoks were never supposed to be anything but fun little things for her to watch. They were just things like newborn wake windows, cute milestones posts and discount baby thrift shops in our area. This is her first baby and the first friend of mine to have a baby so I thought she would appreciate the support since a lot of people I know have turned their back on their friends after they get pregnant especially when theyre young.

I messaged her on instagram today to ask if she had seen the most recent Reel I sent her with this baby thrift shop thats about a 1 1/2 hour drive from us because I wanted to offer to drive her there while our partners were away at work (quite literally almost to the state border) and I received a very rude message instead. In short, I'm 'telling her how to be a parent when it's none of my business', I 'seem to think she's in over her head' and 'she has far more experience with kids than I do and I should butt out'.

I haven't apologised yet because I don't know what to say but AITA if I simply don't care about her feelings on this? It seems like a stupid thing to get offended over when I have literally been half of her support system through these last 8 months? I have done nothing but support her, I literally got her a job interview at my job, to make money before maternity leave. For her to turn around and essentially spit on everything I've done or helped her do - I do not care if a few videos on motherhood offended her so badly she felt the need to get agro at me about it. AITA?

"AITA that my gf doesn’t want to make me a follower in her ig? So a few weeks ago, we had an argument and she ended up blocking me because I kept trying to call her. My mistake. But after that, she ended up just following me and keeping me out of her instagram (it’s private). Gf reasoned out that it doesn’t really matter, there’s nothing to see, she wants to keep me lowkey, and she follows me anyway. I just thought of it as disrespectful, a nuisance question that’ll just keep coming anyway, that she can still keep me lowkey either way even as a follower, that what kind of couple doesn’t keep each other on their socials, and that it doesn’t take much for her to accept the request anyway. More than that, every time that I do bring it up, she just ends up ignoring me. Exhibit A: I ask her why can’t she keep me as a follower. She tells me let’s talk about it later. I wait a little. She then tells me she’s sleepy. When else do I ask? I think it’s a simple question anyway. All in all, I find this so petty. Mind you, we’re well in our 20s. I’m in law school, and she’s a dentistry student just one sem off from her clinics. I feel like a second class citizen to my own gf. I just don’t get why it has to be so complicated, and why it seems like I’m the asshole I’m upset. So yeah, AITA?",0.31
"AITA for not inviting my high school best friend to my wedding celebration  My best friend from high school, let’s call her Sara, (we are both women in our early 30s) and I had been spending more time together recently because she was going through a traumatic experience and I wanted to be there for her. But we are by no means as close as we were in HS and I felt like she was having trouble accepting that. She knew I was getting married but we hadn’t planned anything. Edit: she asked me what I was doing and I told her I didn’t know. But I asked her for if she had any suggestions. she said “I don’t know but tell me when it is!”. I responded OK because I didn’t have any idea what we were doing and to her that was an official “invite” to my wedding. 

I got married at city hall and had a dinner afterwards. The dinner was scheduled super last minute, like the night before. My husband asked me to only bring one person because he wanted to be comfortable and all his friends are not in the country. The only people in attendance were my mom, my best friend J (who I’ve known for about a decade) and another really close friend N (6 years), who my husband is really comfortable around and they’re really good friends too. 

My mom posted a photo of us on Facebook and Sara saw it and was super pissed. She sent me a long text about how awful I am and how I traumatized her and how could I invite this other friend (that I’ve known for less time) and not her. She was totally skeptical of me telling her my husband was actually the one that invited her. Sara said I should have called her to let her know she was no longer invited to my wedding which is insane to me because I didn’t have any plans when I “invited her”. Also i have many other good friends who I didn’t invite and they were totally fine with that. 

For me marrying wasn’t a huge deal, but for her all she wants is to be married and I would be her maid of honor etc. Sara doesn’t want to be my friend anymore because of this. She was the only one of my friends who didn’t offer to help.. J was videographer and N helped me buy my wedding dress. Sara just wanted to make sure she was attending and didn’t want to be involved in any other way besides that. Now my day is clouded over the fact that I lost a friendship. I guess this was always meant to happen but am I in the wrong here for not inviting/communicating that Sara wasn’t invited?

UPDATE: Thanks for the thoughtful responses! There are definitely some insightful comments here and I appreciate the feedback. Here are the main takeaways that I got from here which I will apply for the future:

- I should have communicated she wasn’t invited the night before when a dinner was scheduled. The fact that I forgot about her entirely was disrespectful to her. Not having her there though was not the problem here.
- I shouldn’t have been so inclusive in asking suggestions when she asked me about my wedding since I didn’t know what we were doing. Avoiding talking about it would have been better. This is an honest mistake as I thought maybe we would have a bigger celebration and she’d be invited. I didn’t see my “OK” as an invitation so much as an acquiescence forced upon me but if I had said “I don’t know who is going to be invited” that might have been rude to say but at least more honest. If I didn’t say “ok” I could’ve avoided the mess and not hurt her feelings later. 
- Either way her not being there would have hurt her feelings even if I communicated that sooner. I think she would cut the friendship over not being invited. 
- Either way the friendship had been in the background of my life for many years before this so it’s for the best that we finally let it go. We would catch up maybe once a year at most. People grow apart. I’m just sad it had to end in such an explosive way. 

I have tried apologizing which she hasn’t accepted. Without the intention of rekindling a close friendship I don’t want to push her too hard to make up. There were many things that felt off with us before this happened. But going forward I can avoid setting expectations by being clear and upfront in my communication. Hopefully I never get married again and this is the one time this happens because I honestly hate all the importance our culture places on marriage! For me it was definitely not a “major milestone” in my life. I love my husband but for us the day was more of a formality for us to stay together than anything else. ",0.8
"AITA for blowing up at my husband because he counted his work on our DND game as one of his chores? I (35F) and my husband (35M) have been together for ten years, blissfully happy, no notes.

Over COVID we got into Dungeons and Dragons. We have a weekly game that runs from 3 to 4 hours with three other friends. Five of us have been going on adventures for the past few years, meeting consistently over Zoom. I've been having a great time overall.

My husband is the DM, which means he does a lot of work preparing the sessions. This includes coming up with the characters we are going to have conversations with, figuring out the battles we are going to fight and so on. I really appreciate his work.

On the other hand, I've been feeling like I'm doing more chores in our partnership. I cook a lot, clean the kitchen, help with the loundry, do most of the driving. We tried splitting chores before, there was a period where he would fold laundry or do cleaning while I cooked, but it didn't last beyond a week or two.

I normally don't particularly mind but life has been especially shit lately due to health issues in the family and I think it put extra stress on us.

So, the other day I cooked dinner. During dinner he was giving me a sneak peek of the magical items he made for the blacksmith in the new town and I guess I didn't look as excited so he asked me why. I said: ""I'll be excited when you clean up the kitchen after we are done eating.""

This started a major argument (and we really don't have many of those, so it was a bit intense) about how I don't appreciate his work on this campaign. I countered by saying he's free to work on his hobbies as much as he wants but it's not the same thing as helping me out with chores. To this, he countered, that his work on this DND campaign counts as a chore, just like cooking and cleaning. He said he provides a space for hanging out with our friends every week. In a way, he's organizing and scheduling our social life and that it takes a lot of work.

I thought this was an absolutely bonkers perspective. This is where things escalated because I was sort of befuddled (I still am) and he got really hurt. He did say: ""The fact that you're asking this shows you don't understand how much work I put into this campaign."" For the record, I did run a leg of the campaign as the DM for a few weeks and it was a lot of work. 

But it was a hobby, at least to me. It was a fun thing I elected to do, not something I needed to do, like a chore. He pointed out that I don't need to cook either, we can afford to eat out every night and hire a cleaning service for sorting out the apartment. He's not wrong, we can afford it but it still felt weird.

I eventually let it go, but I feel like I am going to need some sort of a resolution to this because I can feel the resentment bubbling in my chest. I don't want to win an argument, I am not looking for vindication, but can someone give me an insight into this conflict? Am I wrong? Am I being the asshole here?

Thank you.",0.25

"AITA for no longer helping my sister out? -Throwaway acc - please don’t post this anywhere 

My older sister , Amy (36 f) runs her own little bakery from her home. It’s honestly pretty successful and she’s been able to make a decent living off of it. She’s been getting a lot more orders and has been needing an extra pair of hands. 
She asked me about 2 months ago to help her. 

I ( 23f) agreed and told her not to worry about payment since it wasn’t too much to handle. So it was agreed I was coming in to help whenever I’m free ( So about 4 days out of the week) . I’m in charge of calls , payment , scheduling and anything that has to do with the more financial side of the business. 
I recently had asked for about 2 weeks off because I needed to focus on my actual job as I needed to get some work done before deadlines. 

She didn’t really like that but still okay’d it, but I made sure I made it known to whoever called and as well as made announcements on her website and pages that the business is taking 2 weeks to catch up with orders. She was made aware of this and gave me the green light. 

I come back on Monday, and as I was checking up emails for her , I saw many ( about 10) angry emails complaining about ME. I was checking the dates and it was the 2 weeks I was gone. She was messaging people pretending to be me and was seriously being rude to them.  She was straight up going “Hey this is Emma , with Amy’s Bakery”. So she was intentionally telling people it was ME.

We don’t live in a huge city and with the type of Job I work it’s not hard to find me either. I am still beyond pissed.
I confronted her and she said it’s no big deal and that it’s not like people know who we are.
I literally yelled at her and called her a lot of mean names. It doesn’t take a genius to literally just look at her Facebook friends and see my info. 

I refused to help her and stopped coming over. She’s been begging me to come back and apologizing for the things she’s done.
My parents are trying not to take sides but are pushing me to talk to her. I refuse.
My other siblings are calling me a dick for leaving her when I know she needs help. 
I’m just so angry at her for just starting shit for no reason.

"AITA for not wanting to watch my brother's kids? Alright so I, F20, have had an agreement with my brother, M29 for a bit where I watch his son, let's call him Damien (M9) , for him when he needs to go out of town or wants to go do something with his buddies or anything. Normally I don't mind as he's family and I care about him as well as if Damien acts out I am able to punish him normally as it was discussed between him, his wife and me.

Well lately I've been watching him a bit more than usual as his wife just got a new more demanding job and with that I've also been having to punish Damien more as he's with me for more time. I do have to say that when I say punishment I mean like standing in the corner or going to his room without toys I don't mean physical punishment. Along with this I got a call from my brother saying that while at school Damien said some inappropriate things about the girls in his class and that if he does anything when he comes over then to just let him know because his wife and him have a system for their punishments for this type of behavior now. I told him that if that was the case and since I've been having to punish Damien more that the agreement just wasn't going to work out and that I'd watch Damien for this night as it was their date night and I had already made an agreement to watch him but they'd have to find someone new for a few days from then and from here on out. This led to an argument between us  and him calling me an asshole because even though I wasn't screwing them over completely finding someone to watch Damien in a few days would be difficult.

"AITA For telling the disabled student not to trauma dump on people? I, (M15) am currently attending highschool. There’s this girl in our grade who always posts sad things. ‘My life is horrible.’, ‘Nobody likes me’. A lot of people talk badly about her behind her back. I’ve never been one of them, and always felt bad for her.

One day she posts her new hair style, asking for peoples opinion. Being nice, I say it looks good, and we start talking. She suddenly starts talking about how bad her life is, and how it was her fifth time in the hospital. I didn’t know how to respond so I kept saying things along the lines of ‘oh I’m sorry’ ‘that sucks’ ‘it’ll get better soon.’

She even said she had no friends, in which I suggested making ones with similar interests, and even named another person who I thought liked similar things as her. she kept going, saying how they used to be friends; and how she’s not even interested in the thing anymore.

Eventually I suggested that the reason people didn’t want to be friends with her is because she kept starting conversations by trauma dumping on people. She then blocked me. AITA?",0.4
"AITA for wanting another man while in a relationship? This is more for advice than anything. Back when I was in high school, I developed a crush on this boy a grade above me, Jacob. He was known for hopping between relationships throughout the female population of the school. He wasn’t a toxic person on the outside and he was actually a really nice person to be around. He and I hung out and flirted over a period of a few months, after I had gotten out of a pretty toxic relationship and he was essentially my rock, helping me work through my emotions and provide a “distraction” from what happened. After a few months of this we eventually started dating, close to the end of the first term. Those first 2 weeks were amazing and I don’t know how to describe it. He was a handsy person, always finding an excuse to touch me, whether that was wholesome or not. We never got together in that way, but his touches were suggestive. I was a virgin at the time and he was obviously very experienced in that area. I developed an obsession over those touches, the seductive way he handled me and I got drunk off that high. Long story short we broke up and parted with no long lasting hatred. I’ve had relationships since him, but I cant get Jacob out of my mind. My other relationships weren’t what I wanted. They were respectful and never tried to initiate anything like he did. The list and longing wasn’t there, the secretive glances and need was not present. I actually broke up with a boy over this, explaining this to him and he just didn’t understand and labelled me a hateful and dirty person, with high expectations. I sometimes wanted him even when in other relationships, thinking of him when around my other boyfriends. I would never cheat but does that count as cheating, lusting after another man?

"AITA if I end an internship early if they aren't going to be hiring me? I'm currently at the end of a near year long internship. In the final month, all of the interns from each department are being asked to present to the company on our work. The thing is, as all seniors in college, they initially made it sound like we'd be hired at the end of the internship. All of us have worked our butts off but we've recently been told we shouldn't expect to be hired.
Working and going to college was worth the stress in my eyes if there was a job lined up. But now I feel there is no reason to stick around for the presentation as it's just added stress on top of working and finishing school. Would it be wrong if I left early? Is it likely to impact me applying elsewhere in the area?

"AITA for telling my mum to not charge me for the good things she does? I(24F) am a Mexican student still living with my mother(54F) while I finish school, in about a year, and she has been taking on every economic aspect since she insisted she wanted me to focus on my studies instead of getting a job. 
Yesterday, she was going to pay a repairman for fixing our washing machine, but unfortunately got distracted and accidentally sent a thousand five hundred pesos to the wrong account. So she had to send the correct amount to the repairman and the first 1500 pesos were lost. She started berating herself and was furious the rest of the day, so I tried comforting her but was turned down at every turn. Which was understandable, she was mad and needed space, so I tried giving it to her.
Fast forward to when we arrive home, she sits in the dining room, turns the TV on for us to watch something and scrolls in her phone for a bit. 
I tell her I had leftover tacos in the fridge and that I was very tired, so I was just gonna heat them up and that was that. She asked if I didn't want to make her some tostadas with cheese and I told her we could prepare our dinner together. She made a face and continued scrolling on her phone. 
I assumed that meant she didn't want to cook with me, so I heated up my tacos and sat down. She looked at my plate and then started getting super mad at me for not making her dinner. 
She said she had made coffee for me the day before and that it was ugly of me not to make her dinner. 
I didn't like the comment, so I asked that if she did nice things for me and she meant to charge them later, she shouldn't be doing nice things for me anymore. I thought I was setting a boundary, I was tired and maybe we were both cranky...
She got so mad, she ate in her room and locked herself up. 
Today, we were supposed to go swimming together. But we fought, again. 
She said that, since she wasn't meant to do AAAANY nice things for me, she was done doing ANYTHING for me. And that included payments, driving me places, or speaking to me in a good way.
I told her I felt really bad with what she was doing and that I felt as if it was an emotional blackmail, but she replied that it was not her responsibility to do anything good for me and that I'm an adult that should take responsibility for my own words.

"AITA for Venting to My Wife about a Friend My friend (female) and I have been friends for almost 20 years. Although we have occasionally stopped talking, we always end up reconnecting like nothing ever happened. Since my wife and I moved in together, she has also become friends with this person. 

For context, one of my biggest flaws as a person is that I can be mean when I get frustrated or overstimulated. I am currently in therapy and actively working on it, but unfortunately, it's still something I struggle with. One of the suggestions my therapist gave me is to journal out my thoughts when I get into a negative headspace. I usually do this on my phone, but instead of writing in a personal note, I send these thoughts as messages to my wife. We have discussed this and she is completely fine with it. This way, I can vent my feelings in the moment and express myself as honestly as I need to. Even if my wife doesn't respond, it still helps me feel heard and understood while also allowing me to look back and see how blinded by rage I was in the moment.   
One weekend, I went on a work trip while my friend and wife spent time together painting. They sent me photos and jokes, and everything seemed fine. However, things took a turn when my friend messaged me saying she had messed up and that I would probably hate her. It turned out that when my friend had borrowed my wife's phone, she went into our messages and searched for a particular date when she thought I was angry with her. To her surprise, she found messages where I had vented to my wife about being mad at her. I admit that the messages I sent that night were very mean, but I never intended for them to go anywhere. Maybe I should have instead written them in a physical journal?   
Anyway, when I got home I explained to my friend that I needed a day or two to process before we sat down and had a conversation about this issue. When I reached out to her she informed me that she would need to time because I broke our trust and she doesn't think she can ever get over it. She is making it out like I am the bad guy in this whole situation and that she did nothing wrong. That was over a month ago and we haven't talked. I am starting to wonder if maybe I am the asshole in this situation. ",0.29
"AITA for refusing to drop off my sister a pair of pants For context: My sister texted me saying that ""GET ME PANTS FROM HOME, I STAINED THEM REALLY BAD, AND DROP THEM OFF, PLEASE BRO"". Seperate text messages, seperated by the commas.

It's only a 5 minute drive to her school, and every time its inconvient for her and I'm at home I'm forced to pick her up and drop her off to school. For context, there could be a drop of rain(literally) and she will harrass me into picking her up. She's also always picked up by her friends mom so I don't think she's walked to school unless its perfectly sunshine and rainbows. When I went to that school I always walked, because there was no one who could pick me up(thunderstorm, snow, etc) and its not event that far from home.

Regardless of that experience, she seems to expect for me to spend 10 mintues to drop her pants and go back home and I think its a huge. So I responded very maturely with: ""im not your dog brother"", now she's been harrasing me through text and calling me stupid for not dropping off her pants. Her justification is that her friends said that their parents or siblings would, and that I should since I'm not doing anything anyways.

Edit: the stain is mud.

"AITA for asking my fiancé to limit her sleepovers?   
I (23M) have been with my fiancé,  (23F) for 3 years, engaged for about a month, we live together.  She has a bestfriend (25F) who she has been friends with for years. 


 
My fiancé and I both work full time, 7am- 6pm including the commute, and she sometimes has to work Saturdays (around twice a month) it feels like we have limited time together even though we live together because of our busy schedule. 
 


The issue at the moment is that my fiancé is spending the night at her fiends house about twice a week. I don't have any issue with her spending time with her friend, I'm glad she has a support system outside of me, but I just ask that she comes home after. 


 
There's also a big issue with her telling me she's coming home, and then telling me last minute that she staying. resulting in me making us dinner or other plans and then having to cancel or eat alone. It hurts my feelings and makes be feel like second fiddle. I have thoroughly communicated my feelings time and time again, even bringing it up in therapy and it doesn't seem to change. 
 


I have asked her to limit sleep overs to once a month. Not seeing her friend, she's free to do that whenever and obviously does not need my permission to do so, just sleep overs. She thinks this is unreasonable and limiting, saying that I'm a controlling asshole. I don't think I am. I just want to spend quality time with her and I don't feel like that is an unreasonable request, but maybe I'm wrong. AITA?",0.29
"AITA for telling my friend that she's clingy and to stop copying me I (22F) have known her (23F) since high school, I'll refer to her as Friend. We became acquainted because she used to ask my sister and I for help with her art projects and we would help her out but didn't talk about anything else. Friend graduated in 2019, and I lost contact with her for a few years until she invites me to a birthday and suddenly is treating me like I am her ""best friend"".  
There's been several annoyances I've had since then:  
**I realise Friend is constantly copying the things that I like.** If I'm watching a ballet production and post to my stories, suddenly she is also posting nonstop about ballet, but suspiciously can't say anything about it. If I like Taylor Swift, suddenly she's also a Taylor Swift megafan and posts nonstop to stories about her while also not having anything to really say.  
**When we hang out, she never lets me leave.** She goes ""but I thought we could go to my house and we could do this"" or ""but I want to go shopping"", even if you explain you are tired or you have a curfew. She will look confused even if you explain, and will more or less beg you to stay longer. She is also the type who requires extensive babysitting and it is exhausting for me.  
**She doesn't understand me.** I'm tired of needing to explain my jokes and her still not getting it. It's really simple jokes too, and she just doesn't understand anything I'm saying. I feel like the kind of jokes she makes are something I'd laugh at if I was 12 years old. She also thinks it's scandalous whenever we mention drinking, kissing, holding hands. I think the idea of any of her friends having sex would blow her mind. 

  
**Friend invites herself to events.** When I went to see the Nutcracker with some close friends, she found out I was going and asked if I wanted to see the Nutcracker with her. I told her I had agreed to go with someone else, and told her I wasn't comfortable with her joining. She kept asking ""unless? Haha, jk... unless"", and it was extremely off-putting. She also invited herself to dinner with my mother.  
There's honestly a lot of other things but the list would just get too long. I talked about it with someone who used to be close with her in high school, and she told me that the reason they were no longer friends was because Friend had done all the same things to her. Since the person I spoke with is Autistic she had to go to learning support, and Friend had told her not to go, because she didn't want to be associated with disabled people. I find this deeply ironic considering Friend is widely considered to have a mental disability. She is rude to mental health professionals as well, calling them ""creepy"".  
The person encouraged me to cut her off, and I eventually aired out all these grievances, telling her I didn't want to hurt her feelings but that she deserved to know her behaviour was making me uncomfortable, that I needed space, and that we were acquaintances, NOT best friends. She hasn't replied, and I kind of feel bad. AITA?

One of my students (11M), (who we’ll call Warren, not using real names) is VERY advanced. He’s in the 99th percentile for IQ and is way above grade level in all academic areas. He’s autistic, but quite social, and is close friends with a group of boys he plays basketball with. His friends are all in grade level or slightly above, no where near him. Warren is a sweet kid, but if he’s not being academically stimulated, he’ll be acting like a class clown and distracting the class.  
  
There’s this concept in education called differentiated instruction, which is basically about meeting kids at various levels in the same classroom. When learning about a topic, I give Warren late high school or early college level reading materials, as that is what challenges him.  
  
Warren has a cousin (11F) in our class who we’ll call Mia. Mia is slightly below grade level, she doesn’t show any signs of autism and has different interests than Warren. They don’t talk much together in class, but they don’t argue. The only argument they got into was when Mia made a racially insensitive comment to a classmate (who’s the only POC in my room), Warren tried explaining why her comment was wrong to her but she didn’t understand before I had to talk to her.  
  
Last Tuesday, I asked the class what they did over the break. Mia mentioned how their family celebrated Easter, she said Warren was acting “strange”, the first thing she brought up was him being atheist (his parents are religious) and how she didn’t get it, then she said he had “weird worksheets”. Apparently, he brought some of his homework to Easter and Mia saw it. She asked why his worksheets have “so many big words” compared to the ones her and her friends got. I tried explaining why, but I didn’t want any of the kids to feel dumb so I didn’t really give a great answer, just “it’s what he likes”. Mia kept asking if she could try his worksheets, because “she can know big words to”. I was unsure what to do as a first year, so I asked some colleagues and they said to just give her one of his worksheets. We were doing an English assignment on a book we read in class.  
  
She came crying to me when she couldn’t do it, and got virtually every answer wrong. I told her I wouldn’t count it and she could have her old worksheet.  
  
The next day, I got a call from Mia’s parents, they were screaming and asked why I made her cry, after I explained what happened, they told me they wanted me to name the teachers that told me to give her a copy of Warren’s worksheet because they wanted to “make sure they learn a lesson”, I told them their names in a panic and hung up and then went to admin to explain the situation, who were sympathetic.  
  
Since then, both Mia and Warren’s parents have been posting on Facebook about my colleagues, calling them “bullies”, AITA?",0.82
"AITA Should I be Guilty for what I did? 


For the background I am a 24/m student , with student debt and No job. Lost my Mom last year untimely. Because of all these reasons borderline anxious and have panic attacks sometimes. Not writing this for sympathy has relevance in the story. Earlier that day I had a really bad argument with my flatmate that really ended in some racist remarks and ""Shut up or I‘ll ****you in the face“ remarks. It was disturbing for me and I can’t even change my house because I don’t have enough money to move out. I can’t even ask for money from my family because my mom was the only one close  to me and she‘s dead now.

Last Friday went out with my Female best friend and another friend of mine. We had a great evening had fun. The other friend left and it was late so I went to my female best friends home to drop her off. As usual I went inside because she wanted to show me new shoes she ordered. 

Then we spoke for a while and as I was about to leave , she told me ""You can stay here I have a small bed but we will adjust“ and since I was anxious about the things that happened earlier that evening I said OK I can stay because I didn’t want to alone at that time and I was sleepy , generally when I am anxious I cant sleep and I have panic attack. 

So I went to Bathroom to wash my face and clean my feet. I came back and she was like ""You know what, you can sleep here and I will go to my Friend who lives in a flat next door  and sleep with her“ and I said NOOOO , then I will leave for my home. The reason for that is-

1. I don’t find it good to make someone go out of their house just so that I can sleep in their room.

2. I didn’t want to be alone. and if I have to be alone its better to be in my room than an unfamiliar place where I don’t have my laptop or anything that I can use to calm myself down if I felt anxious.

So we argued for a while and she was not letting me go home also. I told her I don’t want to be alone and if you go then whats point of me staying here. Then I even said ""Ok if you didn’t want to share bed and also didn’t want me to go home. I can sleep on the chair with my head on the desk I have no problem in that. She didn’t even agree to this. 

Then after few minutes of argument she agreed and we slept on her bed. And I maintained a distance and Barely touched her even during my sleep. Got up , in the morning she was acting all normal. Even made me coffee and then I left. 

Since then she is not replying properly. Not ready to speak to me. I texted her what happened and she said What I did that night made her really uncomfortable and she is disappointed. 

After this Right now I am feeling awful even though I didn’t and will never want anything physical from her , she is just a good friend of mine. Also I recently started talking to a girl who I am really into (and even my friend knows about this) and now I don’t even feel like talking to her because of this feeling.

AM I WRONG HERE ?

"AITA for /forcing/ someone to get therapy 
My girlfriend has anger management issues and abandonment issues. This in turn gave me my own set of traumas while being in a relationship with her. I called for a breakup and told her I want to heal first. And basically forced her into doing the same (because she didn’t want to breakup yet) and told her I will only call off the breakup if she gets therapy even though I know she’s not comfortable being vulnerable in front of anyone and talking about her life. I’m basically the only person she’s comfortable with to tell her story. I feel like I’m forcing her and pressuring her into doing it so AITA",0.02
"WIBTA if I rejected a phone that was to be given to me by my sister because she's giving me an Iphone XS? Now I know that the title makes me look bratty and ungrateful but bare with me here. 

I(15F) own a small, broken hand-me-downed T-MOBILE phone and my sister(19F), who well call Bell, owns an Iphone XS.

Since Bell and my eldest sister(20F), who we'll call May, left our small country in the Caribbeans to go study in the US, they have all upgraded to Iphones, with May buying and owning an Iphone 10 when she arrived, changing it to an Iphone 12 and now wanting to buy an Iphone 14.

My third sister(17F), who we'll call Tay, doesn't have a phone because she broke it but May has promised to buy her an Iphone XR soon. As you can see, all of my siblings love Iphones, except for me and my father, and I'm not trying to be 'different' but Iphones are just not my cup of tea and I prefer Samsung, Motorola, and T-Mobile. Iphones are too complex for me and I like simplicity. 

A couple days ago, Tay celebrated her 17th birthday and we got a call from Bell, telling us that her god-mother was willing to buy her an Iphone 13 and since my phone is severely broken, she wanted to send me her Iphone XS. I told her I rather not have an Iphone and went into another room and left Tay to speak to her, after Tay ended the call, she came to me, asking me why I didn't want the Iphone, I just said I preferred other types instead of Iphones. She tried to reason with me that the phone that was going to be given to me was free so I told her ""So is the Iphone XR you're getting"". Tay proceeded to tell me that the Iphone XS was already bought and that I'm acting ""like a brat and being ungrateful"". 

I told them that when my Bell gets the Iphone 13, she can sell the Iphone XS and buy the Samsung or T-Mobile and still have a good amount of money left. Tay and Bell still denied my idea and said, I either accept the Iphone XS or stay with my broken phone. I told them to keep their phone as I rather use a broken phone that I'm comfortable with instead of a overly complex and overrated phone that I don't like. Bell got mad and hasn't spoken to me since then but I don't know what to do. 

I tried comparing my situation with Tay's and May's situation as May wants to buy Tay an Iphone 8 but Tay insists that she wants an Iphone XR but Tay said that her phone isn't even bought yet so I have no place ""comparing our situation"". I also tried to reason that for a change, could I have a new thing instead of a hand-me-down but Tay said to stop acting like a ungrateful and just accept it because many others would love to be given a free Iphone.

"AITA for making my boyfriend loose his college fund I (18 f) and my boyfriend (19 m) have been dating for almost a year and a half now and when we first started dating in February 2023, he told me that he was going to be leaving the state for college later that year. Ending things wasn’t a choice so we happily stayed together even though he had to leave in August. At this point, we had been joking for months about me going out there eventually to live, but underneath the jokes I did truly want to go.

Fast forward to end of September and I’m on the way to the airport with his parents to pick him up for a visit home. Our small talk in the car turns into them asking me what plans I have for my life, and when I expressed that I had a genuine interest in moving in with my boyfriend the following year they instantly shut it down saying that they “don’t approve of us living together before college ended.” They ended up having a conversation with my boyfriend telling him that they were going to completely cut him off financially if we were to disobey them. This would be his insurance, college money, car payments, phone bills; literally everything.

I expressed my frustration to my parents and they were now saying they agreed and that going against what his parents said would be disrespectful, make them resent me forever, and would cause “generations of family issues”. My boyfriend and I have talked for months about it, but he has made it clear that he want me to move there just as much as I want to go, even with all of the problems that could arise.

A month ago my boyfriend was talking to his parents over the phone and when he was telling them about how he was working on his finances, they pieced it together that he was doing this because he decided on letting me come live with him. They told him they loved him, but that we would have to figure it out on our own and if we mess up it’s on us. This was great news, we were prepared for the cut off thing but them not being upset was a huge sigh of relief. I ended up telling my mom and she was in agreement with his parents now. 

As i’m now writing this post, my boyfriend, 3 of our friends, and I all just got approved for the house we applied for!!

The issue now is my dad. He’s currently extremely mad at me because i’ve confessed over the past year about how I will be going to cosmetology school instead of university, which to him is “wasting what your grandmother died for me to have access too.” I’d like to think I should be able to decide my path and just have some love and support. 

I admit, this all might blow up in our face, but something in my gut says that if i give up on this opportunity I’ll regret it for the rest of my life. My boyfriend and I are as sturdy and in love as ever, but in my stomach I feel like this while situation could be avoided if I just went to med school like my dad wanted. My boyfriend would keep his support, my dad would be happy, but I know I would never be content with my life.

"AITA for giving my boyfriend of 14 years who hasent committed an ultimatum  I’m wondering what I should do in this situation I’m in?

I have been dating the same guy since I was 15 years old. To this day, we are both 30 years old living at home with our respective parents. He has been waving an engagement in front of my face for the last five years minimum and it hasn’t happened. Two years ago, he even took me ring shopping Because I told him I wanted to go one night. We went over to the mall and looked at rings, and he made it seem like it was going to happen in the next few months… This was 2 1/2 years ago and still nothing.

We’ve never gone on a vacation just us two, the only vacations we’ve ever been on, have been with his friend group on his terms. We don’t even do things like go out for New Year’s Eve alone, he always makes me go to house parties with him and his friends for events like that.
Mind you- we were supposed to do something just us two this past NYE alone finally, but then as I was gettting ready that afternoon, his friend invited him to a house party at some girls house so he convinced me we should go there instead. I went because I told myself it’s probably our last year not being married so might as well be with his friends (I’ve been thinking this for many years now)

Last year I told him that I need him to show me some sort of commitment so we started looking at houses. He kept making excuses as to why each house was not the one for us. He then said that he is interested in purchasing a pre-construction home and that he is going to be buying it himself with his MOTHER as the co-signer. He said that even though I would not be a registered owner on paper, it would 100% be my house to and we would live in it together once it’s built.
He told me the reason he wants to be buying this house alone is because we should save my first time homebuyer credit for a different house. We will buy in the future. Ok… sounds smart to me!

Well, move-in day is in two weeks and yesterday night. He pulled me aside to tell me that he doesn’t think we should move in. He thinks we should rent it out instead because we would be stupid to pass up on the rental income we could make from this property. I of course was upset, but told him I understood and that next April we need to for sure move-in… he agreed to this. 
But I do have a silly feelin he will probably make something else up then

I’m starting to think he is wasting my time but, the part I can’t make sense of is why has he wasted his own time if he’s not planning on marrying me?

Can someone please explain to me why he would be doing this it makes absolutely no sense to me and I don’t know where to go from here. I don’t know I don’t want to start over 30 years old and I just can’t get past the fact of why he still has not proposed to me yet, or even moved in with me, or rented a place with me or literally anything at all, but he talks about what our kids names will be. It makes absolutely no sense.

"AITA for wanting to wear a suit instead of a dress for my aunt’s wedding? Hello, I (14F) was invited to attend my aunt’s wedding. Since I live in the Czech Republic, it’s really uncommon for a girl to wear anything else than a dress when it comes to formal occasions. For context, I’m a pretty chubby girl and I don’t feel very comfortable in dresses or skirts. So, I asked my mom if I could wear a suit, because I’d feel more confident in it and I could enjoy this special event more. She replied, that I was being difficult and that I should just wear a dress. (She usually doesn’t mind that I like to wear suits instead of dresses, but she thinks that would be too much for a wedding.) Also, I’m scared that my choice of clothes will upset the bride and the groom, and that I’ll be judged by my cousin. My cousin, (let’s call her Sarah), is a year older than me and she really loves to pick on me. Sarah is considered as the prettier one and I really don’t mind that fact, but she sometimes uses that as an excuse to make offensive comments about me. When we were younger, Sarah was my ultimate idol and I wanted to be just like her. But then puberty hit and we grew pretty apart. She started to smoke and drink, and in her eyes I was considered as immature for not doing the same. Anyway, I’m really scared that I’ll be judged and mocked by her, and that’ll ruin the wedding. So…AITA for wanting to attend the wedding while wearing a suit?

"AITAH for thinking my now ex best friend is a coward? I (17m) had a best friend who we will call grace (18f) for privacy, we’ve been best friends for a year now and yesterday i woke up to being blocked on absolutely everything. EVEN SPOTIFY which made me laugh out loud, not because i found it funny, but you ever feel so confused and sad that all you can do is laugh at it?

thats where i was at, previously we had been kinda upset at each other because me and grace were online best friends and how we hang out is thru games, basically we didn’t end up playing etc.  it was a misunderstanding on my end and i apologized. she’s currently in a different state than normal, and she usually would make time to text me and did not. i would be left on delivered for full days, but i see her gaming and talking with her other friends.

being obviously hurt, i texted her saying that i don’t know if she even cares when i tell her that this stuff hurts me because she keeps doing it. 

grace didn’t say anything and then i asked if she was mad. grace again, said nothing about my text of my feelings of being hurt and said that she wasn’t mad and was sorry to leave me like this.

i, the next morning, wake up to being blocked. i tried to get through to her through my friend and she did not care to respond or give me a reason why she did this, but then i received a text from a random number saying “why can’t you get through in your cellphone? did you block me?” i don’t know if it was her or whatever but i assume not. now, you’re probably like “it’s a loss, get over it.” 

but i think she’s such a coward for this. she promised she would never do this to me, as many others had before, and she literally said she was not mad at me. i confided in my mom saying i think she’s a coward for not being able to work through our first real friend “argument” which id barely even call it that and i thought that grace was horrible for breaking a promise. my mom thinks i’m being kind of an asshole about it because people have their reasons.

We have a trip planned for October to celebrate LS's 21st birthday, all the same people are going on this other trip as well.

Since I've already been to this music festival (with this group of people) 3 times, I personally felt more comfortable cancelling that then missing LS's birthday trip.

"AITA because I don’t want small children on property before escrow closes? My husband and I have had the great fortune to finally buy a house of our own. We close escrow later this month. For context we’re in our late thirties, husband has educational debt, and we struggled for a long time- then the pandemic hit and eliminated our safety net. Between saving all I could and my folks giving us a free place to stay, we found something we can afford that’s humble but in our community in a HCOL area. 

Here’s where I might be the asshole. No one is required to give us money of course, but his side of the family gave us nothing. They also demand we travel and spend money to spend time as a family, which is nice but when we’re saving for a house they didn’t really care/guilted us and we had to put flights on a credit card for example to keep the peace. Now they’re coming to town and want to see the house. Exciting but we’re not closed on escrow yet and we don’t have an active home insurance policy either. There’s some parts of the outside area of the house that need fixing and could be dangerous to our small niece. I asked them to have her stay back and we’ll have everyone over once we’re settled. 

They have been trying to barter and bargain their way around this. It’s a boundary and I think it’s a prudent one given the circumstances.

"AITAH for accepting a ""free"" home from my mom in lieu of wife? So...My wife and I have been married for 2 years and together for 5. She moved in with me before the pandemic and she was studying for the bar. I paid all the bills until she passed the bar and got a job.

We then got a loan for our wedding had the wedding and are still paying that off. 40 grand. We started IVF this year more money spent. During this time my father passed. He left me a stock account with a little bit of change and he gave me 15000 for a down-payment on a house when we decided to buy one. We've been check to check for some time and I've just recently had extra cash to save. Even with this we aren't fully prepared to buy our dream home. She doesn't like where we live now and we've actively been looking to no avail. She wants in home washer and dryer and a big kitchen. I wanted a basement and garage. Knowing this I stated that maybe we should stay and continue to save. She persisted that we should move due to us trying to have a baby. I abliged and continued to pursue a home. We finally put a bid on a home and we're out bid. So we were back at square 1. 

So 2 days ago my mother came to me with a proposal. There is a townhome in great condition but they want cash. She went on to say that she would put up the cash and wouldn't be looking for anything but minimal compensation as she would like to see us in a better position and she has the means and want to do so. I pay a fairly low rent but basically free would free up money to be saved for the house. Keep in mind I didn't plot this or anything. It was an out of the blue call from my mom.

I believe that this is a blessing and should be taken. She believes otherwise for reasons unknown. I just find it weird that she wants to pick and choose what charity she takes. She doesn't need for anything and this would make it so neither one of us or our possible children would need for anything.

This is a much better situation financially and mentally. We could tackle our debt more aggressively and build our credit scores to a point we can buy almost any home. I thought that she would be happy that we could move and have everything she's been saying is lacking where we live but that's just not the case.

Idk what to do. I feel like this might break us as we seem to have 2 polar opposite views on this and I just can't see passing this up to stay somewhere that isn't ours.

That did not go down well, she got mad at me and began to yell herself about me being a misogynist. Now I think I shouldn't have said that.

"AITA for insisting my friend removes this from her baby’s crib post-haste? After seeing what I consider to be an extremely hazardous and potentially life threatening setup in my friends 19 month olds crib, I immediately voiced my opinion to my friend about it. 

I do sometimes forget to appreciate the differences in our parenting styles and tend to be quick to micro manage or judge her parenting specifically because I spend a decent amount of time with her as of recently since we met. 

That said, I was positive something like this is common sense…. The setup is a 6 to 8 inch small rope with a drawstring on both ends…. One end is fixed around the bottom bars or platform of the crib. The other end is fixed and pulled onto/around the child’s bottle. There is definitely enough slack for the worst to happen, and if that even were an argument, should the child take the drawstring and loosen it or should the bottle happen to escape the drawstring, that same notion no longer applies (IMO).

Now, in my eyes, the fact that she says she has done this since birth has me thanking god that the child has not been strangled to death by this thing. I understand that not every situation means absolute death, but isn’t it the job of anyone who is a parent to mitigate the risks with that possibility as much as possible? That is, if there is even the smallest possibility of such a horrible thing might happen and we have the ability to remove that risk, to eliminate it?

To me this is a HUGE deal. My friend insists or tried to insist before removing it (but not before being annoyed by my persistence over the matter), that she has done this since he was born basically and that it is a comforting mechanism…. Otherwise he throws it out of the crib.

"AITA for not giving into my exs demands regarding our daughter. My ex and I have a 7 year old daughter. She sees him every other  Saturday from 10am - Sunday at 10am - Exactly 24 hours . This weekend was supposed to be his but I received a text today informing me that he could not take her because he is having surgery on Saturday. 
 
 I told him that was fine and reminded him that she was attending a birthday party next weekend. He told me that he wants to see her and that she should skip the party . I am not willing to have her miss out on a fun thing with a friend and offered for him to come out and see our daughter next weekend and for him to take her to the party, he refused to do that . 
 
 I then offered to drop her off after the party and pick her up Sunday evening, he was not happy with this and again demanded that I have her skip that party . She is extremely upset at the idea of not being able to celebrate her friend . I think my daughter’s social life is important and attempted to come up with solutions that work for everyone, but am I wrong ?",0.33
"AITA for wanting to know when I'll get paid back? My(28F) ex (27M) reached out to me put of the blue (lives in diff state) and the day after we have a decent chat.. he asks for money. Says "" I just need help til my next payday"" didn't think too much of it I offered to help with the expectation I'll be paid back within a week. 

Fast forward.. they asked for help again 2x within the same week, they said they were at risk of being evicted, I felt bad I helped them with what I could setting the expectation with them ""hey I don't mind helping till ur good but I'm not in position to just pass out money"" They say yes and even explain to reassure me how they are expecting pay from work plus their tax refund. I just told him that I just want communication and they understood. 

The time comes for them to pay me back, I wait all day till the end of day - no text or anything and called them.

I'm mainly upset for multiple reasons, you call out of the blue and ask for help not 24hrs after reconnecting..
He didn't apologize or give any courtesy to at least say something like ""my bad, I know I said X day, I'll have it X day instead..""

So when I get upset and explain to him it's fucked up how he didn't want to communicate, they get defensive and make it seem like I'm trippin! Saying ""you'll get your money back, I just don't have it yet""  This was end of Feb..

I follow up twice around the days for payback and both times they say something new: ""I'll have it next week"" and the next ""I'll should have it by X day"".  

I reach out again after about 2 wks and they've been put out their apartment. I'm dissapointed because the money I sent them was supposed to help prevent that exact thing!!! ($350) But they couldn't even help themselves to make sure that didn't happen with the help he received from me and other people. 

Now they say their car is messed up and theyre going thru it. I get that things are tough I do, but it seems like its always something with him and now I'm in the mix unfortunately.

I'm not trying to pester them but since they don't tell me anything to go by, it's like I'm bothering them when reaching out. but they have no gameplan and it feels like im being taken advantage of. I'm not trying to add to his stress but he's not holding his end of the bargain and communicating. 

 TLDR; I helped my ex with $350 and after they were supposed to pay me back they end up getting evicted and having even more issues. I have to reach out for answers when I ask for an idea of when I'll get my money, they get defensive and basically think im overreacting. Am I wrong for simply wanting an actual est for when I'll get my money back after they agreed to our initial terms?",0.06
"AITA for asking my bff of 4+ years to talk to me a little more after she dropped me for her new BF for months? My friend (F) and I (F) have been best friends for 4+ years. We have always been extremely close, texting all the time and calling every day for hours, playing games, watching films etc. For context, I have been single all our friendship, she has had long term bfs, and she has always communicated with me just the same whilst in a relationship. have supported her through many traumas, and her with mine too. She has always been enthusiastic about communicating, until:

I met a guy 6mo ago, and after a little while we became bf & gf. From this point on things started to change, she withdrew a little and started to “hunt” for a bf herself, joining multiple dating servers and twitters. She has never been so determined to get in a relationship. I would often arrange hangouts, text every day, as normal, I made a point to make time for her as I never wanted to be one of those girls who gets a bf and dumps their friends, but naturally I had to split my time between them, not just exclusively for her anymore. 

My friend joins a server and after a few weeks she goes on a virtual date with this guy (he lives in a foreign country); and after 1 date she books a flight to go see him the next week. I supported her but also said I worried because she has little money and barely knew him, but I knew she would go regardless. At this stage, if she does text me, it’s only about this guy. I’m lucky if I get a “how are you” from her. 

The trip comes around, and from this point our contact drops to almost nothing. We go from calling and texting daily to me being amazed if I get a text back once a day. Her online presence (usually extremely heavy) completely vanishes, she seems to abandon all her personal and future goals to talk 24/7 to him.

After 3 months of nearly no contact, despite me trying to arrange hangouts and text only to be met with constant rejections, I confront her, and say I feel upset she has abandoned me for her new bf and I hoped it was unintentional. She apologises, says she has been a shit friend, and promises to work hard to fix it as she doesn’t want to lose me at all. 

2 weeks pass, the communication is the same, and every attempt to hang out she has cancelled last minute. Last week, after another cancelled hangout by her, suddenly she goes no contact, not a single text. A week goes by and I send a text and suggested we end our close friendship and just stay mutuals online and keep in touch in future like old friends. I was trying to nicely give her a way out as I hate her ghosting, and we have had a close 4 year friendship and I care for her and don’t want to never communicate again. 

She ghosts me after insulting me saying I am asking too much by wanting to spend time with her or text her and then I discover she has blocked me everywhere within 5 minutes of this. I also see her bf posting childish insults about me on his instagram.

"AITA for wanting to get married in Spain? So as the title suggests I want to get married in Spain. My partner and I got engaged last year and have been loosely planning our wedding. This past Monday I went down to see the Eclipse with my uncle and my future sister in law , it was fantastic would do again and am already planning the next one which is coincidentally in Spain two days after the planned date for the wedding. Spain is cheap then the venues iv been looking at here by a huge margin as well. I told both my parents the idea and they are very against it to the point they told me they wouldn’t go. My dad even said “iv been to Spain I have no interest in going “. Even when I talked about him walking me down the aisle he was adamant on not going to Spain. 

I don’t want to lose out on the next eclipse and my family being there. I know with good planning plane tickets can be cost effective which is why I’m bringing it up now and I know some of my friends and family may not make it. My logic is they aren’t going to pay for my wedding anyways and I want a good wedding so why not make this one day about who it’s supposed to be about instead of being unhappy and uninterested in going all together if it’s not in our state.

There is more here too like the fact that after high school they never bothered to show up to any of my events including several solos iv had because my school was two hours away to them forgetting prior engagement with me. 

I know my parents love me and have my best interest at heart but iv even asked most my wedding party if it would be fine for them and if they were ok with it. Even my soon to be in-laws say that it’s my wedding day and it should be how I envision it. I just hesitate and feel like an ass because iv always put my feelings and emotions after my family.

"AITA for wanting to split bills according to income?  My 24F boyfriend 24M live together and are renting a house together. We have lived together for about 1 1/2 years and have both graduated college. We both have jobs that are using our degrees, but the thing is, I make $15 an hour. He makes $30 an hour. We both get 40 hours a week. We are also on completely opposite shifts - he’s usually heading to work about an hour before my shift is over. We don’t see each other much, except for the weekends. 

We split all of our bills 50/50. We each pay a half of rent, electric, gas, water, and wifi. I pay my own phone bill, his parents pay his. I don’t drive, and his parents pay his car insurance. 

I’ve been seeing a lot of reddit, and even facebook posts that have me thinking a lot lately. I see many people saying that their spouse and them split bills according to income - so the one making more money takes on more of the bills than the one who doesn’t. 

I want to state first that my boyfriend is a great man and treats me very well. He lends me money quite often just to get by until my next paycheck, but he is ALWAYS paid back. When we go on dates, sometimes he will pay, but more often than not I just venmo him the price of my meal. We both clean/pick up groceries/split chores. 

The thing is, we are planning to move to a different state within the next 5 years. He’s very big on saving money, and I have a bit of a spending problem that I have been working on during the past few months. I tell him all the time that I wish I was able to save money, but I don’t have much extra money after bills to even be able to save. According to my budget, I will be able to start saving $100 a paycheck starting over the summer. 

I’ve never really made one of these posts before, so I’m sorry if I am rambling. 

To get to the point here - I brought this up, gently, in conversation today. I asked him how he would feel about splitting bills based on our income instead of 50/50. He does not agree with it. He says he works so much that he is barely ever home and that it would practically be throwing money away to pay more for bills when he’s either only here when he’s sleeping or on weekends. I work from home so I’m here a lot more of the time. 

I was willing to hear his point and talk about it, but he went into work shortly after. I apologized for bringing up something stressful before he went to work and he said it wasn’t stressful to him. 

I know he wants to have a large savings account in case of any issue, but I just don’t see it as fair that I am literally scraping pennies to get by each paycheck.

"AITA for not boding with my dad at all even though I have the time now? I know I’m probably gonna be the asshole in this one just need someone to tell me tbh. I had a difficult relationship with my dad in high school. He’s the kind of parent that always has something negative to say about what you’re doing but he’s also very clingy and always wants to plan trips and activities so that we can bond. He doesn’t have many friends and works his ass off everyday so I feel bad. 

When I went to college, he always asked me to come home and I felt bad because he doesn’t really have that many friends and I imagined him just doing nothing at home so I usually caved and came home once a month give or take. 

Lately he’s been extremely generous with money, adding me as a user on his credit card and letting me use it for food, gas, and other necessities. He also bought me a car in high school which saved me a ton of money. I’m very grateful for everything he does for me and I’ve had a very easy life because of him. 

I know I owe him more than I’ve given him but I honestly just don’t want to spend time with him. He has a very awkward and boring personality and I’m just always extremely bored when I talk to him. I have no problem coming home or going out to eat with him once in a while but I just can’t stand going on multi-day vacations with him. I don’t like being pulled away from my life even if it’s only for a few days, and I don’t like when he keeps suggesting vacations when I clearly don’t want to go anywhere. Whenever he does get me to go on vacation with him it’s usually not very fun for either of us. 

I recently graduated and have a few months to enjoy before I start a job in the summer. A few days ago I drove up to my childhood home from my college apartment because my dad wanted to go skiing. I told him I only want to go for 1 night which he said was alright. I was barely able to drive up in time for the ski rental store to stay open and I felt bad because he was waiting for me there for a good half hour. I told him I want to drive back from skiing earlier because I had some potential plans for Friday night with my friends and he told me he doesn’t wanna go if I’m gonna keep coming up with things to shorten the trip. I felt bad because it probably hurt to hear that I don’t want to spend over 1 day with him when he knows I have months with basically no obligations ahead of me. 

I know I’m the asshole here. I have it so much better than a lot of other people and I can’t even spend a few days with the person that made it all possible. ",0.92
"AITA for ruining my cousins wedding?  I (24f) got invited to my cousins (25m) wedding. I had never had a good relationship with any of his girlfriends, however this one was a lot worse. She (27f) met my cousin when he was 23, they had been talking for quite a while and I could tell my cousin was very happy with their friendship. Until she had asked him out. After this he seemed very pressured to say yes to her as they were the closest of friends, he had texted me asking me for help with it. I gave him advice on what to do and what to say however he did not take this advice. When they were a few months into their relationship she started to text me a lot, telling me to cut contact off with him and also offered him a place at her house. Me and my cousin were living together at the time, especially because money was very tight for him. He had not long gotten sacked from his job. He had taken the place at hers which I was completely fine with. However a few weeks later he texted me saying how he did not want to be staying with her and he would rather stay at home with me. He said he was scared of her. Not long after this happened he had moved back in with me, however this added a lot to the toxicity of their relationship, she had gotten more aggressive towards the both of us, making us both feel uncomfortable with her presence. Just after my cousin had gotten a well paying job, she had dropped the question of marriage. I could instantly tell what was going on. I got invited to the wedding and went. When it had got to the point of them doing their vows I stood up and spoke out about how she was treating her, in front of her whole family. And they all looked disgusted with her behaviour.

"WIBTA for telling my in-laws that we can't afford a fancy restaurant and that we are not contributing to paying for the meal? My father-in-law's birthday is coming up and my partner received a message from his sister saying that she and MIL have booked a restaurant for FILs birthday. We were not asked about our opinions or price range or included in the discussion. Quickly looking at the restaurant information, I can see that they have a set menu and single price of about $120AUD per person, and that is excluding drinks. Drinks are an additional $30 per person for a package or $15-20+ for a single small glass of wine (minimum some are apparently$60-90 per glass- not that I would order that)!

We told my partner's sister that this is well out of our price range at the moment due to having a single income and a lot of unexpected bills. She said she didn't care and to ""work something out"" as they have booked this restaurant and it is for their father's birthday. 

We have tried to tell MIL (we are not allowed to mention where we are going to FIL) that it is too expensive and we have just been brushed off and told that we are going and too bad.

Every person involved knows of our financial situation and went ahead and booked an expensive restaurant without speaking to us first-- we were just told.

My partner is angry at his sister and thinks she is inconsiderate. She thinks that we are being unreasonable in our concerns about how expensive this meal will be (we pay less for our electricity!).",0.45
"AITA for saying 3+1 is 4? Hi, I was wondering if I was wrong in this scenario or not  


  
So I (14NB) was in school and we had to do this unit where we had to create our own dance moves. I grouped up with two of my friends, and a friend of a friend, who I'll just call her Z.  


  
Us four gathered up and decided which music we should do. I shared some ideas of mine, too. And it got ignored by Z saying ""that's a bad idea"" in a very high, fast voice. (Tbh, I don't know if she's being racist or not)  


  
Then Z started shouting ""We need 32 beats and our moves are only 24!"" So, I fixed and made some moves longer. I showed the fixed stuff to my group and while everyone else was happy with it, Z started saying that the music is in 4/4 and I should ""paraphrase"" it.  


  
Now, at that point, I was genuinely so confused. And I asked to clarify what does she mean by the moves being ""not 4/4"". And she pointed at this one point where I put two moves for 4 beats; one with three beats and the other with one. I then asked her, ""what's wrong with that?"" And she said that that part is in 2/4. And she started with the paraphrasing nonsense again.  


  
Since it had 4 beats (3+1), I told her it's 4/4 because it has 4 beats within a measure. And she completely lost it. She started saying ""I know that 3+1 is 4, I'm not that stupid. But this is 2/4 so we have to paraphrase it so it doesn't go offbeat."" I then said ""4 beats would mean it's 4/4, and it would only be offbeat in a measure because the three will only stay in a measure. It's not 5 beats or something.""  


  
Then Z scoffed and said ""Do you even know how to read music? Do you listen to any music?"" And at that point, I was just so mad at her. First of all, she was rude. If I know nothing about music, she still shouldn't say that. And she knows I'm in a symphonic orchestra as a second chair first violin.   


  
I started to show her visually how 3+1 is 4 so it would all be in together inside a measure using a tool for composing. And of course, she was still saying ""paraphrase it"" and ""it's still 2/4.""  


  
She didn't apologize for what she said that day, so I thought she maybe needed time. And nope, still no apologies even like 3 days later. Honestly, I'm still so upset that she said all those stuff and making me feel like I'm the AH. Should I never have said that 3+1 is 4, so it wouldn't be big of a deal and doesn't need ""paraphrasing""? Thank you!",0.28
"AITA for not informing my wife's parents when she had an accident? My wife (Alison - 29F) just had an accident. She broke her leg and ribs and had to undergo surgeries. I (27F) was a huge mess the whole time. I tried to balance being there for her with caring for our son (he's 4 months old) which was pretty tough.

Alison is now stable and feeling much better but still hasn't been discharged. Alison's parents do not talk to her much since the day she married me (they're homophobic). It would be one conversation or email during the holidays and that's it for the year.

So while I contacted my own family members for help, I didn't tell Alison's parents or siblings (also homophobic). However, I received a call from her mother literally yelling at me for keeping their daughter's health issues a secret from them. She said I had no right to hide this and that she found out through a family friend and was outraged.

I said I simply didn't think of them, and that I was sorry but Alison was thankfully doing well at the moment. They got even more angry and said I should have informed them, as her family. This kind of went over my head and this is where I was the AH. I said our son and I were now Alison's family. That broke into a whole argument

"AITA for making a comment on social media that reflected badly on my friend? I (32M) consider this guy (33M) a very good friend. We met in college and worked together for a number of years. He’s straight and I’m a gay, which is important in this context.

This friend and I both work in advertising. He was hosting a podcast for his agency with two invited guests (both men as well). They were talking about campaign strategies and what brands should be working on for the next months. 

It was a general discussion at first, but eventually they started talking about Pride Month and one of the guests made a very inappropriate “joke” that some people understandably perceived as homophobic. My friend was the mediator, he said nothing but looked uncomfortable and stirred the conversation in another direction.

But this “flub” on the podcast caught the attention of some people in our market, and there was some heat on local Twitter (X, whatever!), which I suspect was partly because the guy who made the inappropriate comment has the reputation of being a huge AH and has moved from agency to agency in the past.

Someone tagged me in one thread where there was a discussion about the lack of diversity in our local creative agencies, using a cut from the podcast as an example. I replied something like “zero surprise that this kind of shit is said when 3 straight guys get together to discuss LGBT issues”. 

My friend texted me immediately after to ask if I was upset with him. I said I was not, I took no personal offense, I was just weighting in on a broader subject. He then said he was following the negative reaction online and was very surprise to see me feeding the public discourse instead of talking to him about it. After all, it also reflects badly on him, and he’s feeling bad that he didn’t speak up but was in tough spot to be welcoming to the guests. And my comment essentially linked him to this kind of behavior.

I told him not to blame himself, reassured it wasn't my intention, and asked if he wanted to talk about it. He refused. I can tell he’s upset with me and now I’m wondering if I was an AH to engage in social media without talking to him first.

"AITA for changing RSVP to wedding (which changes airbnb plans)  I (28F) have a friend group (26-28f) with four girls; I met them when I moved to my new city. I introduced half of them to one another. Last summer I noticed I started getting excluded and tried to ignore. It became super apartment and somewhat rude because they’d talk about it in front of me afterwards. Long story short, I once tried to make plans and was told everyone was busy only to run into all of them hanging out. We have a book club where we meet every month and I’ve stopped actively trying to see them outside of it in the past 6 weeks.

I did confront them afterwards. I couldn’t get over the fact everyone was so okay with making plans without me and pretending as if I didn’t know.

During the same time frame, I was invited to one of their weddings in Mexico (28F). I felt a little worried but tried to lean into the good memories and use it as an opportunity to continue to build our relationships. The Airbnb was expensive but not terrible when split. I already paid.

I recently found out all of the girls were also invited on the bachelorette trip. I’m not incredibly close so I’m not surprised I wasn’t invited, but I am upset that the bride didn’t come to me first and rather someone confessed because I was asking if they knew when her bachelorette was and where she was going since I didn’t know. 

I’m mostly hurt that the bride didn’t come to me first and the rest of them fully planned to let me watch them all go together. They’ve also been planning this for months. I’m also hurt that I’ve asked if anyone has travel plans and they’ve never mentioned it and I knew they were acting a little weird. It just feels obvious that all the friendship building happened during many hangouts that I was specifically excluded from.  

The trip to Mexico costs me probably $1000 to attend, then gifts, bridal shower, etc. it feels like a pity invite. I don’t need to be included in the bachelorette but I think not coming to me and everyone planning to let me find out on my own is…cruel. 

Am I the asshole for backing out of wedding attendance at the last minute and asking for my part of the Airbnb back from the girl organizing the Airbnb?

"AITA for ""blowing a converstation"" out of proporation with a younger coworker? For some context, this happened about two years ago and I have been dealing with this for a hot minute. My friends Kyle(M22) and Eve(F21) keep telling me that I have ""blown this out of proportion"" , am being ""completely neurotic"", and will not talk to me until I schedule a meeting with my therapist next week.  
I(F23; currently F25), Ryan(M26), and Alice (F17) used to work together at a gym and we bonded over workouts and conversations about dating, relationships, and life. I had mentioned to Alice a couple of NSFW details about my life when I was seeing multiple people after a breakup, mentioned that I thought Ryan was flirting with me, and talked to her about our experiences both being bisexual women in the dating world. I made the assumption that Alice was older based on the nature of our conversations. However, I think Alice mentioned that that she was turning either 18 or 19 in a couple of months. Regardless, I approached her privately and wanted to make sure that she wasn't uncomfortable. She said that she was ""totally fine"" and I set some serious boundaries with her after. I didn't talk about my dating life afterwards.

  
A couple of months later, I reached out to a couple of mutual friends to confirm Alice's age because I wanted to make sure I was correct about. I reached a friend who I thought who knew her and mentioned that I think she was around 19 and he was like ""oh cool same here!"". I had asked Ryan whether he had Alice's phone number (i didn't mention that i wanted to apologize) and mentioned that she was around 17 instead of being 19.

  
Alice popped up on my instagram ""suggested for you"" since we both followed out workplace. I had followed her and sent her a DM being like ""hey its been a hot minute"" . I then freaked out and then deleted the message .About a week later, I had accidentally unfollowed her, i followed her again, and then unfollowed her.

I've asked him to slow down because he's getting so many he's even planning on getting two more very soon. Alex hasn't even told his family which he is really close to.

I have no issue with how they look anymore as they've grown on me and he is really attractive with them.

I'm terrified because this is my first real relationship in over a year since my last ex abused me mentally, sexually, and emotionally.

I feel stupid for crying over this situation and I know I worry a lot but every time I try to talk to him about it he tells me ""Its not that deep"". 

He is so sweet in every other manor and truly the best guy I've been with. He just doesn't wanna listen when I tell him to slow down so he can really think about what he's doing

So I guess my question is AITA for asking my boyfriend to slow down with his tattoos?

"AITAH for thinking my coworkers are hooking up and one is married Several of us were in a conference room doing training. As people entered, everyone stayed seated because we know everybody already and are informal with each other. A male coworker who was not part of the training entered the room. A female co-worker who was sitting at the table and had not moved when other people came in immediately stood up and walked over to this male co-worker. They stood within a couple of feet of each other in front of the group and we're talking and smiling, but I couldn't hear what they were saying. When she initially approached him, it appeared that they were about to hug (arm movements looked like it) but stopped and he kind of patted her back and then realized when I was watching them, he gave a hug to a seated female co-worker. Their conversation seemed mundane, but they were both really smiling and keeping eye contact.

The exchange was brief and then the male co-worker left and the female co-worker sat back down with a little smile on her face and blushing very slightly (maybe her cheeks were already like that idk)

Yes, I'm aware this is none of my business. But the female co-worker is actually the boss, she is also married, and unnecessary major drama will affect work flow, which directly affects me and my paycheck. I have no proof that they are interacting outside of work and I will not involve myself in this in any way more than I have to . I just want to know, am I reading too much into this? Is this normal behavior? AITAH?",0.63
"WIBTA if I decided to limit/remove my daughter from her 2nd moms life? A little backstory, I(Now 32F) am a survivor of Domestic Abuse and while fleeing, my friend(we'll call her Jade) had decided to watch my youngest(Riley 3 months at the time now 4) while family watched my oldest(Avery 2 years old at the time now 6)so I could get myself situated as I had to start from the ground up.  It's been a long hard road and I am still struggling but I have both my girls now.   
Through it Jade has been there to help with Riley. Jade has always wanted a little girl so she got really close with Riley in the time watching her, even offering to adopt her if I didn't want to keep her(Later on even having Riley call her mom)So we came to a mutual agreement she would watch her every other week which was going fine and at the start I was ok with. Then, about a year a half ago I got into a car crash. This is where things started to unfold.  
For 5 months Avery and Riley stayed with Jade while I got them on the weekends. Over the course of these 5 months I started to notice Averys teeth getting buildup on them? I asked Jade if she was brushing and flossing her teeth and she said she only brushed and flossed their teeth every other night. I managed to get a vehicle before Averys dentist appointment. Well due to the improper hygiene Avery needed to get 3 teeth drilled down and a silver cap put on them. Dentist was shocked at how fast her teeth deteriorated. Afterwards I had told Jade that she was no longer allowed to watch Avery ever again and that I wanted to go back to weekly rotations with Riley and that I wanted her to better by Riley.

  
Fast forward a couple of weeks, I found out Avery gained 10 pounds in the span of 5 months while there and would freak out during meal times to which Avery started to tell me some things. I verified with Jade and she admitted to me that she spanks Riley if she doesn't eat all of her food. Riley has almost puked up her food multiple times and Jade still makes her eat it. She sets timers if she doesn't swallow her food and she gets a spanking after timer goes off(this is just if Riley doesn't swallow). She had been doing the same with Avery. I told her this wasn't ok that she's creating unhealthy and unrealistic expectations on her. Jade claims she has stopped but now has found other things to do to make mealtimes difficult for Riley.   


Jade, as of last year, has also started to let people who I am not at all comfortable with to stay with her.  Behavioral wise its affecting Riley so I started taking Riley through the week and only letting Jade have her on the weekends. Yes I realize Riley is 4 and she's going to have issues/tantrums but these are just... different? Riley also calms down a lot behavioral wise when with me and things re-escalate after coming back from Jades. There are also various other things that have bothered me recently that Jade has done that she doesn't take me seriously on. At this point I am just exhausted and tired. WIBTA?",0.89
"WIBTA if I refused to go to bed when my roommate wants me to? I am college roomates this year with my best friend from high school (Both 19F). First semester of college everything was okay, but we did start to realize that we have different schedules. She gets up around 8-9 and wants to be in bed around 11. I'm a night owl and I get up around 10-11 and stay up until about 1-2am.



We had a huge blowout a few weeks ago, as she's been having trouble sleeping. She told me that she can't fall asleep unless it is completely silent and dark: she's tried sleeping masks and earplugs but they just make her too uncomfortable to sleep. I've been on my phone in bed on the lowest brightness and she's asked me if I could turn the phone off so she could sleep. I've been watching movies on my laptop with an extra dimmer app and she's told me its too distracting with the light and she can't sleep. So basically at this point when she asks if we can do ""lights out"" or tries to remind me that its a SCHOOL NIGHT (we're in freaking college?) the only conclusion we could come up with is I go out into the lobby which is absolutely crowded around 10-2 at night. However due to the crowdedness and the inconvenience of putting on normal clothes and gathering my stuff has made it so I usually just suck it up and go to sleep when she does.



A few weeks ago, when I told her that I'd like to stay up later that night after she asked if we could have ""lights out"", I told her that she can get in bed anytime she wants but for one night I'd like to stay up. She then got extremely pissed and started saying that she can't believe I'd put games and phone scrolling over her sleep and I need to just go in the lobby if I want to stay up. I told her she was being extremely controlling about things and I should be able to stay up as long as I'm not talking on the phone or having things incredibly bright: it's my room too, my living space too, and she can't see the sacrifices I'm making for her every night at this point. I told her she was being a tyrant and not realizing everything I do for her, overreacting at the situation, and she needs to rethink things because its ridiculous.



We've since made up and I've been going out into the lobby more often, but its just making me resent her more for it and I'm not sure how to go about this, talk to her about it, or stand my ground.



I understand that its not her fault she's like this, but at the same time, I feel like I should be able to play games quietly or watch my phone on a low brightness in my own room. Are there any suggestions you guys could give me or different compromises other than going into the lobby? And WIBTA if I stood my ground and told her that I was gonna stay up in my own room? If I were to do that, what should I say? Thank you!",0.14
"AITA for screaming at my roommate and her boyfriend to leave our dorm room? I (20F) am a sophomore in college and dorm on my university's campus. Both my freshman year and sophomore year I haven't had the best luck with roommates, I live out of state from my school so I have to dorm on campus. This all took place the spring semester of my sophomore year, I was living in a triple room but one of my roommates did early graduation and the other decided to commute to campus instead. Long story short I had the dorm room to myself. That was until my university's housing coordinator emailed me saying that someone new was moving into my room, I was sad at first cause I wouldn't have the room to myself but hopeful as this could be the end of my horrible roommate luck. My new roommate who I will call Kaylee (20F) moved in with me.   
Unfortunately it was the complete opposite, Kaylee was the kind of person who vaped, drank, and partied, and I was the complete opposite. To me she was bad news. The thing is that Kaylee has a boyfriend (20M) the issue was that she would bring her boyfriend to the dorm her and I shared pretty much every day to the point where it was getting extremely annoying and uncomfortable at times. At one point I walked in on them having sex in the dorm room me and Kaylee shared. Luckily I was strong enough to put a stop to it that day, however the visits and uncorfortableness didn't stop there. Day after day I would come back from classes to see Kaylee and her boyfriend both snuggling and doing pda right in front of my face at times. 

  
For months I stayed silent and let it slide, however tonight I came back to my dorm from class and there they were snuggling on Kaylee's bed, I stayed quiet for a while, that was until Kaylee asked her boyfriend for a massage, including the massage oil and everything. Kaylee took her top off and laid on her stomach on the bed as her boyfriend started massaged her back with the massage oil, all right in front of my face. At this point was extrremely uncomfortable and had enough and I screamed at them to stop and I wasn't going to play quiet and nice anymore and yelled at them if they were going to continued to do this stuff they needed to get out. The boyfriend apologized saying he didn't know I was uncomfortable, I yelled back saying that did he really think I want to come back to my room after a long day of classes and witness Kaylee not only topless but her own boyfriend giving her a massage, there's a reason public places do these massages in private. 

I started getting emotional and immediately left the room afterwards for fresh air. After about 10 minutes I came back to find Kaylee and her boyfriend gone from the room. I feel like I went too far into screaming at them and basically kicking them out of the room, not to mention Kaylee hasn't spoken to me at all and I feel like this situation could've been done better. But I'm not so sure, AITA?",0.53
"AITA For choosing to park my car in the driveway during street sweeping days? For some context, I rent a room in a 3 bedroom house (plus a living room converted to a bedroom and rented out). There are 4 tenants in the house who all have 4 cars with me included. For two days in a month, we are required by the city not to leave cars parked at the street for street sweeping or risk getting a parking violation. We (the tenants) are not allowed to park on the driveway unless on street sweeping days.
There is only space for 3 cars in the driveway. This wasn’t an issue until the landlord decided to convert the living room into another bedroom and rented the space out about two months ago. The landlord then proceeded to lease out the driveway for an extra fee to the new tenant. This means the three remaining tenants (including me) have no place to park our vehicles on street sweeping days. I have filed a complaint to the landlord and decided to keep using the driveway even if it means blocking the new tenant in. Am I the asshole for doing this?",0.44
"AITA for not wanting my kids to be watched by their aunt and calling her unreliable? I, (28M) have been on and off with my two daughters' (1,3) Mother (24F). I moved out in August and got a job and a place that are in a town 17 miles away from where they still live. When I moved out her sister (26F) moved in. Her sister had moved in with us before a few times but often roams back and forth between a 4 hour radius and has never had a stable income.

When she moved in I took it as a good thing as she could help with the kids, and she's great with them. However, I had requested that we apply for state daycare as I was the only one with income for the time so I could see my girls more than just on the weekends. She said that she didn't want our girls in daycare and her sister was the best option. This means that during the week I have to drive back and forth after work if I want to see my girls.

Well, the week came around for my ex to start her job (she was stay at home while we lived together and took until then to get an income going,) and her sister left 2 hours away to go help someone else out that week (she doesn't have a car the friend had to come get her.)  So I had to take two days off of my job and my mom had to take one day off to make sure the ex could keep her new job. When I brought it up that I thought it was BS that two people that were using PTO I was told to ""stop talking trash about her sister."" In my eyes, I never trash talked her just said it was super crappy of her to abandon her sister the week she got a new job.

Now, end of March, her sister gets her financial aid for school that she's just started and goes on a two week vacation to see their other sister across the country. My exes mom had to drive an hour both ways to watch the girls every day and was also displeased and has told me she wishes the girls were in daycare. Her mom also couldn't make it one day and I had to take another day off during this trip as well.

So today I bring it up again that it's not fair that I don't get to see the girls as much because of the daycare situation and am having to take PTO (I just started my career in August and don't have a lot of PTO yet.) and she lost it when I called her sister unreliable and told me that as long as our daughters are provided for it's none of my business. I'm on the side of I'm using my PTO and not seeing my daughters as much as I'd like for someone who is supposed to have joint custody (nothing in writing, that's soon to change.)

I'm posting on here because she doesn't want families involved. Am I the asshole for saying her sister is unreliable and shouldn't be the sole daycare provider for the kids?",0.03

"AITA for cursing someone out over Dungeons and Dragons? For context, this is about a DND game I've been playing for a few months in a DND club at college, I'll try to avoid getting too into the DND rules or anything confusing, but that's the backdrop for this conflict.

So, I've been playing DND with these folks for a while now, two short campaigns that went off without any real hitches. I came to the table with a character that was a little dumb, but kind. ...And also secretly a werewolf.

The first few sessions were fun, but then came the main issue; two people who weren't playing the campaign at all started sitting in on sessions for no discernible reason, one being extremely loud and talkative which was a problem since I have noise sensitivity from being autistic, so I would sometimes act irritable from being overstimulated.

The real problem though was the other one, I'll call them Opal. I didn't know Opal, they were a friend of the friends I was playing with and they started heckling me from the second they first showed up. For example, I made art of my werewolf transformation that I worked really hard on, and their response was saying it looked like Foxy from FNAF and loudly belting out the FNAF theme unprompted. It didn't, it was on the realistic side. They were blatantly trying to insult me and my art considering the smirk on their face. This annoyed me but I was like okay, moving on.

Except it kept going on like this for *weeks* and the DM (the person running the game) did nothing to stop it.

Fast forward to today, second to last session, lots of heckling, telling me loudly and snarkily that I wasn't invited to a summer game the club is holding. We're supposed to fight the final boss, a young dragon. Cue one of the players that oneshot everything and made combat basically nonexistent oneshotting the boss before initiative could even be called. I was really sad and upset about this, because I *really* wanted to fight in werewolf form, I got fancy dice for it and everything, and when I expressed that Opal looked me dead in the eyes and went 'womp womp.' I stared right back, and after *months* of being heckled at this point, I had enough.

I've been told that I'm *very* scary when I get mad, partially I basically never get mad or raise my voice at people, but I was seeing red at this point. I snapped at Opal, yelling/borderline screaming about how they were being immature and generally a jackass, something along the lines of 'You're a f\*\*\*ing adult, act like one!' and slamming my fist on the table in anger.

They flinched and stared at me, looking genuinely frightened at my outburst after how quiet I had been about their behavior. That made everyone else furious and I was basically shoved out the door and kicked out of the campaign and any future ones after. I'm still extremely upset about it, but did feel like screaming at and yelling curse words at them was too much, even if I *was* furious.

Idk, AITA?

  
Edit 1 for clarity; I did go to the DM about how this heckler was really getting on my nerves and didn't need to be there, the DM didn't do anything about it even though it would've been easy to say 'you can't sit in on a game if you aren't playing' and things wouldn't have gotten this far.   
This also happened over the span of two or so months, most of which I spent already overstimulated and upset because of the other person there who was so loud it echoed the entire room and after trying to say out loud to everyone there 'hey this made me really upset can you not do that again' and Opal's response was looking me dead in the eyes and doing the FNAF theme thing again whilst smirking. They harassed me a lot post-game too, making fun of me for taking breaks because I was overstimulated, hearing me mention a series I liked and then ripping into it for no good reason and grinning when I got upset about it... I had already left the game in tears once before because of them but I didn't mention it initially because of the character limit. I definitely didn't respond perfectly, but it wasn't without reason.",0.93
"AITA for asking my husband to give me an exact date of bringing at least some income home? Hi everyone! In my last post about 2-3 months ago I wrote about my husband deciding to flip the house. The old house was bought with my savings, all the renovation costs and the entire family costs have been covered by me for a year by now.

It’s been a year now and the house is still not finished. I keep paying for everything. Today I asked about the exact date when the project will be finished. Heard something like “I need to finish this small detail here and there, and also that small thing bla bla bla”. So nothing clear, no exact dates, no specific plan. It feels like he constantly finds a new tiny detail to upgrade instead of moving forward with the sale. He also yells and calls me bossy for getting my nose into his business. 

And I’ll admit - I’m absolutely exhausted. We had to move to a nearby town in February. I had to come up with the deposit (3 months of rent upfront), movers, packing help. Then all this mess with unpacking - it’s just stressful. All while having a 5 year old and keeping working. Our kid is at school till 1 pm only, and I still work 15-17 hours a day. On top of that I don’t have any help around the house. So I also cook decent meals from scratch (Ukrainian women don’t usually use anything pre-made, kinda cultural here). I also paid for my mother-in-law’s surgery, keep paying the salary to my father-in-law, groceries, rent, AND all these endless materials for the house.

You know how I feel? Actually stupid. Like really. I’m an adult woman, taking responsibility for the grownup man and his entire family. Why do I even do that?

I ask my husband for help around the house, like very simple chores - unload a dishwasher or do laundry. The answer is “If I do that, I won’t have time for my house flipping thing! Don’t distract me!”.

I’m still not allowed to ask questions about the future. He calls me bossy every time and says that I’m being harsh. He never called me bossy when he was paying with my card in the supermarket or when I paid for rent though.

I’m lost. I don’t know what to do. I know that I’ll be well off by myself. Probably even better financially, I could save at least a thousand dollars per month without covering his needs. But I love him. And that is the problem.

What would you do? Please don’t tell me he’s using me, I already know that myself. The question is how to change that? 

And AITA for actually asking him any questions about the money? He says that I’m making him guilty when I ask when he’ll start contributing to the household. He says “You know that I CANNOT pay for anything at the moment!”. Then he usually yells or gives me this silent treatment. I feel like it’s very manipulative but can’t help feeling that I’m making him uncomfortable indeed and should just wait.

Have to say that divorce is my last option, I’m searching for the ways to improve the situation. I’ve always seen myself as a family person and we’ve been together for 11 years almost.",0.38
"AITA for crying and yelling at my mom and sister when they tried to help with wedding planning 

I (29F) am getting married in 5 months. I met up with my mom and sister yesterday because they wanted to help me with the wedding planning. They were both giving me really different ideas and they were arguing over which would be nicer since they both had opposite opinions. It was just like really overwhelming honestly and I started crying and yelled at them that I don’t want their help and that I was fine on my own. I didn’t mean to be rude but I just want it to be perfect buts it’s so hard. Everyone in my life is telling what I should and shouldn’t do and everyone is trying to help me except my literal fiancé. He hasn’t given me any input and I just want the whole day to be perfect ands it so scary and overwhelming. I kinda just wish I wasn’t getting married now not because I don’t love my fiancé but this whole planning experience has been so awful. 

I apologised straight away for being rude but my mom and sister yelled at me anyway and told me that they were just trying to help and just because i’m indecisive doesn’t mean I should take it out on them. I apologised again but my sister threatened to not go to my wedding because i’m being a bitch. They both left and my sister told me that she won’t help me. I feel so bad I’ve probably ruined the whole wedding. I don’t understand why I have to do everything though like why wont my fiancé help? I’ve asked him to but he still doesn’t.

"AITA for not wanting to block friend/former crush after being congratulated on my marriage? Not really sure who to talk to about this. Long story short, I had a good friend through high school that I had a crush on. I told them how I felt, and it wasn’t mutual, and for the past 8 years we have been surface level, “happy birthday texts” friends. However, my friends still make jokes about that girl, to the point where one made a comment about it during his wedding speech (yes, we were both livid).

I recently got married, and this friend reached out and congratulated us. I said thanks and asked how her newborn daughter and husband were doing. It turned into a discussion about kids, and about how excited I am for my wife and I to have a baby. She also asked about my wife and I’s story, and I was happy to tell it. 

Lastly, I mentioned how I was so thankful how both our lives turned out, because the confidence I gained after our “discussion” years ago led to me finding my wife, and that the universe always works in our favor at the end of the day. She agreed, and we wished each other well.

The next day, my wife was on my phone looking through our recent photos and saw our text conversation and immediately began scrolling. She was incensed that it was the same girl my friends had made jokes about. She saw all the positive things I said about her and our future, but she became very upset when she saw me thanking my friend for their role in my personal growth that led to my wife. 

My wife began saying things about how I was making it sound like it was all to my friend’s credit that we got married, and that it looked like after all this time I still couldn’t stop thinking about her. I was shocked but just apologized profusely. 

My wife then asked me to delete her number and to block her on Facebook. I felt guilty about it, because from my vantage point all that happened was two friends of over a decade were catching up and talking about their fortunate marriages. But my wife said that to not block her was to show that I care more about my friend than her feelings. 

I empathize with my wife. And if I have to cut back socially with them, even entirely, I understand. However, I feel like deleting contact info and blocking them seems extreme given what actually occurred. If I only reply to their “happy birthday” texts with “thanks” moving forward that’s fine, but to cut a friend entirely out of my life due to feelings from almost a decade ago? I feel like she went too far.

I went ahead and did as she requested, but I can’t help but feel a little sick to my stomach about it. I just cut a decade-long friend out of my life to keep my wife happy. Worst yet, even after doing so, my wife keeps making comments about it. Am I in the wrong as bad as she makes it seem? I tried to be as objective as I could in writing this. I feel like either some past trauma is playing a role in the severity of her reaction, or I am being too dismissive of her feelings given the situation, and both those answers make me feel terrible about it all.",0.62
"AITA for getting emotional about an apartment? My Boyfriend (34M) and I (35F) have been together a little over a year, I moved his apartment 9 months ago. Then I started a hospital job 11 hours a day, with a 50 minutes commute each way. My boyfriend works an office job, 9-6 with a 5 minute commute and WFH 2 days/ week.

We’ve been looking for to move for 3 months. It’s hard to even find apartments that suit our criteria (2 bedrooms because he needs an office, close to my work, reasonable price) and there’s so much competition for renters!

2 days ago, bf found an ad for an apartment, and asked if we should apply. I said yes.
The next day I ask if he’s applied, he says no because he first wants to see properties for sale. He had introduced the idea of moving to another city where he can afford to buy and I could find another job closer (which I don’t mind, but in 1-2 years).

He said he’ll apply to the rental by end of the day. I let him know I liked this apartment a lot (On top of suiting our criteria, I have flexible preferences regarding the character of the home, flooring materials, etc, that don’t matter to him, he thinks it’s irrational and he’s right to an extent).

I had a feeling he would be too late, because I know how fast these things can go, and thought about writing myself. He had already talked to a lady from this agency in the past so I thought it could help if he does it and I convinced myself a few hours would be ok.

Well it wasn’t. By the late evening the ad had been deleted. I was visibly disappointed that I didn’t trust my guts and write to the contact lady myself or insist he do it sooner. I didn’t blame him though.

He told me not to get so upset, it’s only an apartment, we will find another one. I said that he doesn’t seem to to understand me or the urgency to act in this rental market. He told me to basically get over it, there’s nothing we can do about it now. I asked him to contact the agent and see if there was any way we could still at least see the apartment. He said no, it won’t make any difference anyway. I was upset he didn’t even want to try.

He got angry, saying I should have empathy for him when he’s been doing everything he can to support me with work-life balance (by accepting to move, sometimes picking me up at work and cooking).

I said this is why we need to find a couples therapist (he accepted but neither of us had the time to find a therapist we like, though I don’t know if he looked). That’s when he said he changed his mind about therapy, we either will make it through our issues on our own or we won’t.

Now I have the impression that either he never had the intention to giving therapy a chance or he’s not willing to do everything he can for our relationship.

He then went to bed. I said go sleep on the couch because I won’t be able to sleep next to you if we’re still in a fight. I’ve slept on the couch several times when we were arguing l and for once I wanted to sleep in “my” own bed.

"AITA for telling my office mates to be quiet? Visiting a foreign research institute and was assigned to a visitor's office with four desks (I am used to having a private office in my home institute).

A group of researchers are working together in the next desk, discussing loudly through out the day, and not letting me concentrate on my tasks. 

AITA for telling them to be quiet?

The catches are:

1. I can mitigate the issue by using my noise-canceling speakers and listen to some music, which I often like to do anyways, but without speakers, and it is not really comfortable using the speakers all the day;
2. It is here culturally more acceptable for people to speak loudly than what I am used to.
3. I do not really interact with my office mates, other than greeting in the morning and in the afternoon, when they/I arrive/leave.

"AITA for not cooking for the last year? My partner (31F) and I (33M) have been together 4 years. For the last year, I have refused to cook for her.

I've grown up with a big interest in food, love different cultures and cuisines, spices and sauces and meats. Everything. anything.

My partner, pretty much loves potatoes, pasta, chicken and cheese. Everything else is a struggle. She'll write entire continents of food off, because she has never tried it. 

I used to love cooking, I've worked in restaurants, done culinary courses, experiment with foods, would spend whole days cooking to try something from scratch. Grown my own foods, killed my own meats. 

Now, because of her years of complaints, I feel ashamed about my food, don't want to even try anymore. She spent 3 years complaining about everything, not a single compliment that wasn't alongside something else that was wrong. Never enjoyed anything. 

She's broken my desire to cook, completely taken away that passion I had.  I'm embarrassed and always second guess myself cooking now.

The only time I cook now is the BBQ, usually meat rubs, big chunks of meat on the spit. Everyone always loves it, except she'll have a reason to complain. She'll burn the garlic bread, but complain my beef is too rare, or spicy.

We had a big argument tonight about this, the catalyst for this post. She wants me to cook more, and I understand that I haven't cooked ina year and it's not equal. She'll cook 2 or 3 nights a week, the rest of the time we have takeaways because I won't cook.

She says she wants me to cook, says she didn't mean all those complaints, says she wants me to give her some advice cooking.

It just seems so disingenuous given how she's spoken about my food for years.

"AITA for having a past adult industry history? Throw away account obviously.
(Sorry for my awful grammar, English is not my first language).


I married my husband young.
I had more experience when it came to the adult world than it came to him and I did some very not safe for work stuff while (before him age 18-21 maybe before) lesbian videos.
They aren’t able to be found unless you really dig deep down to find them but I know that they are out there if you search in the right language.
Here’s the part where i am being called the asshole.
I have always been open about the fact that there might be videos or pictures out there from before me and my husband were toghether.
Anyone asks about it and I answer honestly cause the internet is forever and eventually someone is gonna find it and there is just no point denying it.
And if someone finds it I would rather be on the side of prideful knowing than being shamed for something that happened in the past.
My husband however says that I am disrespectful towards him for admitting that there is images out there and I should rather keep it a secret until it “might happen that someone finds out”. 
It’s not like I advertise it to the world, I actually don’t bring it up at all unless I’m talking to girlfriends at parties/girl talk that he listens into  that are interested in doing adult work / nude art to let them know the fact that everything online stays online and not all work is going to make you money and so on. 
I can understand how we’re both being stubborn here’s how I could be the asshole. 
He has a habit of calling women that so adult work / onlyfans whores/sluts and generally look down on them. And I see it as honest work, I’m not going to lie the way he talks about women worries me sometimes. Cause instead of seeing women doing online sex work/art/taking advantage of what they have in our current society. He calls them whores and prostitutes. 

I can’t go back and change what videos/pictures I did before I met him but I also refuse to keep my past a secret just to look good for him.
I have listened to him trying to explain how it makes him feel but all I am getting is “how do you think it makes me look when you are proud your past videos ect”. 

So am I the asshole for not completely hiding my online past for him? Should I just keep it secret to preserve his pride? Am I wrong for being open about it and should I instead hide it to keep the peace? ",0.09
"AITA for telling my husband he can’t hang out with his friends if a specific girlfriend of theirs is there? My (23f) husband (24m) and I have been together for 5 years. Over that time I’ve met and been friendly with many of his friend’s gfs/wives and never had any problems. My husbands best friend, Jeff(24m) got a new girlfriend 5 months ago. Jenna(28f). When we first met, I joked about how my husband switched to Android so I can’t see his location anymore. She then said she had already airtagged Jeff. This made me think hmm maybe it isn’t a terrible idea. I suggested it to my husband and he put an AirTag on his keys no problem. As we all hung out more over the next month or two, I started picking up a weird vibe from her I guess. She referred to my husband as “big boy” and then giggled and looked to me and asked if she can say that. My husband and Jeff where on the phone while we where on a walk listening to music through his headphones, and Sarah on Jeff’s side asks to talk to my husband. My husband warns her im listening and then she awkwardly says hi how are you then eventually gives the phone back. According to my husband her best friend and her have threesomes with Jeff, which gave me the impression she may cross boundaries I wouldn’t. Before she got with Jeff she almost got with another friend of my husbands. I felt odd about her and mentioned these facts/incidents to my older sister who said “it’s giving homie hopper” and at that point felt like I didn’t know her enough to trust her. I mentioned this to my husband and he agreed she was kinda weird, and I said I’d feel more comfortable if he didn’t hang out with her alone. My reasoning being if she’s hanging with him and his friends, then there’s no reason why I can’t just be there too since it’s a group/girlfriends included thing. He agreed. I said if he shows up and she’s there, either invite me or leave. He agreed to all this. He’s broken my trust in the past and swore to do anything to fix it and has. Though Eventually he said it was starting to cause difficulty, and we were out at a store so I said we would talk about it later. Before we had a chance to talk, he told Jeff about my “no Jenna” rule, who then told Jenna. She got mad, and made the same rule for Jeff (he can’t be around me). There was a time I saw his AirTag at Jeff’s house (where Jenna always is) when he said he was going somewhere else and called him to clarify and his friends heard including Jeff. Who then told Jenna. When I found out my husband told them about the “Jenna rule” I was embarrassed because I knew I was being a little dramatic. I offered to talk to her and clear things up and she refused. Jeff texted my husband that she said she respected my husband wanting to squash the beef, but I’m insecure and controlling and my behavior is concerning and it isn’t in her boundaries to reconcile with me, she didnt want Jeff in between our “hidden tension anymore” and accused me of accusing her of being in love with my husband and wanting to f him. That was 2 ish months ago now. My husband didn’t defend me hardly at all. AITA?

"AITA for lying to my nephew to get him to eat his vegetables? My brother told me that my nephew(11) is refusing to eat his broccoli and spinach. He said he could use my help. I told my nephew that eating his veggies can improve his health but he still wasn’t very interested. Promising chocolate afterwards didn’t help either.

I thought about it before showing him Physical: 100, a show you can find on Netflix, featuring physical contests between super buff-type people.

I told him if he eats the high protein veggies he could look like those guys.

This worked and he started shoveling broccoli and spinach into his mouth. But my brother isn’t too pleased about out it, saying I shouldn’t have lied to my nephew since a lot of those guys probably do steroids, and that my nephew would never get buff like them if he doesn’t go through painful workouts.

"AITA-  my ex showed up at my workplace as a potential manager. I raise the issue with my bf and now he's dumped me Written on my phone, so excuse layout. 
Background:I am in an administrative role in a very large factory where my partner works. Our relationship isn't public knowledge.

On Wednesday my manager came into a meeting and told me to go out and meet a potential new manager thatvwould manage people. That person  was an ex boyfriend from 14 years ago, before my now ex husband. 
Not gonna lie I had a little panic attack. This ex bf left me for a friend of ours and where ever he has been in my life there has been drama. 

More background: I have a habit of just dealing with stuff coz my current (?) Bf doesn't seem to deal with any situation well. Before my ex husband knew about us, my ex husbsnd was for some reason still connected to my google account and saw picture of me and my bf together. When my ex husband told me about it, I disconnected all the accounts so every device had to log in again and didn't say anything. The problem was solved. My ex husband told my bf about it and my bf lost his mind because ""if I can't talk about the little stuff how can I talk about the big stuff."" 

Yup I agree. That was a poor decision by me. I need to change that mindset.
So I did.

So when my ex bf showed up at my workplace, I messaged my bf as soon as I finished work. I told my bf what had happened and what the plan for my ex was. I'm not worried about my working relationship with my ex coz honestly I'll just avoid him, but I told my bf that my ex could become his manager and I wanted his opinion on that situation, and if he didn't want that situation, I would do everything in my power to make it not so.  I'm a crucial part of my workplace right now with no one knowing my job so I'm not worried about who my boss will choose. I know I will come out on top and my bf knows this.
......
I was met with resistance like it was my fault he was at work, when I had no clue. It was civil till today where he pretty much broke up with me and I dont know what to do? Is this a lost cause? Or did I actually mess up?  I will add screenshots to the whole conversation in the comments, with names and stuff blurred. But aita? ",0.75
"AITA? Husband needs to go abroad for 1 week to fix our migration requirements but it’s near my pregnancy due date. I’m about to give birth on June with our miracle babies (yes, twins) but my husband has a very important matter that he needs to attend to abroad for almost 1 week and time is also of the essence since it’s related to our plans to migrate in Spain via Golden Visa since the Spain govt announced their plans to scrap the real estate route anytime soon it’s a now or never scenario since there are a lot of requirements to arrange in Spain like bank accounts and securing the property.

Now, I told him he can leave anytime but it should be after our babies are safely delivered. But he insisted that he should go this June because if later, it’s too tight to complete the migration requirements. 

We argues and stood my ground that it’s a very crucial timeline for me too since it’s the same month i’m about to give birth and I want him beside me since this is our first pregnancy and given multiples, it’s a high risk pregnancy. OB check-ups are also more frequent if closer to our due date.

"AITA for not pushing myself physically on a hiking trip I planned a drive/hike holiday with a friend, Jane. About a month or so before Sarah asked if she could join us. We couldn't meet up before we travelled and didn’t talk through how things would work, except Jane told me she wasn't prepared to drive.

  
It turned out I had to do all the driving (nobody's fault). Also we realised that the guides provided by the agency were terrible. The maps were pixelated and the instructions were meaningless. Driving 4 hours and then hiking, and not drinking at night as I was the designated driver was not going to make for a great trip. I guess I shouldn't have voiced this, but I did. Jane took it on board, but Sarah was annoyed with me for not sucking it up and I walked in on them that night talking badly about me. In general the atmosphere wasn't great. 

  
I’m no mountaineer and never claimed to be. The conditions were difficult and the other two much fitter than me. Due to difficult driving I would arrive already tired at the climbing site, couldn't keep going as long as them and would stop and sit down. Going on without me wasn't an option as we were in the middle of nowhere. I wasn't prepared to go anywhere too hazardous without a good map or guide, but Sarah is a very athletic person and wanted to take on every peak, the higher the better. Jane sat on the fence and looked upset.  


That evening I wanted to discuss the next day, as there was a difficult option and an easy one, but they had nothing to say. Then, at the foot of the mountain Sarah said, I'm taking the hard route, you can come if you like. I knew I wasn't up to it so said I wouldn’t. Jane went with her and I just wandered about and picked them up later on. 

  
I was ready to just chalk the whole trip as a bad experience not to be repeated, but years later Sarah is still bitching about to to all our friends when I'm not present. They bring it up pretty regularly saying things like « why did you take a hiking holiday if you are scared of heights »? Jane said nothing, but implied I should have apologised. 

I never felt guilty about any of it because they tried to bulldoze me into doing things I didn't feel comfortable doing, and they weren't in charge. But maybe I was the AH because I didn’t follow their lead on the mountain and push myself physically and take on more risk. ",0.19
"AITA for talking to my boyfriend too early in the morning? hey reddit, my boyfriend (24M) and i (25F) got into an argument this morning and i need to know if i was an asshole. he told me “talk to someone else i have nothing else to say” so i’m asking you all. 

my boyfriend and i are taking a vacation next week. i have done all of the planning, booking, research etc. he has not helped with anything, aside from booking a single tour, which i sent him the link to and asked him to do. he was also responsible for finding transportation there. he has not done any research for this trip at all, and i don’t even think he knows what currency they use.

while we are there, we are taking a day trip to another town a few hours away, and i messaged the airbnb host if we could drop off luggage a few hours before check in so we could hike. she responded and asked what time. 

here is the scene: 

my alarm goes off this morning at 5am. typically both of us wake up between 5-5:15 so this is normal for us. his didn’t this morning but i believe he recently changed it to 5:15. i turn off my alarm, check my notifs, and see the message from the host. it’s been a few minutes and my boyfriend was awake at this time but not up. i asked him 2 questions in a very neutral tone: 

“do you know how long the bus ride is?” and “do you know approximately how often they leave?” 

he answered the first question normally, and when i asked the second question he immediately and sarcastically said “WELL, I GUESS IM GETTING UP NOW,” in a rude tone of voice and turned over and grabbed his phone aggressively. this irritated me as i have planned everything for this trip and asked very little, and we had just woken up so i didn’t appreciate being spoken to in this way. so i got up without saying anything and went to take a shower. 

when i got out of the shower, he approached me, asked what was wrong, and when i told him i didn’t like how he spoke to me, he said “well it was rude of you to wake me up so early asking me questions.” 

1). i didn’t wake him up, the alarm did, and i waited a few minutes. 2). we normally wake up at this time for work anyway, and 3). our trip is in 4 days and i needed to respond to the host. 

he has since doubled down and said multiple times that it was my fault, that i was being rude, that i “started it,” and that he didn’t do anything wrong and won’t apologize. he doesn’t like being woken up ever for any reason. the last time i woke him up was because tornado sirens were actively going off. after attempting 3x and him being increasingly rude every time, he finally got up, told me he didn’t care, and blamed me for annoying him.

i think that it’s reasonable to not want to talk first thing in the morning. however, given the circumstances, and the fact that i never do otherwise, i would have appreciated a simple “i don’t know, i’ll check later” rather than being snapped at and then blamed for it.

i almost never say anything to him or interact for the first 15-20 minutes of the day, but i did today. AITA? ",0.57
"AITA for spending my daughter’s allowance money?   
My husband (33M) and I (33F) have 5 kids, including a daughter, Allison (13F).  
  
Allison and a few of her friends had/have a crush on this boy in her grade, Connor (13M). Connor is a very popular boy in her school, and earlier this year, he started dating Lizzie (13F).   
  
Lizzie is autistic, she’s kind of quirky and mostly cares about art and crafts and is a pretty good artist. My daughter had issues with bullying Lizzie before she started dating Connor, which my husband and I grounded her after she bullied her a few years ago.  
  
A few weeks ago, a teacher called us to tell us that Allison and her friends were bullying Lizzie again, and telling Connor that he should break up with the “sperg”. My husband and I were infuriated and grounded her, she hasn’t been able to use her phone or go out, we’re also making her read resources from autism self advocacy groups.  
  
This past weekend was a sort of carnival/fair the school runs and all of the clubs, as well as some local businesses have booths.

I told the boy that my husband and I would love some bracelets and bought some for our kids.   
  
We told Lizzie that instead of getting her allowance money back from when she was grounded, she should consider that her allowance money being spent. She got mad at us and said being grounded was already punishment enough.  
  
Here’s where my husband and I think we may be assholes, we could see the boys smirking once we bought the bracelets and in school on Tuesday, one of the boys asked why she wasn’t wearing her bracelet and was telling other students what happened. He told Allison it was “karma” for bullying Lizzie. Lizzie is saying we’re a-holes and that she hates us. AITA?",0.42
"AITA for telling my wife she can't complain to me about being tired? We (both early 30sf) had a little girl about 9 months ago. As you may very well know, babies and sleep don't really mix. I feel like at this point I've only had one nights full sleep in over a year, and that's because my MIL came to town to help with the baby when I was very sick. 

My wife is the bread winner and I'm a SAHM. Typically on the weekdays she'll take over for bedtime and putting the baby down and I do all overnight and daytime care. Our baby hasn't slept through the night yet. We've gotten really close but then teething happened. 

My wife loves to complain about how tired she is and as someone who was up with the baby at 1am, 3am, and then up for the day at 5am I'm getting a little resentful. I asked her to stop complaining to me about being tired and she said that isn't fair and she has a right to be tired. I told her yes I know, and I agree she has the right to be tired. She works hard. BUT I currently am burnt out and do not have the emotional maturity to hear her complain about it without being resentful since she gets hours more sleep than I do. I asked her to please complain about it to a friend or someone else.  

It sucks because I feel like I do a lot of work to try to help her get as much sleep as possible. I've set up overnights for her so she's out of the house away from baby for a full night. She sleeps in on the weekends usually and I definitely help with bedtimes anytime I hear her getting frustrated.

"AITA for storming off when dad asked my aunt to take her device for me So I'm an artist and there is this device tablet thing I've been wanting for a very long time, which isn't even that expensive (≈300$), I'm in my third year at college, and I have my own money that I saved but I live with my parents.

My dad's sister has this exact device that she used to use 7+ years ago but it has been collecting dust for a couple of years now, I know for sure she doesn't need it nor want it, but I don't know whether it's working properly or not.

My dad suggested I take hers, I DONT WANT TO, he was like ""why spend the money when you don't have to?"" And we have a pretty good relationship with my aunt so it's okay.

But the thing is, if I have the money and can buy myself one, why would I take a used one from her? It's not like I'm in need or sth.. so I was telling my dad that, and he was silent and acted as if he got it now, but all of a sudden I heard my aunts voice? Dad ignored everything I said and called her and asked her to take it and she said okay. When he hung up he looked at me and said ""just see if it's working properly or not, if not then buy a new one"" it's not about its condition though? I said something like ""why would you force me"" and went to my room.


Am I being over dramatic or is my reaction understandable? I'm frustrated cuz why ask me all the questions when he set up his mind already to call her? Idk I just feel bad now but I'm not sure if I have the right to or not tbh

I do get my dad's and ya'lls point on why buy a new one immediately when I can try out my aunts tablet. And I already knew about my aunt's tablet and used it when I was in MIDDLE SCHOOL. It's this old. But it's not even about the condition of the device nor about the whole tablet thing. 

My problem is, if I was clear with my dad that I didn't want it, and I politely told him that I'd prefer buying a new one (with my money, never asked my dad to pay for it not expected it like some of yall assumed?), then why would my dad ignore my statements and called her still? I just felt unheard, and as if my dad is spoon feeding me still, I'm allowed to make the decision myself and to refuse the help if I don't need it.",0.3

"AITAH for being offended by my wife’s self deprivation? My wife has always been fit and small, I’ve always been on the heavier side. My wife and I have always told one another that we love each others bodies and are incredibly attracted to each other. Despite me not really liking my body prior to meeting my wife, the reassurance and encouragement changed that.

Her body has changed due to life events that has made it less toned and muscular/thin and more on the average side. She has been self critical since this change, almost weekly, and I always do my best to lend my reassurance and express my desire and love of her body despite what she’s feeling about it currently. Not just in a “I’ll take it even with flaws” but more of a “I love adore and cherish every bit of this body and lose my mind over how incredible it is”.

Today she was feeling self critical again and wanted to vent/lean on me about her body. As always I listened and made every attempt to reassure her and build her up. I told her I wish my words made any impact but that I understand it’s really difficult as I’ve struggled with this before.

She went on with examples of why she thinks her body is gross. One example was how she now has a little bit of a fat roll and had gotten a crumb underneath it after eating before realizing and immediately cleaning it. She sited this was incredibly gross and disgusting that she had fat rolls and that they’re so big that crumbs could get underneath.

Well, as a bigger person with these very same attributes she is describing, and I have been in a similar situation with the crumb example. So I expressed to her how I get that she’s feeling certain ways and I’m doing my best to reassure her but the example she’s used is one that’s happens to me and I have rolls, so that if she views those things as gross and disgusting it kind of feels like she’s calling me gross and disgusting.

She refused to see how they’re one and the same. I asked her why it was okay for me to have those scenarios and body type but that if she has it, viewed it as gross and disgusting? She told me it was because it was her now.

So I’ve tried to express to her how it hurts that she would call her body gross and disgusting because she perceives her fat rolls and that scenario as such, but expects me to believe that the same bodily attribute and scenario for my body isn’t?

Tl;dr : My wife has had body issues recently. I’ve always been a bigger person and she a smaller/thin person. I’ve reassured her and been consistently supportive about her depression around her body. She used an example to define why she thinks she’s gross and disgusting, but the example she’s used is something I’ve experienced and had for years. So I expressed how it’s not only hurtful but makes me doubt her liking my body this entire time.

"AITA for expecting my daughter to pay for activities I do with her children  Hi,
My daughter (27) has 3 children aged 8, 9 and 3. I have them every other Friday and Saturday to give her a break as she has bipolar so I want to support her the best I can.

I am 47, I also have young children myself aged 6, 11 and 13. I work full time as a nurse mon-fri. Still I struggle a lot financially as by the time my bills and mortgage are paid, I don’t have much left over.

The days that I have her children, I take them out. Cinema, swimming, activity parks, petting zoo, trampolining, arcade etc. I have recently started asking my daughter to pay for the activities for her children (not my expenses nor my other children) just for her children. For example if we went to the cinema, I asked her to purchase the tickets for her children and give me some money for popcorn, drinks etc for them. I never expect her to pay for myself or other children as that’s unreasonable. 

She has became very upset that I’ve asked her to do this as she says this is my duty as a grandmother, to take her children out for activities and not expect her to foot the bill.

She always brings up the fact that when her and oldest brother were young, they went to their nans (my mums) every weekend and their nan would always pay for their activities and go to extravagant places without asking me for a penny and she’d also take them on holidays at her own expense. Yes this is true, but my mum is and was very financially stable with a large disposable income which I do not have.

She feels that because of what her nan did for her, I should follow suit and act in the same way and not expect her to foot any expenses as I was never expected to. 

I feel differently as had my mum been struggling financially, I would have of course given her money to take her grandchildren out. But she never asked as she was never financially struggling.

Fast forward, I've got all my furniture put together and I got the couch/TV setup going. I bought some nice speakers I've been saving up for and wanted to test out some of my favourite bands. I listen to almost all genres but lean towards abrasive music. It can be techno hardcore metal, experimental jazz etc. Immediately after putting on some Lingua Ignota he loses his shit, telling me it's fucking trash, it's not real music and that i need to turn it off right now. I can't ""test the speakers"" with music that he doesn't like and he insists on putting on his ""test song"" which was Glitch Mob or some other dubsteppy band. I try to explain to him that I don't really listen to that band a lot and that I can't know if I like the speakers if I'm not listening to the stuff I always do. He calls me a woke idiot that listens to meme music and that nobody really enjoys this kind of music.

I lose my shit. I call him all the things. Homophobic, women hating, small minded fucking boomer that is so sensitive to other people's views that he has to shout his opinions so loud that people can't stand having a discussion with him, actually making him into the exact person he himself hates on. My dad cuts in, telling me I'm overreacting and that I have to respect his taste in music, especially since I listen to such ""aggressive noise"". I've never talked shit about other people's taste in music, knowing it's a very personal thing.

Anyway, they leave after ganging up on me and having a rant about me being young and woke and that society is to blame bla bla bla. Now they want an apology and my mom has joined them. I can't be in the wrong here, but now I'm unsure if I indeed should have respected him considering what my taste in music/pop culture is.

TL;DR i told my boomer brother that he's a small minded fuck for hating on my music while listening to it in my own home.

EDIT: I'm never using the word boomer again 😅",0.55
"AITA for telling my sister she can’t use my car for her abusive boyfriend  A little back story- my sister, her boyfriend, and two kids live with me. a few months ago before i got my own car i was using her car solely for work and school. On my way to work one night i accidentally hit a deer and totaled her car. Thankfully, she had insurance to cover everything. 

Fast forward a few months and i have my own car (i paid for & in my name), i have no problem with my sister using it for the things she needs to get done for her and her children. Fast forward again to Easter- her boyfriend completely destroyed our house (holes in the ceiling, walls, broken cabinets, stools, appliances, etc.). I kicked him out of my house, my sister told me that if i pressed charges she would move out and keep my nieces from me. So, against my better judgement, i didn’t. 

A few days ago i found out she had been lying to me about where she was taking my car, she has been going to see him and stay with him. I told her i didn’t want my car to be used for him and she said “i don’t care that you paid for it and it’s in your name. it’s my car too. i don’t have a car because of you”

Again, i have no problem with her using my car as long as it doesn’t involve the man who destroyed our house and abused her for years.

 AITAH? Should i let her do whatever she wants with my car, do i owe her that? ",0.23
"AITA for backing out of a cleaning job even though I already agreed to do it?  My buddy was renting his house out and the tenants ended up moving out. Him and me were talking today and he said that he’s gonna need someone to clean the place up and that is was pretty gross. I have this weekend off and told him I’d go over and clean. He said he’d give me $15/hr which I thought was pretty low but oh well. 

I check it out this morning and it’s worse than I had thought. I thought I was just going to be doing some tidying up.. but no. There’s already like 10 trash bags full of trash that the tenants just left. I asked my friend about this and he said I can take it to his dumpster, but I don’t have a truck and that stuff isn’t going into my car lol. 

The carpet needs to be deep cleaned with a rug doctor, some stains are almost 12 inch in diameter. There’s mold in the closet and behind the water heater. It smells like smoke and pretty sure there’s smoke stains on the ceiling. 

And there’s still a bunch of trash inside the house. 

I know at this point it feels like I’m complaining, but for $15 an hour I’ll pass. 

AITAH after backing out? I usually try to finish what I start. ",0.04
"WIBTA for reacting harshly to my bf’s desire to stay indefinitely with his ex while he starts a new job? TLDR: My bf wants to stay with his ex for an indefinite period of time (at least 2–3 weeks) while he sorts out his job situation in NY. That idea disturbs me so I‘m willing to inconvenience myself to allow him to stay with me and my parents for that period. Bf is lukewarm and just wants me to chill/not worry. Am I overreacting?

My (31M) boyfriend (27M) needs to move to New York at the end of the month for a new job. He hasn’t been able to sublet his apartment yet and can’t afford to pay rent on a second apartment, so he’s been looking for someplace to stay in NY while he gets started with his job.

I’ve been asking him where he plans to stay for the last few weeks but he has been coy saying ‘I don’t know’ until yesterday when he revealed he plans to stay with his ex with whom he has maintained a platonic and (in my opinion) seemingly healthy relationship since they broke up two years ago. In his telling, he has no other friends whom he’d be comfortable imposing on for an indefinite period of at least 2–3 weeks, and they all have roommates. I believe him. (His ex doesn’t have a roommate.)

Maintaining a friendly relationship with an ex doesn’t bother me – I text one of my exes about once a month to exchange pleasantries – but the idea of him staying with his ex makes me extremely uncomfortable. This partly has to do with the fact that when I first met him he almost cried when he described his regret about how the relationship with his ex ended, but I’m also just uncomfortable with this plan, period.

Fortunately my parents live outside NYC and my dad did the roughly hour long commute every day for > 20 years. I’ve proposed my bf stay with my parents and he said he would do it once I could join him at my parents’ house. That was going to be two weeks after he lands in NY, but I realized that I can come home earlier. I’d need to go back and forth, which is inconvenient, but it would remove his need to stay with his ex, which would be totally worth it for me.

He responded to my suggestion by saying no, I should focus on my work and shouldn’t go out of my way like that. He also suggested he might not be able to do his job properly if there wasn’t a spare monitor at my parent’s place for him to use with his computer. I know he knows how painful the idea of him staying with his ex is for me (I cried hard at the idea when he revealed it to me), so I’m having a hard time understanding what to do next. 

He feels unconcerned because he says he knows he won’t cheat on me with his ex and therefore there is nothing to worry about. I actually believe him, but the idea of him spending so much time with his ex and living at his apartment drives me crazy. There is more than enough room at my parents’ house, so to me it seems like if he‘s not willing to stay with me and my parents, I might need to cut off contact for that period he’s with his ex, and I’m not sure how that will impact our relationship. Am I overreacting?",0.16
"AITAH for speaking back at my  parents and ""disrespecting"" them. I(19f) grew up in strict family. My parents .....idk they are strict and controlling but sweet???at the same time. I am still confused. I am their first child and later they had my brother now age 11. Following are the things which tragically happened to me which made me socially awkward and question my life. 

1)Mom has severe ocd which she always projected on me and always scolds me whenever something goes out of place.
2) father has anger issues, used to yell at mom and mom always talked about death to me....I was like 6-7 at that time.
3) forbided from making male friends and certain ethenic people. 
4) always go by their time table or else locked outside the house.
5) can't speak back or disobey them.
6) always controls what I wear or eat
7) forced to take biology...but I worked my ass off to get into college.
8) my rank 3 or 4  in class  is like .....u are disgrace 
9) basic thing like face wash and shampoo ....lipbalm is forbidden....had to force them to buy me any.
9) I sleep walk every month....can't control that .....still get belittled and never taken to doctor.
10) almost  ""harmed""myself at night ......they told me it's all in my head and need to stop using phone and focus on studying.
11) issues between them .....projected towards me ...I become their personal listener, counseller, punching bag or what not.
12) tried to talk about my mental health and sleep walking issue ......told me it's not a big deal ...u r just weak and excuses.

List goes onnnn and onnn 

I am just tired of everything. Had rough day in clg ...came home and mood was off....they yelled at me saying I am not help and as a girl I need to learn how to handle work and household. Why me only ?...not my brother. Strict on me while my brother is allowed to do whatever he wants to do ?

I yelled at them .....I lost confidence and now being an adult don't know how to interact with other people, always overthink , can't go anywhere without having to fear what would happened at home afterwards. All my life I have been such a good girl to them and never get to enjoy my childhood.

They told me ...they also never get to ""enjoy childhood"" and now doing fine ....so I also have to adjust with it. I can't do that ...I can't  ruin my precious clg life ahead like that .

"AITA for refusing to do my job because of the time I was giving to do it? Apt-apartment
I (16m) have refused to do my job because I wasn’t given the time to do it and am now getting ridiculed for it. For context I work for my parents cleaning their apartments. I’ve worked for them for a few years now (2-3 years). They own 2 apartments (one large 2bed and one studio), check in time for the apartments is 4pm leave time is 11am.

Today I had the studio apartment the clean, my father came into my room around 9:20am to ask if the person coming could come early, I said “maybe 3pm but otherwise no” he immediately got visibly upset and we went back a forth a little, me saying “I can’t get laundry and everything done in that time” and him saying “your unreasonable, you should get it done at 2:30”. (I also have an event happening the next day that he is also going to that I have to get ready for) 

Once my father left he texted me and we went back and forth. Him telling me I had to get it done at 2 now and me saying I couldn’t do that because I was stressed and the laundry and other components literally could not get done in that time. Finally with my father telling me I’m immature and don’t have anything to stress over in my life, I took that very personally because I’ve gone through a lot of shit in my life and he knows everything that I deal with on a day to day basis, yet tells my I have nothing to stress over.
 I told my father he’s immature and rude, and to clean it himself if he’s going to give me that time limit.

A little later my mother called me saying that we both were in the wrong and saying that my father just cares a lot about how people see the apt. That people coming in early “means a lot to him”?

My father ended up cleaning the apt and was clearly annoyed at me. I get overwhelmed very easily and the event coming up puts a ton of stress on my shoulders already.

 I know this is a very biased opinion coming from a teenager at that, but I’m not sure if completely refusing to clean was wrong and if I should have just done it? I acted on emotion telling him he was immature and rude and I felt like a jerk, though what he said really got under my skin I shouldn’t have said anything back. AITA?",0.23
"WIBTA if I tell my friend that pretending to be depressed is weird? So I have a friend in school, she is kinda immature and usually wants to beat everyone at everything. Not too long ago I struggled with something depression-like, by which I mean that I was always sad and tired. I have also had an eating disorder and I have imposter syndrome. I once told my friend about my eating disorder, and she claimed to have one too. I know she eats regularly, and she always makes fat jokes about people (even around me! After I told her about my insecurities!). 

Lately, she has been talking about being depressed, and it is pretty much all she talks about. Whenever we try to have a normal conversation, she always just interrupts and talks about how depressed she is.

She kinda always wants us to talk about her problems, and it annoys me a lot. I have and is still going through some tough stuff, and it is so annoying listening to her faking this stuff. As I mentioned, she is immature, and she doesnt understand that much humor or serious topics that people may want to talk about. She doesnt have much going for her, so she kinda makes up stuff every month to make herself interesting.

"WIBTA if i moved out and stuck my room mate with the rent and only paid for my damages to the home? I am going to keep this short. I(F22) and my boyfriend (m22) have been living with 6 room mates for the past year. Our lease ends in July but I honestly don’t think I can make it that far. They refuse to clean up after themselves, we’ve gotten fucking maggots all in our kitchen and I HAVE TO CLEAN THIS WVERY TIME. I do not cook here, I go to my dads yet always find myself washing large pots and pans and cleaning up large containers of moldy food. One room mate left molded chicken in our fridge for so long it turned bright blue, when I mentioned it he slung it on the back patio in retaliation and his own dog ate it. They poured dog poop down our bathroom drain and onto all my soaps and rags.

"WIBTA for suing my friend for abandoning our phone bill for petty reasons? Hello everyone, first time poster; long time lurker.

So here’s a bit of backstory. One day I informed my now ex-friend (Let’s call him Andrew) that I was going to be canceling our family phone plan in two weeks time, asking him to please switch over his plan, devices (which he was still paying on), and accessories (Also was still paying on) to his own account to take responsibility for those finances.

He told me he would so I left it at that. After the two weeks I told him that it was the day and I hoped he did what he was supposed to. Well that flipped a switch inside of his psychotic brain where he sent a text saying “AFTER ALL THE TIMES I F****** HELPED YOU OUT, YOU CAN’T COVER THE COST THIS MONTH?! F*** YOU! I’M GOING TO CALL CPS ON YOU”

Well for one, I’m not financially stable. His portion of the bill that month was $300. The CPS comment bugged me but I shrugged it off as an empty threat. I’m a good dad, so I figured he was trying to just intimidate me. Well I let it go and attempt to explain it all to the phone company that he refuses to pay his bill and items. They inform me without him present they can’t set him up with an account or move them from my account.

Well the next day a couple of CPS agents show up saying they got a report of neglect. For those who don’t know or aren’t from the US, CPS is Child Protective Services. After he did that, I started thinking of how to get back at him as well as how to fix the financial issue he left me in. Both of his phones (2), his accessories (5), and his bill that he abandoned all equaled more than $6,000 USD. On top of that the stress of CPS being involved didn’t help. They finally after 4 months wrapped up the investigation.

So what I’m asking is… WIBTA if I took him to court and sued him for the money for the phone bill and punitive damages for the false CPS call? A few people in my life are telling me to drop it, but people like this never learn until they get a judgement against them.

"AITA For asking friends to split a vet bill?? Earlier this week, some friends John (51M) & Jill (40F)‘s flight home from vacation got delayed. They asked if myself (39F) and my partner, David,  (44M) could take their 2 dogs overnight since they were getting in at like 2AM. We said sure! John & Jill often watch our dog, who gets along great with their two. 

In addition to the dog, we also have a cat. When dogs have stayed over in the past, the cat has always stayed in the basement with food, water, her litter box. We have the dogs stay over before without issue.

This time, there was an issue. The cat got curious and wandered up from the basement. One of the B&R’s dogs cornered and attacked the cat. Scary AF! David texted John to tell him what happened and asked him to come get the dogs immediately. He did and said to let him know how much the vet ER visit would be. David took the cat to a Pet ER (I’m recovering from a broken ankle so driving is tough). Thankfully, the cat was only bruised and not really injured. The cost was $610 for visit & xrays. 

I didn’t hear from John friend at all the day of the attack but David did text him to say the cat wasn’t serious injured. The next morning, I sent John a text to say cat was doing okay and told him how much the bill was. I asked John if he would split the cost with us? I know John read the text message (read receipt) but hasn’t texted me back. It’s been over 24hrs. I’m really upset that a) John hasn’t check in on the health of the cat, b) said yes to splitting the bill.

I'm talking $200 extra she'd ask for 3 days before my normal due day on the 20th of each month. I told her we need to sit down and look at the bills together to split them equally so I'm not giving random increases in bills.

Now, last night I came home to find her kittens food in my cats dish. I give my mom $75 a month for my cats kidney prescribed by the vet food and the only reason she orders it is because of a deal with the shipping with litter.

"AITA for not giving a $20 refund I just had my first Marketplace sale go sideways and am wondering if IATA for refusing to give a $20 refund.

I bought a $30 platform dog bed on Amazon in anticipation of getting a dog. I had already been rethinking the amount of dog stuff I'd been buying because my apartment is small, so I was totally on the fence about the bed by the time I went to open it and put it together (it sat unopened for a couple weeks.) 

When I opened it up the night before the dog arrived to assemble it, I saw there were chips in one of the legs and took that as a sign, didn't explore/open up the bed any further and initiated a return. Long story short - Intelcom botched the return pickup TWICE (not surprising) so I decided to just sell the thing on Marketplace for $20. I was transparent about the chips on the leg in the posting and that I hadn't opened it up to use it. 

Someone agreed to buy it, I met them, opened the box for them to check it before handover of money - great, deal done. But then they messaged me the following day to say the bed canvas had tears in it (the pictures they sent look like it's been friction burned - pretty sure Amazon sent me a used/returned bed considering the chip marks like it's been chewed on - but the canvas isn't bad at all as far as I can tell) so I apologized right away because I genuinely had no idea it was like that. 

The buyer then messaged me again a couple hours later to express more discontent (it was the evening so I was doing other things and didn't look or reply) and then AGAIN the next morning requesting a refund and presenting options for getting them their $20 back.

Here is the part where I am not sure if IATA - I was totally willing to give back the $20 and not take the bed back, but hadn't said as much to them yet because I was busy in the evening. I don't want the item back, I feel bad it wasn't what they expected and I wasn't trying to pull a fast one with this sale, I just hadn't checked the condition in full - totally my bad. 

But in their 2nd message, demanding a refund, they told me my options were to drive \~2 hours round trip (and they know the distance for me bc of where we met) and give them their $20 + get the bed, OR they would mail it to me at my cost and I could send the amount of the shipping + the $20 they paid, so literally go into the hole to give them $20...

He said that he wanted me to be present there. I laughed and asked why, and he said ""She's your niece. Don't let what she said earlier prevent you from coming, she's your sister.""  
  
I replied by saying ""No, she's not my sister, and I don't want to do anything with any of you. Go fuck off, and ask her to get fucked as well.""

"AITA for not wanting to play with my brother anymore? He basically rages at video games frequently, screaming, throwing controllers, stuff like that. He claims it's only with games I have him play buy I hear him scream and rage at games he plays too, to a lesser extent.

 He calls a game BS and poorly balanced/made when its usually a skill issue on his end, and refuses to listen when I try to explain. It's just toxic and I don't think I can put up with it anymore, especially with how he can yell at me for trying to help, even if some of the things I suggest he already figured it turns out.

 He also yells at me for asking on the day he promises to play when we can do it, and when I try later, because he did still promise, he often pushes it off to another day or just yells at me again and ends up forgetting about it because i figure ""should just wait for him to be ready"". I ask about every week or 2 if we can play, and well, I just want to spend time with him and he enjoys it too. I get he has other stuff going on much of the time, but it's like he gets pissed no matter how hard I try to find an appropriate time to ask usually.

 He's 17 BTW and I'm 21, and me and my mom have been working on finding a job/getting a proper adult life set up for quite a while, it's just difficult with transportation/time issues, so it's not like I'm obsessing over him or nagging him, he wants to spend time with me too, supposedly.

"AITAH for calling my bfs mom a bitch. I 24f have been with my bf (27m) for 3 years. 
We get along fine, but I have issues with his mother. She wants me to baby him.

She wants me to do his laundry, cook, clean. 
I already do these things, but I don’t want her to tell me what to do. 

When she comes over,  she feeds him food, literally like a child. 

She decorates the house like her style. 

When he buys me  things she asks for the same exact kind too
She makes everything all about herself. 
She even asks him to massage her feet, makes comments about how she’s the first woman in his life. 

Every day she tells me how I’m so lucky to be with her son etc. 

So yesterday I got irritated when she asked my bf to buy her something expensive, so I said why don’t you have your husband buying things? She didn’t like that so we were arguing where I ended up calling her a bitch. 
 think it was because I was PMSing, but I called her a bitch. My bf got so hurt he said he’ll never be with a girl that calls his mother a bitch. So do u guys think I’m an asshole?

"AITA? My boyfriend moved in and his cat is destroying my house and my mental state PTSD isn’t an excuse, but it’s something I deal with as a veteran. Certain situations I can’t control and repetitive noises can make me very irritable and angry. 


My boyfriend moved in over 3 months ago. His cat’s behavior has been an issue from the start. 
During the night he goes into the kitchen looking for food. He tears apart anything on the counter, even if it’s not food. He knocks things off of my shelves, chews up plastic bags. My roommate’s door js basically in the kitchen (nyc apartments) and he can hear the cat at night. Every morning when my boyfriend leaves, the cat scratches at the door and meows loudly for about an hour. It sounds like someone is trying to break in because the door is loose. Tried a gate, he jumps it or scratches at/yowls at the gate.  After that, he usually chills until about noon at which time he starts to be extremely vocal for food. 


When I met my boyfriend, the cat was extremely overweight. With my guidance (and purchasing a measuring cup) I helped him get the cat down to a pretty good weight before he moved in. The only behavior issue I was aware of before him moving here was the scratching at the door, as well as the attention seeking for food. 

After my boyfriend moved in, I was helping him clean out his room at his old apartment. I found cat feces everywhere. This made me aware that the cat also selectively uses the litter box. 

So not only am I dealing with the meowing/scratching of the door/gate every morning, a roommate who is angry, picking up cat feces off of the floor, trying to block out his meowing as much as possible (for hours at a time) I’m also trying to deal with not directing this anger towards my boyfriend. 

I’ve asked my boyfriend to get a trainer, to come up with literally any solutions. He hasn’t. The cat is 14 and probably set in his ways is my guess. We fight about stupid things because I’m already in a very bad/irritable mood because of his cat. I’ve yelled at him recently when we fight, when I never yell at anyone. My boyfriend has no one, his parents have passed away and he doesn’t talk to any of his family. This cat seems like the most family he has other than longtime friends. I love him and we had a good relationship up until his cat moved in. 


Do we break up? 
Do I ask him to get rid of the cat? 
Am I the asshole? (Im really okay with it if I am, give it to me straight) ",0.64

My job entails me traveling on the road multiple times in the week and so I gave her access to my paypal in case she needed money but she took complete advantage and would take it without asking me. I know it was stupid of me and partly my fault. I decided to break up with her last weekend. I just couldn't take it anymore. Even after I broke up with her she sent herself $50 from my paypal.  I have since changed passwords on everything. On top of the money issue she was also very controlling and jealous when it came to me talking to anyone, she would give me issues when I was working, If we were on the phone she'd think I'm fliritng with a co-worker,  Our names are on the lease of the apartment which ends in May I think.

"AITA for not wanting to work with someone because of their insecurity  I’m 20F. I do photography and makeup as a hobby, I like doing editorial photography and I am selective about the friends i ask to model for me. Me and my other friend, Sam often take “shoots” together, I enjoy working with her because she is gorgeous, taller, and experimental so I feel like I can execute my ideas better with her as my model. 

Recently me and Sam had a really nice photo set taken at the library and Sam posted it to her socials. One of the mutuals we have, Mia, texted me linking the photos asking if we can do a set of pictures for her birthday and how fun it would be. I am not close to Mia, she is part of our larger friend group, and i was hesitant because she doesn’t have the exact aesthetic i prefer, but i do like to experiment so I told her we can brainstorm some ideas on what to do and I’ll see if i can work with it. I like to have input from the people modeling on what they want to do, but when she showed me her “inspiration” pictures, it was bland. It was the same as most instagram influencer pictures, neutral colors and not anything really interesting. I suggested some more creative poses, outfits, and makeup looks, but she preferred the minimalist style which is fine, its her birthday shoot and her style.

Yesterday I picked her up and we went to the park for the shoot. I must’ve taken hundreds of pictures over the span of 2 hours, Mia was hard to work with though. She kept on standing stiffly, refusing to pose, and didn’t want to walk around the park to find other areas. The pictures did end up nice, it was the vibe she envisioned, but went she looked through it she deleted most of the pictures because she nitpicked every flaw in herself. It was tiring and we spent 2 hours only to get 5ish pictures she liked. She looked stressed, I tried to comfort her and told her she did look good in most the pictures and didn’t need to nitpick herself and her appearance. She seemed over it though and told me that she looks awful in most of them (ouch) and kept on comparing my pictures of her to my friend in a passive aggressive manner. I gave up and told her I can’t do the same with her because she is insecure and refuses to experiment with her style, a lot of models have “unconventional” features, they enhance and compliment them rather than hide them. She took this as an insult to her style and appearance so told me she going to have someone pick her up instead, later texting me im narcissistic for saying she wasn’t good enough.

"AITA for having my baby shower on Mother's Day Weekend? I am pregnant and due at the end of the summer. This is our first and we are excited to welcome Gloria Violet.

I planned my baby shower with my mom, and we decided the best day is May 11. Which we realize is the day before Mother's Day, but it is what it is.

But my sister is saying that it's ridiculous to usurp Mother's Day with a baby shower. She's saying she would have to fly in fly back the day she flies in, or on Mother's Day, or bring her kid to celebrate on Mother's Day then fly out Monday.

"AITA for leaving my friends? For the sake of this story I’ll be using different names for the people in this. 

Last night I had to cut ties with my old friends. They’ve been horrible the last few years. To start this let’s go back to day one, my friend Nora and I have been friends since 6th grade we would do so much together like draw, play games, hang out, even have sleepovers. We were literally the best of friends. Then in 7th grade I had another friend named Sarah, she did not like Nora at all. Over the years Sarah would try to get me and Nora to split by blocking her on all of my social medias when she had access to my phone or whatever and more. There was just so much wrong with that friendship but we ended that friendship a few years ago. In April of 2022 I got into a relationship with my boyfriend Tyler he’s the best. Nora really didn’t like tyler but sorta put up with him because he’s my boyfriend. Fast forward to July Nora gets into a relationship with Connor. Connor is cool he’s a nice friend. 
Sometimes I’d hang out with Nora and Connor but they really didn’t like me talking about Tyler. 
Last night April 11th I went to the mall with Tyler and I took a nap when I got back. He was talking to my friends and my friends kept bringing up stuff like my past relationships and old friends that I haven’t talked to or seen in months. They convinced Tyler I was cheating on him with one of my old friends. It took me so long to get him to believe me that I wasn’t cheating. It really hurt me that they would lie like that and try to sabotage my relationship. It hurt even worse that my boyfriend believed that I’d even do that. I blocked them on everything after calling them out for that stuff and stuff they’ve done in the past.

"AITA for not going to my own birthday party (that I didn't plan)? I just turned 40. I don't care about my birthdays (I do care very much about others'). I'm also working a new very difficult supervisorial position in wildfire mitigation that will turn into wildfire management in a month (I live in a wildfire prone area as you can guess) and I have a staff of 10. I have a lot of work to do. I'm constantly tired, feeling worn down, and one of my dogs is very old so I unfortunately deal with a lot of doggie accidents and health issues. It's April and I've already had it up to here with this year. A couple of my friends asked me what I wanted to do for my \~special 40th\~ and I was like, crawl into bed for a week and softy cry to Taylor Swift and watch sci fi shows? I said that I do NOT have it in me to socialize and that was my only answer on the group chat about the topic.

I in NO WAY indicated that I wanted anyone to ""take care"" of my birthday for me. I thought I was pretty clear on the obvious, I'd kinda just like to be left alone this year.

The weekend before my birthday a friend asked if I wanted to go to the park, which happens to be a nearby dog friendly park so we could bring our dogs and just chill. I thought that was a nice and relaxing break from wanting to just lay face down on my floor so I agreed and said I'd bring sandwiches from our favorite local deli. She said ""oh no need, I got it taken care of"" and I thought that was weird but brushed it off.

When I walked up to the park, I saw that there was a group of people in a neatly arranged picnic. I recognized those people. They are my people. I did not have the social battery to entertain them, so I didn't. I just turned around and walked back home. I got a text from my friend because I didn't show up on time (I'm known for being punctual) and I replied to the whole group chat saying that I mentioned that I am not up for anything, and I can't do it, and I hope they enjoy their picnic. It's been two week and I think they started a new group text because we never go more than 2 hours without someone sending something, and it's been total silence. Finally I reached out to my best friend who organized it, and she said that I ""hurt everyone's feelings by not showing up"" (aka not accepting a forced social situation I said I didn't want).

"AITA for yelling at my bf to help me keep the house clean?  I (22F) live with my boyfriend(31m) and his two kids (7m and 10m). Recently he had back surgery so he’s currently not working and has to stay home and recover. For the first 2 weeks I’ve been handling all the house work, the kids, and whatever else needed to be done on top of caring for him. During this time I’ve also been working almost 9-7 every day. He’s been doing much better and can now walk and move around more. Since I work 9-7 I figured I could rely on him to simply manage the kids to make sure they clean up after themselves. He doesn’t have to lift a finger or do anything because I understand that he’s still recovering. Just help me Manage the kids is all. I’ve also expressed to him in the past that having a messy house does overwhelm me and it does make me feel a way because no one else cleans the house and after working all day I don’t want to also have to clean up. 

Today I came home and I saw the dishes were starting to rust and the sink was overflowing with them. The kids had some of their stuff in the living room, dirty socks/shoes in the kitchen, their trash from breakfast still on the table, and their clothes in my room with their blanket. And my boyfriend was on his game🙄. I started to rage clean and started telling my boyfriend off and to help me with the kids and it shouldn’t just be me always telling them to clean.

"WIBTA for ditching my husband on vacation? My (33F) husband (36M) and I are on vacation in a foreign country. I did all of the legwork for planning the vacation, including researching and choosing only activities that my husband can participate in (he has some physical limitations). I have tried to involve him in the planning but he has shown little interest in having an active role - which is fine. We both work, have equal salaries, and the vacation is jointly paid for. 

Today we were crossing a land border from one country to another. I am on my period, which is extremely and unusually heavy due to a recent cycle of IVF. While at the exit checkpoint of country A, I realized I was beginning to bleed through my pants and told him. He seemed unconcerned and said that he also had to use the bathroom. There were no public facilities at country A checkpoint. While entering country B, we had to get out of the car and wait in line in a crowded public room. At this point I could feel fluid running down my leg (sorry, this is gross, but I’m trying to explain why I was beginning to panic). Because we had never been to this country, we had no idea what was required so I brought everything in with us - passports, all car documents, etc. My husband remained engrossed in his phone and then randomly asked me “do we need the car registration?” I DID snap at him, and then told him I was beginning to bleed through my pants. He said “that’s not my problem” and went back to his phone. As soon as we got our passports stamped, the customs official pointed us toward the car registration line. I gave my husband all the car documents and told him I had to go beg for bathroom access so I could handle my situation (my loose, dark colored pants would only cover for so long).

While I was in the bathroom doing damage control, he called me and said that they would not process the car without me there because it was in my name, and called me an idiot for not knowing this/leaving him alone. Later, in the car, he doubled down and said that it wasn’t his responsibility to care about “my bodily fluids.”

"AITA for kicking an actress off our play and being the cause of an almost ruined performance? I (30F) am a part of an amateur theater production. We have recently separated from our 2 previous directors for many not related reasons, but most of us left very traumatized after the experience. 

When we separated we established a notion of our production being a very democratic and open space for anyone. We decided to rotate directors and staff roles, we wanted everyone to express their opinions and feel welcome in our midst. On paper this sounds like a paradise production, right?

Well, for our first independent show I took the role of a director for half of the show. Everything was going on smoothly - except for one dance number. 

It required 2 female performers, 2 male performers and a soloist. No matter how many rehearsals came and went - the number was incredibly rough, the actors could not memorize their lines and places on the stage. This was especially the case for one female performer, Mary (45). Mary was constantly on the phone instead of practicing with other actors, questioned every director decision that I made and refused to come to the final dress rehearsal due to ""being busy up until the performance day"". Her last rehearsal two weeks before the show ended with her leaving early, because she forgot that she had a job that night. 

Us being amateurs would explain (and excuse) a lot of things. However this season we started to actually sell tickets for our performance for a considerable price.

For the remainder of the rehearsal that night I stood in for Mary. And miraculously our last ran was amazing - me being on the stage gave other actors a confidence boost, I guess. 

So me, the soloist and another organizer sat down to discuss our further steps. We were either removing the number altogether, having more rehearsals or replacing Mary with me. We came to Mary and asked, if she could find at least one day in which she could come and practice. She refused, saying that she is extremely busy.

This is where I might be an AH: despite our democracy, I suggested Mary to vacate the number and focus on the other numbers she had (she had 3 more). Not ordered, mind you, still insisting on more rehearsals being sufficient. I was not a fan of the removal, plus I didn't want it to look like I was removing an actor in favor of me personally being in the spotlight. But it was either that or nothing at all. 

Mary blew up. She accused me of not being able to plan rehearsals and being an atrocious director. She was generous enough to agree performing in other numbers, but refused to work with me any further.

So the performance day came - and Mary didn't show up. At all. She ignored all our calls and we ended up having someone to replace her in all her numbers. The only message she sent: ""This is because of OP"".

A lot of crew are now blaming me for creating a conflict which resulted in the whole performance being jeopardized. They say I should have accommodated Mary more, and kicking her off the number was not a democratic solution. AITA?",0.72
"AITA for trying to get my BF to quit vaping? My (21F) boyfriend (26M) vapes. He’s been doing it for years before he met me. I expressed my disapproval in his vaping before we started dating, and he had told me he was actually planning on quitting. He said he’s done it before and that it was time for him to do it again. 

Now, 7 months later, he still vapes and shows no sign of quitting. I will be honest, I kind of nag him about it. He barely eats because of it, he has vape breath, and he’s very reliant on it. I keep trying to express how bad it is for his health but he doesn’t listen. He just gets defensive at this point and says it could be much worse and he could be doing hard drugs. I don’t think that can be used to justify his bad habit. He now also says that he’s tried to quit before and it’s never worked. So I don’t know if what he said before about quitting was true.

I’m trying to do all I can to encourage him but I’m worried I’m taking the wrong approach and coming off as an asshole. I understand it’s his body and he makes decisions for himself, but he sees no issue with it and I’m worried about him. Am I coming off wrong? I don’t want to give him an ultimatum but it’s making me uncomfortable and frustrated. I definitely need some outside perspective here.

"WIBTA for disinviting my brother from my wedding? I (26F) have been recently engaged to my boyfriend of 4 years (27M), and we are in the planning stage of our wedding. We have decided to keep our wedding small, just immediate family and close friends as my fiancée is in medical school.

My brother, (22M) is your stereotypical youngest child, and was spoiled from day one. Things such as, getting away with things I would be punished for, a new car at 16, etc. I don't have many issues with him, except for the fact that he is very rude to my fiancée, who is a first-generation college student and comes from an immigrant family. (For context, I grew up in an upper-middle class suburb)

This is where the issues begin, my brother seems to always find issue with my fiancée, such as the fact that he didn't have enough money, and that he got me a ""small ring"" which no one finds issue with except him. My fiancée decided to be a bigger person, as I told him how meaningful it would be if my brother would be in the wedding party, as a groomsman. My brother, instead of being thankful for this meaningful gesture, reluctantly obliged at the persistence of my mother, and father. 

My husband doesn't want to accept any help from my parents, which is why we are keeping the wedding small, which is what both him and I want, as we want to keep it intimate for us, (under 50 people) and my mother, offered to make my wedding dress, which keeps the budget down. Our wedding is set in about 6 months, and my brother continues to create issues with the rest of the wedding party, saying things like ""If this were my wedding, I'd have..."" or ""Why does your tux look like that"" or when my husband told him we weren't doing a cake, he laughed in his face and said ""I guess someone is a cheapskate"" although we made it clear that it was my idea to have cupcakes.

This was about 2 weeks ago, and yesterday we had another talk about more preparations at my house, such as tables, etc. This is where my brother begins to basically throw a tantrum because he isn't close enough to his friends table, which he made my husband invite, as we decided to have him closer to my parents and future in-laws, and he began to make more comments about our wedding. He even said ""I bet you she (me) wont enjoy this cheap wedding"" while laughing to my husband. Before this, I was unaware of what he said to him, as my husband didn't want me to have to hear it, but this time I was about 10 feet away talking to my mother. At first, I thought he was joking, as I couldn't believe my brother would say something that harsh to someone who has been so accommodating to him, until I heard, ""I give this marriage 2 years at most until she realizes she wants someone... more."" When I heard that I couldn't believe it, I told my brother to leave then and he did, with retaliation. I talked to my mother and husband and they both think he should stay in the party, but I don't want my husband to have these foul memories of our wedding.

So WIBTA if I kicked him out of my wedding?",0.16
"AITA for not going to my sister’s graduation party? My (27/f) sister (29/f) and I have always been pretty close up until about 2 years ago when we got into an argument regarding my relationship. My family has never liked my boyfriend or the fact that we have been pretty “off and on” for the past almost 10 years. I will admit that in our younger years we were pretty immature but have since grown up a lot and have been going steady for the past 2 years. 

The argument my sister and I had 2 years ago was related my boyfriend and I getting back together. Ultimately, while it was about my relationship, it also felt like a lifetime of issues coming to the surface. She said some really hurtful things about me and some pretty nasty things about my boyfriend in the name of her version of “tough love.” She also drew her boundary that she would no longer engage with my boyfriend and our relationship and would not be waiting around to see if he’d truly changed this time around (he genuinely has).  I also drew my boundary that I would not allow her to disrespect me and my relationship, especially since we are serious now and will likely be getting married in the future.

Since then my sister and I haven’t spoken one on one or spent alone time together, only at group family functions where it’s very surface level. She recently matched into a residency and is about to officially graduate in the coming weeks, so due to scheduling, my family went ahead and scheduled a graduation celebration for her earlier today so that some out of town family would be able to attend. I was invited, however I chose not to go due to the boundaries we’d both drawn. 

Here’s where I think I may be the asshole. Our mom and brothers essentially begged me to come throughout the event over text, but I didn’t change my mind and chose not to attend. I will say, if my sister herself had asked for me to come, I would’ve come but she didn’t. After the event was over, our mom sent me a very long text telling me how disappointed she was in me for not coming, and I got several other texts from other family members saying that I should’ve come. Our younger brother straight up called me an asshole and accused me of making her day about me although that wasn’t the intention. Now I’m wondering if I really was an asshole here for not showing up.",0.96
"AITA for telling my mom “ don’t tell me what to do “ because she is controlling I’m 21, still live with my parents so supposedly I live by their rules. My mom has always been quite controlling and likes to baby the hell out of me since I got some health issues and therefore I’m dependent on her.

This morning I woke up early and was watching tv, around 10 minutes later, My mom came to the living room and I told her that I had a terrible night because I had a lot of back pain and therefore couldn’t sleep, she told me go to sleep : “go back to bed now. “ But she said it in a very controlling and passive-aggressive way. She kept saying it for like 6 times. I know people would probably assume she says it out of care cause she wants me to get enough rest, but I’m 21 and I get to decide when I go to sleep and when I don’t. I simply told her “ don’t tell me what to do “. After I told her that, she looked at me in a sad way and  gave me the silent treatment for the entire day.

"AITA For Not Wanting A 2nd Desk In Our Home Office?  For context: My boyfriend (26M) and I (29F) are looking at moving into a 2 bedroom apartment. I am hybrid wfh 3 days/week and just wfh on my laptop. He works in hospitality and therefore not someone who does wfh. However he has an office desk and computer that he uses for gaming and his side hustle. I’m excited for a 2 bedroom apartment that will allow us to utilize the second bedroom as an office, and provide me a quiet space to take client calls and meetings when I wfh. 

The situation: While discussing how we were going to use the office space, he told he doesn’t want me using his office desk and that I would have to purchase my own desk to put in the office, so we would have 2 separate desks in the home office. I explained to him that it would make more sense if we just shared the one desk, because 1) I would be using my own laptop to hook up to the monitor, not his computer, and 2) We are on opposite schedules and are never working / gaming at the same time anyways. He disagreed with my suggestion and told me I’m not willing to compromise, however I don’t see how making me buy a whole other desk and not being willing to share is a compromise either. I offered the following compromises: 

1. I will purchase my own keyboard and mouse, if me using his gaming keyboard and mouse are a concern. 
2. If there are any instances where our schedules conflict and he wants to use his desk/computer, I have a laptop and would be willing to relocate to the dining table or couch

"AITA i want my baby to have my last name Hi everybody, i am 26f with a 31m partner of 8 years going on 9! We are a very healthy couple for the most part and do not fight frequently.. normally i come on reddit to read other experiences but this time i decided i wanted to post for the first time .. in these eight years of dating i have always been hesitant to have children with him because of a few reasons, one of the main reasons is that my mother and grandmother both had a disease that will be 50/50 chance of me or my child getting it, it is a very rare disease called familial ALS, the pain i endured after her loss was something i would never want to put a child through and knowing that i am having a child anyway sometimes makes me feel like a horrible person but I've recently adapted the mindset that i too have to live my life and make the best of it, after all i am still healthy and i am 26 ! 

I also lost my father when i was 6 years old i don't remember him too much but i am left with no real family of my own. My partner has been a very supportive person to me and i actually moved in with him before we officially started dating, I've always had a big crush on him prior to me moving in so it just kind of worked out, we have a cute love story of how we met and so on... However during this relationship he has made plenty of comments about how bad he wants a kid and he was VERY persistent with these comments, he would tell me ""his clock was ticking"" although he knew and i knew that men don't really expire.... women do. I expressed to him that i would like to be married before kids and he explained to me that he doesn't want to get married because ""marriage scares him"" ..... as if having a child didn't scare me ??? I kept holding my ground, holding my ground, until one day i decided to finally compromise with him because i love him. I feel a lot of our relationship was me compromising with him and not a lot of the same for me, I am really good women, i mind my own , i allow him to do whatever he pleases , i own my own business and i do not ask or use him for money. He is well off and i told him countless times that i would be more than happy to sign a prenup . 

After expressing to him that i would be more than happy to sign a prenup he still says ""well i don't want to get married because marriage scares me and my family sucks"" Its just a piece of paper anyway.  I decided in my heart that i would like our newborn to carry mine and my fathers last name in order to honor my deceased family, i also don't want to explain to my kid that i don't have the same last name as him/her and their father because their father wouldn't commit to me or compromise.. I feel like i don't want to feel like the outcast with the only different last name in our family and if my partner truly want's our kid to have his last name he should be willing to share it with me as well.

"AITA for telling my mom “I’m not 5 anymore” after receiving a present? For context: I come from a poor family so we live in a 2 bedroom apartment. My parents are also split but my mom needs a house right now so she’s living with my dad, sister, and me. She’s been in and out of me and my sisters life since I was 5.

Yesterday, my mom called me down to the kitchen so she could give me something. She hadn’t started cooking yet so I was excited since I rarely get gifts on any day that isn’t a holiday. She handed me a book which I think was titled “If you Give a Mouse a Cookie”. I hadn’t had seen nor read this book since I was 5 so I was kinda confused since my reading level is more advanced then something with a maximum of 2 sentences a page.

I thanked my mom for the present and made a sarcastic remark about the present about how I’m not 5. She stared at me for a moment and then looked away. It appeared like she was zoning out or something. I realized that might’ve been rude so I tried to make up for it by telling my mom I liked and appreciated the present but the damage had been done.

She silently went back to her bed and made dinner about an hour later.

The book is on my floor right now and I just received a text message from my dad telling me about how he hears mom talking to herself and thinks she’s mental.

I feel like I am part of the cause of her mental health deteriorating.

"AITA for claiming my mothers dog after she left the dog to die outside? I (24N) woke up to my mother (57F) telling my sister (27F) her dog (6month? F) was dead after she got hit by a car. For reading purposes my mother will be Becky, my sister will be Midna, and the dog will be Link.

 About 20 minutes after I woke up Becky wants to go to the store and needed to bring me, but before we left she went to look at what I expected to be a dead dog, I followed and saw that said dog was still moving, my mother had put a blanket on the Link, and she moved out from under the blanket and laid down in a different spot, seeing that the dog was in fact ALIVE, and just in pain I was furious and asked Becky why she said Link was dead, to which she responded ""Don't worry about it, she had blood in her mouth."" 

  
I thought perhaps Link was actually dying, but when we got back from the store I found out that the dog had been hit more than an hour prior (when the vet was open) to when I woke up to hearing Becky tell my Midna ""My dog just died!"" (which evidently was her trying to guilt my Midna into going to the store with her), 

I went out and I checked the dog shortly after we got back (I have very minimal medical experience but I still know a little bit) Link was exhausted and in pain, but no broken bones, and it looked like she had bitten her tongue (likely where the blood came from).

  
I immediately grabbed one of my warmer hoodies and brought Link inside where it's warm instead of continuing to leave her in the mud and grass, I called a friend that worked at the vet and he told me to see if I can get her to stand and keep water in her (help her drink) but make sure she doesn't just lie there because then she'd just try to let herself die, after trying to get her to stand to no avail, I elected to give her a bath, whilst cleaning mud off her belly Link groaned in pain and then I heard a gurgling, and I elected to take her into the vet.

  
At that point it'd been about 3-4 hours since she was hit, I decided if Link survived this I would take ownership, as before today Becky wasn't properly taking care of her anyhow, and decided right away the dog was dead even though she was able to run behind the house after being hit, and the dog was still alive and moving, had she woken me up when it happened to go I would have been fine with footing the bill.

  
The vet gave Link meds to deal with shock and said her breath and heart rate were better, so it seems like she'll make it but there's no guarantee, and then while the vet and Midna were talking, I had an argument with my mother over text about me taking and renaming her dog and how ""I just wanted the dog from the start"" (I didn't want a dog).

AITA For trying to discredit my roommate’s spiritual abilities? My room went off on this wild tangent today that she’s got spiritual powers that allow her to see people’s emotions and tell if there’s bad energy. I’ve known her for 15 plus years.

"AITA for falling in love with my girlfriend’s best friend? I met Ivy in a class that I shared with Liz. I talked to Liz and had a little bit of a crush on her(no one knew) but Ivy broke up with her bf, and we quickly got into a relationship. By now we’re both friends with Liz. Our relationship started out great, we talked a lot, we flirted, we went out. I even ended up confessing my love for her which I never did before. And we both helped other with hard situations. But things slowly started going downhill when she started talking to her guy friends more. Now normally, I wouldn’t have a problem with this, we’ve both been cheated on in our past relationships but I understand that there needs to be trust. But, almost all of her friends had crushes on her and I’m not entirely comfortable with that fact. So I brought it up and she told me I was being insecure about it. This went on for a while with different guys coming to now when i’ve just given up trying to change it. But despite me getting over it, she still gets upset at me to the point of exhaustion. “You’re not touching me enough!” “You’re not giving me enough attention!” “You’re being annoying go away!” It's really frustrating but  learned to deal with it. We gotinto several arguments that almost led her to break up with me. And recently she’s said that she’s thought about it more. But I still love her and I care about her. And I’m indebted to her bc she helped me at a point where I was really low and brought me up to where I am. But then Ivy asks to hang out with this guy that I especially don’t like, and says that she wants to go hiking with him and her other best friend. And I realize that I’m so numb to this idea of her hanging out with her guy friends that I don’t even really care much I just got annoyed. Now comes Liz, we started hanging out with her, me and Ivy. And I realized that we have a similar sense of humor and personality. I start talking to her a little bit more, and we really hit it off. And to be clear, I think that Liz’s pretty, so do what you want with that. I got to a point where Ivy and I took pictures for graduation. But I ended up talking to Liz the entire time. I was glad that I got to hang out with my girlfriend and that I’m making a new really good friend. But Ivy noticed. And then Ivy went to sleep early so i talked to Liz until 2am. I haven’t at this point really noticed anything off with our conversations, they’re just really fun. And then again today I was talking to Liz again, in person this time. My girlfriend noticed and assumed that we were flirting. I didn’t think about it that way but I did enjoy talking to her. She confronts me about this tonight after I’m off of work and gets super angry. I deny that I flirted with her but looking back I might have. I feel myself falling for Liz.

"AITA for being on acid at a funeral? It was my uncles funeral yesterday, I (16M) didn’t wanna go because he was a cunt specifically a cunt to me, I don’t think i’m allowed to go into more detail. My parents understood but they told me I had to go because he’s still family even if he’s a shit person. I didn’t wanna go sit in a church with people saying how good he was and pretending that he wasn’t a bad person and not be high so I took a bit of acid before I went. I didn’t disrupt the funeral I was just staring at the ceiling the whole time because there was like these tiles on the ceiling and look at them whilst on acid is crazy. 10/10 experience. I think my parents figured out what was happening after my mom gave up on making me pay attention the actually funeral. I think I was very noticeably tripping and after embarrassing my parents by acting weird in front of a relative at the wake my dad drove me home. He yelled at me for being stupid and disrespecting his brother. I didn’t yell back I just stared at him which made him way more angry then he left and went back to the wake. 

I only saw them again in the morning because I think I was asleep when they got home. My mom told me that she understands that the funeral was gonna be hard for me but there’s no excuse for getting high. My dad won’t look at me, he said I’m an embarrassment.

"AITA for leaving her at a party?  My friend (Alice) talked to her therapist about me because I left her at a party.

Alice and I were in the same high school but we weren’t so close. After high school we’d meet one or two times a year for a mutual’s event or her event. She would only talk to me when she’d invite me to her birthday parties. She doesn’t even know my birthday.

Long story short, a mutual of ours (a guy call him Mike) and I made out on her birthday. He came on to me and he was very PDA about it so how could I ever think that her and him had a thing? The next week Mike had an event and we both went. I liked him so when we made out again I wasn’t mad about it. In the same party, a guy I was seeing in the past (Jake) was very clingy and I didn’t want Mike to think that Jake and I were together so when Mike asked if we could go someplace else ( same building but another house where his close family and friends were) I agreed. This house was much quieter and my social battery had run out.

Alice had other friends there that she was close to but I didn’t. Her, Jake and Mike were the only people I knew. She called me once or twice during the night but my phone was silent and there was alcohol involved so I didn’t check my phone till morning. She had left when I woke up.

Next day she calls me and we talk for an hour telling me how I left her for d**k (we didn’t even have sex) and that she liked him. I didn’t know that they had a thing. I tell her I will not engage with Mike anymore because she felt this way. My friend has a history of depression and was on antidepressants at the time.

So AITA?


Edit: I mentioned the mental health part because she told me that the incident made her depression worse and that’s why she talked to her therapist about it. She told me she had considered me a good friend of hers and that why she would invite me to her birthday parties even though not many people would go i always went.

"WIBTA if I kick my adult family out of the house?  My Mom passed away in May of 2023. Since then, I have invested a lot of money into the house (that my Mom, Dad and siblings lived in) to renovate in order to make a profit. This was agreed upon at that time. Upon the sale of the home, the proceeds will be divided between me and my 2 brothers. I am the youngest of the 3 and the 2 brothers have lived there sans expenses for 10+ years. They are 56 and 50. My sister-in-law also has lived there for longer than I can remember. 
Once my Mom died, renovations began and I've taken every stance with trying to get them out so the house can be listed. The house has a reverse mortgage on it so there is a tight timeline to repay the loan and we are down to about 5 weeks until it goes into foreclosure and, in turn, I will lose all of the money I put into it. This includes all of the  life insurance I received and my retirement. 
About a month after my Mom died, my adult niece (unknowingly) moved into the house. Her youngest child burned down the house of her babies daddy's parents (x2 kids) and it took a while for me to realize she was living there and not just visiting. 
I've managed to get one brother out as of 2 days ago but I was told today (by SIL) that the she and her daughter will be living there when the house is listed. To say they live like roaches would be a compliment to how they actually live. I've spent every last dime I had and it's too late to even file for eviction because it will be past the bank's deadline to sell the house by the time they'd be formally evicted. I've had to continue paying property insurance, utilities, and property taxes for the duration for the past ~ 11 months (+ 20 years prior to my parent's deaths). 
Would I be the asshole if I just lose my s&it and enforce that they all leave the premises immediately? I just can't fathom being taken advantage of anymore and am out of money. At least if the house does sell in the final month, there is a profit to be made. I'll pay myself back first and then divide the proceeds accordingly and at my discretion. I am the executor. 
In the past several days, I've been informed that they've ""had to buy"" things for the house (paint specifically) and gave them cash for it, among other things. 
Before I lose my $hit, I want to know if I am overreacting. AITA?

"WIBTA for discouraging my boyfriends art career? I (28F) love my boyfriend (27M) very much, he is a very empathic and idealistic guy. He studied art history and is now trying to make a name for himself as an artist (paintings primarily). I myself am a little more pragmatic, idealistic also (I am a human rights lawyer), but I feel that his attempts at becoming an artist are very naive. The problems started when he finished studying, I had no problem with him studying art history, though I do feel like that it's risky with limited career options, combined with the fact he assembled over 80.000 euro's student debt, as he didn't work much on the side and got no support from his parents. I myself studied law and worked on the side, and was lucky enough to have parents that supported me, so I assembled no student loan. After finishing his studies I thought he would try to get a junior job at a museum, or maybe he would end up working in a more boring government job if things didn't work out in the art scene. However for the last three years he has been working 2 days in a boring administrative job for minimum wage, and spent the other 3 days making paintings. I am no expert in paintings, but I really feel that he isn't a very good artist, I never tell him so of course, but I also don't often express enthousiasm about his work.

"AITA for posting my feelings about my grandma's house When I was a kid, I always looked forward to visiting my maternal grandparents. Their house had a welcoming atmosphere and all of us kids would sleep in the living room under mosquito nets while telling ghost stories or just laughing about anything until we fell asleep. 

My grandpa died when I was 14 and for a long time, my grandma lived in that house with many of our relatives coming in to check on her. When she died, the care of the house was split among my mom and her siblings, but my uncle took on most of the renovations.

I went home in 2019 and I loved the house. It looked like a really lovely fusion of traditional and modern. I kept telling my uncle how happy I was with it and how he'd found a way to still preserve the best parts of it and make it feel like my grandparents were still with us.

Last November, Mom and I went back to visit my grandparents' graves. When I saw what had happened to the house, my heart broke. Instead of stopping at a point where everyone was happy, my uncle had the yard covered and walled off. When I went inside, I was horrified because it was like the interior of a warehouse. The dining area was also in that warehouse/yard and it had very little ventilation and smelled of cockroaches. 

The second floor was what made me cry. The space that used to be the dining room was now filled from floor to ceiling with dolls. I can't even describe the creepy energy that radiated from them. I'm talking about porcelain dolls and stuffed dolls that look like Annabelle. I was told my uncle was insisting on keeping them up all year round. 

The living room was equally horrifying. There was a long table with chairs around, and on the table were crucifixes of different sizes and designs. It was hot inside and I felt claustrophobic. 

I went downstairs and told my mom I felt like my grandparents were no longer there and it felt more like a haunted house. She said I'm not the only one who feels that way and the whole family is creeped out. It's my uncle who thinks we should adjust. 

I was so shocked about the house that I posted on Facebook. Not a rant, but just to say that I felt my childhood had been erased. My uncle immediately knew what I was referring to and he sent a message to my mom about how ungrateful we are. My mom said that I, just like all the grandkids, had every right to express our feelings because we all had memories growing up in that house. He just said we weren't respecting his artistic expression and added that I was no longer going to Japan with him.

My mom told me about the message and I explained that I was never against his artistic expression. My only issue was that he made the house unliveable. I said I could talk to him, but given how he went ahead and did all of this to the house even when she, the most rational sibling, disagreed, I wasn't sure if he would hear me out. My mom said just give him space.

"AITA for lying to may LDR boyfriend?  
""I'm 20 years old, a second-year college student (graduating), and I've been in a long-distance relationship with my boyfriend (21 years old) for almost 11 months. Last month, my boyfriend asked me about the guy I had a fling with when I was in high school. I deleted the conversation we had with that guy, and the last conversation I did not delete was from 2020. My boyfriend questioned why I had to delete our old conversation, and I just said that at that time, my sister was strict about me talking to guys, so I had to delete it to hide it. Then my boyfriend said, 'Why did you delete it? Did you send something to him that's why you deleted it?' I just said that I did not, and he keeps accusing me of lying. He keeps calling me a liar and even starts to curse at me. When I asked him why he cursed at me, he just said that I deserved it. It broke my heart because I know that I did nothing wrong and I don't deserve to be disrespected like that. He considers me a liar because I did not mention about me deleting it, and he said that if he didn't ask, he wouldn't know. I just thought that it's unnecessary because it happened a long time ago. We eventually reconciled and did not talk about it again, but he got into the habit of calling me a liar. Even on my updates, he keeps saying that I'm lying to him. He suspects everything that I say and do. He keeps on calling me a liar that even I felt like maybe I'm really a liar and it's fine for him to react that way because it's my fault. After that, I unintentionally lied to him because I'm afraid that if he just suspects even a small thing, it would cause a big fight. Just for example, when I ended our call and I messaged him 'I would call my sister first' and I unsent it because I overthink and thought about what he will say or react. Usually, when I say something like that, he would say 'hah, you will just call another guy,' 'k,' or act like he's mad. So when he asked why I unsent it, without thinking, I replied 'it's a like,' and he actually saw the message that I unsent, and now we are in a big fight because of me lying to him. He said that 'I lied about small things, so for sure, I lied even on big things.' I know myself, and I know I never keep secrets from him, but I can't blame him for getting angry with me. I apologize to him, and now he's threatening to break up. Actually, I felt like I did those things because I want to protect myself from hearing hurtful words from him, and whenever he does that, I keep losing respect for him. I'm also at the point in my life where I'm angry at myself for letting him treat me that way. I'm aware that even if it's unintentional, the truth is I still lied to him, intentionally or not.

"AITA I 20F made a running joke with someone I was dating 21M and now we are friends. AITA for making this running joke So this may be a bit long. However, I think details matter. 

I 20F attend a local university that I commute to. I matched with this guy 21M on a dating app. Usually I'm hesitant to meet up with people - but we both actually attend the university so in my head it gave it some more validity. 

Anyway we met up 2 months ago and have been on 3 dates together. In the grand scheme of things that isn't much. However, we would call each other 2-3 times a week and we would be on the phone for HOURS at a time.

I have not been in a long term relationship since I was 16 years old. He broke up with a long term girl around a year ago and it really hurt him a lot. 

So I am in a place where I would want something more long term. He admitted that he liked me a lot and wanted to see where this went. However we agreed to just not ""talk"" to other people and basically a textbook definition of a ""situationship"" 

He didn't talk to me a few days this past week because he was busy. Which I completely understand - me being the overthinker was a bit salty when I called. He asked me a question and I was like: ""oh you aren't my boyfriend idk what that matters."" The question was relating to how I was feeling. 

Seems like a dramatic response on my part. In previous conversations we both have made similar jokes about not dating. Anyway we got in a fight and by the end he admitted that he couldn't be in something long term right now.

Which I get and I also was not trying to pressure him - but I made it clear I was looking for long term. Not mad that this changed. I was perfectly find with just going with the flow.

Now - we agreed to be friends and reevaluate where we are in a few months. I feel awful because if I didn't make that comment things probably would've been fine. 

I have never felt a connection with someone like this and that's why I'm upset about it. Yes I haven't seriously dated someone in years, but I've had other situations 

I never cared like this or felt such a good vibe from a person. 

Am I delusional to think this could eventually work out?

"WIBTA if I declined to hold my cousin's baby?  I'm having a moral conundrum here, hoping for some insight. 

My cousin had a baby about a year ago and she's bringing him over to our house later today. During this visit, she's planning to give my wife and I a bunch of unused baby clothes , toys and other things we'll need when our baby is born in June. 

For context purposes, I love this woman (my cousin), she's truly an incredible person that I've gotten along with my entire life. That said, if she was to ask me if I wanted to hold her baby, I would decline. I've told my wife, she's on my side but everyone else I ask seems to be appalled by this choice. 

The reason I would decline is because I've never held a baby, and I want my first time to be with my son. It seems silly, almost unimportant, but it's something I genuinely want to share with my son in June. 

Do you guys think I'd be the asshole if I made this choice? ",0.07
"AITA For not wanting anything to do with my adult ""daughter""? Throwaway.

I (M40) was recently contacted by my 21 year old ""daughter"" who was conceived as a result of my ex baby trapping me when I was 19. At the time my ex, who we will call Samantha, revealed to me that she got pregnant from me by poking holes in my condoms and scooping my semen out of freshly thrown away condoms from the times I had visited her place. Initially held out hope that perhaps she was either lying about the pregnancy, or lying about me being the father if she really was pregnant. So I asked her to get a pregnancy test at a doctors office to confirm whether or not she was lying, but it came through positive. So then a few months into her pregnancy i asked for a paternity test to determine if the baby was actually mine or not. It was in fact mine. 

 When everything fell through and it was confirmed that the baby was actually mine I was furious with her and with how she broke my trust like that. I would have preferred it if she happened to cheat on me and got pregnant from that than for her to have essentially stolen my DNA to make a baby. I made it clear to her that I would have no involvement in her or the kids life beyond child support and cut her off completely.

That was over 20 years ago now and honestly, my life is alright. I'm married and have 3 kids with my spouse, my career is going well, I don't need to worry about money that much, and I'm in relatively good health. All was well, until about a 2 weeks ago when my now adult ""daughter"" managed to get into contact with me through social media. We later called eachother and she told me about her upbringing, (apparently her mother was abusive). During the call, I also explained the circumstances of her birth and why I wasn't a part of her life. I concluded by essentially telling her that I wanted to focus on my other kids and continue my life without her in it and ended the call.

I later spoke with my wife about the event and she told me that I sounded cold, and could have tried to have a relationship and bond with her. But I honestly don't see her as one of my children, and i only care about the three I willingly had with my wife. Anyway, that's a summary of events for you redditors. Now AITA or not?",0.94
"AITA for telling someone at the gym not to use 30+ wet wipes in a single session?  The gym I go to has these disinfectant wet wipe bins where you can grab wet wipes to wipe down your equipment. I was at the gym today and saw a man come in and grab 10-15 wet wipes to wipe down a bench. He then throws that in a bin and pulls a string of 10ish wet wipes to wipe his phone screen. I was debating telling him that he’s using way too much but decided to hold back. There’s no staff at this gym so there’s no one I can go to. 

After his workout, he pulled out another long string of wet wipes (maybe 20-30). This was when I stopped my workout and walked over to him and told him “hey, don’t you think you’re using way too many wet wipes?” And he goes “what? Not really” I told him if everyone in this gym used almost 30-50 wet wipes in one session, they’ll have to replace it often and that’s the cost that will be passed onto us. I also said it’s bad for the environment, using these many wet wipes in one single session. 

He goes “but wet wipes are cheap! They cost pennies and these are bio degradable”. I told him if everyone had that mindset, imagine how many wet wipes are wasted and just because it’s biodegradable doesn’t mean it’s okay to just waste them?!!!

Anyway, he said other people use just as much but he’ll keep it in mind. I did apologise for giving unsolicited feedback and thanked him for hearing me out. I felt weird after because who am I to say anything?? I’m not a staff member… but I also would have felt uneasy not saying anything. I workout at the same time every night and so does he so it’s gonna be so awkward from now on but that’s what I brought on to myself. AITA??",0.62
"AITA for parking outside my house We're currently debating with the neighbours about parking outside our house and I want to know if my family are TA.

I have lived in my house for 18 years and we've never had a problem like this but it seems to be dividing the neighbours so I wanted to get Reddits opinion.

We live in a semi-detached house in a courtyard - sounds fancy, it isn't - our house and our next door neighbour are the only two houses actually in the courtyard with all other houses facing away from ours (so their back gardens are across from our front) with 2 blocks of flats filling the spaces between houses.

Other than our house, the courtyard is all parking spaces or garages for our neighbours.

We are a 4-adult, 3-car household, and only have 1 assigned space within the courtyard. One of our neighbours in a flat lets us use her space as she doesn't have a car and the 3rd car goes on the street in the lay-by parking.

Now, we've never had any major issues with the courtyard until recently - our next door neighbour keep inviting visitors, boyfriends and other 'overnight guests' to park inside the courtyard, directly outside the front of our house. Just to note, there's no spare spaces, and even when my sister comes to visit, they park outside on the street, we never invite people to park as all the spaces are assigned.

At first, it wasn't a major issue, but then we were having people parked outside our house for hours, days, and even a whole weekend when they went on holiday - they never pull forward in front of their own house, and instead park against our front garden usually blocking our path as well as our parking space. Our front window, is usually blocked and visitors sometimes wait for 30minutes to an hour, while able to look directly into our kitchen - not a major issue, just made us a little uncomfortable.

After around 6 months, my dad got fed up of parking on the street while others were parked in front of our house, and so he has begun to park against our front garden - for context, he drives the smallest of our 3 cars to reduce how much of the courtyard we block.

Since beginning to park there, it has made ours and our next-door neighbours space a little tight, but we are both still able to get in and out easily. There's room for a car to go past, but its a little tighter than it used to be.

One of the neighbours who's garden backs onto the courtyard is now complaining about us parking there as they feel it's made courtyard a little tight. While we agree, my dad's car does not block their space and its no tighter than a supermarket car park. They've hinted about us moving the car, but it came to a head today when my parents were directly confronted about the car.

They had a conversation and even though those neighbours have parked guests - work men - vans - parents in front of our house previously, they acted as though we were being unreasonable.

So, are we being unreasonable for parking in front of our own house? We know it's not ideal but we're really sick of seeing strangers outside our house.",0.21
"AITA for refusing to go on an expensive trip with my partner while his father is dying in the hospital? I F(30) and my partner M(38) have been in a relationship for 9 years. For the past 4 years it is has been bad. He has been controling, obsessive, and abusive. I started working in his businesses at the beginning now I manage most if it. I started a second online job during the pandemic. I really enjoyed it as it was something truly mine.  Everything else in my life involved him. 

He and family is very wealthy. They have been kind and supportive if us. They have taken us on many expensive trips over the years. They allowed us to live in their favourite house together while they reside in one of their other houses. They are elderly and have declining health. I have helped them in many many ways as best I can and am in debt to them.

We made a suprise renovation to their favourite house. It is old and in their family for generations. At this time I manage 2 jobs and a full house renovation.

They came back and where surprised and pleased. They also wanted to prepare for a trip to a resort in Egypt. However his father was not feeling well and went to the doctor. There they found he had blocked arteries in his heart and needs an operation. First they say it is nothing serious. We were worried. We discussed and his mother wants to stay and be with him and  for us to go instead of them so they don't waste the money and we deserved it after the restoration. I was hesitant but agreed. I had already taken many off days my second job during the renovation. I was not sure if i can have more. 
The Boss was understanding but let me know he still needs some help with work. So i told him I will try to work from Egypt. However my partner said he does not want to spoil the trip with work. 

By the next day they tell us his father is getting worse and needs a complicated and risky operation. He is slowly getting worse and they tell us its a very high risk since he is old and with a weak heart. So we discussed again and my partner said there is nothing that we can do to change the situation so we will go. His mother is whatever. His brother said it is a family emergency and we must stick together. I agreed with with him and said its best to stay.  So a huge argument starts and my partner blames me for choosing the second job over him. And my concern for his father is a lie.

"AITA for deliberately misunderstanding my child's father? So I had a baby some weeks ago with my partner to whom I'm not married.

We've been together a while, and I've given many compromises in this relationship. While discussing baby's name, we had a few disagreements on names but ultimately decided on a name we both liked well enough. The surname was a sticking point: he wanted the baby to have his name alone. I offered to hyphenate b/c logistically it's easier for the baby to have both of our names. He's been drinking the red pill cool aid lately - a large bone of contention in this relationship - and went off about how it's 'tradition' and 'the right thing to to' and 'his right as a man' to have the baby have his surname. He told me I'd be emasculating him and may as well be a single parent if I won't grant him this one little ask. 'My word is final - baby's having one surname'. This was late in my pregnancy and I didn't have it in to fight, so I told him that I understood what he was saying.

FF to 3 weeks ago when baby's birth certificate came. He blew a gasket when he saw that I'd given the baby my surname. He rehashed the conversation above, saying I agreed to giving baby his surname. This is where I might be TA. I did nothing of the sort. I told him I understood him, which I did - but I never said I agreed with him. I told him there was no way I was doing all the work of making a baby for him to stick his name on it. When we bought up tradition, I told him it's also traditional for him to marry me before having a baby but he was happy to ignore that, I told him it was traditional for him to be the provider but I do that too - and I pointed out other holes in his logic. I told him trying to bully me into submission with his red pill bs when I was exhausted from pregnancy didn't work. He should have known better than to expect me to not share a surname with my child. He said the baby should only have one surname - they do. So why's he mad?

He went crying to his brothers and mother - all 'traditionalists' and misogynists - and now they're all up in arms.

ETA 

  
There seems to be some confusion - we are not married or engaged. I don't believe in it, and he's never seen the point of 'bring the state into your relationship', so we agreed to never marry. 

He's on the birth certificate as the father - baby just has my last name but father is listed.

"AITA for not wanting to lend my parents money? My (23f) parents (42f and 43m) are very financially irresponsible, and they use up all their money all the time. When I was younger they would always scare my brother and I saying that we weren’t gonna be able to pay rent and stuff like that, but they always managed to solve it. 

Once I grew up and started working they would ask me for $100 dollars here and there and always pay me back. 
Once I got married to my husband (24m), they started asking us for like $500+ dollars every other week. Always paying us back but they can take up to 10 months to pay us back. 

Fast forward 5 months ago, they asked me to ask my in laws to lend them $25000. I was so embarrassed to even ask, my husband’s family is rich but I don’t want them to think less of me or my family or to think that I’m taking advantage of them. 

They haven’t paid them back a penny yet, but a few days after they got the money they went on vacation to the East (we live on the west). With everything we’ve lend them they owe my husband and I over 4k and my in laws over 25k. 

Last week they asked me for 10k more and I told them we didn’t have that much. They told me to ask my in laws and they said no. I’ve told them I don’t wanna know about their financial problems anymore because to be honest it seems like they spend so much they are asking for it (they go on vacation once a month or every two months tops). They keep reminding me how my husband and I make more money than them and how they moved to this country to give my brother and I a better life. 

I feel so bad not helping them but I am just tired of lending them money so often. They called me an hour ago asking for $200 when I’ve told them I don’t wanna know about their financial problems and they are in Vegas right now… my husband is really tired of lending them money and seeing them be so irresponsible with it, he has told me he doesn’t wanna do it anymore.

I don’t wanna fight with my husband, specially about something that I agree on. Wibtah for not lending them money? How can I nicely tell them that I don’t wanna lend them any more money?

"AITA for telling my husband I expect him to fold laundry he washed? My (40F) husband (39M) of 7 years got mad at me for telling him I expected him to fold the laundry he washed while I was out of town.

Background: I travel for work. Not a ton by comparison to what I did before 2020 and before we had kids. I was gone this week from 5:30am Tuesday morning until 8pm Friday evening for a work trip. My husband had our 2 boys (1M and 4.5M) by himself while I was gone. They go to different places. The baby goes to my parent’s during the day. 3 of the 4 days my mom picked up the older one and brought him to her house so my husband would only have 1 pickup. He still had 2 drop offs every day. I prepped enough food for them before I left so there was no cooking. 
Based on the way we have divided household tasks, laundry for everyone is my job. I typically do a load every day because that’s my preference. I do not expect him to do laundry when I’m just gone for a day or two (which is what I typically do). This trip, he had taken the clothes that he and the boys wore and washed and dried them. I got home last night to clothes in the dryer. I told my husband to is morning this morning that I expected him to finish the task of the laundry he started by folding it and putting it away. He got upset at this. 

My perspective:
When I am gone, the house still needs to run. If you start a task you should finish it.
Laundry is part of what the house needs. He doesn’t have to do laundry everyday like I do, but once after 4 days seems reasonable.
I did make sure all of the laundry was clean before I left. 
I thanked him multiple times while I was gone for taking care of the boys so I could focus on work. 
I didn’t want to go on this trip anyway, but I had to. It’s for my job. 
I also got progressively more sick while I was gone and came home feeling like crap. That was just this trip (although it happens often) and I don’t think that should impact the expectation. 
I was on a 2 hour time difference while I was gone and the work days start around 7:30am and go until around 9pm. 

His perspective:
Keeping the kids is hard. He wants to be able to kick his feet up at night and relax after a day of work and taking care of 2 kids. 
Laundry is not his responsibility. He saw it as helping me by doing the piece he did and felt disrespected and unappreciated for my ask for him to fold and put away the laundry. 
He was overwhelmed (his word). 
I suspect he’s also frustrated I came home sick (he didn’t say this so just speculation). 
He said he won’t do laundry in the future when I’m gone if that is my expectation.

"AITA for not letting my GF take my truck? Lately my girl has been asking to take my truck for errands if I'm staying home with the excuse that she doesn't want to lose her parking spot. My building's visitor parking is three times a week max, so she often has to street part, which isn't always super easy but most of the time she will find a spot within a 5-minute walk, if not right in front of the building. If it's too far I can pick her up. It doesn't matter where she parks, the car will be equally safe.

Anyways, today I told her she couldn't take the truck after she asked, partly because I might use it (for whatever reason) but most importantly because insurance only covers me in case of an accident.

AITA for not letting her use my truck so she doesn't lose her spot? I'm wondering if I'm being selfish or inconsiderate with her.

I am just trying to help her, as a hiring manager and someone who has the ultimate veto for hiring on my team, I have seen this exact scenario playout and unless they have a really special skill I need, I would say no hire just for the blatant attempt at manipulation.

Finally an elevator arrived.

I easily stepped inside, not touching or pressing against anyone to get inside and doors easily shut behind me.

She started talking. ""You are stepping on my shoes!""

There was a full hand distance between us.

I told her that she was the senseless one and she could get off if she didn't like it.

She kept going and kept calling me name and told me that she was there first.
 
Some other people near her were smiling in amusement. Enjoying the show. I think they were a group.

Finally I had enough and shouted in anger. ""shut your mouth"" 

She shut up and every single smile was wiped away in an instant.

Recently, Lily has started to want to bring it to school. To prevent distractions I said no and Lily was heartbroken when I told her she couldn't take her blanket to school anymore. She whined and argued that her blanket makes her feel safe and she threw a tantrum about it.

"AITA for deciding to name my daughter the name I originally chose? My daughter will be born in 2 months & I fell in love with the name Aura (pronounce AH-RAH) way before she was conceived. Well my SIL also got pregnant and gave her son the middle name Audree, after her childhood bestfriend who passed away from cancer (her name was Adrianna). Keep in mind we didn’t know he had a middle name & we chose this middle name long before she was pregnant.
When we told our fiancés family about naming my daughter Aura, they mentioned how close it sounded to our nephews middle name & if I’ve discussed it with said SIL?

I didn’t know I needed permission to discuss my daughters name with SIL? But out of respect, I did so anyways. 
I asked her if she was ok with us naming our daughter Aura given that it came to my attention, it sounds similar to Audree & I don’t want her feeling uncomfortable that we chose that name.
She first said that it didn’t bother her but after thinking about it, that yeah it does bother her simply because if she had a daughter she would’ve named her Audree as well after her best friend but she had a son so she gave him that middle name. She also stated that it does sound alike just the last syllable is different. 
I was a bit startled given that to me it’s two completely different names with also different meanings but I understand how she’s feeling so I told her okay, I’ll look for another name but I let her know this name was picked long before we even knew our nephew had that middle name. 

I’ve now searched over hundreds of names and cannot find one that I am in love with. My heart was set on Aura. I referred to her in my wound as Aura whenever I would read or talk to her. 

I know I said I will pick another name but I am stressing I won’t find one that I love & if that happens, I’m just going to go with Aura. AITA?

"AITA for screaming and crying at my son's accident? I (26f) have a 4 year old son. We were celebrating my husband's birthday, so a good few people were at our house. We have a shaky old book shelf that we use for old VHS movies that has fallen down twice now, we've been meaning to get rid of it, but we've decided to focus on our living situations first.

My son was laying down on his back with his feet to the bottom of the shelf out of boredom while I was deciding on a position for the couch. A small earthquake happened, and it began to fall towards him. I screamed (admittedly loud) threw myself over the couch and pulled him out of the way by his arm. He just laughed and called me ""girl-flash"" because I was fast, and I just held onto him and began to cry.

People who had heard my scream were in the room now, and he explained what happened. My sister reassured me and said to stop crying, but I couldn't, she got annoyed after a bit and said I was being dramatic and he was fine. I said rather harshly ""you watch that shelf almost fall on your daughter and just go back to normal""

She said ""Just as 'you' as ever."" and left me alone.

When my husband came back from his dad taking him for his birthday gift (he was console shopping during the incident) my sister said ""Sorry about her, you're in for a helluva marriage""

He asked what she was talking about, noticing I was still misty eyed, I explained, and he just said nothing, put the VHS tapes in a box, and dragged the shelf to the garage and locked it.  He asked to not invite her places again. I feel like I ended his birthday on a sour note, AITA?",0.33
"AITA for wanting quiet in the morning? My hubby (38m) and I (38f) have been married for 12 years. He’s loud and social, I’m quiet and like my space, especially in the morning. We’ve had many conversations about respecting boundaries and not trying to “change” the other person. He’s always going to be loud and I’m always going to be quiet.

We were out late last night. I had to work today. We both woke up around 645. I made coffee and ran a bath for myself. I brought him a coffee in bed then got in the tub (which is right beside our bedroom). 

He called his mom and got into a long, loud conversation with her until I finally asked him to take his conversation elsewhere.

He seemed shocked that I was frustrated. I think it’s absurd to be on the phone that early, period, and if he knows I don’t want to talk in the morning, why the hell would I also want to listen to his early morning phone conversation in the short time I have to myself in the day? I think he was being obnoxious.

"AITA for refusing to pay for my step-daughter's college because my wife removed her mangalsutra? Our wedding anniversary was some time ago, and we had planned to go out. But my parents were caught in an accident. When I learned about it, I cancelled my plans and wanted to go there to take care of them. My wife Karthika didn't like the idea, saying that I can go later, etc. We got into an argument, and in the end I left for the hospital anyway.

When I returned days later, she asked me how my parents were. And then she said ""Since you cancelled the anniversary, I want to tell you something.""

And then she removed the gold necklace, literally threw it into the dustbin, and also wiped off her bindi (red dot on forehead).

I hardly ever talked to her after this.

Yesterday she came to me to say that our step-daughter's going to attend college & that I should pay for it. I said absolutely not.

"AITA for sharing private text messages in public?  I used to hook up with a girl who invited me to her local discord group. I was 28 and she was 25. At the time it didn't feel off. But soon I learnt that she had a lot of self image issues, daddy issues, etc and since I didn't want any drama I decided to stop the FWB situation we had going for a week. 

During our time as friends, I learnt that she had an affair with a dude who was married. He left her after he needed to got his wife pregnant. She used to say that she is down for any guy she can get and she expected her future husband to leave her for someone younger. Etc all of this screamed more drama so I cut back on friendship too.

She used to complain and vent a lot about her ex, also. Anyways after we stopped the FWB and I slowly reduced the frequency of our chats, one day she confided that she was using me to forget him, make him jealous. She was very bitter about him and wanted to harm him. 

I was happy that I was smart about cutting things off early. Until now. 

She has started dating one of the discord mod and clearly she is antagonising me to him. But the issue is that the idiot mod blocked me from the discord group, but instead of stopping there he has started joining almost all WhatsApp groups I'm in and mass spamming admins to block me and remove me.

His reason is that I have sexually harassed 6 women and 2 guys (including him) online by asking them for pictures (nude) and locations. And when asked for evidence to back his claim he tells them that his words as a discord mod should be sufficient. 

Once this got out of hand because WhatsApp is not as private as discord. My friends (all of them ladies and don't know him irl) whom he spammed about me made a separate WhatsApp group and added him to ask for evidences. 

He revealed one name (my ex FWB) and claimed that I coerced her to send nudes, forced her to call me daddy over texts, and lots of things that luckily contradicted reality. He added her to the group and she verbally confirmed these claims. 

My friends asked me about this in private and I shared screenshots of my text message with her where she said she loves getting attention and sending nudes as bribes to guys like me to keep them interested in her. And a text chain where I was telling her that I don't like being called daddy (she called me without asking me) because it gives daddy issue vibes. 

I practically send everything to my friends to show that I never forced or coerced her at any point. They shared it with the discord mod and then he reveals that they were dating and she cooked up all the lies because she didn't take our ""break-up"" well. He decided to add 5 extra false victim to increase severity.... 

Now, the discord mod and my ex FWB is whining about me sharing private text messages. And no I never shared nor saved any of her nudes or any picture from her. Even threatening to approach the law.

"WIBTA if I stop giving my sister money even though I can afford to? I (39m) am the second oldest in a family of 8 children.  We grew up in poverty.  I have always taken on the role of the oldest because my older sister (41f) is self-centered, reckless, and unstable.  She simply can’t be depended on for anything, so my parents just stopped trying to depend on her.  I’m not here to bash her, but to justify my harsh language and judgment of her, here are some examples:

* The 2nd time they left her to babysit us she invited friends over who drank and smoked.  The base MPs were called, and my dad got in a lot of trouble because they found minors with alcohol and weed.
* She constantly struggled in school, was suspended more times than I remember, and was expelled once.
* She stole from everyone and would shamelessly lie about it.
* She faked a home robbery and sold our electronics for weed money.

She left home and, in the 20 years since, has called me every few months asking to borrow money with some crazy story.  Car repossessed, a friend stole money from her, work messed up her paycheck, her card was stolen, her account overdrafted, the landlord won’t give back the deposit, etc.  I gave her money every time.  Over the past 10 years, I guess I have given her $10-15k and been paid back maybe $2-$3k.

We now live in the same area, and so we have been keeping in touch for the past year or so.  We see each other or talk on the phone several times a month. I can tell that her life is the same clusterfuck it was 25 years ago, she makes foolish financial decisions, overspends on frivolous things, refuses to work more than one job, and refuses to look for better jobs if she has any job at all, with the justification that “anyone who works 40 hours a week deserves a living wage”. (I don’t disagree but it’s irrelevant)

She recently got a DUI and needed $900 to install something on her car that required her to pass a breathalyzer to start it. If she doesn’t have this device installed within the next 2 weeks, she will be in violation of her probation.  She called me crying to ask for money, and I said “I don’t remember you being this stressed out months ago when we talked about you getting a 2nd job” and then later “Your booze from the last 3 months would have covered this”.  She said, “Thanks Dick”, hung up, and texted me saying I was kicking her when she was down.  I know it wasn’t “right” of me to say that, and it wasn’t the right time, but I felt so cornered and frustrated that I lashed out.

I gave her the money so that she would be fine for now, but I feel frustrated and taken advantage of.  I am comfortably middle class and saving over $3k a month, but I’m considering cutting her off completely because I feel she makes terrible decisions while others pay for the consequences. On the other hand, if we take this latest example as a guide, it seems like it would be an asshole move to let my sister go to Jail because I disagree with her decisions.

"AITA for not switching shifts with a coworker so she could visit her dying grandmother? I (22F) work as a pharmacy technician. My coworker, Sam (32F) and I are currently butting heads. 

The relationship between Sam and myself started out very positive and she was a good mentor to me. However, recently it has gone downhill quite fast. It’s mostly coming from work ethic. Another coworker was recently let go, which has left me working overtime at store (~50hrs/week). 

The problem is, it feels like I’m doing everything. Running register, fixing and receiving inventory, filling the prescriptions, handling insurance, etc. And whenever we work together, she is constantly complaining about wanting to go home, how she hates doing X,Y, and Z. She’s come in late most shifts and then asks me to stay and close for her so she can leave early. She also calls out of work the day of her shift constantly, which leaves me to have to cover.

I’ve tried to work with her. I’ve covered shifts where I can, I’ve switched tasks so she doesn’t do the things she doesn’t like. At some point, I even asked her just to run register while I do everything else so she could at least do something she liked while I handled the rest. In fact, I cover 3/4 weekends a month, so she works only 1 weekend a month.

Recently, she asked me to cover her weekend shift so she could go see her grandmother. As far she’s told me, she and her grandmother don’t have a good relationship, and she tries to actively avoid seeing her (though this situation is different given her new prognosis). 

I let her down gently, saying that I couldn’t come in for the weekend. I haven’t actually had a day off in a little over 2 weeks, and this weekend is the only time I’ll have off for probably another 2 weeks since we’re still short staffed. 

She got upset and said that I’ve always covered shifts for her and that this was super important and how I should be more understanding. I told her that I wasn’t trying to put her in a bad spot, but that I was exhausted and couldn’t keep coming in on such short notice for her.

She called me an ungrateful asshole with no compassion for anyone before storming out, leaving me to finish out her shift. 

My friends have told me that I wasn’t out of line, but my mom said that I could have just done it this once for her. 

Additional Info:

Her behavior has been a reoccurring problem, but because we don’t have any new hires, she’s still working with us. 

She has told me many times how she has cut out most of her family and doesn’t speak to them. She has not spoken to her grandmother in years. ",0.02
AITAH for not leaving my job for my boyfriend? I (f20) have been dating (m34) for a year now. Im madly in love with him to the point i actually lose all control over myself and do anything he asks me to. He loves me a lot too. All I've ever wanted is to get married and have kids and he seems the perfect guy to me for that. He loves this idea too but neither of us can afford that life for atleast another year because of our financial situations. We live together and we're barely making enough to run the household. He has a very low paying job as of now but he's trying his best to save up as much as he can. I work as a barista which pays okayish for me to survive and to be able to save up.

I saw my boyfriend and jumped in excitement and ran to hug him but he pushed me away in front of my coworker and dragged me outside and told me to quit right there and then. I told him we need the money but he kept insisting he can make enough for us to survive. I broke down into tears on how rude his tone was but i understand his anger too.

 I kinda had a crush on him since the beginning he was my type but nothing serious and my friends knew about it. 

As we got to all know each other I noticed he was more interested in Jen ( for context he is a close friend to someone who asked me out but I declined) and gave her a lot of attention and all since I was the first to notice so I told jen and she started to like his attentions and everything. 

At the same time I liked him secretly cause he’s genuinely a nice guy but kept to myself even though he sometimes did small things that showed he liked like telling me he liked my style or complimenting my eyes or taking random pictures of me when I wasn’t noticing but since he obviously was interested in jen I never did anything .

then lately he was openly showing he likes me and doing small gestures for me and everyone started to notice then we begging texting and all.

until he confessed he liked me since the beginning of the year but didn’t do anything since his his friend likes me then I said I thought u liked Jen and his answer was that he didn’t like her like that and that all the attentions were meant for me but she was the first to cross his path so they went to her I didn’t really believe him but let it slide.

when Jen found out she got mad and felt really hurt because I didn’t tell her but also because she felt like he played her and she’s convinced he a bad guy who’s a player.

"AITA for leaving my bf behind in order to be on time for a strict reservation? Boyfriend (M27) had an amazing idea last week to take our baby and grandmas to the Sugar Shack on Saturday, the only day he doesn’t work and is available for family time. 

He had the idea to go but I had to do all the planning: choosing the place, checking if grandmas could come and make the reservation. I found a place that was 50 minutes away from home and made the reservation for 10am. I received an email to confirm the reservation and they repeatedly wrote that late arrival will mean a cancelation. 
I informed my bf on Thursday that the reservation was made at 10am, the drive was an hour away so we had to wake up at 8am to make sure we made it on time. I said: “we cannot be late”. On Friday morning, I reminded him again that the reservation was on Saturday and we had to be on time so we had to wake up at 8. Friday night came and he mentioned he was thinking of seeing his friends as they were all getting together, just a regular Friday. I told him that I dont think its a good idea since we have to wake up so early at 8am and we cant be late. He said that it wouldnt be a problem and he left to see his friends. Before falling asleep I texted him goodnight and asked him to wake us up at 8am. He says okay, goodnight and he will sleep in the sofa. 

Saturday morning comes, my baby wakes up at 8:45am, I rush to the bathroom effectively waking him up. He wakes up, takes some towels from the dryer then stretches and chills in the bathroom while im brushing my teeth, brushing my hair, making small talk of how I slept and then decides to jump in the shower. In that moment I looked at google maps and decided to skip all shower and get baby and grandma ready so we could still make it somehow on time. He was still in the shower but I decided to leave with baby and grandma. 

He called around 15 minutes after we had left and was furious about leaving him behind, I told him I had told him about the reservation and time to wake up several times, but he kept insisting I messed up big time for leaving without him.

"AITA for asking my boyfriend's parents to not buy us a car? Hi, we're a couple George (29) and Anna (26) and want to get your input on a situation that happened to us four years ago.

In 2020 George bought our first car (Skoda Fabia) since Anna didn't earn money at the time and couldn't contribute. We shared the car equally, it was perfect for the city and our needs.

Then one day George's father told us he wanted us to get a better car. His reasoning was safety and long travel. First we just dismissed it, we liked our car, it was doing a good job. But he kept on insisting which introduced tension to our relationship. Anna was very against, George was mildly against.

Then after a lot of back and forth, George's father called to tell us that he found a buyer for our Skoda AND the new car was ready to be picked up from the dealership. It was presented kind of as a done deal. In the end the Skoda was sold & the new car was paid by George's father who felt like he was helping us and wanted good.

Another outcome was that we had a huge end fight. Anna asked George to ensure his parents never intervened in our lives like this again. 
Now our separate perspectives:

George - 
I come from a wealthy family but I made it my core belief to be independent from my father's wealth & to make it in life on my own. In 2020 my girlfriend and I were a young couple just starting as adults. I managed to save up enough money to buy my first car and I couldn't have been prouder. I'm not a big car guy and wasn't emotionally attached to the Skoda, so I didn't care much about loosing it, & my father is very stubborn, plus my parents live 2h from us and I visit once every month so I drive a lot & knew the other car was better. 

Tbh the worst thing about the situation was that I felt I was forced to choose between siding with my parents or my girlfriend. I didn't agree with my father's stubborness, but equally felt that Anna was forcing me to choose between my family and her. 

Anna - 
At that time George's independence from his family's wealth was a big subject in our relationship. We also just moved to a new apartment and were renovating by ourselves. George's parents proposed to help financially but we said no. I knew how important it was for George to be self-sufficient & always supported him in this. So when the car thing came up, I was surprised how quickly George agreed with his father. In general I felt the problem was that George was unable to refuse his father, car aside.

When we got the call, I was very angry. I was attached to the car, but moreso felt that George's parents were intervening in our lives & making decisions that we're not theirs to make, even after repeatedly hearing we didn't want the car.

The Culmination was one particularly bad fight in which George said ""it was his car anyway"". This was tough to hear because we were building everything together. I felt hurt, isolated & that essentially I had no right to form an opinion, since no one seemed to listen to me anyway.

My husband 58/M (YES, 58) got a large sum of $ from his mother and is hiding it from me 50/F.  We have been together for several years but only married for 2.  For many reasons, money has become incredibly tight over the last several months. 
I am physically disabled & unable to work much but do get a small disability check. He works in an industry that ebbs and flows.  Lately he’s done nothing to bring money into our home as the joint account slowly made its way down to zero…yep $0.00.  I have done a couple very simple cleaning jobs for a neighbor and made a few dollars, but nothing that could ever pay the bills.  He was offered a job in his business and walked around bellyaching about it not being what he really wants to do & it fell apart. Then had the audacity to ask me where I put the whopping $40 I made! 

I have known about the money from momma for a few weeks now.  There was also an exchange between him and momma about hiding the money & deleting all records of their conversation. Little did they know…not everyone in their lives is who they think they are.  (We don’t live remotely close to one another, but the truth always comes to light.)  My personal favorite part was momma saying not a dime could be spent on anything to do with me… 

In hindsight I now see I am an idiot and have played the game too long (15 years +/-.)
What’s the best way to throw this in his face?  I don’t want to just pop off about it during some heated exchange. After this much time, I really need to make a statement.

"AITA for telling my fiancée that I hope she dies first 
Me (m23) and my Fiancée (f25)  have been together for 5 years and i can say i aboslutely adore her and every moment we spend together. Tonight as we were watching a movie (while high) we began talking about the topic of death, i had said that whenever the time comes i hope she dies before i do. I tried to explain that i just think she has gone through so much loss already, and that i just want her to go to heaven and i will meet her there. She went in the room and closed the door and i have had time to think about what i really meant by that statement and havent been able to say it to her yet.

What i really mean by that is that i just want to be there for her when that time is here, i want to be the last face she sees, the last person she smells, the last person to tell her she is loved. I dont want her to live with the grief of losing me, do i think she would be okay eventually yes, but i dont want her to have to deal with that grief. I dont want her to die now or anytime soon i want our time together, i want to get married and travel and have a family together. but it was a fleeting thought and now i feel bad.

"AITA for wanting to hang out with my boyfriend of 8 years my own way? My boyfriend (30M) and I (28F) enjoy hanging out with each other in our own way. He likes me being 100% present with him and I enjoy being able to do multiple things at the same time to quench my ADHD (one of the symptoms anyways) while being around him.

 However, I find it slightly intense that every weekend we have a minimum 10 hours marathon of movies which I enjoy, but with mt ADHD I crave doing multiple different things/activities while watching our movies. I love hanging out with my boyfriend, I do, and we've been together for almost 8 years.

 But he will get passively and even a little angry if I am not actively watching the movie and instead playing a game, stopping the movie night and acting up like the screen of my phone or video game is too loud or too bright and that in a cinema they wouldn't do that.

 He calls me rude and says I am just passively hanging out with him, and that it is disrespectful of me to do so. But I want to be able to hang out with him without feeling constrained and feel like I am trying to deal with the ADHD demons alone whilst trying to pay attention for hours on the same thing.

"AITA for telling my dad he sexualized me My age and situation are very important to this story. I am nonbinary/AFAB and I am almost 22 years old. I still live with my dad because I’m disabled.

I decided to go out with my partner and their friends today. I wanted to look nice since I was going on a double date so I wore a crop top, fishnet top, and jeans. My dad was going to watch a game so I didn’t expect him to be back when I got home. I was wrong. 

He immediately started calling me names after seeing the outfit I was wearing. I almost immediately left to go in my room and didn’t say a word. He called me multiple times to get me to have dinner. I was annoyed and upset at this point so I snapped at him once I got my dinner. 

He asked me why I snapped at him and I told him the truth that he sexualized me and slut shamed me. He immediately got angry and started yelling at me saying that it was his job as a father to do this and that he wasn’t sexualizing me. He told me to go to my room so I did.

I locked my room and haven’t come out since. I told my mom about the situation and she’s in agreement with me that my dad shouldn’t have said the things he did or yelled at me. This isn’t the first time my dad has done this. He’s done this multiple times so I’m not surprised that this happened again.

Once I was in my room, I immediately broke down crying. I feel so violated and disgusted right now. Am I the asshole for telling my dad that he sexualized me? ",0.5

On her birthday, her boyfriend gave her some lotions, perfumes, and other things that had been identical to the stuff that had gone missing mere weeks beforehand.

When i told her, she flipped out on me for “trying to make decisions for her.” Heres how it basically went down…

Me- Hey RM, i don’t think your bf is a good person to have around. He seems to be stealing from my half of the apartment and im not comfortable with that. Some of those gifts were stolen from me.

"AITA for ‘stealing’ my friend’s future baby name? Throwaway and changing names. I (25F) am in a tough situation and would like some outside perspective. I’m married to Max (29M). My family friend Anya is 21, and has been dating her partner Ryan (22M) for 5 years. Her family and mine are really close. Anya and Ryan moved in together the next state over a few years ago, and it’s about a six-hour drive between us.  
She had no plans to get pregnant anytime soon, but has been talking for years about what she wanted her future kid’s names to be. The issue is that it’s a really common name, think like Isabella Grace. I found out that I'm pregnant a few months ago and my partner and I both love the name, but we were going to make it different, like Bella.

We had a birthday party for my grandma a few days ago, and it was her 90th birthday, so it was a big extended family event. Anya was invited, but she didn’t end up going. With my grandma’s permission, we announced the name of our daughter at the party. Mostly everyone seemed pretty about it. My mom came up to me after the party and said that I need to pick a different name because Anya will be mad. I told her that we only see her a few times a year so it doesn’t matter.  
Anya texted me today, calling me insensitive and taking away something important from her. She accused me of stealing her baby name. My mom agrees with her, but I don’t really think it matters. AITA?

"AITA for getting mad my friend called me paranoid and judgmental? I went on my first date with a cute guy (29M) from Hinge. He was kind and fun. Our conservation was great and he was respectful.  
  
However, when I asked about his dating history, his response was suspicious. He said he’s only dated a girl briefly in college since he didn’t meet many people because he mostly focused on school and building his career.  
  
He’s a senior accountant, which makes low 100k in Bay Area. Accounting isn’t extremely difficult. Also, he attended an easier university (SJSU). Plus, some accountants his age are managers, which make more.  
  
There’s people who studied more time consuming fields like medical school and dated. For where his career is, I feel might he might be making an excuse. There might be worse reasons like social or personality issues which interfered with him dating.

I told this stuff to my friend and she told me if she's being honest, I sound really judgmental and paranoid. I got annoyed and asked how? My friend said there was nothing that indicated the guy has any problem. I argued I only spoke to him for about 2 hours, so he could just be hiding something.

My friend said there are plenty of guys who will already have red flags showing just from things they say or their behavior. She said the fact that I didn't notice a single thing from this guy already shows I'm paranoid and judgmental. I got mad and said if anything, my friend is being naive.",0.76
"AITA for yelling at my boyfriend? Cross-posted with r/relationshipadvice.

My boyfriend (Tyler) and I have been together since the beginning of last school year. So, we’ve been together for more than a year now, and it had been going really well until recently. Tyler recently started hanging out with his friends a lot more often than with me. This would be okay, since I hang out with my friends a lot too, but he’s been ditching me to hang out with them. Always canceling our plans to play Overwatch or go to the gym or whatever. I never do that with him and my friends (the one time I did my friend was literally in the hospital). This had been going on for about a month and a half when the final straw came. It was spring break, so my family went on vacation and I didn’t see Tyler for almost a week. We came home yesterday, and Tyler was supposed to come over to just hang out and watch some movies. But at the last minute he texted saying he was going to Six Flags with his friends. It had been a long flight so at this point I‘m pretty pissed off. I call him and start ranting about how lately he’s been ditching me to do something or another with his friends. He says I’m being a baby and to calm down; I start shouting and say he’s downplaying the situation and choosing his friends over me. He crossed the line when he shouted too and brought up past trauma that I’ve had, saying it might be making me too emotional and blowing up the situation. I won’t mention what this trauma is unless absolutely necessary, but it had nothing to do with the argument and doesn’t make me have emotional outbursts or anything similar. So I hung up, and we haven’t texted or called since. I found out from my friend group what Tyler’s friend group thinks, and let’s just say we might be over. What should I do? Apologize?

"AITA for wanting my husband to start helping with the cat's litter box even though I made a deal with him six years ago that I'd always handle the litter box so that he'd agree to adopting a cat? Just what the title says. I'll try to be as concise as possible. My husband grew up with dogs but his family was never crazy about cats. On the other hand, I grew up with both cats and dogs and love them both. Not long after we were married in 2015, I started trying to convince him to get a cat. He was very reluctant at the time but I finally convinced him in 2018 with the caveat that I'd always handle the litter box. He agreed to that deal and whenever I ask him to start helping with it regularly, he reminds me of the deal and says I have to uphold it. 

I'm irritated because our life is a lot busier and chaotic now than it was in 2018. For one thing, we had a small apartment. And we lived the apartment life up until 2021 when we finally bought a house. We also have a 2.5 year old toddler who is the best kid ever. She's amazing and honestly, pretty chill for a toddler. But she is still a toddler and naturally demands a lot of our attention. My husband also works nights and every other weekend. I work the typical 9-5 office job but I'm also in school taking classes to study accounting. There's a lot of homework and studying. I'm the primary parent just because of my husband's work schedule but when he is home, he is an equal, active parent.

When he's home, he does a lot of stuff around the house. Both inside and outside. He does pretty much all of the yard work but I have started to take more of an active role outside. He feeds and waters our cat. I should also add that he loves our cat and she loves him. Ironically, my husband is her favorite human. 

Though we sometimes disagree on who does more and who has a bigger mental load, he is a great husband and equal partner in life and parenting. 

I'll also note that when I was pregnant, he handled the litter box for the entire 9 months without complaint. He'll also do it if I'm really sick or injured. That said, I am really annoyed that he still holds me to this deal. I just want him to start helping me scoop the litter box regularly and I'd like to take turns changing the pee pad once a week. It's not like I'm asking him to take over completely forever. But I'm so tired of the maintenance of the litter box. 

 I feel like I have so much on my plate already between work, school, taking care of our daughter, trying to keep up with the house, and many other things. I'm the one who handles our finances and I also meal plan and maintain our calendar and appointments. 

I want to add that my husband does a lot too. I've never been frustrated with him over him not doing his share of the housework. From what I've seen in the Mommit sub, I'm lucky. 

I just want to know who's the asshole here. He knows I'm posting in this sub and I told him I would accept whatever verdict it is, even if it's not in my favor. Yes, I made a deal. But life happens. Life changes. I feel like it's an asshole move of him to hold me to that deal. What are everyone's thoughts? This has been an recurring argument the last couple years.

"AITA for grossing my friend out I know from the title I sound like an AH and maybe I am.

I (16F) and my girlfriend (15F) and some friends were on a trip last weekend. On the way we made a stop

Me and my girlfriend separated from the group and went to the bathroom to make out. We don't do it in front of our friends because it's weird.

One of my friends (15F) came in after a few minutes and asked if we were okay. We said yes and made sure to specify that were having some couple time. She pretended to leave and after a few minutes she looked over the bathroom stall wall. The stalls are partially tall so it's not like she would accidentally see over. 

She was shocked and kept talking about how weird we were and how uncomfortable we made her feel. She went outside and told all our friends. 

This entire week she's been telling anyone who will listen. She's been screaming about it in class and in the hallways. We've both asked to stop because it makes us uncomfortable. 

Our friends mostly side with us but some side with her saying that we shouldn't be doing that anyway. I've had random people I don't even know ask me about it. I've had people from completely different grades asking about it. 

We've asked to stop multiple times and she won't. Tonight she sent us a long long paragraph about how she felt and she shamed us for making out. Our friends have all told her to stop and leave us alone but she won't.

Sorry for any mistakes. English is my second language

"AITA for asking a child to use the other side of the slide? Final update: I posted on the mommy group my apology. I got a direct message from the woman after it was posted. The part I heard them discussing about she had said she was telling her husband to keep an eye on their youngest child so that they didn’t hurt my daughter. She said that my daughter would never learn to not be afraid of the height of slides if she never experienced it, and that she hadn’t given the situation another thought, especially because I had t used a negative tone. I apologized again and she stressed to not worry about it because I had been reasonable trying to use the opposite side, moving to a slide on the other side of the park, etc. I mentioned that I’d put no thought into possibly setting an example of climbing the slide she didn’t want her children to follow and she said “That’s the thing about public places, you’re going to see and hear a lot of things you don’t want your kids to follow, but that’s the risk of a public place. Besides, you saw my children running up the slides. As long as they’re not going when someone is coming down it’s great for their development! Your daughter was just exploring the slide at a height she’s comfortable with.” I still feel like an AH but feeling a bit better after talking with the woman herself. Thanks all for your input

 I (31F) was at the park with my daughter (19 months) and there was another family there. They were on one side of the playground at the slides, and we were on the other side at the swings. My daughter wanted to explore so we finished up where we were. The children left where they had been to go to where we were, so we went over to the slides. 

The park has three slides, two of which have like a double slide (divider in the middle). Their youngest child (about 3 years old) climbed up the stairs while I had my back turned as I was supporting my  daughter climbing, and the other child slid down the exact same side of the slide. I caught it last minute and was able to move my daughter before she was knocked off. 

Their child went back up the steps and went to go down the exact same side of the slide. I waited for the parents to say something since they had been watching, and it was just us at the park so it’s not like it was too busy for them to see, but they didn’t, and their child went down again. 

Their child kept going back up the stairs and down the slide on only the sides my daughter was on (we had switched sides just in case the child preferred the side we were on), and I kept saying to the child “Can you go down the other side so you don’t knock her over please?” (or some variation of that). The mom said something once but that was it, and never reinforced it. 

We then went over to the other slide to try and the child did the same thing, and I kept saying something. I probably said this about 10 times to this child, but not sure I should’ve said anything, but also didn’t want to interrupt my own child’s play. The parents had clearly been talking about me saying something too (heard part of it). 

AITA for asking the other child to use the other side when their parents didn’t say anything? 

ETA: My daughters scared to use the slide from the very top (it’s her second time on it, ever). She kneels at the base, facing the top, puts her foot up one step, turns and slides down, we move out of the way. She had stood watching the child after, and I moved her saying “we are done our turn now we need to move so (their child) can go down.” Maybe climbing is the wrong term? My hope was to build her confidence doing this before trying to go down from the top again. But either way, I’m new to the parenting thing and wanted to know if I should be writing an apology on the mommy group. 

Edit 2: I never asked the child to use a different slide altogether, just the other section of the divided slide we were on. But got it. We had always been allowed to climb the slide when I was in school and hadn’t thought about when she goes since she isn’t even 2 yet. Will be issuing an apology on the mommy group today in case she’s in there ",0.86
"AITA For Asking Kids To Not Bang on the Bus Stop? I probably was, but I want outside perspective. Also, I'm on mobile.  So sorry about the formating. 

So I take the bus home. And tonight, there were some other people at the stop. That's not a problem. Everyone keeps to themselves. But they were screaming and singing. I have headphones so I don't care.

But then one of them started banging on the bus stop. The plastic covering an ad. It was not canceled by my headphones like it should have been so I asked them to not do that because it was going to give me a panic attack (which was true). They said sorry and asked if I was going to work. I wanted to end the conversation so I said yes and put my headphone back in. 

They didn't back off. They came closer and asked about my age. I'm alone at 10:30pm. I asked why that was important and they started calling me a Karen. I told them I'm an introvert and please knock it off and they kept doing it even on the bus.

"AITA for prioritizing my friend over my now ex fiancée? My (23M) friend (21M) came to me about 2 months ago covered in bruises. He came out to his family, and they didn't react well. He didn't have anywhere else to go and I didn't hesitate to let him in. I asked him to report his father but he didn't want to. Since then he has been super depressed and I've been trying my best to cheer him up to no avail. 

Well, about two weeks ago my ex-fiancée (28F) told me that she got tired of him being here and she wanted him gone. I told her that that wasnt gonna happen as he has no where else to go and I wasn't gonna kick him out on the street. She kept insisting that she wanted him gone and how he's taking my attention away from her and suggested he go live with my parents or my brother. She was NOT quiet about any of this and he heard it all. He came to us crying and told us that he didn't mean to be a burden and that he'll try to find somewhere else to go. 

This genuinely just made me upset and I assured him that he wasn't a burden. This led to my ex-fiancée and I getting into an argument. She told me that when we get married she wants him gone because she doesn't feel comfortable with him being here anymore. She told me that if he doesn't leave she would. So I told her she was welcomed to leave and I ultimately chose him over her. 

Since then, I've been getting phone calls from her family and friends for wasting her time, not prioritizing her over my friend, and for not allowing her to keep the ring. She's been posting on Instagram and Facebook about how I abandoned and humiliated her which have made me have to explain myself to people I don't even know. Her mom told me that it's best I didn't marry her since I wasn't man enough to prioritize her daughter over my friend and how her comfort should've been top priority. I don't know. This whole ordeal has only made my friend feel worse than how he was already feeling.

"WIBTA if I told my MIL to stop doing things without asking involving my child? On mobile, so deal with it. My husband (30M) and I (26F) married 2 years ago and had our first child last November. My in-laws (60s) are very supportive but I feel my MIL steps out of bounds sometimes. To give some context, early in our pregnancy, my husband and I have been going around stores and making a list of what to buy for the baby's room. One of the things on our list is the crib which we picked out the color for to match the room. As this was our first child, we're pretty excited and want to plan for it. Out of the blue, my MIL contacts us and said she's bought a crib for us. It was a neutral color and would work for the room and as far as a crib goes, it would do the job, but to be honest, the quality wasn't there and I was a little bit disappointed that I felt the choice to make for my child was stolen from me. We didn't say anything about it and just thanked her as she has already bought it. When the baby was born, she would continue to get things for us without asking first, but again wouldn't say anything other a thank you. Things like a baby jumper for example. I'm actually against this as after researching (which I do because I'm anal), read that it actually inhibits walking, etc. Again, we let it slide and just say our thanks though we would never use it. Recently, my MIL asks if we have plans for my baby's birthday. In my head, I'm like, ""What??? It's only April. Birthday is in November, why would I plan for it now?"" So naturally, we said no. A few days later, she sends my husband a couple of pics, of red dresses and shoes. (??) My husband asks what is this. MIL says which one of these would you like for baby's birthday and to ask me for my opinion too. We just opted for the more conservative option and I asked my husband if my MIL expects oirbaby to wear this on her bday. He doesn't know so he asks MIL, ""Is this for her to wear on her bday, or just a gift?"" My husband also adds not to make plans for our child's bday even though we have no plans yet. Apparently, my MIL blew up after this saying she's not making plans and it was just a gift, and now she's off pouting. Like a red dress as a gift? And not something she expects for us to dress our baby in on her bday? I'm confused. Baby's grow up fast and if she isn't wearing it then, then at what other occassion is she supposed to wear a red dress before she outgrows it??? Was my husband's question not valid?? Anyway, we she'll cool off in a few weeks, but I don't know what to do. Do we just accept things with a smile, or say something about it.

"AITA for telling my friend that pestering me about my driving was unwomanly? I am 22/f and have a 25/f friend, Aurora. I've known Aurora most of my life, but wasn't close with her in the past because she was friends with my brother and cousin (25 and 26 m) and back then, Aurora was a boy.  
  
My brother, cousin, Aurora, and me are all autistic but I was the only one who wasn't recognized as such when we were growing up. All 3 of them were never expected to conform to any social conventions or manners, had no chores or responsibilities, and were pretty much allowed to spend their lives in the basement playing video and computer games. Meanwhile, I was expected to conform perfectly to every female role of my culture, and many of them revolve around appearance and social niceties. I was horrible at all those things, and I did end up getting them all spelled out for me, but not in a nice way. More like a mean way constantly telling me I'm a failure and not good enough.   
  
Back in the day, my brother, cousin, and Aurora all bragged about how much they could get away with. They were capable of way more than the adults assumed, but pretended otherwise, to keep playing video games and being unhygenic. I had to clean up after them and they mocked me and treated me like a servant.   
  
Now the tables have turned because I can socialize like a neurotypical person but my brother, cousin, and Aurora don't have 1 social skill between the 3 of them. My brother and cousin assumed they would somehow get wives eventually who would cater to them just like I had to, but that never panned out for them. Aurora became a girl but feels she missed out on a lot because ""how to girl"" was spelled out and taught to me at the appropriate age, but she missed that. Aurora has asked me constantly to help her learn ""how to girl,"" mainly asking a ton of makeup and style advice.  
  
She has gotten better at makeup, hair, and style, but still struggles to make female friends. She thinks it's because of how she looks but it's actually because of her lack of social skills. She's frustrated with her lack of friends and keeps telling me she needs things ""spelled out"" because she's neurodiverse.   
  
So I was driving Aurora to the store. Aurora CAN'T DRIVE but thinks she's better than others at parallel parking because of her video game skills (dead serious). As I began to parallel park Aurora started shouting at me about which direction I should turn the wheel. I tried to tune her out and she yelled louder and chastised me for ignoring her, saying I was doing a horrible job.   
  
I told Aurora this was rude but also unladylike. It's a stereotype for men passengers to criticize women's driving. Women passengers generally don't criticize each other's driving ever. I said this because Aurora told me in the past she wanted it spelled out when she was ""failing to girl."" Her actions weren't JUST rude but they were rude in a way women associate with guys, so I told her that. Aurora was horribly offended and said I was an asshole. ",0.03
"AITA for standing up to my girlfriends family for her? I'm not entirely sure where to start this because this is my first time, but I have been dating my current girlfriend (and future wife) for 2 years now, going on 3. 

She (GF) has had a lot of trauma in her past, due to losing her younger sister at a very early age. Because of this,  she is terrified of standing up to her family in any way, and is very much so overly submissive when it comes to them asking her to do things/etc. because she is afraid that saying no will result in her losing them. 

One of her older sisters had a child around the time we met and started talking, and things started out fine and reasonable. She would have to watch the baby from time to time for her and her husband so they could have date nights, or go shopping/things of that nature. 

Fast forward two years to now, and they live with us and as of late, it has grown into a nearly every day thing, even after my girlfriend gets off of work. It's gotten so bad that on weekends, her only days off, she has to watch her kid for 7-10 hours a day while the sister sleeps and her husband is at work and on weekdays, after finishing a 7 hour shift, she is expected to watch their child for 2-3 hours until the father gets home. 

This, reasonably so, has been incredibly stressful and draining on her mentally and physically. I've hated seeing how this is affecting her, and so I finally stood up to her and asked for her to have access to her weekends, even if it's only one day for the time being. 

The sister blew up on me, saying it's not my place to bring it up and that I need to mind my own business. Because of this there's a lot of stress and frustration between them and us, but I don't see anything wrong with me standing up for my future wife when she's not able to stand up for herself. 

(For context, the toddler in question that constantly needs watched is on the spectrum and the mother refuses to pay for childcare because of this reason. They make $54/hr and her husband makes $20/hr so they can 100% afford a qualified specialized babysitter but refuse to do so.

Not only that, they refuse to pay my girlfriend for her time and expect her to give up 30-40 hours of her week unpaid to watch their child for them.)

I always felt left out because of him. Cause I would never hangout if he's there. So few days ago it was eid and per tradition we meet our friends and family. I was sad because my little sister humiliated me that day and we couldn't go to the new cat cafe in town with my friends. I cried. One of my friend Sara called me and even heard me cry.

When It was almost night my friend called me to hangout. I couldn't go outside that late cause my parents wouldn't allow me to. So I said no. Then I saw Sara's fb story. She and my other bff's were hanging out with M. Seeing that I felt betrayed. I felt like I wasn't important or the priority. I cried again. Told my boyfriend about it. He got mad and cussed the people who went to the hangout that day. I didn't ask him to cuss them out and he crossed the boundary. My friends called me and yelled at me because of him. And told me they had a sudden plan to hangout so they did and didn't ask me because I wouldn't go anyways. That's fair but at least they could've come to meet me at my house. I just wanted to meet them. Idc if they hangout with him or not. I just wanted them to meet me first then him. Anyways, my friends yelled at me that my boyfriend was nosy and was toxic and a red flag and I should just break up with him if I valued our friendship. I feel conflicted. I am still upset with them but they are my friends. And I am also upset with my boyfriend for doing such a dumb thing. But still I loved him. He never cussed me out. He did it to defend me even though it was an inappropriate thing to do. I feel conflicted. Help me out. Should I break up with my boyfriend? Or not.  What should I even do? I ignored him cause I felt overwhelmed with everything happening. Now he's crying and I feel so bad about it. I don't know what to do. My friends said I would be an ahole if I didn't break up ",0.6
"AITA for accidentally eating my mother's leftover pizza without knowing it was hers? My mother got home from being out with her friends at their home late through the night , she had broughten leftover pizza and set it in the fridge, not saying what it was once. I decided to go to the fridge and grab two slices as I had assumed it was for everyone, in the morning I had went to grab a slice before I hear ""Where the fuck did my two slices go?"" I had asked her what she meant and she had told me just now that there was two slices of pepperoni on top while the rest was works. I've apologized and decided to make supper tonight to show that I didn't know and it was an honest mistake as this has happened before but in reversed positions, so I suppose this is accidental not quite karma but more so an accidental semi-reoccurring mistake.",0.87
"AITA for telling my fiancé she has no clue about normal people's lives. Last night I(M25) and my fiancée Leah (F25) were spending some time together after I had got off work for some overtime. We ended up getting into all kinds of conversations and eventually landed on our upcoming summer wedding which was fun until Leah started talking about me taking time off work as the wedding approaches and I should completely cut out the overtime. 

For some context we've been dating since first yr of college and got engaged last year. Leah doesn't work per say and spends her time doing what she enjoys and some charitable work here and there. I actually really like that she gets to do charity work since she's always so cheerful about it. We still split most of everything 50/50 as her parents and grandparents are very wealthy and she has a trust and pays for whatever she needs from what she gets from that. Her parents are even fully paying for the wedding costs in excess of 200k out of pocket since she's their only child.

Now back to last night she tells me I should take time off etc and I explain that taking that amount of time off in this economy would just be plain stupid with all the layoffs happening, so I should make and save as much as I can for whatever might come. She plays it off like I don't need to worry so much about finances since I make more than most of our college friends plus I've got her money 'just in case'. So I told her she has little concept of day to day handlings of money and especially no clue about how 'normal people's' livelihood functions.

She got upset and said I was being an insensitive asshole. Leah seems like she's got over it since but can't help the feeling maybe I should apologise. Can't ask my mom for advice since she's so obsessed with the extravagant wedding and securing money from Leah's side of the family. So I keep her at arms distance when it comes to this.

"AITA for refusing to let my boyfriend’s friend send her mail to my house?  My boyfriend recently became friends with someone that goes to his university after he was able to help them out of a tough situation … she had to get home to visit a dying relative and he drove her there so she could make it in time to say goodbye. (I was also in the car while this happened). 

From what he’s told me, they had worked together on a couple projects by chance before that, but they were never really friends, “she’s nice but we’re very different”. 

Fast forward to today… she messaged him asking if she could get exclusive TS merch mailed to MY house in England so he could bring it back for her after he visits me next week. Apparently it is unavailable to send direct to their country. 


She might be a die hard swiftie for all I know… but it just seems weird that she’s reaching out to MY bf for this? I am concerned that him doing this for her puts him in a “hero” position again and might cause her to ask for more and more of him.

"AITA War Memorial argument  So yesterday I am out with family and friends at a birthday party having a really good time when I notice a war memorial remembrance statue to commemorate the soldiers lost during WWI but somebody had superglued a sticker in the shape of a love heart with the Ukraine flag on it, I personally thought it was disrespectful to vandalise a war memorial in effort to drum up attention for a current war that we all know is happening.

Some of the group agreed, other people in my group thought it was an amazing symbol that connects the soldiers from our past to the soldiers of today, I have always been very interested in WWI and WWII having lost family members in both wars and seeing a statue to commemorate the multiple men who didn’t make it home defaced to drum up support for a war that doesn’t even involve us had really annoyed me.

They all told me to leave it but I went up to the statue and ripped the sticker off and threw it away, everyone seemed to agree that I was in the wrong for that and said I was no better than the vandal who put the sticker there in the first place, I’d also vandalised the memorial in a way.

"WIBTA if I (F33) told my friend (M33) that his fiancée (F32) is too controlling? Hi all. Apologies for the long post, it is a tough one so bear with me. 

So I (F33) and my fiancé (M32) have a close group of friends who have all known each other since we were kids/teens. About six years ago our friend, Ben (M33) started dating this woman, Amy (F32). To put it simply, Amy is a nightmare.

She is loud, demanding and attention seeking, and very domineering of Ben. She is the most self involved, dramatic and exhausting person I have ever met by a long stretch. 

Last year, Ben privately told us that he was planning a trip abroad for them as a Christmas present, during which he planned to propose. He said that he expected their engagement will be a long one, and that while he knows Amy will want a big wedding, he secretly hopes that they could have a small wedding and that he hopes they can compromise. Amy has always been very vocal in her desire for a proposal, and I’ve only seen this increase since our engagement, as they are now the only long term couple in the group to not be engaged.

Fast forward to their engagement. On the day after they returned home from the trip, Amy sent us all a message saying that they wanted to have their wedding next Spring in a country a few hours flight from where we live. We’d all have to pay our own way. Amy said it wasn’t 100% decided yet, and that they still might have their wedding in our country. She wanted to know how many of us from Ben’s friend group would be able to go if they did it abroad.

While my partner and I love Ben, and would hate to miss his wedding, we decided that with planning our own wedding (which will be around the same time), we just wouldn’t be able to swing it financially. We told them our decision and that if they decided to have it in our country we would definitely come.

So with all that background, here is where I might be TA:

Last night, my partner, Ben, and another friend (M33, Tim) were playing Xbox online over headset. 

Amy came home, drunk, and shouted over the headset to Tim, asking if he was going to go to their wedding as he hadn’t yet answered their message. Tim’s response was the same as ours. Amy then said “Ben doesn’t want to do it in -country-, but it’s what I’ve wanted since I was a little girl, so…”
Ben then says “yeah, I don’t want to do it in -country-“ in a resigned way.

When my partner told me this morning, I was livid. Ben isn’t going to have three of his oldest friends at his own wedding because she wants to have a party in an exotic location? 

I want to talk to Ben and make him see that it’s a massive red flag if the person you’re marrying can’t compromise. Couldn’t they have their honeymoon at that place? Why expect everyone you know to fork out the cash to go but if they can’t, too bad? 

My partner says it’d be stepping over the line to say anything, and it’d look like I was only trying to change their wedding so that we could go.

My wife on the other hand, has been working since 24. She's a social worker, 125k a year. So for the past 8 years we've been together, she's always made more than I do, (125k v. 60k max) and footing most of the bills and stuff. It's something I'll probably always appreciate her for. 

Well, ever since I've started working, we've been more heavily saving for a house, an emergency fund,  a fund for our kids (1F, and pregnant with a another), and retirment, yet still leaving us with a lot of fun money. By the way, no car debt. 

My wife has been asking for gifts that are probably in the 1-2k range, which I obviously don't mind since she's been supporting me for the Past couple years. But it's becoming a every couple weeks to once a month ask, which I think is a bit excessive. When I try to bring it up with my wife, she just tells me not to worry about it,  even though I feel I shoulf worry about it.

"AITA for “kidnapping” my stepson? I (25M) have been married to my wife, Colleen (30F) for a year. Coleen has 2 kids with her ex husband, her kids are Aiden (12M) and Oisin (11M).  
  
I met Colleen when I was working at a local sports center pretty fresh out of college, Oisin would practice for basketball there and Colleen asked me out one day a few months into working there. I recently started a job as a sports scout (my BA is in sports management).   
  
Aiden isn’t athletic at all, unlike Oisin. Their dad isn’t into sports either so Oisin has naturally gravitated towards me as a role model and I spend the most time with him.  
  
Colleen and her ex technically have joint custody of the kids, but right now Oisin mostly spends time with us (specifically me) and Aiden with his dad, as Oisin and Aiden don’t get along whatsoever. Oisin is very sweet, but he can be a handful, especially when his (again, very sweet) friend on his basketball team with ADHD is around. This boy is amazing and a great friend but his ADHD makes him very hyper.   
  
Aiden is a very quiet kid, he has friends and most of them are bookworms like him, they do Model UN together. I’ve tried connecting with Aiden because my brother (16M) does Model UN at the high school, but they haven’t really connected well.  
  
Colleen and her ex are on good terms, and he seems fine with me. Last weekend, Colleen had a conference for work. Normally, as I said, Aiden would be with his dad, but their grandpa (Colleen’s ex’s dad) had a fall, he’s expected to fully recover but her ex was in the hospital.  
  
I was left alone with Aiden and Oisin. Oisin had his girlfriend (11F) over. Oisin’s gf plays basketball as well and they’ve both been watching everything with Caitlin Clark and watch the WNBA as well. They were in the living room watching something WNBA or college basketball related when Aiden came in and asked why Oisin liked to watch “lesbians” on TV. Aiden went on some rant about how only “lesbians” play basketball and was calling Oisin some homophobic words. I told Aiden to stop but he wouldn’t.  
  
I then told Aiden if he stopped I’d take him to the comic book store he loves. I took him there and bought him some stuff, and on the way home, I asked him about his behavior. He defended himself, saying he was just “telling the truth” and said I should “be a man” and not get offended so easily.  
  
When Colleen got home, he said I “kidnapped” him, because I “tried to trap him” into a “bullshit” conversation. Colleen told him to cut it off, but Aiden won’t stop calling me a kidnapper, and saying “I’m not his real dad” (which I understand) and I’m wondering if I went too far. AITA?",0.97
"AITA for asking my religious friend why god created Hitler? I'm a strong atheist, leaning into anti-theist. My personal beliefs on religions behind, I don't really mind people who are religious. As a specific example, one of my friends, Diego (fake name) just randomly said to me ""I know, like, I believe in god and you don't, but that's chill."" We haven't talked about religion in the 7 months since then. This is how I think with most religious people I encounter IRL. Some are more annoying than others, but I rarely get annoyed with religious people when not online.  


Now, it gets to my friend James. James is quite religious. He is Muslim and will do the regular practices like fasting for Ramadan and praying daily. Now don't get me wrong, I have absolutely no problem with this. I personally believe all religions are equally stupid beliefs, but for everyone I understand cultural and social practices like celebrating Ramadan or Christmas. If this is where it stood, I would keep my mouth shut. However, ever since James found out I was an Atheist (I wasn't bringing it up, he asked), he has been trying to convert me. 

&#x200B;

Randomly throughout the day (We go to the same school), he will say ""Why don't you convert?"" and will CONSTANTLY send me TikToks of pastors and amateurs preaching about silly stories. As you may imagine, he had a field day when ""Noah's Ark"" was found in Turkey. If you're confused about this, so was I. He is a devout Muslim, and Noah's Ark is a Christian belief. Normally when he would send this stuff, I would just brush it off with a ""Haha okay"" or just ignore it, but eventually after the 20-something-ish TikTok of a pastor dancing around college kids' questions, I snapped. I had only ever sent one rebuddle before, and that was asking how Kangaroos got to Australia after disembarking the Ark while leaving no traces throughout the Middle East. His only response to this was ""Boat"", and when I replied by saying that the Bible says the Ark was deconstructed in the Middle East, he never replied.

&#x200B;

Anyway, back to the title. I was fed up, so I sent this exact message: ""Then riddle me this Mr. Worship: Why did God create Hitler? Because either: -he knew what he was going to do and didn't stop him, meaning he's not all-loving. -he didn't know what he was going to do, meaning he's not all-knowing. or, -he knew what he was going to do and couldn't stop him, meaning he's not all-powerful."" Obviously, he didn't respond, so a few days later I sent ""Well?"". We are pretty good friends besides this and see each other every day in school. Our friend culture is kind of razzing each other and pushing boundaries, so this fits in well. But did I go too far? Our friendship has persisted, but people I've told about this have been split 50/50 on whether I was TA or not. Thoughts?",0.09
"AITA for falling for a horrible prank Ok so i got a text from one of my friends that she really likes a guy and she told me that he likes me so i shouldn't text him. And i agreed. Then i saw his text and he had written a paragraph about me expressing his feelings. So i thought that i would talk to him and politely reject him.

But by that time she had already blocked me and her other friend also texted me calling me a shitty friend. And i genuinely felt so sorry.

So i got really pissed off at her for blocking me for something so stupid.

"AITA for telling my mother to stop rambling? I (18) and my mother (40) haven't always had the best relationship with each other, which I suppose is expected given the situations we've been in. For context, my mother was abandoned by my father when I had just turned 2, the man fled the country, remarried, had 2 kids, built up a successful tree surgeon business. Despite all this, he never once paid any form of child support, offered any assistance to her or me whatsoever and even barred me from obtaining a passport until my mother finally had enough money to take him to court. 

As for my mother's side of the family, they're in no position to help anyone. Our lives haven't been very smooth but she made do and I can't express how much I appreciate that. However, throughout most of my life, I felt as though my existence was ruining my mother's life as she couldn't afford to return to her home country (South Africa), which of course lead to friction. 

With that out of the way, I'll move onto the argument which led me to make this post.

This morning (Sunday) I was looking forward to spending time with my mother, after we'd finished cleaning the house. I've been feeling very isolated and alone lately as my only friend is moving with their life. When I asked to spend time with my mother however, she replied that she was busy and didn't want to go out (I'd suggested we go fishing as we live near a trout fishery, which she'd been going on and on about ever since we moved). 

When I expressed that I was feeling lonely, she simply told me that she doesn't get much time off before going on what I can only describe as a tirade about how I was ""burying my head in the sand"", ""wasn't thinking about my future"" (she expected me to be fully independent by 16, job, flat and all.). This happens pretty often so at a certain point I just end up drowning her out.

At some point during her tirade, I started to become irritated and cry before telling her that she was being inconsiderate of my feelings and all I wanted was to spend time with her. When I realised there was no point in carrying on speaking to her about the topic, I asked where the trash bags were, as I needed to clean out out cat's litter tray. My mother didn't answer me, instead continuing on about how ""the world is my oyster""and I'm ""squandering my opportunities"". This went on for 30 minutes before I eventually told her to ""stop rambling"" and just tell me where the trash bags were.

"AITA For Not Being “Nice” to Boyfriend’s Parents?  I (F26) have been dating (M25) for 2 years. I first met his parents about a month into dating and I tried my best to be nice. Prior to meeting them, he was telling me how kind and calm his parents were so I was excited to meet them.  

I would offer them food and greeted them respectfully like how I treat my own parents. I brought them gifts as well for holidays. I would always make sure to make small chat with them and ask them about their lives. I noticed that since the first day I met them, they seemed aloof. They didn’t say hi or speak to me unless I did it first, or offer me anything. They treated my bf and his friends kindly. 

As I was speaking with the father, he realized that I spoke Chinese so he started making mean comments in Chinese so my bf would not understand such as:

1. Saying his kids are better than me and I have been “lying flat” which is an internet term for doing nothing in life. He said that he was proud of his kids and how great they were, and that I need to strive to be like them. For context, one of his kids did not find a job after graduation and is still looking for a role whereas I have a professional job. 

2. When it was a cold winter blizzard at night, he told me to book an Uber as I don’t drive and he doesn’t want his son to drive me home. He said that he and his wife cannot sleep or have peace until their son is safe in bed and that I am bringing trouble into their household. 

3. He told me that I am an “older sister” and that I need to lead a better example for their son by doing XYZ such as going home at a time before 8 pm. 

Otherwise, he ignores me or makes minimal small talk. 

When I brought it up to my boyfriend, he said he will speak with his father not to make comments. He tends to be a pacifist that “wants everyone to be happy” in his own words. 

One day I asked if he noticed his parents were not treating me kindly and with respect. He said that he knew but didn’t think it was a big deal even though I told him the things his father told me. When I asked him to stand up for me, he tells me did. But, his parents started acting exaggerated, for example, when they see him, they act as if he was a long lost child and hug his profusely, telling him to come home often, etc then awkwardly looking at me and walking away. Their behaviour has seem little improvement over the entire relationship. My bf defends them saying that he only talked to them 3-4 times about this issue so far and to give them patience and kindness. 

When I tell him I do not think it is acceptable to be treated so poorly, he states he is sorry for it and that yes, that sucks. Over time, I no longer go out of my way to be kind to his parents but continued to be respectful. He told me that if I do this, then I need to accept the consequences of my actions.

A few close friends and I have recently been playing an indie game called 'Content Warning' in which a group of four travel to a factory to record ghosts for a fictional video platform called 'SpookTube'.

We had planned to start at 7 p.m. today, but one of our regular players (I'll call them Meansy) was unable to make the last session. Earlier, I made a random off-comment in the Discord to which Meansy responded with a question mark almost immediately, so I asked them if they would be able to make it tonight. A few minutes passed with no response, and I left a message reading, ""Hey, it's alright if you can't make it tonight; just let me know!"". More time passed without any response.  
After about half an hour, Meansy responds to my message on Discord, telling me that they were on the phone with their mother and couldn't reply immediately. They scolded me for my impatience and insulted my ""awfully short attention span"". I was bewildered and responded a little harshly, asking why they assumed the worst from my message when I was only asking if they would be able to make it.

"AITA For ""Telling"" My Half Sister That She Needed To Change Her Name If She Wanted A Relationship With Me? Throwaway Account   


I (30m) used to have a sister ""Selena"" but she passed away when she was 6. She was sick since she was 4 so it wasn't unexpected but my mom and I were still heartbroken. When Selena passed away my mom was inconsolable. My grandpa had to make all the funeral arrangements and my father didn't even show up. He always said he couldn't bare to look at my sister in that way. That first year after her passing was rough all my mom wanted to do was cry. My father didn't and hated my mom for bringing Selena up so much. Then one day my dad walked in and told my mom that he got another woman pregnant and wanted a divorce. This news was not well received and it nearly pushed my mom over the edge. Thank god we had her sisters and friends to her through. 

I did NOT want to meet my father's new woman and physically lashed out when he or his family tried to push it. I don't know what this woman was thinking but she thought it was a good idea to name her newborn daughter ""Selena"" and my father didn't stop her. My paternal side said that she felt it was her way honoring my sister as if it weren't for her (a.k.a. her dying) then she and my dad wouldn't have gotten together. I told her, my dad, and his family that if they kept the name then I would be done with them and never acknowledge his other daughter as my sister. They didn't so I kept true to my word. As far as people knew I only ever had one sister. 

My mom and I both got therapy and were living decent lives. I worked hard, made smart choices and have a really good job, car, and have a house that I'll have fully paid off in 5 years. I'm also engaged to a wonderful woman ""Erica"" (32f) who has a sister ""Emily"" (18f) and she's great and we've developed a nice bond. Since the engagement I have publicly acknowledged Emily as my ""second sister."" 

I'm not sure how but Selena #2 found out and reached out asking me how come I never call or see her and why I can make time for Emily and take her to so many cool places but never her. I didn't respond the first time she reached out and then blocked her when she kept asking. A few cousins have told me how she's really upset about this and Erica convinced me to at least tell her, so I unblocked her and we had a video chat where I explained everything. Selena #2 was shocked as she didn't know that Selena was my sister's actual name and relatives only referred to her by the nickname she had. 

I'm told that Selena #2 and her mom are fighting and that she blames her parents for screwing up a relationship with me. Selena #2 wants a relationship and I told her that while I don't hold what her parents did against her the name she carries is still a sore spot for my mom and I so it's best that she just move on with her life.

"AITA for speaking to my neighbour despite my friends asking me not to I had some friends over (all F, mid-20s) for my bday. We had been day drinking and it was around 2AM. My friends started playing loud music, which I should have asked them to turn down but was feeling anxious about saying it, and inevitably it disturbed the neighbours...

So, after a few minutes of loud music, we hear banging on the front door. Not sure who it is, we immediately turn off the music. The knocking continues and the man was asking to come in so we all got pretty spooked. Then, the man knocks on the back window. The house backs into a backstreet, and now I could see through the windows that it was my next door neighbour (M, 40s).

I have never met my neighbour, but my housemate (who wasn't present) has spoken of him highly. Also, I live in a really safe neighbourhood for context. One of my friends had also met this man before and we tried to reassure everyone that it's just the neighbour- don't worry.

I opened the back door to go speak to him. After all, IATA at this point, who caused the issue with the loud music, and I wanted to apologise and smooth things over.

My friends (except the one who had met the neighbour) where all all extremely fearful and telling the man to go away. So, I shut the door and had a really pleasant chat with the man, who was obviously not a threat. During this time, my friends asked that I come back inside and that the man goes away several times. I felt safe and they could see me through the window, looking calm and not in danger, and then I came inside after around 10 mins.

When I came inside, I was pretty surprised that all of my friends (except the 1 who had already met the neighbour) were saying that I had made them feel betrayed in my response to the situation. That I ignored their needs and prioritised this man's needs over theirs, despite them having traveled to see me. That I invalidated their feelings, despite them telling me that they felt unsafe.

In the morning, 2 of my friends left without saying goodbye. They were still very upset with me. One of them said she had been crying all night by the way I handled the situation.

I can see how they reacted in response to a perceived threat and their fear was very real to them, however the reality to me was that the threat did not exist. I can see how they felt I was putting them in danger, although the threat did not exist. And also, we caused the issue with the loud music in the first place.

So, AITA?

TLDR; we played really loud music at 2AM, the neighbour knocked on the door and I spoke to him despite my friends feeling unsafe, however there was no real threat. AITA to my friends?",0.01
"AITA for having a work-bestie? Me and my, now, work-bestie (let’s call her Maria) started working at this company a few months ago. We joined the company at the same time and directly bonded. We have two younger bosses - Victoria (28) and Chloe (26). At first everything seemed just fine and I thought I had great bosses who really understood me, but learned quite quickly that’s not the truth. They started “resenting” us for getting along well. Mind you, we were never loud, annoying, disregarding other coworkers or anything similar - hence my surprise. They would always talk to Maria how some coworkers feel excluded. We were truly taken aback cuz we also get along with everyone else. I decided to ignore it and be even more careful, but it didn’t stop. A few days ago Maria’s dad came to the store we work at 5 minutes before the end of her shift to pick her up (she’s 16 and in Europe you can’t drive alone until you’re 18). The next day we had a meeting about families coming to our workplace and how we should refrain from inviting them. We were floooored. But that wasn’t the end of it. Anytime we shared a small laugh, we would get a looks from them and soon enough would be called to a meeting about “coworkers” feeling left out. By now it was more than clear it was just the two of them. We really did not treat them any differently than the rest of the team and it really got annoying. Today we had a meet up for the video we were making as a part of the wedding gift for another colleague. After filming, a few of us were just randomly sitting on the registers and one colleague decided to take some photos of us. After those were sent in the work group, our bosses were jealous YET AGAIN. The comments were: “Weren’t me and Chloe not allowed to participate as well? 🙈😁” - that’s what Victoria wrote and Chloe responded: “That’s cuz they also wanted to be pretty 😄🙈”. I am truly speechless and annoyed at them for acting so childish. I called them out and they want to talk to me on monday. I’m pretty sure I’m getting fired. So dear redditors, am I the asshole?",0.18
"AITA for wanting to eat lunch in front of house guests? My wife’s family came to our house for an infant CPR class. The class started at 2, they arrived by 1pm. I made a comment to my wife about ordering/getting lunch at 1:15 because all I’d eaten was breakfast. She told me it’s rude to eat in front of people, and I shouldn’t do it. I’d gone to the driving range from 11-12:45 otherwise I’d have eaten sooner, so this wasn’t intentional it’s just how my schedule aligned. 

I asked if nobody else has had lunch, or if they expected us to provide lunch, and my wife said she wasn’t sure but most people probably have eaten already. 

Then I said that I feel like a stranger in my own home when her family comes over, this is just one incident of many, and my wife completely freaked out. Had a small temper tantrum and told me to not “do this.” Needless to say we never even discussed what to eat/order and if we should ask our guests if they wanted anything. 

After that, she told me to eat in my office alone, or go eat somewhere else but be back by 2pm. How is that not the literal definition of making someone a stranger in their own home? Is it my fault our lunch schedules don’t align? 

I just went to our bedroom for 45 minutes and stayed alone until the class began, of course I’m sure this made people think less of me, but I couldn’t stomach faking it when my wife just did what she did. How should I handle this kind of issue with her family moving forward?",0.9
"AITA for trying to protect my dad? I (15M) lost my mom when I was still a toddler, making me an only child with a single dad (40). He is originally from Asia but moved here to Europe for his wife, making me Asian-European.

My dad isn't your typical masculine figure. He exudes a more feminine demeanor, both in appearance and personality. He looks young, cute, and pretty, but also soft, kind, and innocent (kinda like one of those kpop idols). Despite that, he is still a great dad, being able to raise me like a man while also able to nurture me like a mother would. I love my dad so much and would die for him. But, sometimes I worry about him, especially when he goes out for work or other activities.

As I mentioned, my dad's unfamiliarity with our surroundings plus his unique character often lead to trouble. He gets into more trouble than I did as a child (although I was too mature as a child as well). I remember almost losing him SEVERAL TIMES. One particularly memorable incident was when I lost contact with him for an entire night (I always message him every few minutes to check in with him). I knew his schedule so when I noticed he wasn't coming home and responding to any of my messages, I panicked and even contacted the police. Thankfully, he came home the next morning. Apparently, he 'forgot' the way home and got lost. What's worse is that he was also offered to stay at somebody's home which he naively accepted. Thankfully, they were a kind elderly couple who mistook him for a lost child (You see now how I always get worried about him?). But perhaps the most terrifying experience was when my dad had to undergo surgery abroad, leaving me alone with my grandparents for several months. Both incidents happened when I was less than 8yo. I truly love my dad and the thought of losing my only parent always haunts me.

Just yesterday, while working on my school assignment, my dad came and mentioned wanting to 'hang out' with his friends. This immediately set off alarm bells for me because I know for a fact that he doesn't have any (he considers his therapist as friend 🙁). Naturally, I began asking him questions about these 'friends.' Admittedly, it may have come across as an interrogation, but I never expected his reaction. For the first time, my dad raised his voice and scolded me, accusing me of being controlling. His words hit hard, and I realized that I may have been unintentionally overbearing in my efforts to protect him. It's a wake-up call for me, and I feel terrible for making him feel that way. He's been ignoring me since and it's breaking my heart. Reflecting, I recognize that I've often been the one in a position of authority within our family dynamic. But I do so because I love him and I want to protect him.

So AITA here? Am I being too possessive, or is it justifiable concern for my dad's well-being? Also, I can't help but wonder if our family dynamic is unique to us as I've noticed differences compared to my friends' families.",0.19
"AITA for yelling at my brother for making me end my birthday celebration early? I (20f) turned 20 recently and my mom said I could go to the mall to celebrate. I was excited and I went to one store. However, I didn't get to go see other stores because my brother, 15 (autistic, I'm autistic too) threw a fit over a smoothie and my mom said we had to go early. He also was mad that he couldn't find stores he liked despite there being a bunch. I told her it isn't fair and almost had an autistic meltdown and my brother apologized to me for making us leave early and he asked if I was ok. I yelled, ""no I'm not ok!

"AITA For melting down my great grandfathers ring to make a ring for myself? Years ago I was given my great grandfathers pinky ring by my cousin because I was already an interested in my family history. None of us knew him or had any sort of connection to him, it was just something they had managed to hold onto. The ring was broken (they had to cut it off his finger when he died.) so it’s not like I could wear it. 

I decided I wanted a signet ring and found a local jeweller that could make me one. When I went to visit him he mentioned that he was melting down some old jewelry to recycle it and it clicked with me. I asked him if I could take an existing ring, melt it down and use it to make a new ring. He said yes, examined the ring and then told me how much extra gold would be needed to make a ring that I would want.

I got the ring and I love it, and I proudly went and showed my family. My cousin saw it and o told her “I had them use Bills ring you gave me to make it.”

And she was pissed. She accused me of destroying a piece of family history, and ruining it. She told me if she knew I was gonna go that she never would have given it to me. Did I really do wrong? I thought this would be an amazing way to give the ring a second life rather than sitting in my drawer for the past decade",0.65
"AITA for wanting my son to treat my girlfriend with respect? My ex-wife and I got divorced 2 years ago. We have a 15 year old son who we share custody of. He spends one week with me and one with my ex.

My girlfriend and her daughter moved in with me at the beginning of this year. My son and her have been getting along better than I could’ve hoped for but lately he’s been acting dismissive towards her and her daughter.

Last week, we found out that we’re going to have a child together. We broke the news to the children today over dinner. Her daughter was excited to have a younger sibling but my son didn’t seem too happy. 

After dinner, I asked him if there was something bothering him. He asked if we were really going to have a child and how I could be sure that it’s mine. I told him that there was no way to talk about someone and he reacted by doubling down on his statement and calling her a homewrecker and a gold digger. 

He was getting pretty loud so I told him to either calm down and talk to me in a normal tone or to go to his room to cool off. He decided to go back to his mom’s house instead. I agreed to drive him because I didn’t want him walking through half the city after dark. 

I told my girlfriend what happened and she thinks I should text him before going to bed and let him take his time to respond without being pressured. I did receive a text from my ex though, in which she called me an asshole amongst other things for kicking my son out in favor of my girlfriend. 

Which is something I never did. I didn’t want him to leave but I also didn’t want to force him to stay here when he insisted on leaving.

I also think my ex might be behind my son’s reaction since she can’t stand my girlfriend. None of the accusations sounded like something my son would say, especially since my girlfriend is contributing to rent and groceries because she’s an adult who can pay for herself.


Edit: I think some people are projecting their own issues onto my post and are making a judgment based on that insteast of what I actually wrote. My ex and I agreed to get a divorce because we'd grown apart and just weren't happy anyomre. Neither of us cheated and my son knows that. My girlfriend and I met 4 months after my ex and I separated and started dating 2 montha later. She didn't meet my son until we were both sure that our relationship was serious.

Edit 2: my ex and I were only married for 9 years, I don't know why some people are claiming it's been 2 decades. I'm 39 and my girlfriend is 26. Her daughter is 7 and her father hasn't been in the picture since she was a baby.

Because a lot of comments kept asking for a more detailed timeline:

- november 2018: my ex wife and I separated
- spring 2019: my girlfriend and I officially started dating
- september 2019: divorce process started
- winter 2019: my son and my girlfriend met
- october 2021: our divorce was finally made official
- february 2024: my girlfriend and her daughter moved in with me

We just learned that my husbands ex-wife and her live in b/f plus my husband's daughter and her family are all accompanying his son and his family to DW the day after the party. There are no plans for us to get together with any of them before or after the day of the party. They've done this before and when we've gone to other events we are virtually ignored.

"WIBTA to make known unfair raffle practices at an elementary school that benefit more disadvantaged kids? My kids school has over 50% free/reduced lunch kids, so we get extra funding, etc to support. Our school PTA is under supported and struggles for support for school activities and only 10-12 parents max consistently help plan and execute school dances and movies and things, but there's great turnout for these things. Once a year is a school carnival, which relies on a ton of volunteers and support and is the primary fundraiser for the pta. Every year businesses and families donate gift cards and items so there is a random drawing winner for each raffle item. During 2 hours of the carnival, families can buy raffle tickets to put in the individual bags for the drawings for each item.  This year there were over 100 different baskets or gift cards raffled off. They always lock down 30 min before the end fonthe carnival event with a few people locked in the room with the bags, and they post the winners 30 minutes later. It's essentially a few school staff and family members who do it.

I have supported the school for years and was pta president the last 2 years. I want to support the pta, so I always buy $70-130 worth of tickers, and figure it's a great donation purpose but also fun to win gift cards. A handful of other bidders go over $50 but many are under $20, it seems. Last year I won nothing at all. Surprised, but no big deal. 

This year I noticed and bid on items with good odds and not many other tickets entered for them. Since there were over 100, it seemed overwhelming for the volunteers to draw for them, so I offered for the first time ever to help draw. 

Once the door was locked and it was just those of us drawing tickets, I was told they had made a rule for this year that no one would win more than 2 items. This wasn't mentioned in any of the rules posted or handed out around the room. So my 100 tickets won about 12 items, but I was told to go redraw winners on them to spread out the winners. All 6-7 other volunteers were on board with this. They also cringed when people kept winning. Ultimately time ran out and while we redrew 10-20 of the items to fewer ticket-buying winners (at least 4 of them were one I originally won), we had to just post it because it was taking forever and people were waiting to find out. There were 3-4 people who won 5+ items, but all of us lost items we technically won, I am just the only one who knows.

I feel divided about whether this should be publicly known. Part of me feels anyone who bid at this raffle should know what was happening behind closed doors so they have to publicly draw raffle names. Part of me feels like I would be an asshole for publicizing what happened and should handle it more discreetly. But it's ultimately a fundraiser, not a participation trophy, so why can't I feel like if I spend $75 I am entitled to every basket I win?",0.25
"AITA for telling my fiancé I regret moving in with him? I (19f) just moved in with my fiancé (22m). Yesterday was our first night together. 

Now, this is a throwaway account because what I’m going to talk about is very personal and somewhat shameful for me. 

I suck my fingers at night. Just as children suck their thumb, I do the very same thing with my two fingers. I know it’s an awful thing to do for someone as old as me, but my mum tried everything to make me quit as a child and I couldn’t — the bitter nailpolish, wearing gloves to sleep, braces, everything. I’ve been doing this forever and it’s more than a habit now, I can’t fall asleep unless I do that. Again, I know I should have worked on myself but I have come to accept this part of me and don’t even want to change it since it is a source of comfort and doesn’t affect my hygiene. Likewise, I smell and hug my pillow to sleep and like to have a pocket watch ticking when I doze off. 

I told my fiancé about all this before we decided to begin living together. He reassured me that he understood, that this was ok, that he wouldn’t mind, that he doesn’t think less of me and I was very grateful. Well, yesterday I finally moved in (all my things are here already, I gave up the keys to my old apartment, in short, I’m settled) and it was our first night together as well. 

We cuddled a bit at first which was nice and then I fell asleep doing everything I usually do, except I remember I fell asleep holding his hand. In the morning, he wasn’t in bed so I just went about my business and did what I do every morning (wash my hands and brush my teeth). Then, I went to find him. 

He said he was disappointed in me, that I didn’t do anything to ‘include him’ in my sleeping routine, that he had this fantasy of his beloved falling asleep on his chest and instead I was there, on the other side of bed. 

I genuinely apologised he felt that way and that if he wanted to, I could make compromises to make sure he feels loved and cherished when we fall asleep. He shook his head and told me I was a child and that my eccentricities are a burden. 

I felt awful and pretty much spent the morning on my own wondering whether I had just moved in with a man who couldn’t stand me and whether he still wants me around. He joined me in the afternoon but instead of actually talking he just played with my hair and said he wanted to cuddle. I sort of broke down in that moment because I’d been anxious all day and when he asked if I’ll try to do better I teared up and said I wished I hadn’t moved in with him. 

I regretted instantly because he was genuinely hurt: he was the one who asked me to move in and organised the logistics of it. Besides, I love him very much and it feels awful to be rejected in such a way. ",0.06
"AITA for calling out a group of boys during a presentation? I (17F) am apart of a group that gives presentations about what my particular club (drama) does and offers. Usually these presentations are given to younger years (think 13 to 15)

I've always struggled with really bad social anxiety, though it had improved dramatically, but i was still trembling before I even got in front of one of the groups I and another member were supposed to speak to. This particular group consisted of about 20 to 25 kids. (Note, we were the only group who didn't have the teacher/adult who ran the club present with us)

Now, the day prior I was already attempting to hype myself up for it. I even bought a ton of candy to sort of encourage the kids to participate in the activities we had. I already had a fear that these kids were going to be a handful and I expected to be made fun of. 

During this presentation, I noticed a group of boys in the back talking, smiling and laughing. My other speaker sorta got onto them (moreso the whole group) before I said anything. Again, they kept talking. So, while I was asking for voluteers for one of the activites, I specifically singled out the boys who'd be laughing/smiling/talking the whole time (I have no idea what they were discussing or if it was just a random conversation and me, already being nervous, immediately became defensive because of how insecure I felt standing up there speaking)

I remeber they went quiet and I said, ""what's wrong? You guys are so quiet for someone who had so much to say when someone else is talking."" I gave a small lectured to them, too. Something to the effect of how easy it was for them to laugh at us while we're speaking when they're not the ones up there doing what we were doing. A few lines about how to be in this club it means having to be able to get over yourself and be willing to look stupid. 

You know teachers will lecture a class thats talking too much or acting out? Thats exactly what I sounded like. Except, I'm 17, what right do I really have to speak to kids only a few years younger than me like that?

Said group of kids in question had two 17 y/os, like me, chaperoning them (student council). Come to find out both of them had taken videos of me speaking and talking and posted said videos into the student council group chat. I was able to read them messages, which were essentionaly them saying that me and my partner speaker were being rude and calling on the kids for no reason. Some of the messages were pictures of us speaking or engaging in the activities while poking fun and calling us annoying,, etc etc.

Two weeks after, I apologized to one of the caporones who had been the one to first begin talking about us in the group chat. I said I was out of line. She responded and said, ""no, I get it. You're fine. Those kids were bad""

I assume this was her lying to me, given what she had said previously. 

So, AITA for calling on those kids during my presentations?",0.84
"AITA for changing who I’m going with To a concert? So when I saw that Nicki Minaj tickets were on sale, I immediately messaged my friend who messaged another one our our friends to make sure I should get tickets for all of us. Let’s name them sarah and Gabbie. A couple days before tickets went on sale, someone that I went to college with (let’s call her Lucy) put on her social media that she would love to go but doesn’t have anyone to go with. I messaged her asking if she would like to join me, Sarah and Gabbie and she said she’d love to. 

I messaged both of them to let them know and they seemed a bit weird about it. Gabbie said that she wished it was just us three that were going but I didn’t see it as a big deal since we’re gonna be at a concert surrounded by strangers lol. so a month or so goes by and I recently got a message from Gabbie and she had all these questions about Lucy such as ‘is she still coming?’  ‘Is she travelling with us?’. She then said that she wants to be able to make inside jokes with us three without making Lucy feel excluded. 

THEN Gabbie says that as it is an expensive trip (which I fully understand) she doesn’t feel comfortable going with someone that she doesn’t know well and said she wants her to go with someone else…. Looking back maybe I should have confirmed with Sarah and Gabbie that they’re okay with Lucy coming  but I honestly didn’t think it would be a problem as I said earlier, we are gonna be in a crowd with loads of people we haven’t met before. 

I’m a bit frustrated. I had met up with Gabbie a couple days before and she could have talked to me about it in person. I did the best I could in being calm with my response. Essentially I replied saying that I can see it from her point of view, but I didn’t think it was much of a problem and that it’s a bit of a shock that it all just came out of nowhere. I then said that if it comes to it , me and Lucy can go seperately. I was wishing that happened anyways as Gabbie made a comment a few weeks before about a post Lucy put on her social media which was a bit harsh. 

 Perosnally I think it is a bit selfish of her to ask Lucy to go with someone else just like that. Aswell as this I think that as I was the one who bought the tickets and originally suggested that we go, it’s cool if I invite someone else as we wouldn’t be going if I didn’t plan it. But that can be viewed different by everyone.

Gabbie was essentially telling me she doesn’t want Lucy to go, Sarah lets me know that it would be tricky if it was just them two sharing a Uber on the way there and back as it would be cheaper to split the cost three ways. I was rather angry that Gabbie wanted to not have Lucy there, but Sarah wanted to split the bill amongst us so it’s cheaper. It felt like they were finding a way to use me just for the Uber to be cheaper.

I decided to let them know that me and Lucy would be going separately and I can help out covering their Uber . But that was more of a hollow offer and I probably wouldn’t help them out. So, AITA?

"AITAH for telling off SIL First post- My (51f) and SIL (49f) have had a pleasant but not close relationship. We are very different people from different backgrounds. The issue came up when after years of not responding to her comments about my parenting. I finally said something. I have 3 children (28f, 25m, 21f). My children are strong students who have attended top universities. All 3 of my children have studied abroad; this is where the comments put me over the edge. SIL thinks we (hubby and I) give our children too much freedom- letting them learn to drive, working, go to college and study abroad. Her children on the other hand 24m and 22m barely graduated from HS, never learned to drive, never worked and now stay home playing video games.
Recently our 21f got an amazing internship in Europe. She is thrilled. SIL commented that it isn’t safe for her to move to Europe for 4 months and that she- as her aunt- forbids it. 
I lost it. I told her how we parent is none of her business and we aren’t raising losers that wont leave home. I also pointed out the my daughter is an adult who pursued this opportunity on her own and it really isn’t my place to “let” her go or not.

We moved back to his state 30 years ago. Fast forward to now and because we have some harsh winters and it causes pain from his injuries he's been talking about moving south/ somewhere warmer.

"AITA for resenting my wife’s parents for favoritism? My ultra conservative Christian right wing mother and father-in-law favors others, possibly because my wife and I are more liberal. My wife comes from a family of 4 sisters. All are married. It seems to me there is one clear favorite, I’ll call her Jamie:

1. The parents bought Jamie at least 4 homes. They paid the down payment for each house. Each time they’d give them a big hug and say, “we’re so happy we could help you buy this home”. Jamie still owns all 4 homes. 3 are rentals. 
2. Recently, I found out the parents sold another home they bought, and they gave Jamie half of the proceeds. Apparently, they “managed” the rental for 5 years and therefore are entitled to ~ $250k equity (half of the $500k they made on the sale). Jaime put no equity into the house.
3. They built a cabin with 4 bedrooms. They assigned each sister a room in the cabin when visiting. For some reason, Jamie got a master suite with en-suite bathroom despite Jamie having the fewest kids. Their room is about 2x-3x as big as the other rooms. Also, Jamie is the only sister allowed to leave things at the cabin. They have their clothes, cosmetics, furniture, and games. Everyone else isn’t allowed to leave as much as a q-tip.

How are we treated?

1. We were given $50 off our rent of $850 from the parents when we first got married.
2. We were assigned the smallest room in the cabin despite having the most / oldest kids in the family.
3. We were invited to a family Disneyland trip a few years back. All families attended and were given tickets and hotel rooms. My family had season passes (so we didn’t need to have tickets purchased for us), and no one else had tickets. For some reason the parents asked for our family to pay $500 once we were there. I asked the other sisters if anyone was being asked for reimbursement, and everyone said no.
4. We were recently sued. The case was dropped but the legal fees almost bankrupt our family. In response, the parents said “If you lose this case you’ll lose your home!” Shortly after the lawsuit, they said the family is going to Hawaii this year. Everyone is going! The parents offered to pay for our rental car, but we’ll have to pitch in for gas. We’d have to pay for flights and hotels and food. Despite us explaining over and over again that we’re not going after the lawsuit, they continue to try to guilt us into coming.
6. Apparently Jamie is getting the parents home when they die. The other two sisters have each been promised a collector car. My wife was promised to get a grand piano that she paid for half of in high school, despite us not living in a home big enough to house such a piano.

After all of this, I can’t help to always feel slighted. If we ever question the favoritism, they respond with “It’s our money, we’re going to do whatever we want with it.” And “Why do you need to tally everything we do? We want to help all our kids.” 

Doesn’t feel that way!

"AITA My bipolar bestie chose to prioritize her alone time over my bachelorette party My (36f) best friend (30f) of 10 years is bipolar and currently lives in my fiancé and my spare room. Usually I am very good at reading her and handle the ups and downs that come with this disorder. This weekend was my breaking point.

I’ll start off by saying my mom is difficult to navigate even on her best of days. She personally doesn’t like my bestie due to some friction over my bestie and one of her friends. Now I asked for this day from my bestie to be my emotional support four months ago and she agreed.

 My bachelorette party was a one day small get together (I only invited my four bridesmaids and that included her) at my mom’s where we would have a tea party, make our bouquets, go out for dinner, and then dancing to finish off the day. Then go back to my mom’s to crash and leave early. My mom would only be there for the tea party and craft time stuff. I gave my bestie many outs weeks before but I appreciated that she reassured me everytime that she could handle herself.

The day before bestie tells me that she is going to be late to it because she scheduled an interview that morning. I thought it was a little odd given that she knew about the party for months but shrugged it off. 

Well the day rolls around and she shows up two hours late which is fine but when she comes in she immediately goes to treating everyone around her in this bland give zero fs way. My mother was actually on very good behavior. Bestie chugged three mimosas in the span of five minutes. She I asked for her to step outside with me to talk. 

She proceeds to explain her interview went well and then tells me that she no longer wants to spend the night so she is only going to day drink and doesn’t want to go have fun in the evening so she can drive home. I asked why and she just explains that she wants her weekend to herself to decompress from the work week. I explained her she could do that Sunday because we would leave early in the morning. She declined saying that she would prefer to have her Saturday night as well. I immediately saw red because it hurt me that she was choosing to be this selfish. I never ask her for anything and this was the one thing I asked of her to please do for me. I told her ‘I am really hurt that you are doing this’,  ‘If you are going to act like this then I don’t know why you even bothered showing up’ and ‘if you don’t want to be here for me then I don’t want you here. You are more than welcome to go home and have your time.’ She said fine and that she will not be manipulated into feeling guilty for taking time for herself and just left. I cried with my other ladies, drank some, and had an over all enjoyable rest of the party except for the growing anxiety of the next days to come. 

It is now super uncomfortable. She is just silent treating me and I am suppose to accept that I guess. I am not going to apologize for expressing my feelings to her. AITA?
Update: All talked out and I apologized for being too harsh and she apologized because she said she misunderstood why I was feeling the way I was. All is well and I appreciate all the responses. It was a stressful day for both of us but I am glad we are in the same page now. ",0.27

"AITA for telling my roommate he can’t make hot tuna melts in our apartment? I live with my roommate in a pretty tiny apartment in LA. He’s pretty much the ideal roommate (cleans up after himself, is fun to hang out with but still gives me privacy, generally respects our space) except he has been on a bender recently of making hot tuna sandwiches. 

Every single time he makes one our apartment absolutely stinks for at least a couple hours. I’m pretty grossed out by canned tuna to begin with, but could definitely tolerate it if he was putting it in a salad or something. By heating it up however, he is practically lighting a tuna candle and letting it linger in our apartment for hours. 

I kindly asked him today to be a little bit more considerate about making these as I’d told him before I’m pretty grossed out by the smell. He told me that I can’t tell him what he can and can’t eat and that he doesn’t need to feel like he’s walking on egg shells every time he makes food. 

We left things at that and I literally gagged when I walked into the kitchen now to make my own food. I don’t want to police him over something like this but the smell truly is unbearable. AITA?",0.8
"AITA for wanting child support? 
Sorry in advance for a very long post.

I (28F) have a beautiful baby boy who is 8 months old. He was very much planned, wanted, and made from love with my fiancé at the time (27M).

When I gave birth I  had a C-section so it was hard for me to get in and out of bed, yet  once we got home from the hospital I was completely alone taking care of him. I also had some breastfeeding struggles and definitely wasn’t the most attentive and present partner i could have been during those early days but I assumed my fiancé understood it was because I was overwhelmed as a new mom.

Unfortunately, things kept getting worse and worse until one day we got into a pretty bad argument where there was some abusive behavior that occurred. I told him that I loved him but it might be best that temporarily we live separately so we’re not fighting in front of our son. I was still wearing my ring and we were very much still together. He ended up moving 4 hours away and claimed it was because there were better job opportunities there but would regularly come visit the baby and I. Yet, Thanksgiving, Christmas, and new years all came and went and he never came to see our son or I. Yet he would still constantly reassure me via text he was staying faithful.

Now, fast forward to two weeks ago. I get a text from a girl named “Riley” about how she saw me in her “boyfriends” phone as “Shawn” and thought it was sketchy he was sending him flirty messages and calling him so much. She said they had been together since late August (when WE were still living together). They live together, spent every holiday together, and go on vacations together. When I sent Riley pictures of him and I together with our son she said “I recognize you, he told me you were his sister and the baby was his nephew. He would even FaceTime me in August with the baby asking me if I thought his nephew was cute” I was floored.

When I confronted my fiance about this he said “well you should have known we were broken up, you were so mentally checked out by the time i left it was obvious we were over.” Needless to say, Riley kicked him out of her house when she found this all out so now he’s homeless and without a car.

I gave him the option to just sign over full custody of our son to me and that’s it. He agreed, however after this he blocked my number. He says it’s because he “needed a break from hearing from me” and he “wants to just move on with his life.” At this point, I am absolutely furious. He clearly doesn’t give a shit about me or our son and I don’t want him to get away with that. He doesn’t get to just abandon our baby without having any consequences. So I tell him, no, I’m not playing nice anymore. I’m getting a lawyer and going for child support because he’s a shitty father and it’s the least he can do. He says I’m TA because he won’t be able to pay and will go to jail so if I do this he will harm himself. Now, I’m so conflicted and having second thoughts. AITA?",0.07
"AITA for realizing days into emergency kinship placement that we cannot do it On Wednesday I received an urgent call from my sister to go pick up her kids from her exes house because CPS was there due to drug allegations. The house was also filthy, there was no running water and no gas because it was piled with trash. A case worker starts calling me as well. I felt like I had to immediately drop what I was doing and rush over there to get them so they wouldn’t go to foster care. I picked them up and brought them home.

 They are twin 10 year olds, and their sister is 5. Their sister is no blood relation to me but I was still told to take all. While at the fathers house the case worker tells the father it’s going to be a removal case and he should think about allowing me to take temporary guardianship so the 1 year timer to get clean and better doesn’t start so quickly. In the moment I agree. 

Over these last few days we’ve had to allow him open opportunity to see the kids. Thursday was okay and the CPS worker stopped by to look thru our home as well while he was there. The case worker gave me no assistance or advice, just told father he has to come to my house by himself and not high. He came over high on Friday and continually passed out in the chair and was hard to wake by his children. 

We have a 5 year old girl ourself and an almost 13 year old. We live in a 3 bed 2 bath 1200 sq home. We flipped the whole house upside and combined our kids in one room so these 3 kids could have the other. It has been very hard the last few days keeping this place cleaned and not being on top of each other. My 5 year old is very emotional and upset is having a hard time adjusting. 

I texted the worker last night and told him we can’t do the long term temporary guardianship anymore after having serious concerns and serious doubts about being able to provide the appropriate care these kids with trauma need. There has not been any paperwork signed yet, except the initial safety plan the day of, nor anything thru the courts. He didn’t respond so I’m assuming he will read the message and call tomorrow on Monday.  We also are having a hard time with this person very clearly on drugs being able to be in and out of our home and in front of our kids who have never seen this before in their lives.

Some back story here is that my sister lost custody of these children 10 years ago due to a CPS case for drug use. Her rights were terminated thru the state. I have not seen nor spoke to these kids in their whole lives. My sister and I were not close until these recent years and she lives clear across the country from the state the kids and I are in. I felt bulldozed and pressured to immediately go get them.  

AITA for realizing we cannot do this entire situation and asking for them to be placed elsewhere? It is not the kids fault at all, it is the rest of the situation that is hard. I don’t want them to stay and get attached her when we cannot provide the best long term support and space for them.

"AITA for telling the guy I'm seeing that I don't care? I (26F) started seeing a guy (27M) recently and it's been going well. I was ready to date, and I didn't totally feel like myself but I am getting there.

I have BPD and I tend not to see the 'ugly' parts of the person I'm with. He's insecure about the way he looks but he doesn't take it out on me or others, thankfully. He's still a kind, level headed man which is a nice difference. Recently, he has started to be more sensitive and angry which has put me a bit on edge.

The other night, I was followed by a random man in the early hours of the morning. I ran and hid but he followed me down the street and I had to run to the nearest shop open and get help there whilst this man was shouting at me, trying to get my number. I was then escorted home. 

The next day, I had time sensitive things to do and I was very stressed. I ended up snapping at the guy I'm dating after he started talking about how he doesn't like his thighs. I told him that I don't care about him, 'I don't need someone in my life who makes everything about them,' and his thighs are the least of his problems. I had told him what had happened and he wanted to make sure I was okay and safe, but I just feel like he then snapped right back to incessant complaining.

"AITA for telling my friend that she doesn’t get to have an opinion about my cooking because she is poor? My best friend Layla (29f) and her partner Ryan (40m) were over for dinner this evening. I enjoy cooking and tonight’s dish was a seafood pasta with garlic bread and a veggie side dish. Having Layla and Ryan over for dinner is a semi frequent occurrence, but they typically don’t contribute anything to our meals. The reasoning is 1.) they struggle financially and 2.) neither of them are very good at cooking. IF they do bring something it’s usually drinks or a store bought side dish (potato salad, mac salad, chips, etc) but that is rare. This has not ever really bothered me because hanging out is always a good time and I’m understanding of their financial situation and preference for not cooking. 

My partner and I live very comfortably and can afford to feed guests for dinner every so often so it really has never been an issue until tonight. I usually like to cut shrimp in half when I’m incorporating it into pasta because I feel like it mixes in better that way. It’s just a personal preference. I don’t claim to be a master chef. I just like cooking, and that’s the way I’ve always done it. Layla started getting on my case about not serving *whole* shrimp with the pasta. It started out as lighthearted banter but quickly became extremely annoying. Some of her comments included: 

*Feeling stingy tonight, huh?* 

*Hope I don’t get hungry again later!*

*I’ve never seen pasta served with cut up shrimp before* 

I eventually got fed up and said something along the lines of, “Interesting take considering that I *know* you’ve never cooked shrimp ever in your life, and probably can’t afford to either. You don’t work, Ryan doesn’t have a real job….you guys come over here for free food and complain about it? Nah. I’m done.” It was word vomit…followed by a very awkward silence. 

They left shortly after that. I texted Layla an hour later and apologized for what I said. She apologized as well but honestly I’m still mad. I’m starting to feel like they’re free loaders and it just feels icky knowing that they come over here and eat well pretty often and my partner and I *never* get anything in return. I know that we’re in different financial situations but there are ways to make an effort without spending a lot of money. 

Layla suggested we do dinner again next week, assuming we were all good after we both apologized. I responded and basically said “I’ll pass on that.” She hit me back with “So are we too poor for you now?” And I just said “Yep.” 

It’s obviously not entirely that. But the whole thing left a bad taste in my mouth and now I don’t even want to talk to her. My partner thinks I’m being harsh but I don’t know…I feel used and I don’t like that.",0.67
"AITA for not wanting my grandma with dementia sleeping on my bed?  

AITA for not wanting my grandma with dementia sleeping on my bed

(Sorry for bad English)
My 75 year old grandma has a very powerfull dementia, she has forgotten everything, who she once was, who am I, who was my father. 
It has gotten so bad she cannot live alone anymore. In November we took her to an asylum so she could be watched, but her dementia only got worse now she needs to use adult diapers.
So in any case, my dad hasn't forgotten who she was so she takes her out of the asylum often. One day he decided it was better for my grandma to spend the night with us, my bed was the chosen one. 
I remind you she has no bowel or bladder control especially at night, in any case we put her to sleep. 
In the morning I woke up did everything a guy my age would do when suddenly my dad decided to check on my grandma, she had a very bad smell and had urine all over her, my dad took her to take a bath. 
After checking my room I noticed had a very bad smell, it was a mixed of ammonia, urine and feces it was so bad I almost threw up. 
I cleaned it, used different technics to get rid of the smell and I have not gotten any solution. 
It has been a week and smells the same and I have to sleep here and have no other place to sleep
Also her urine smells incredibly bad and it's really smelly so now my bedsheets are covered with that scent 
I talk with my mother about this and she told me to get on with it, that it was for my grandma and is now mad at me. 
I love my grandma but smells is a thing I cannot stand. 
I 16m have autism and a very powerful nose so this can make the situation I don't want her sleeping on my bed anymore and that's had made my family mad an take me as an ungretful man

AITA? For not wanting to bring people other than my spouse into my financial situation?  Hii! Female (26) and my husband (33) are having regular fights about him sharing our finances with his grandmother. So backstory  we were married and then got divorced and separated for a little bit then got back together so now we have separate bank accounts and we both work and draw an income. Well he was having a discussion with his grandmother how he couldn’t afford to pay for 6 months of insurance because we did not have the money and she said he could use her credit card and put it on that and he declined because he didn’t want to use the money his grandfather worked hard for (he is dead and she draws social security) because we have a spending issue. Me I have a savings account and I try to save. He does not. Yet he feels as if we are broke all the time and live paycheck to paycheck because of all the miscellaneous spending we do. But we did have the money to buy insurance at a monthly cost so I’m not sure why this hasn’t been done? Well it was then blamed on the two vacations I took and how we didn’t have the money to go on them in the first place.. which I saved and paid for one and my father took us on a family vacation paid for most of everything but we did have to pay for a few items. Then I brought up why was my personal finances being discussed with someone other than my spouse?  I got very upset. He believes he is allowed to talk about this issues because I talk to my father about things he doesn’t want me to talk to him about. Example  (husband) told me not to speak to my father about my car’s mechanical issues. And I did anyways. So this gives him every right to talk about my or our personal finances  with his grandmother. Well fast forward we are looking at buying a house and there is a chance he might have to borrow from his 401K (I am not eligible to withdrawal from mine due some banking issue I’m trying to get fixed) so I asked him if he borrowed from his 401k for a down payment on a house would he talk to his grandmother about it and he said yes. I said I wish we would not talk about our finances with other family members. As I believe that should be between husband and spouse. And I told him I did not like that he continued to tell me he didn’t care due to the things I talk to my dad about like car issues. And then I told him if he talks to his grandmother about our finances going forward while buying this house I would not move in with him I will stay at the house we are living with now (we do say we are married and wear rings and live life as we were married.)  I feel like he is not respecting my wishes about this. I feel like an asshole for saying this. But I don’t wish to have other people know about my financial situation. Am I the asshole?

Last month, her mom had a stroke unexpectedly and she became responsible for her after she was released from the hospital. When she told me, I said I was sorry, sent my love, and offered to be of help. At the time, I was staying with friends for the week out of town. We spoke once over the phone, and texted a bit, but didn’t talk much. I thought that was fine, assuming she wanted space since I had asked her whether there was anything I could do, and she didn’t respond.

A few days later, while still away, I texted her to apologize for not being there to support her more and asked if she was upset. She said she was hurt. I told her I already apologized but said we could talk about it. I told her I didn’t know what kind of support she wanted and how much of it to give since she didn’t tell me, and in any event I was away with friends and was caught up with them. She got really upset and felt like I didn’t care about her. I said that was not true and not fair— I was in touch but just didn’t give as much as she wanted. I said I understood she was hurt, but that i wasn't at fault and wasn’t an appropriate target for her anger. She then told me it's important that she can trust me to support her in an emergency. I said that if she didn't trust me, then that was a huge issue and she would need to do something thinking if she really felt like she couldn’t trust me. I told her i didn't want to talk about this if she was going to be angry with me.

"WIBTA If I got with my ex’s best friend of 7 years? Okay so, I basically have the opportunity of a lifetime right now and i’m seriously debating if I take it further. My ex who I recently broke up with started dating her guy best friend which she told me to never worry about, which is no biggie right? 

That would be the case and I honestly couldn’t care less if she also didn’t start accusing me of doing non-consensual things (you can only guess) to her and her telling all her close friends and even some of mine through connections. I have never done anything un-consentful in any relationship I have been in, and it’s my #1 priority with every girl I meet and talk to. So this obviously ticks me off.

 Fast forwards a bit I’m headed over to my buddy’s house and conveniently his girlfriend is friends with my exes best friend and she was over at the time. We hit it off a bit and we start texting from there on out. 

I’m seriously considering getting with her out of spite of what my ex has been saying and doing but I can’t bring myself to actually think it’s a logical choice even though she’s accusing me of a crime. Her friend is nice and I would absolutely love to see my ex’s face crash down after I ruin her evil little friend group but I wanted insight, WIBTA?

"WIBTA if I (28M) told my friend (27F) the reason she’s not booking any acting roles is because of her weight? I have a friend who I met in an acting class a few years back, and we’ve been close friends since. I’ve always supported her and think she’s exceptionally talented as an artist. 

We’ve shared a healthy competitiveness but always in good spirits and have always supported one another for audition reads, etc, and cheered each other on when the other books roles. 

However, this past year, she stopped going to the gym and gained a substantial amount of weight. She took new headshots after her weight gain, and keeps complaining that she gets called into auditions way less than before.

This alone wouldn’t bother me, but she keeps saying that the reason she isn’t getting roles is because she’s White, and brings up her friends (who happen to be BIPOC) booking things left and right. Mind you, all of the friends she listed off spend hours at the gym every day and work insanely hard on their fitness.

I’m not here to argue if White people are disadvantaged in Hollywood. I have plenty of White colleagues who are getting plenty of roles these days.

I’m not thrilled that I have to cut and exercise like crazy every audition season, but Hollywood is the way it is.

I care about my friend and want to see her succeed, but I also don't want to hurt her feelings or damage our friendship. WIBTA if I told my friend the truth (tactfully)?

"AITA for using my family’s Montana ranch for a corporate retreat without asking? Throwaway because I'm scared someone will find my reddit.

&#x200B;

I (27M) am in a bit of hot water with my family right now, and I’m starting to think I might be the asshole here. My family owns a large ranch in Montana that’s mostly used for family vacations and the occasional hunting trip. It’s a beautiful place that everyone in my family cherishes for its peace and connection to nature.

I recently got promoted at work to a managerial position, which includes hosting and organizing corporate retreats. Seeing an opportunity to impress my new bosses and colleagues, I thought the family ranch would be the perfect place for our upcoming company retreat. It has all the facilities we would need, and its remote location seemed ideal for team-building activities.

Without thinking it through, I went ahead and invited my entire team to the ranch, planning a weekend of workshops, meetings, and some leisure activities like horseback riding and fishing. I genuinely thought I was doing a good thing by using the ranch in this way.

The retreat was a success from my company’s perspective, but when my family found out, they were furious. They told me that I had no right to use the ranch for such purposes without consulting them first. My family members were upset that I had brought a large group of outsiders to a place that is reserved for family privacy and relaxation. They felt that I had commercialized a cherished family space.

In my defense, I argued that the ranch was being underutilized and that this retreat could help with its upkeep costs. However, my family countered that it’s not just about utility or money, but respect for what the ranch represents in our family history and relationships.

Now, I’m left wondering if I was indeed inconsiderate for not asking permission first, assuming that my family would be okay with it because I’m part of the family too.

He asked if I’d put my dog outside. I asked if he was allergic and he said No. And it was like ‘does he want to make a move? We haven’t even eaten or chatted or anything.’ My dog is my family. My life. She loves it when people come over and is really friendly but unobtrusive. In your face for the first few minutes then she calms down and just loves chilling with the people. It was cold out, not freezing, but I didn’t see any reason for my dog to be outside. I said she was OK where she was. And he said “Well, I’M not OK” and in an impulse reaction I just said “Don’t let the door hit you on the way out” and he laughed and then I said “I’m serious, this isn’t really working for me anyway” and he left.

"AITA for ruining my boyfriends viewing experience of the new Fallout TV show? So, I (F32) am a MASSIVE Fallout fan.   
I have played all the games, am invested in the law and history and have often theorised about the Fallout universe with my boyfriend, Shawn (M36). When we heard there was going to be a Fallout TV show we were hesitant but also excited for what it could be (turns out its amazing guys, go watch it, I won't be giving spoilers)!  
So when it came out this past week, we sat down together to watch it. It had come onto Prime that day. I had been at work all day, so I had not seen anything about it, watched any of it, anything! (That's important)   
So, as we are watching, I am really excited at seeing one of my favourite worlds come to life. As the plot develops, I start to suggest things to Shawn that may happen, what I think characters will do, what something may be etc.   
ALL OF IT was based on context clues from the show and playing the games. One thing I will say about the show is that if you have played the games, you will recognise almost everything.   
We watched the first few episodes the first night (Thursday), and picked up the next few episodes on the following night when I got home from work. On Saturday morning, Shawn told me he didn't want to watch the last two episodes with me because I was spoiling his viewing experience, because I had obviously watched it before, or read about all the plot online, because there was no possible way I had known everything that was going to happen.   
I tried to explain to him that I didn't know exactly, I just knew the world (like him, Shawn has played just as much as I have, TBH more so, as he got in to the game first, and I started playing it after watching him play) and that I was just excited and enthusiastic.   
I promised I wouldn't say anything so he could watch with me in peace (just to mention too, I wasn't talking incessantly thought out, I was trying to limit talking to ad breaks, or when there was a quiet moment in the show), but Shawn said it was already ruined, he had waited so long for this show (like I hadn't?} and he wanted to watch it in peace, so he went and watched it without me on the TV in the bedroom.   
I watched the last two episodes downstairs alone - I was right about everything I had theorised, but I didn't know I was right, I was just spitballing and it stuck. For context, I am also a amateur fiction writer, so I have some experience in writing narratives.

This isn't the first time he and his parents bought stuff for our home without even asking me. It already happened several times and I've let it slip several times.

We met at a dinner, we started to date it didn't work out mid February is when we broke it off, we have been fine from that we have been great friends/roommates up until yesterday. We went to ikea. I wanted to look at stuff I potentially needed to buy due to me HOPEFULLY moving out because of needing my own space. They made some ""jokes"" that made me uncomfortable. (Inside jokes mainly but I have communicated before that they make me uncomfortable) then were finally at the exit after I manage to write everything down without getting too uncomfortable. At the exit they decide they're going to buy chocolate bars. But they grab one of the flat carts and put 3 tiny chocolate bars on it and at that point I have been flustered and social battery is completely out. So I just shut down. I stop responding I just kinda walk away and they are giggling and laughing. And I just couldn't do it so when they got done checking our amd wheeled the cart over I took the chocolate bars off the cart put the cart away while they went to the bathroom. Then when they were walking back towards the exit (the bathrooms are near the entrance to ikea at the one closest to me) they start being silly and doing bird floppy arm thing, not like chicken dance but like full arm flapping. I walked out of the store and sat on a bench. I was so tired and done with everything. 

Next thing I know we are home he's pissed at me I am pissed at them I try to Apologize for just kinda shutting down at ikea then they proceed to say ""you saying sorry means fucking nothing to me."" (They have done this on multiple occasions) they grabbed a few things out of my room and went to the gym. I went to the park to get out of the house despite them being upset. But when I came back and then they grabbed a few of their things from my room. When they were shutting the door they straight up said ""you don't have to pay rent for may and june but if you're still living here in july you will start to pay $900 for rent"" at current I pay 500 due to my job I am struggling to make sure I buy food at current and I have been looking for my own place and managed to apply for one with their help this month.

"AITA for asking my ex not to have his new GF stay over in the house I pay rent on? I feel like this situation is making me doubt my own sanity and would appreciate the perspective of redditors. Throw away because I don't want this linked to my main account.

I (38F) was in a relationship with someone (44M) for 8 months and then I found out they were seeing someone else; a person they told me I should not worry about.

They told me it was nothing, they were sorry, and I (very stupidly) agreed to work on the relationship.  I was going through a bad time as I had recently gone through a personal tragedy, was having difficulty at work, in love, and very stupid.

At this time, they needed to move into a new place and we had an agreement that I would help them with the rent on their new place while we looked for a place to buy together. Again, very stupid. They signed a lease for 12 months and we said we would use those 12 months to work on things. I did not sign the lease.

4 weeks into that lease they dumped me. 1 week later they were having the person they said I should not worry about in the house to stay for days at a time. This is the same house I was paying about 70% of the rent on as they are between jobs and could not afford to live anywhere.

I have been through a lot these past few years but I cannot describe to you my level of distress. I ended up having to go see my doctor who prescribed me some medicine just so that I could continue working and my other responsibilities.

We have got to a place where we are sort of friends, there is no hope of a relationship anymore. I have continued to pay the rent because to do not do so would leave them in a terrible situation. 

They recognised the distress that this caused me. But they continue to bring this person to the house to stay.  I have asked them not to because I feel humiliated by the situation - I am paying rent on a place that was a bridge between the bad things that happened and our life together. They are using that house for their activities with their new partner.

I know that I am stupid and was being exploited. The lease is up in a few months after which I will not continue to provide support. He has said to me that I am manipulative and toxic for making this request to not have her stay in the house.

"AITA for siding with my friend's ex during their breakup instead of fully agreeing with her My friend (26F) got dumped by her bf a year ago. She's still a mess over it and goes back and forth between what she did wrong and he's the spawn of Satan. 

I've been comforting her and listening to her ever since she reached out to me for support.

Her ex is still in her life since her friends are still friends with him and they see each other during hangouts.

From what I gathered based on what she said vs what her close friends said, he broke up with her based on incompatibility and he didn't see a future with her. They also said he's smart, well-off, went to a good school, and got a high-paying job. 

My friend, while caring and supportive, hasn't found a job after graduating and it's been difficult for her to find something in her field of study. She doesn't have her driver's license. She has a bit of a spending problem so she impulsively spends and doesn't save up. She told me they had some disagreements over finances and her lack of savings.

In my experience with her, while she's kind, she's a bit of a mooch because she doesn't have money. She'll often ask for gifts and food, so I imagine if I, who isn't as close to her experienced this, her boyfriend dealt something similar.

The other day my friend was cursing her ex again and said that he would never be able to find someone like her, missed out, and she couldn't believe he broke up with her.

While I care about my friend, if I put myself in his shoes, I can see why and I wouldn't want to be in a relationship like that, especially at a young age. I thought my friend needed a bit of a wake-up call and at her current state, she's not really the catch she thinks she is. I didn't say those exact words to her, but I might have been mean to point this out. 

I told her that I think she should work on herself instead of looking for love or trying to get him back for the time being. She asked me what I meant, so I explained that she should find a job, build up her savings, and maybe even get her license so she can support herself first. Right now he's working on his career and is moving up and he's at a different point in life than her. 

I tried to be gentle but my friend thought I was taking her ex's side and I guess in a way I was. She's now mad at me for what I said so I'm wondering if I was too harsh.

We've had some ups and downs in the past with him catching feelings for me and me always turning him down, but we're so close that it was never that deep. 

He started dating one of my friends in October and everything was fine until in early January he tells me he might have feelings for me again, which again nobody can do anything about, but things started to get messy when he ""offered"" to leave his girlfriend if it ends up working out between us. I declined, obviously, and he realised his mistake a few days after too and although he wanted to keep this a secret, i felt really guilty about it and told his girlfriend a few weeks later. While i do believe my only fault was not going to his girlfriend immediately, i don't think it counts as me being a homewrecker, but the girlfriend says otherwise.

"WIBTA if I refuse to be my parents glorified house sitter for the next 10 years?  So Reddit to make a long story short, I am currently renting a house from my parents due to being broke. I have 2 kids who have been through some trauma not related to this but greatly impacted by it. My parents are financially very well off and they know this, and have a tendency to think about money before people. When I was a kid my parents were also very abusive towards me and my brother. 

On Thursday they were telling me they were going out of state to help my elderly grandparents and that it would be my husband and I's choice whether we took care of their house or kept renting ours. We’ve both sat it over and considered all the factors, our kids, school, and closeness to his family whom we’ve had to rely on for the day-to-day cause my parents mostly can’t handle it. We decided we did not want to move into their house, not only did the therapists for the kids who we saw on Thursday and Friday say it was a bad idea, we’d be further from his work, pay higher bills we cannot afford (my parents say it’s not that much more 1000$ more is that much more guys), and I just don’t want to raise my kids in the same house I was freaking abused in. Like yes, I want to have constant flashbacks to crying in that corner while trying to help my traumatized children cope with their own issues. 

Yesterday they decided not only are they not moving to help grandma and grandpa, but to their dream state, but we don’t have a choice but to be their glorified house sitters because their house is worth more. I’ve tried repeatedly explaining to them we don’t give a shit about the money but they give 0 shits about anything else. 

My hubby and I decided last night, that if we’re gonna be forced to move out (their house they can sell it if they want we know) that we’ll just have the kids stay with Mil while we figure our shit out. We also decided that if they go through with this they will not be seeing their grandchildren again. 

When we got this rental we were encouraged to think of it as our house, and nest, and start saving so we could buy this home off of them one day. I personally feel that this was all just a ploy to make money off of us and that my parents are taking advantage of our situation to control. 

I get the feeling when I tell my parents this they’re gonna be pissed at us cause moving out of state has been their dream since I was a kiddo myself. Plus it’s their money I don’t get to tell them what to do with it and they may see this as us trying to force them to stay in the state. 

We don’t care if they stay in the state at this point, we just don’t appreciate them deciding to burn everything down in our lives for their convenience. I wish they’d just sell their house, and use it to get a nicer place somewhere else. ",0.46

"AITA for telling my birth siblings I owe them no apology or expressions of regret for being adopted while they were kept? I (29m) was adopted out of foster care at the age of 4. I was first placed in foster care as an 11 week old. My birth parents willingly surrendered me to the state, got me back and then lost me to CPS within a few weeks of being returned to them. Their extended families were asked if they would like to raise me and everyone on both sides who was contacted, and the list was extensive, said no. So I was placed back into foster care and after two weeks of a temporary placement I found my parents. I was 11 months old at the time. My parents were the best parents anyone could ask for. I have three siblings from my parents. Two were their bio kids and one was also a kid they adopted from foster care. My family is very close today and it includes a very very large extended family where my sister and I adopted from foster care were treated as their own and no different than the blood grandkids. It was a very happy life.

My birth parents went on to have three additional children who are now 22, 20 and 19. My birth siblings sought me out two years ago on social media and told me they wanted us to be a family. I expressed at the time that I had zero interest in this. A few months after this I got another DM from them but this time with a word document attached and it contained this very heartfelt explanation of how they had always been aware I existed and how their childhood had not been the best but they valued each other and how they longed for me to be a part of their lives and how they felt we were robbed of growing up together. I did not respond to this right away because it did read as something from the heart but I did not agree with them and did not feel robbed. So I didn't want to be a jerk. I told them I needed some time and when I did respond, I told them I had a very happy life and a wonderful family and I was sorry to not share their sentiments. They asked if we could meet one time and I agreed and it happened a couple of weeks ago. They were upset that my siblings were nearby for moral support and they were upset that I did not show up ready to hug and embrace them. They asked me how I could be happy being adopted and raised in another family when I had real, blood siblings, etc. They asked me how I could express joy because of my adoption knowing this. I explained again that my life was happy and I would not trade my family for the world, especially given their parents treatment of me. They told me I should want them and apologize for making it seem like I don't. I told them I owe them no apology or expression of regret for being adopted while they were kept.

Of course this was not what they wanted to hear and I left because they clearly wanted to argue after that. My siblings, parents as well as my wife were a wonderful support to me after this. But some fellow adoptee friends said I was too harsh and a few said most of us (adoptees) would love to have such easy access to our birth families and I was rude to mine and threw them away.

He said that he hasn't yet told my younger sister (F19) or grandparents (M80 and F76), and asked me not to say anything to them until he has more information as he doesn't want to stress them.

My dad said that he is letting me know now because he knows I am trying to make ""plans for the future"", and he wants me to know that he won't always be able to give me definite answers. Now obviously, I was very upset and couldn't care less about a birthday party in that moment. I told my dad I would support him through anything and to let me know if he needed something.

That conversation happened last week. The day before yesterday, my husband (M30), son, and I went for dinner at my parents' place. \*\*My sister was not at the dinner.\*\*

 I did share with my husband what my dad had told me, and at the dinner table, he brought it up and asked my dad how he was feeling. My dad said that he felt ""strong"" and very quickly tried to change the topic, but my mom (F54) asked what we were talking about.

I told my mom that dad had mentioned the masses, and we were anxiously awaiting news of what the next steps were. My mom asked my dad what we were talking about, and eventually it came out that he never had any masses or anything sinister at all.

Apparently, my dad thought it would be a good idea to come up with some medical story to get out of unwanted events, and he thought he would do a trial run with me. Needless to say, I packed my family up very quickly and went home. My mom joined us as she says she cannot face my dad right now.

I told my dad that until he apologises, I am not interested in talking to him, and any time I see him after that, I expect him to make the plans and follow through to prove that my family and I are not ""unwanted events"". My dad has been blowing up mine and my mom's phone saying that I am taking things too seriously, I need to understand context, and I am cutting him off from his grandchild and simultaneously causing problems in his marriage by making this such a big thing.

I firmly believed I was right, but now my sister is involved and telling me that I am cutting an old man off from his loved ones after one mistake and he never meant to hurt anyone. Am I being an AH?",0.11
"AITA For refusing to invite MIL AND FIL to our wedding after they tainted my soon to be wedding dress for me? I (F26) am getting married to the love of my life (M28) in September, we have been planning the wedding for a 1.5 years and have been so excited to start our lives together especially as we draw closer to the big day. 

I took my MIL dress shopping last September and fell in love with one as soon as I tried it on, I paid for the dress that day and set a date for picking it up in the new year. From the time of paying to collecting my dress my MIL made comments about the dress and saying how it was a perfect and that it would be perfect for any occasion.  

Fast forward to February this year and I went to pick up my dress from the shop with my MIL so she could see it one more time before the wedding, I explained that I planned to keep it hidden so hubby to be didn't find it and this is when MIL offered to keep it at her house so he wouldn't find it. I agreed as long as it stayed in the bag and no one was to touch it WHATSOEVER! She agreed and I stopped by her house to lock it away in a special cupboard where she promised no one would touch it. 

Last month I was out running errands and needed to pick some things up for the wedding that had been delivered to her house, I tried calling 4 or 5 times but there was no answer so I decided to drop by and let myself in to collect the packages. When I pulled up I saw her car outside the house so I tried calling her once more to find out where she was, there was still no answer so I let myself into her house and went to grab the packages. As I was about to leave I heard noises upstairs and was a bit concerned as I had no idea where my MIL could be after trying to continuously call, I walked up the stairs and heard noises coming from FIL's home office that sounded like draws banging so I figured it was my FIL working at his desk. 

As I opened the door to check on him I was both devastated and scarred by what I had witnessed, my MIL was laying on the desk in MY WEDDING DRESS having s\*x with my FIL who was standing in front of her naked! I let out a shriek which scared them both to a stop and before frantically slamming the door shut and running to my car!

My MIL continuously tried calling and texting me over and over saying I was overreacting to the whole situation and we needed to ""Talk about it like Adults"", I cancelled all the vendors they had paid for to cut their ties to our wedding and simply told them 'You are not coming to our wedding anymore'.

MIL turned to my Fiancé begging him to talk to me and dramatically threw herself down on the floor screaming as she did so, she continued to beg and plead saying 'She would send out the dress for dry cleaning' but it was too late the dress was tainted. I told MIL and FIL that the decision was final and that they would not be attending our wedding, FIL called me a 'Dramatic and Selfish A-Hole for hurting them like this and that it would be unforgivable'

"AITA for not telling my girlfriend that I live in a murder house? I got my house very cheap due to it being the site of a crime. I paid a crime scene remediation company a lot of money to clean it up. 

My girlfriend and I have been talking about her moving in with me. We were having a party with a bunch of our friends. My sister asked my girlfriend how she could be okay moving into my house after everything that happened here. 

Afterwards my girlfriend came and asked a bunch of questions. I ended up having to pull up old news reports of what happened.

"AITA for helping a dog despite my husband's annoyance  I've done dog rescue for most of my life. I foster a dog (either pulled from animal control, or found as a stray), get it all necessary medical care including spay/neuter, then find it a new home. My husband met me in my early 30s and I was upfront about this. As a matter of fact, I had a lab and her litter of 9 puppies living in my house when we first started dating. (All were sent to great homes as soon as they were old enough.)

We've been married 5 years now and have two toddlers, 4f and 2m. I don't rescue like I used to. I used to always have at least one foster dog in the house, but now with kids it's just a lot more complicated so I only do it when it's basically an emergency.

Yesterday while driving home, a little chi-weenie darted in front of my car and almost got hit. I pulled over, opened my car door, and called to her. She ran right up to me and jumped into my car.

I immediately posted her on the lost and found groups, had her checked for a microchip, all the things I can do to get her home, but so far, no dice.

This little dog is AMAZING with my kids. They adore each other. But she is afraid of my personal dogs and barks at them. This isn't a big deal. It's easy to work with. Honestly she just needs a few days to adjust, but until then, she yaps annoyingly any time she sees one of my dogs. Other than this, she's great in the house, easy to care for, and most importantly, she is so entertaining for my kids.

But my husband is super annoyed with the yapping. He's super cranky and talking s*** about the dog and how she's getting sent to animal control TODAY and telling my daughter not to get attached (too late) because she's leaving immediately.

I don't WANT to send her to animal control. Once her stray hold is up, assuming her owners don't claim her, I want to re-home her myself. She's small, friendly, and will be easy to adopt out. 

But I am so sick of my husband's attitude and I know he's going to be like this until she's gone. It's pissing me off because he knew I saved dogs when he met me. He's seen how dedicated I get. But he's acting like this is all such a HUGE inconvenience to him, *just because the dog barks* and it annoys him.

I told him this morning that the dog gives his children joy. She's a sweet girl who needs help. He needs to stop thinking about himself and focus on the good things she brings into this family. He sulking, and I'm pissed.

To start, I never wanted to be in a situation where I tell someone who or who they cannot talk too. I think it’s toxic, so here we go..

A man named, we call call him Jeff works with my gf. He’s a nice guy who I met once but I notice he’s constantly snap chatting or instagram DMing my gf. Nothing flirty but it’s just constant.

"AITA for telling my husband the dog can hold it This seems like such a stupid fight but it’s been a consistent issue in our marriage. Husband (32m) and I (27f) have been married 2 years, he got the dog (3.5ish f) little under 3 years ago, just a month or two before we started dating so she did come first and it was clear to me that I accept them both or break up. I did tell him that I never had pets growing up and wasn’t fond of having an animal in the house so it will take me some time to get used to it and he needs to work with me as well. Before I go on, the fight today was because I normally work 8am -6pm in person but due to a work circumstance, I’m going in at 4 pm today and so I slept in a bit. Husband got out of bed and got the dog out of her crate. She clearly needed to go out asap and I told him that just based on her whining. He knows she can’t hold it when she’s excited, like when telling her to go say good morning to mommy. She came over to me and peed next to the bed, to which he started yelling at her and getting the spray to clean it up. He then asked if I can take her out, to which I agreed. If she hadn’t just peed, I would have gotten out of bed with much more urgency but since she had and I had literally just woken up, I stayed in bed for another 5 mins checking my messages and emails. He came out of his office area in those 5 mins, yelled at me for not taking the dog out promptly because “she’s a living thing too and has needs” and started getting her leash angrily to take her out. I told him that I literally just woke up and she has just peed, which we know is where her urgency comes from, so why is it a big deal if I take her out in a few mins. Especially as he just did the same thing to her and she ended up peeing in the room and getting yelled at by him. 

I don’t think I’m the asshole here but AITAH for not taking her out asap? 

To give some context, setting boundaries for the dog has been a constant issue in our marriage. Him putting the dog’s perceived needs above mine consistently (but never his own) has also been a constant issue. I won’t go into details but things like refusing to put the dog in a different room while sleeping even after me not getting more than 3-4 hours for months and begging him to do it. I was WFH at my last job and potty trained her to let me know when she needs to go out. She would tell me and I would take her, and she never did anything in the house. Since I’ve been going to the office, she has started peeing and pooping in the house, because my husband doesn’t take her when she tells him she needs to go. He yells at her when she does because it gets in the way of his work.

"AITA for not being grateful for a birthday gift  and making it super clear that I don’t want this and clearly they can not listen I am in my 50s and I am sick of getting technology for  gifts. My kids are all into tech, they always by the newest stuff and for years I have beeen trying to get it through their head I don’t want it. I will upgrade when I need to but I am so sick of relearning technology.

I work on the computer for work 8 hours a day and when I get home I don’t want to mess around with tech to make it work. Sometimes I also don’t want to be staring at a screen in my downtime.

My biggest pet peeve about this was them getting me something and then get annoyed if I ask for help setting stuff up. I used to have a bunny tv and i don’t use cable or streaming platforms. The tv worked fine and I was thinking of getting a Roku. They knew I wanted a Roku. They got me the worlds most frustrating smart tv.  Half the time it won’t connect to the free tv networks. I hate that tv, and it is in my basement. It’s a Samsungs smart tv

I have made it so clear I don’t want tech. Christmas they got me new Bluetooth headphones. I couldn’t get them to pair, it took my DIL an hour to make it work. Whole time everyone is pissed I asked for help.

So I really dislike getting tech, I asked for my birthday if they wanted to get me something get me a book off a list or gift card.

I got a tablet, and they told me I can download book. I don’t want to read books on a damn screen. This was my breaking point. I gave it back and told them I don’t want it. This started an argument with them. By the end I was  asking why they can’t fucking listen to me and I am done with this.

"AITA for not giving my cousin my cake?  Yesterday, Sunday, I (F21) had purchased a small pistachio cupcake at around midnight from a bakery about half an hour away. Pistachio cake is my favorite cake in the world. I had planned on drinking coffee and eating it for breakfast in the morning (Sunday) but my immediate family decided to eat breakfast together and I didn’t get a chance to. Yesterday night I had some cousins and their parents that came over for a dinner that my parents put together. With them my uncle brought chocolate cake. I don’t really like chocolate cake so I didn’t eat any. One of my cousins, Jason (m20), hates chocolate cake. My mother then demanded that since Jason’s parents brought chocolate cake and he hates choose cake  I should give him my cupcake. I refused. This isn’t the first time it happened either. 
Earlier, I also asked my mom if I needed to bring any sweets for them and she said no that they’d bring some and that I don’t need to bring more sugar into the house. 
My mom then gave it to him anyway after he agreed to eat wanting it. He ended up taking a bite and throwing it out claiming he’s on a diet and shouldn’t have it anyway. 
My mom then degraded me for hours after they left about how I am greedy and selfish and it’s “just a cupcake”. However, this happened before with my cake during graduation and many times before that. Nobody else cares about what cake I like so why should I go out of my way to give them my food?

"AITA for opposing my friend’s decision to stay with the her boyfriend? So, my friend and I have been best buddies since elementary school. We practically grew up together, and I always saw her as my sister. We did everything together, from sharing snacks to giggling over silly jokes during class. But things changed when she got a boyfriend.

When she first started dating him, she seemed so happy, and I was genuinely happy for her. But as time went on, I began to notice some red flags. There were times when she'd cancel our plans at the last minute just to be with him, and she'd often seem distant when we did hang out.

Then, the bombshell dropped. We found out that her boyfriend had been cheating on her—with another man, no less. I was shocked and angry on her behalf. How could someone she trusted betray her like that?

What made it even more frustrating was that I had warned her about his cheating history before. When she first mentioned him, I did some digging and found out about his past. But when I tried to tell her, she brushed it off, saying that people can change and that he was different with her.

When she came to me for advice on whether she should stay with him, I couldn't bring myself to sugarcoat the truth. I reminded her of his history of cheating on women and how he'd hurt her before. I didn't want to see her get hurt again.

But instead of listening to my concerns, she chose to cut me off.

I'm posting here because I'm torn. On one hand, I feel like I did the right thing by trying to warn her about her boyfriend's past and standing up for what I believe in. But on the other hand, I can't help but feel guilty for hurting her feelings and causing our friendship to fall apart. It's been incredibly hard, and I don't feel like I can talk about it to anyone else. So, I turn to this forum for some perspective. Am I the asshole for opposing my friend's decision to stay with her cheating boyfriend?",0.15
"AITA for not wanting to go on a Vacation I already partly paid for I (30m) have been friends with a girl (38f) for about two years. We became close rather quickly. We were both single at the time. Even though we started hanging out regularly if was always as friends and not anything more. When I say regularly it was often two to three times a week as we are in a lot of the the same groups and do similar activities. It was really great. People often asked us if we were together and we would just brush it off. 

I started to develop feelings for her about five months ago. They were always there but I guess they got more pronounced over time. One night I went out to dinner with some friends and she was there. I was particularly quiet that evening and she noticed. She called me later and asked what was wrong. I'm not sure why, but I told her I had feelings for her. It just kind of happened. I really didn't mean to cause any problems between us.

She said she didn't have feelings for me back, which I pretty much knew. She did say if I wanted, we could have dinner and talk about it. I agreed. We had dinner and it was nice to really talk about how I felt. She listened and was very kind about the whole thing, putting me at ease that I wasn't ruining the friendship. 

This is where things took a bit of a turn. A month earlier she had invited me to go on a cruise with her family and some friends. It was going to be nine days long and I would be staying in her cabin. Yes, I know. I should have declined. Nine days is a lot to stay in a cabin with someone you have real feelings for and hang out with probably a lot during that time. There would be two other people in the cabin but still. I even gave her half the cost of the ticket at that time.

So the dinner is coming to a close and she says I still owe her the other half of the money. Oh. I didn't say anything for a second because I honestly didn't know what to say. 

This is where things got away from me a bit. I said I had some reluctance and said I would have to give it some thought. She reminded me I wouldn't be able to get the money back and I had already agreed to go. I then told her I didn't want to go if I wasn't feeling like I could. She said I didn't have a choice and I was being childish. She further commented that I was a jerk for saying I had feelings for her and ruining everything. We both paid for our separate meals and left.

It's been a week and we have not talked. A friend that knows the situation says it was out of character for her and she will definitely call to apologize. I'm not so sure. I really do feel bad about it. I'm also really not sure if I want to go on the trip now or just eat the cost. I am very much in my own head about this. Should I call her? Should I just try to get over it and go on the trip? AITA.

The following Monday when I dropped the kids back of at their house the father pulled me aside and asked for the tooth. I told him sure but I'll need the ten dollars back that I gave his child for it. He's mad and said that I didn't have to giver her any money for the tooth and certainly not that much.

"AITA for not wanting to go to my girlfriend's friend's wedding in another state? My (26M) girlfriend (26F)'s friend from college is getting married in another city and she wants me to go with her as her plus one. This would be our first wedding together, and we have been dating for about a year. 

We live in Atlanta and the wedding is in DC, so flights are cheap, but the whole thing will still be at least 200-300 per person including the hotel and everything else. Neither of us makes very much money, though of course I could afford this if I thought it was important enough. But we would probably go there for just the wedding and then turn around and leave the next day, unless I decide to take off work which I don't really want to do. 

I told her it sounded fun a few months ago when she mentioned it in passing, but we never actually planned it out or anything. Now that it's coming up, I've been having doubts. I don't really want to spend that much on such a short trip where I don't know any of the people; I haven't even met the friend who's getting married before.

My girlfriend is upset because she thinks I should want to go to stuff like this with her as her boyfriend, and that it seems like it isn't really about the money because I'm willing spend that kind of money on other stuff. If I don't go, I worry she will take it to mean I'm not very serious about her.

"AITA for telling my wife that my SIL will always have say in my kids lives? I realize the title might be a bit confusing so let me try to clear up the background first. I M(43) had a wife previous to my current wife. My late wife sadly passed away due to illness around 5 years ago and her sister has been coming around daily since then to help out with my kids by picking them up from school, playing with them, helping them with homework, etc.. 

She has basically taken the mother role on herself for my two kids currently M(6) and F(11). I married my current wife a few months ago, and she doesn’t work because my salary is high enough for the whole family to live comfortable lives. Now my wife has decided that we don’t need my SIL to be coming around anymore because she can perform all the typical stay at home mom duties herself and because SIL doesn’t technically even live with us.

I talked to my wife about this multiple times and have told her that my SIL is very important to my children and they are still related to her even if her sister is no longer around. 

Now here’s the main issue: yesterday when my SIL went to pick my kids up from school she found out that my wife had already gone earlier in the day and pulled them out of school just so she could be the one to take my kids home and play with my kids and help them with their homework. 

When my SIL showed up at the house to confront her, my wife called the cops on my SIL and said she was trespassing. I didn’t know about any of this till I got a call from the police station and had to go explain the situation to the cops and pick my SIL up. 

When I got back to my house I got into a fight with my wife and told her that my SIL will always have a place over her in my kids lives. My wife was furious about this and went to go stay with her parents. She hasn’t come back yet.

Now I know why my wife is upset with me, but my SIL stepped into our family after a tragedy and while we technically don’t NEED her, we all still see her as part of our immediate family. I want her and my wife to be able to get along and coexist because I want them both in my family, but if it comes down to it I will keep my SIL over my wife.

It's a fancy wedding but there aren't too many guests she's also wanting all women to wear full long dresses.

She's quite conservative so she doesn't want women to attend in a suit and she picked out a nice dress specifically for her niece. My daughter doesn't want to wear them as she'll feel uncomfortable but it's the dress code and I think for one wedding it'll be fine just for her aunt.

 In December my gf was upset with me for not being more festive for Christmas. In January 3 out of the 5 people couldn't attend so I had to cancel. In February my gf had a family even she really wanted us to attend on the day we were supposed to have a session. In March I had 4 out of the 5 people tell me they couldn't attend and the last session we were supposed to have fell on Good Friday and my gf wanted to spend the day together.

Since we missed the last session I told my group I would make a small change and I told them we'd do a session on Friday April 12 instead of the end of the month. They all agreed and I changed the event in mine and my gf's shared calendar. 

My gf didn't check and last Friday she wanted to go for a long walk. I told her I couldn't go because I had promised my group we'd do DnD. My gf was sad and said she was really looking forward to a walk because the weather had really improved but I told her I wasn't going to change it because we've already missed nearly half a year of DnD. She said it's not a big deal for me to move the date because it's just a game and I told her it wasn't just a game and I spent so much time working on it. She then told me how it is just a game and her friends think it's crazy that I do that and how they want to pry me away from Dungeons and Dragons. 

I told her I was going to do my session and we'd go for a walk on Saturday. Unfortunately for Saturday it was raining for most of the day and it was really windy on Sunday. I know shes mad at me and I don't think it's fair.",0.1
"AITA for not giving my sister a heads up that I was having an engagement party, but she would not be invited? I have an odd family dynamic. My parents divorced 12 years and my sister is estranged from my father. I do not really have a relationship with my sister. There’s been so much drama with the soured family dynamic ahead of the wedding. Theres never really been a clear reason that was shared for why my sister is estranged from my father. There had been numerous parental style disagreements ahead of the divorce (ex my mother was ok with allowing my sister to get an underaged tattoo and to drop out of high school, while my father was not.) During the divorce my father always felt like my mother unfairly took his daughter away from him. 

I’ve been caught in the middle of it for the last more than decade. All of my special events and milestones have been ruined by the awkwardness between my sister and father. My father is always heartbroken that he doesn’t have a relationship with one daughter and my sister and mother are always seeking to hurt his feelings at this type of the events. Since engagement I’ve dealt with non stop comments about my sister being uncomfortable around my father at the wedding, my mother bad mouthing my father, wanting to walk me down the aisle because “she was the better parent”, etc. It’s been nothing but stress and has completely taken all the joy out of this occasion for us. Our engagement party is coming up, and I didn’t invite my sister because honestly I just needed a break from all the drama and wanted to get some type of joy back when we haven’t been able to have any. I didn’t want to deal with the stress her presence would have caused up to and at the event. I am now being told by both my mother and sister that I hurt my sisters feelings greatly and that I should have owed her a conversation explaining that I was having  party she wasn’t invited to. Now I only talk to and see my sister a few times a year at holiday gatherings and what not. I really did not feel like I needed to tell her I was having an event but explain to her why she wasn’t going to be invited. I also thought the reason for lack of invite was obvious given everything that has transpired the last few months but now I have myself second guessing if I am the ah or not. AITA?",0.32
"AITA in this really sticky situation or am I justified in feeling let down? My (30f) boyfriend (33m) have been in a relationship for just over 2 years. We have a little boy (1y m) and I have a little girl (3y f) from a previous relationship. We get along great and its a perfect family.

But I overthink and feel things really deeply (some past shitty relationships). My partner has also had shitty relationships in the past too. 

The issue is my boyfriend is married. He kicked his ""wife"" out as she cheated, financially abused him, emotionally abused him, at times physically abused him and isolated him from his friends and also family at regular intervals. 

He kicked her out Christmas time of 2021, my boyfriend and I got together in the spring of 2022. Everything moved fast we decided we'd try for a baby and a month later I was pregnant and now we are a happy family of 4. 

What constantly makes me have doubts is that he didn't tell me he was married and alleged conquest of his ""wifes"" did, now this could be a load of bollocks about this person sleeping with her but it's how I found out. 

My boyfriend still has contact with her not on a regular basis but he hides it from me and I've asked him to stop contacting her and if she emails him to please tell me. 

He promises he will tell me but he never does and then I find out he has been and it starts an argument. Each time it hurts more and it shows he has lied again.

They're not divorced yet either despite it being 2.5 years later. I love him with all my heart but I just want to know am I being naive and kidding myself about the commitment in our relationship or am I being a AH expecting him to stop replying to her emails?

He has blocked her on social media, her number and he tells me he loves me and wants to spend the rest of his life with me. But something just isn't sitting right with me...",0.25
WIBTA if I changed my kids last name  Long story short their dad is a POS in and out of prison. We speak to him sometimes but increasingly becoming pointless and they haven’t seen him in years. We have zero contact with any of his family because they’re all bad people. We were married but I changed my last name back to my maiden and hyphenated with my new husband’s last name. The kids are 10 and 11 years old and I feel like dad doesn’t deserve his name attached to theirs anymore and it would be nice to give the kids my last name. Are they too old in life for this change? Should I just deal? Did anyone else experience this growing up and how did it affect you? ,0.15
"AITA for not driving my brothers baseball bag to him because he forgot it? I (17m) get out of school at 3:30, home at 4:00, and I leave for volleyball practice at 5:00pm and come home at 9:00pm. This leaves me about an hour from 3:00-4:00 pm after school to eat a snack, relax, and get ready for practice. Since I get home at 9pm, I usually eat dinner + relax a bit until 10pm and then do homework from 10pm-12am. I am busy.

My little brother (14m) had a baseball game after school today and he forgot his baseball bag at home. My parents wanted me to drive his bag all the way to his school and come back. The entire trip would take me 45+mins in total at LEAST. I said no. They got mad at me and said they got me a car for a reason and I need to help with stuff like this.

I said no, because I would be late for practice and also that’s not my responsibility. It’s his fault for forgetting his baseball bag and it’s his responsibility to remember to bring it; he’s 14, he’s not a baby. Also, after work my parents don’t have anything so I said why can’t they just do it instead of me.

TL;DR AITA for refusing to drive my brothers baseball bag to him because he forgot it?",0.22
"AITA for not allowing my daughter to go to a concert? Firstly — I posted in AITAH and am looking for more thoughts.

AITA for not permitting my daughter to go to a concert?

Okay. I (F48) have a 15 year old daughter, who I’ll refer to as Olivia throughout this post. She has a boyfriend, who she met in her freshman year of high school. They are the same age. 

I am posting here because I want to hear other outside opinions on my decision. 

So, her boyfriend and his dad are very musical/music oriented. They both enjoy a myriad of bands, and can both play a few instruments. There is an upcoming concert on Thursday, and his dad had a free ticket that he wanted to give to Olivia. Her boyfriend wants her to go. This band is one that my daughter and her boyfriend both enjoy and have apparently bonded over. She has bought him merchandise as gifts. 

In February his dad informally invited her along to a concert, but we would have to pay for a ticket and she wouldn’t be sitting with them. My husband and I found it disrespectful that his father did not reach out to us and ask. Olivia was very understanding, and did not end up going. 

This Thursday a specific band is playing, so she really wants to go. Her boyfriend’s father reached out to me via text and gave me some details, expressed that he and his son want Olivia to come along. He has a free ticket, so they’ll be sitting in great seats together. However, the venue is an hour and 45 minutes away from our home. This makes my husband and I uncomfortable.

We don’t like the distance, and she would have to be picked up a little early from school, which would result in her missing a study hall and math class. Olivia would return home at 12 am or so on a school night. 

Olivia is very mellow, and often goes with the flow and doesn’t get upset. I think that this is because she is the oldest child, and her sister is a little younger. She is also mature. She believes she should be allowed to go, because her grades are good, she will be chaperoned, we have to pay nothing, and she will go to school the next day despite losing some sleep.

My husband and I both disagree, and told her there is no room for discussion, even though she tried to talk about it. We expect her to be understanding of our decision, but part of me feels like maybe we were in the wrong. 

Please respond thoughtfully. Thank you!

My daughter and I are very close. I want her to be happy, but there are so many factors that make me feel uncomfortable. I trust her, she has been away from home before, but I feel like this is something she can miss and see in the future.

"AITA for Only Wanting to Pay for What's My Fault? 

I'm a 16-year-old with a sister who's 17, and recently, we ended up breaking our washing machine, leading to a hefty repair bill of $600. Our mom divided the cost, giving each of us $300 to pay her back through chores, babysitting, or upfront payment. We don't have a dad in the picture.

The incident that led to the breakage happened when I was downstairs grabbing a snack, It was my sisters turn to watch our 4-year-old brother. When my brother asked for a snack, my sister said he'd already had one, so I told him he couldn't have more. This led to a meltdown from my brother, resulting in him attacking me. he ended up damaging a new chair, which also caused injury to myself. (Slipped in water and fell on my back)

Despite my limited involvement in the incident, my mom blamed both me and my sister for the damage. I felt unfairly targeted, especially considering my sister was primarily responsible for supervising our brother at the time. Fed up with the situation, I quit babysitting, feeling unappreciated and undervalued, especially since I wasn't even being paid for my efforts.

This wasn't the first time such an incident occurred. I was forced to babysit again without pay, leading to another problem where my brother's behavior resulted in further damage and blame placed on me. After appologizing and trying to make it up to her I suggested paying back the damage through getting a job, but my mom refused, insisting I pay for both chairs, totaling $640, despite one incident being clearly my fault and the other largely due to my sister's supervision. Shes making us both do house cleaning (She has OCD) Until we both clean or babysit whats equivalent to $300 (Her) and $640 my end

Desperate to settle my debt, I explored options like monetizing my Twitch and YouTube channels or seeking permission for a job, shes letting me try makong content but she wont let me get a job. With only $50 to my name, I'm left feeling trapped and unfairly burdened with all the debt that I believe is unfair

So, would I be the jerk if I only paid for what was my fault?",0.38
"AITA for telling my mother-in-law not to bring her dog on a trip I feel like I'm taking crazy pills, so I hope I can get a sanity check from you all.

My spouse and I (early 40sMF) are taking our son (13M) to the Bahamas for his birthday. He has always wanted to go, and now that's he's becoming a teenager,  we wanted to treat him to something extravagant. We found a nice hotel, and the plan is to spend a bunch of time enjoying the ocean and letting our son veg out.

To note, there are activities to do, but our son isn't super keen on packing in a bunch of adventures. So we're going to go with what he wants, even if some of it seems like it would be cool.

The crux of the issue: we are on the outs with my in-laws. They treated us like shit when we moved away and I'm pretty sure my MIL has some stuff that's wrong with her head. She's definitely got some narcissistic behaviors and I wouldn't be surprised if she was BPD or bipolar but I'm not a psych.

We reached out to see if they wanted to come. Our son still has a somewhat decent relationship with them, and we thought it would be magnanimous to let them come along plus it would make him feel special. It would also avoid a lot of the issues that crop up when we visit to each other's homes.

The problem is my FIL and MIL want to bring their dog. The resort is not dog friendly. They are going to get an AirBnB ""nearby"". They have stated they will get a dog sitter for when they'll be out at restaurants etc. Why can't they just get a dog sitter for the dog at their house and not bring the dog on a long flight? I do not know.

Would I be the asshole if I told them they can't bring the dog? Like, I get it. It doesn't disrupt our plans if they have a dog with them. But I don't think dogs are allowed at the resort beach either. So in the limited time they have with us (3 days), I can predict there's going to be a lot of fuckery surrounding this dog. They'll have to split up, or miss dinners, or whatever. It is definitely going to be lame for my kid, who we're supposed to be celebrating. The trip will be about that damn dog. Plus it seems like a huge dick move to just insist the dog come. Am I being crazy to think this is a weird power move? Do people frequently bring their animals when invited on other people's vacations? Our relationship is so fraught I really do wonder if I'm being oversensitive. 

In case anyone cares, we are not paying for their tickets or anything, which adds to my thought that maybe I'm the asshole here.

Tldr:
MIL wants to bring a dog on a birthday vacation for my son. None of the places we will be are dog friendly. I want to tell her to not bring the dog to avoid taking time away from visiting my son, but it feels like maybe I'm projecting some of the strain of our relationship onto what is a normal request.",0.88
"AITA for forcing my friend to pay for his food upfront or not order at all? I’m in a tight group of four friends, and we usually hang out at one of our places every week to just chill and grab some food. We keep things simple with payments: one person covers the bill and then sends the receipt over to our WhatsApp group so everyone can send their share back.

  
Here's the issue—one of my friends, I will call him John, never volunteers to pay. That's not a big deal by itself, but he’s also really slow about paying his part. For the last few times we hung out, he’s taken a week or more to send his share. Sometimes, he doesn't pay at all unless we remind him, and even then, he drags his feet. It’s starting to get annoying because I feel like I shouldn't have to chase him down for this.

  
John’s currently unemployed and trying to make it as a musician, so I get that he’s strapped for cash. Still, it feels unfair that he continues to order food with us without being prompt about paying.

  
The other day, we were at another friend’s place and nobody stepped up to pay, so I did. Before I placed the order, I had a bit of a moment with John. I told him he needed to pay me before I ordered, or he should sort out his own food. I admit I was pretty frustrated and called him out on always being late and sometimes not paying at all. He didn’t say anything, just looked disturbed and left. My other friends think I was too harsh and even called me an asshole for the way I handled it.  


So, was I the asshole for confronting my friend and demanding he pay upfront or order his own food?

"AITA for not being okay with not being invited for my friend’s 18 birthday ?   So I have that friend group (composed of 2 girls named J and A and a boy named B) that met since last year at school. They were very nice and I knew one of the girl since middle school which is the girl that turned 18(A). So basically, they organized a surprise birthday party for her and they all got an invitation from A’s parents except me. At first I thought that maybe they didn’t have my number and they will eventually sent me one because they’ve already seen me wi her daughter and know that I’m nice person who doesn’t do “bad” things like smoking for example. On the day of her birthday, none of them talked in the group chat we usually chat in. I found that weird because it was her birthday. I really got hurt that none of them even just asked me why i wasnt here or just sending me some pics or even tell me ""you werent invited because my parents didnt want to"". So I decided to ask them why they didn’t even have the respect to tell me that they went to her birthday and tell me the reason of why I wasn’t invited because I’m supposed to be their friend. They started telling me that I was in the wrong and that I just wanted to get angry at them. They said that it was normal that they didn’t tell me anything because I wasn’t invited. They told me “we knew that you weren’t invited so we thought it would’ve hurt you to send you any pictures or ask you why you didn’t come”. They kept saying that I’m not supposed to act that way. I know it’s long for nothing but it really hurt my feelings and I don’t think I consider them as my friends. But the thing is I hate being someone that’s mean and I’d like to know if I was really in the wrong. ",0.12
"WIBTA if I got a tattoo despite my fiancée's wishes? The other day, I (22M) was talking to my fiancée (21F) (I will call her Mary) and one of our mutual friends (22F) (I will call her Sara). The topic of tattoos was brought up. The conversation wasn't negative at all, just talking about some of our other friends who had them. I mentioned that I was thinking about getting one, and Sara said that if I got one, she would get one with me. Mary, however, got silent and started glaring at me.

For context, we had talked about tattoos in the past. At the time, I was really on the fence mostly due to my fear of needles. Mary told me that it was probably just a good idea to avoid it until I was 100% sure I wanted one. I agreed, but I have since grown out of my fear and I found a design that I really like.

After our conversation with Sara, Mary turned to me and said ""Seriously, if you get a tattoo, I will be very mad at you."" I don't know where this attitude about it came from. I don't want to bring it up because she is never seriously mad. On the other hand, this is something I seriously want to do. I'm thinking this is an ""asking for forgiveness is easier than asking for permission"" situation. So WIBTA?",0.17
"AITA for having a panic attack at work? So I've worked at a pet store for about a year. About Well, Friday (4/12) I go into work, and into the back where my breeders are, and all of my rats are gone. It turns out that while I was away at a competition for two days, my boss decided to put all of my breeder rats up for sale because they weren't producing. She did not tell me at all. Did not send a text, or anything. She said she didn't text me because I was at competitions, but more on that later. 

So, I go into the back and my rats are gone. I start freaking out and having a panic attack because those guys are extremely important to me, as I've raised most of them and they all have names. I call my mom and tell her to come pick me up because I am freaking out. She's talking to me on the phone and trying to calm me down and I am yelling because my brain can't comprehend what's happening properly. 

This was about the time when another lady who works with me and has been working here for so long that she is basically my second boss, calls my boss. She did not come back to try and calm me down, just straight up called my boss to come over here because I was freaking out. 

My mom comes back, and is talking to me, and a minute or two later my boss walks in. She basically tells me that it isn't good that I am having a panic attack because it is bad for business. Mind you, there were no customers in the store. None at all, just me, my employee friend, and my second boss. Then, she tells me that it is her store and she has control over it. I understand this, but I would have liked to have been informed. 

She tells me that she didn't want to text or call because I was at competitions. I told her that she could have called and it wouldn't have interrupted anything at all. She doesn't want to hear it. I end up leaving. 

Later on that same day, Friday, after I had calmed down, I sent her an apology over text. It wasn't long, but it was sincere, basically detailing how I should have acted like an adult and I was sorry.

She Read the text on Friday, and never responded. (I have an iPhone and can see when people do that) 

So forward to today (4/15), and I go in because I have a shift. She stops me at the door, before I even get in. Gives me my paycheck and explains that ""this isn't going to work out"". Had me go back and get my stuff. 

On the way out, I said goodbye to the only rat she had kept, who I have raised since the day he was born. She came back and since I had been mostly quiet the entire time, she said, ""Don't have anything to say to me?"" and I said, ""Nope."" 

That was when I said, ""Just make sure you call me about him if you decide to sell him. He's really important to me."" 
This lady deadass looks at me and says, ""Well, your job should have been important to you."" 

Mind you, I had this panic attack BECAUSE of how much I liked my job. 

That's about all.",0.7
"AITA for not allowing my homeless friend to live with me? I (16F) am the youngest of four siblings. We used to have a massive house, with six bedrooms and multiple bathrooms, but after my dad's gambling addiction caught up to him, we had to sell the house and move into a tiny apartment, with only two bedrooms, forcing my elder brother to move out, which I found unfair at the time. Recently, I found out one of my closest friends (19M) had been kicked out by his parents for coming out as gay, and has been couch surfing for the past two months. We had been friends since childhood, and he would be constantly at my house, my mom even considering him a son. Recently he asked whether he could live at my house, not knowing we had moved, but when I explained we no longer had the room to house him, he continued to ask until eventually I blocked him off my phone.

Apparently my friend had got into contact with her, and had made plans behind my back to move in. My mom explained that, without consulting me even once, they had decided that my friend would move into my room, and I were to move in with my elder sister several cities away, because 'He's going through more than I ever will', despite the fact that my dad has severe gambling issues that has ruined our entire family. If I am to move, I will lose all the friends I have ever made, and be forced to start an entirely new school, just a year before I graduate from high school. I unblocked my friend immediately after the conversation with my mom, and angrily texted him about how he's ruining my life by trying to move in, but he didn't seem to see the issue, arguing that at least I will have a  constant roof over my head and that my mom is the only one to treat him with kindness, despite our long lasting friendship.

"AITA for falling asleep during a date? My boyfriend (22M) and I (22F) have been dating for a year and a half, and it's been wonderful. He's a really good boyfriend.

I'm studying and volunteering at a clinic in the vet med field. My schedule is packed; I sleep 4-6 hours a night and meticulously plan my week, even squeezing in laundry. I manage to see him once a week.

Last year, we had an issue when I kept falling asleep during our dates. I have ADHD and usually take medication, but it's currently out of stock. My doctor prescribed a higher dose temporarily, but it's been a struggle. My boyfriend and I agreed that I shouldn't take the pills, but I started again on days we'd meet. He's into sociology and politics, topics I wasn't keen on before.

He felt I was nodding off because I was bored. I reassured him it wasn't the case; I was just tired, usually towards the end of our dates.

I've since made an effort to understand his passions, even delving deeper into them. I want to show him I care and that I'm willing to make the effort, even if the topics are challenging for me. Since resuming the medication on days we meet, we haven't had issues.

However, lately, I've been exhausted. I had to give up volunteering in a field I'm interested in (non-obligatory) to have at least one day for laundry, relaxation, hobbies, and homework. It happened just last week.

Yesterday, our date was exhausting due to the hot weather and lack of sleep the night before. As we watched a show, I struggled to stay awake. When he started talking about a song, I dozed off briefly. Afterward, he was serious, and I apologized. He doesn't want to discuss it further, feeling there's nothing more to add. I'm angry at myself for falling asleep, but I also feel he's taking it too personally, not acknowledging the efforts I've made. I'm frustrated because he seems to have a double standard regarding our interests (I also feel sometimes that he is bored in  moments i told him about my interests, but i dont care about it, i understand that not everyone is interested in the topics im interested) and he doesn't understand my chronic fatigue or why I fall asleep.

I don't want to dismiss his feelings, but I'm unsure if I'm justified in being upset with him for being upset. Am I the AH for being mad at him being mad?

TDRL: My (22F) boyfriend (22M) is mad that i fall asleep when hes talking about a topic im not that interested in, but im cronically tired and it has nothing to do with what hes speaking about. Also ive shown interest and i dont feel my efforts are being seeing.

"AITA for getting upset/sad when my girlfriend talks about being attracted to guys? for context, my girlfriend and i are both females, i identify as a lesbian and my girlfriend identifies as bisexual. recently, she's been bringing up being attracted in various ways or finding certain things attractive from other people. she will do this with other women, but it feels almost more upsetting when she has these feelings for men. i always thought it was because i'm not a man, and can't provide those kinds of traits for her, so it hurt more than talking about liking the way other women looked. she will say things like how she finds it really hot when men whimper or are submissive, or will keep screenshots of famous men in suggestive positions or wearing little clothing and talk about liking them or finding them hot/a turn-on. i understand her having these conversations with her friends, but i don't want to sit and talk about how she is turned on by men as a woman. lately, i have been wondering if this reflects poorly on me, as i know she cannot control who she is attracted to and i don't want to be biphobic, but i am worried i might be thinking that way. it just hurts being her girlfriend and feeling like there is something she wants that i can't give her or that she is more attracted to other people than she is me. it hurts me when she talks about women too, as she will talk about being attracted to or turned on by masc-presenting women, when i am very fem-presenting. she assures me when i ask that she is only interested in me and loves me for me, and i don't think she would ever cheat on me or anything like that, i just don't know how to feel about her talking about her attraction to other people. i don't want to shame her or make her feel bad, and i'm worried it may be a poor quality of my own that i need to work on -- obviously i am not threatened in my relationship by famous men, and she's given me assurance that she doesn't like anyone but me, so why can i not let these things go and why do they make me feel so sad?",0.2
"AITA for hoping for a Birthday Gift from my GF?  I am 43m and started dating a 35f last April, after we met online. I ended the relationship between the mother of my children the previous April (2022) but didn't move out until late August and my current gf's marriage ended in January 2023 after her husband left her suddenly.

So by the time we met she had only been single for 4 months. But we weren't rushing anything and just taking it day by day. We were enjoying dating and taking short trips together. We were having fun. Although she did tell me she was having trouble letting down her emotional walls - which was completely normal given the trauma she had been through. I was happy to take things slow. In fact we have still never met each other's children a year later and we don't plan to introduce them for at least another year.

Anyway things changed slightly in September, when I accidentally let those 3 little words slip out at the end of a phone call whilst tipsy. Neither of us acknowledged it though. I did the same thing a few weeks later, this time in person and we both kinda did acknowledge it. She later said it was nice to hear but wasnt ready to say anything like that. Again this was completely fine and tbh - I was expecting this response. I didn't say it myself with intention. I did saying with intention, however, a month later when we visited London for her Birthday. Again wasn't expecting to hear it back, as I believe if you love someone you say it freely and without expectation.I also felt it was necessary for her healing to know that she was loved for who she was.

BUUUUT, I became a little insecure about it and maybe felt a little vulnerable and that she held the balance of power in the relationship. I also began noticing that she rarely paid me compliments or gave me words of affirmation or affection, whereas I always tried to make her feel good about herself, confident and beautiful. So I brought it up just after Christmas. I explained how I was feeling vulnerable and that it was my issue but would appreciate her making more of an effort in that regard.

She tried for a while but things soon went back to normal and I think the same issue has come up a couple of times, finally coing to a head a couple of weeks ago. We didn't argue or anything but had an adult discussion where she said she didn't feel ready to give me what I need. Therefore, at this point we decided to end it, although, I never truly felt we wouldn't see each other again. I just felt she needed space. This was on the Thursday and she reached out on the Friday and Sunday. She said she felt conflicted about the whole thing (understandable), so I asked her to take  a week to think about what she needed and get back to me. She agreed and wrote ""LY"" at the end of the message - The first timecshe hd ever donethat. It was nice to read but I knew she still needed to think. So she took the week and contacted on the Monday which happened to be the day before my Birthday. We had a nice conversation, although nothing was resolved and I asked if I could visit her on the Wednesday, which I thought might have been to say goodbye.

She messaged me first thing on my bday however and said she wished she could spend the day with me to make it special ( although we couldn't- we both had our kids) and we continued messaging just like before.

Sooo I went over on the Wednesday, she immediately kissed me and presented me with a beautiful cake she made me. Which was a truly lovely gesture and we spent the rest of the night just talking and having fun. At the end of the night as I was leaving I said those three little words....and she said it back 😁 So for the next couple of days I was walking on air until....This is where I don't know if Iam the asshole or not:

I feel disappointed that she didn't get me a  Birthday Card or even a small gift that related to me. I bought her lots of little gifts for her Birthday that related directly to things she likes and even took her to London to see a Disney Musical as she loves Disney and the Theatre and she even told me those were the most thoughtful gifts she ever had. So I kinda feel resentful that she wasn't prepared to put any thought into me in the form of a small gift or even a nice message on a card. Part of me wants to ask why not, buy part of me doesn't want to be THAT GUY, so I always complaining, or asking for more. Am I being ungrateful. Am I the Asshole?",0.75
"AITA for wanting to move closer to my family? This is my first time posting. My situation is as follows. I (43m) have been with wife (42f) for almost 11 years, married for 8. We have a kid together. My problem is that my kid has no relationship with any of her aunts, uncles or cousins on my side of the family. I constantly try to talk to wife about how it could be detrimental to our kid to not know all of her family. My kid has a good relationship with wife’s family, but doesn’t even know her aunts and uncles. I am constantly reminded of how it felt to go to my mom’s funeral last year by myself, when I wanted to at least take my kid so she could meet my family. My kid had only met my family once at 5 months old, so there is no way she could even have an idea of who they are. My kid is about to be 7, and I don’t feel right denying my family the ability to build something of a relationship with my sisters and their husbands. I apply for jobs that would put us closer to my family, and constantly tell wife that I am finding jobs in her field. But, I am constantly getting pushback, and refusals. Wife claims that moving would strain my kids relationship with wife’s family, but won’t listen when I say that my family is strained already because of the distance. My family is 2,000 miles away. Am I the a-hole for trying to get wife to agree to move closer to my family?",0.72
"AITA for not getting my Ex, who I’m trying to remain friends with, a baby shower gift?  Two years ago I (M32) dated someone (F26). It started casual at first and we mutually agreed it was just a fling. Over time we bonded and it got serious enough that we became exclusive. We never put a title on it due to lingering doubts on both parties. That being said we really, really loved each other. 

A year later her feelings deepened but I still had doubts and decided it was best not to pursue the relationship further. We split. It wasn’t mutual, but it was amicable. We decided to attempt to stay friends.

Note: this is NOT my norm. Once we’re done, we’re done. But in my big age and since she treated me really well, I decided to try. I explained to her how hard that was for me and that we’d have to ease into it. 

A month later she began dating someone else, a month after that he moved in, a month after that they’re Engaged!! I’ll tell you this, I was not ready to cope with all the news. 

Nevertheless, I fought my natural jealous instincts and remained platonic with her. I’ll skip the part where I made a move on her a few months later (I’m really embarrassed about it). Even through that we kept the friendship. 

New Year’s Eve she calls me and tells me she’s pregnant with his kid. I held it together.   I didn’t feel I had the right to comment; couples have kids. 

Today … she sends the baby shower registry! And I can’t. A year ago at this time we were still together!! 

AITA for not sending her a baby shower gift? 

I didn’t even bring up the fact that I got laid off or that I was struggling financially even before the lay off. I just told her (respectfully) that I don’t think it’s something I can do. Between us here, I can’t bring myself to send a gift to my Ex and her New guy for Their baby. AITA?",0.45
"AITA if I drop out of the wedding party? Long story short - My partner and I share groups of friends together. I met the bride through my partner years ago and that’s how I know her. We’ve all hung out so much and we were all very close. My partner and I were both in the wedding party and we were very honoured.

My partner had an affair on me - and I told her friend (the bride) about it. I let loose and just let it all out and it felt amazing to let it off of my chest. The bride was upset but took it a bit too far.

They had a blow out and are not speaking anymore - the bride blew up at my partner and was angry that they didn’t reach out to talk to her about what was going on. The message was very rude and my intention was to not “get her on my side”, but the bride’s message came off that way. My partner is out of the wedding and I am still in it.

Over the last couple of months, my partner and I found out that the bride has been running her mouth about us and telling strangers about the affair… It feels like the entire town knows about it and it makes us both uncomfortable and quite frankly sick to our stomachs.. 

Would it be wrong of me to back out of the wedding? I don’t appreciate how I trusted her with information and I was trying to talk to a friend about how I was feeling, and she’s turned around and told people that have no business knowing what’s happened. I’ve had strangers message me on Facebook and tell me that they know about it, and I know that they’ve heard from her. My partners other friend told her that the bride said something to her randomly while they saw each other at work about it. This friend and the bride haven’t really spoken since high school and the bride just talked about it like they were BFFs catching up…

I’m very hurt by this, and so is my partner. They’ve known eachother 10+ years and the fact that she could do this, shocks us and terrifies us. We’re both constantly anxious about going out in the town that we live in because we don’t know who knows and who doesn’t.. even going to get groceries is so scary to me because I feel like everybody is staring. My partner sometimes has to finish grocery shopping while I go to the car because I’ll have anxiety attacks. I just want to know - am I the asshole if I drop out of the wedding party?

FYI: my business is totally my business, and I get that people may have their reservations about the affair that I mentioned. People make mistakes and in a relationship, 2 different people have 2 different experiences - and neither of them are the wrong experience. We are going through therapy, and we are working through it. This was *not* what I’m needing advice on. ",0.95
"AITA for asking if my co-worker was pregnant after she implied she was? Okay, so you I’m asking this because I’m very upset about it happening, and since my feelings are as hurt ad they are, I’d like some outside insight, I guess. It won’t change how things go down; it’s in the past and I won’t be addressing it at work again unless it’s brought up with me directly. This is for my own benefit internally. I am genuinely afraid that I overstepped here, though, and my boyfriend reassuring me isn’t exactly a neutral party.

So I’ve been working here for a couple of months, and I love my job. My co-worker, A, has always kinda frozen me out of conversations, ever since I first met her. She ignores questions I ask her and things I’ve said. I’ll say something to her directly and it’s like I’ve never spoken at all. She and the other girls, including one I primarily work with, B, chat all the time, and they even go out after work. I’ve noticed that there is another new girl who she isn’t this way to; they talk and laugh and never have any issues. But with me, A ignores me outright when I speak. However, she’s leaving soon, and I was excited for her because she’s going to be a stay at home mom. This afternoon, B, A, and I were all talking, and A heavily implied in a statement to me that she was pregnant (she basically said that the almost two year gap one pregnant girl is having between her kids will be more of a gap than she will have between her kids. She only has one kid, and he’s under six months. So yes, heavily implied). Excited for her, I asked if she was pregnant, and I assumed she was okay discussing it because she had brought up her own life herself. She didn’t say anything and was a bit aways, so I figured maybe she didn’t hear me, and asked again. She walked away, still not saying anything. I guess my brain didn’t process this as her ignoring me, because I asked B if A was pregnant, and B kind of apologetically said that it was her business. I said okay and left it at that, and I didn’t ask again. I will say, too, that later, A was openly discussing her pregnancy (which she confirmed outright this time) right in front of me with B and the other new girl. I’m concerned that maybe I overstepped and asked a personal question when I shouldn’t have, even if she did all but say the words “I’m pregnant”. What do you think? AITA?",0.71
