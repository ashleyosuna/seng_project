"WIBTA? Skipping coworkers funeral? My coworker had passed away over the weekend & today was her service. Now I wouldn’t consider this coworker and I super close, but I did know her. We worked together often, she was my superior and we would talk often on our shifts, gossiping and messing around. (We work in healthcare, nightshift).  I would have considered her someone I really liked at work and enjoyed seeing us on the same shift together. However, I had only known her for a year and a lot of my other colleagues have known her for 5+, so that being said, I knew her the least. There is a group of them that are all very close and tight knit that ended up planning on attending the service together then going out for dinner and I was not invited. I was a bit upset by this but tried not to take it too to heart because in all fairness, I only know all of them on a surface level basis and vice versa, so I understood why I wasn’t included, it’d probably be weird if I was. But it got me in my head thinking, is it even appropriate for me to go to the service? Do i still pay my respects? Or is it inappropriate because I didnt know her through and through or for that long? I dont know, I am a chronic overthinker. I had donated some money towards the family and signed a card along with some other coworkers too, maybe thats enough?
Anyways, I intended on going to the service after the group of them had gone and when I got there I got really bad anxiety and left. Now I am filled with guilt about not attending and feel awful. I am beating myself up for letting my anxiety and insecurities dictate this because it isnt about me. AITA for overthinking and being selfish or is it not that extreme? 
There is another service tomorrow morning for an hour right before the funeral but I figured that one was more intimate for family.

"AITA if I'm upset my supposed ""good friend"" sold my beloved parents' furniture after I gifted it them? So, I had the sole responsibility of cleaning out my family home  lasty year (only child here). It was many painful months, and I finally asked friends if they wanted to take some of my parents’ furniture. Keep in mind that this was our family dining room table (many holidays spent gathering there), and our entire living room set. My supposed good friend wanted rooms of furniture, but insisted that she move everything on her own timeline. I didn’t care, I was overwhelmed, so I gave in for weeks and weeks due to their home repairs (she, never thinking about how difficult this was for \*me = grief\*.)  I finally needed to get everything out of the house b/c I was selling/renovating it and she was insulted that we “didn’t coordinate movers.” Weeks later, after finally getting the furniture, she posts my family’s real estate listing on Facebook. In the text, she advertises the price saying it was overpriced- this is to all of our mutual friends on Facebook. I tell her the post was incredibly invasive. She blocks me for being “too emotional.” A year later, she is selling the furniture, using personal photos of my parents’ home and touting up it’s from an “exclusive area.” They are not hurting from money, and I know it’s a gift, but I find this incredibly invasive and mercenary.

"AITA for being ungrateful on my birthday? It was my birthday this week. I usually hate celebrating because past birthdays I have been really let down (people cancelling on me the day of celebrations, no one doing anything special for me, past boyfriends not even writing me a card let alone presents). I was however excited for my birthday this year because I have a new boyfriend who I thought would go above and beyond. I was so keen for the entire month because I couldn’t wait to see what he had in store.

For context I am someone who loves other peoples birthdays. I love writing down peoples interests and things they mention so I can get thoughtful gifts. I love writing 10 page long birthday letters describing how lucky I am to have them and everything I love about them. I love organising dinners and gifts and overall just spoiling people on their special day.

This year I organised a dinner and bowling with my family and boyfriend. I asked my family to get there 30 mins earlier (they are known for being late). People being late for things is my biggest pet peeve, I believe it is super disrespectful and inconsiderate and I am quite a time anxious person so I need everything to be on time or else I get stressed. Anyways, they rock up 20 minutes late. I had organised everything, all they had to do was show up on time, and they didn’t. And no one got me a present. My bf got me a present and a card, but I couldn’t open it because we were running late. This put me in a really bad mood for the remainder of the night.

After my family left, my bf and I argued for 2 hours because he was claiming I was being ungrateful, and that he went above and beyond to make my birthday special (I wouldn’t call a card and present above and beyond, I would call it the bare minimum) and there was no thought put into the gift.

Anyways I spent most of my night crying and arguing and I thought it was really unfair because I built my special day up so much in my head and I felt very let down by everyone. I understand I shouldn’t have held a grudge the whole night but I also felt like I deserved more as I am always doing the most for my loved ones?

AITA? Any insight would be appreciated.",0.77
"AITA for blowing up at my bf for a stupid joke he made? My boyfriend (M26) and I (F26) have been together for almost a year. He's a great guy and we are really good together.

There's a specific joke that he makes that bothers me a lot. He is always ""joking"" about me sneaking guys into the house when he's away or how I have a bunch of guy friends that come over and hang out without him knowing (which I don't even have any guy friends to begin with and he knows this).

He is not really the jealous type, it's just this ""joke"" that he makes all the time. He was cheated on in this past and I'm not sure this is related to that.

Obviously I told him that this hurts my feelings and that I would never cheat on him and how I don't like him speaking to me like this, even if to him it's ""just a joke"".

He thinks I'm overreacting when I get upset.

"AITA for changing my mind on buying con tickets from my ex? My ex and I broke up two months ago. When we were dating he brought two tickets for a major convention in my state. 
 
For context: my ex was never an anime fan, in April I had asked him to go to a con and do a couple cosplay together and he made excuses on why he didn’t want to go (too much people, him not liking anime, him not knowing the characters, him having OCD, him not trusting stuff from China?) and that I have to learn to do things I like by myself. Valid reasons, I was salty but I accepted it and never went to the con since I had no one to go with. I could’ve gone by myself but it’s lonely going to a con alone.

Few weeks later a male friend asked me if I wanted to go to my states biggest con in August. He also likes anime and I’ve known him for a few years. I say yeah, since I had no one to go with anyways. I tell my ex bf this and he gets upset with me because I should’ve at least asked him if he wanted to go etc. I told him it made no sense and reminded him that he didn’t want to go to the first one so I didn’t bother asking him.  He changes his mind and buys the ticket to the major con and tells me. I’m surprised but happy.
I tell my friend nvm I’m going with bf, he says ok and we can meet up at the con and he can meet my bf.

We broke up last month, and the con is next month. It was last minutes so the tickets were sold out I couldn’t buy them if I wanted to, so I asked my ex if I could buy my ticket off of him. He argues and says it’s not fair that I get to go to the con when we were supposed to go together, and that we could still go together. I was firm in our break up and had no desire to see him as I believed it was dangerous to meet up alone. So I said no and offered to buy the extra ticket and give another friend. He says okay. 

I found out recently I have to travel out the country and can’t make it to the con. So I tell him I can’t buy the tickets from him. 
He tells me he paid over $157 for the tickets and he’s losing out on money because he doesn’t even want to go to the con and only bought them to go with me. I apologize and reminded him that I never asked him to buy the tickets that he brought them in a fit of insecurity and I had only offered to buy MY tickets because I thought I was going, and only offered to buy the extra ticket because it was a loss just to be nice. He says Im evil for doing that to him. But people are entitled to change their minds right? Like the cons a month away it’s not like I changed my mind last minute, and I’m not gonna lie I do feel bad that it is a loss, but had I not asked to buy them to begin with what would he have done with it….

I got pregnant,Her mom stopped all contact she decided that she not taking their daughter and she stopped calling her.So then I had to deal with the backlash and be mom.I decided to move in with my BF and things we're getting better his daughter had a better attitude,her chores were getting done,and we were bonding more than ever.sge goes to see her grandpa for the summer,I did not have a problem with this until I found out that her mom was staying there.She goes out and sees them,I thought her mom would be more involved now that they got this bonding time.When she got back her mom made promises she couldnt keep,so she was in a bad head space again throwing attitude,not doing her chores,and being defiant towards me so I tried my best tounderstand because her mom was causing her pain and I related to it because my dad walked out on me too.I was working at a job and the job wasnt going to pay for maternity leave so I had to leave my job to find another job but our schedules were too complicated to watch the children so I decided to be a stayathome mom and get benefits to help out with food and healthinsurance.My BF is a great man but he has ADHD so he forgets and he procrastinates.I set up and make sure the kids go to their appointments and take care of them regularly.My stepdaughter just got into a new school and my BF wants me to be the one picking her up and taking care of her.I've gotten to this point where I feel like he's putting a lot of the parenting on to me and it's overwhelming me because we are not married.I told him today that I don't want to have to be the one taking care of his daughter all the time and picking her up from school.I gave him the option that she could get on the public bus which have a safe place sign for kids.The bus that she would be taking would be a straight shot to the school but he doesn't want to compromise because he thinks its too risky so I told him to figure it out and that he needs to find people to watch his daughter and get her from school MOST of the time because I feel like he's putting so much on me and not holding his BM accountable by not putting her on child support and not taking his divorce seriously.Am I the a******?",0.88
"AITA for trying to hire my ex's ex for gig work? Me (30f) and my ex (39M, let’s call him Gary) broke up 5 months ago. We started dating because we run in similar professional circles, although not the same company or field. Before we got together, Gary recommended a designer (we’ll call her Linda) for some of our projects. While Linda would typically be too expensive for us, she did some pro bono work to break into our industry, which is impact driven. She declined being paid more, saying she was happy to be doing meaningful work. Her work was INCREDIBLE. With very little direction she built entire projects that were beautiful and meticulous. We also got along super well, and the work she did has been unparalleled by people we pay more for today.

Back to t-1 year ago. Gary and I were dating, and I mentioned Linda’s work. I thanked him for rec, and said that I wanted to hire her again. Gary became very upset by this because unbeknownst to me, he and Linda had been dating on/off for 6 years when he made the referral. He told stories before about his ex before that sounded intense – but I had no idea it was Linda. He said he was uncomfortable with me working with her and I took this to heart. When she reached out asking for more work, I let the email pass me by.

Gary and I split up about 6 months after that. We were “cordial” since we ran into one another for work, but only ever talked only if it was needed. I found out later that Gary told mutual colleagues about our breakup, and painted me in a very negative and untrue light, which damaged a few relationships. With this new context, I didn’t think Linda was the monster she was made out to be by Gary. 

 So, we get to today. I was working on some old materials and came across Linda’s work. There were a few incomplete items that I thought would be perfect for our current project. I figured she probably didn’t know that I even dated Gary, and this was in a professional context, so I didn’t see the harm when I sent an email to see if she was free.

An hour after, I had a text message from Gary containing a SCREENSHOT of the email that I sent to Linda. This weirded me out and I thought it was a breach of privacy. He was pissed, saying that reaching out was inappropriate, psychopathic, and that I went behind his back. To me, the statute of limitations on hiring Linda expired when the relationship did, I felt I gave it enough buffer for decency, and she can make her own decisions without Gary getting involved. However, since it’s clear I struck a nerve, so I sent Linda a “Sorry! Let’s just drop it!” email. I haven’t heard anything from her yet, but I’ll update if I do.

So AITA in trying to hire her after I dated her ex? I find Gary’s reaction feels immature, but maybe it was inconsiderate to ask her, especially if they’re back together/on speaking terms? In the meantime, I stopped replying and I don’t know where to go from here.",0.05
"AITA for leaving my boyfriend at a BJs alone, and with the bill? I, 18(F) went out to dinner with my boyfriend 19(M) on a Wednesday night. He offered to take me out for dinner after i had gotten in a pretty rough fight with my mom. I came over to his house seeking comfort, when he asked if id like to get some dinner (i hadn’t ate all day). I said yes, and we headed off to our local BJs. The dinner was going well, until he made a joke about asking the waiter if they accepted “freak pay”. I told him repeatedly “no, don’t ask that”. In response, he got incredibly offended and upset because he was “just joking”. We ate the rest of our meal, and when the check came, lo and behold he asked: “do you guys accept freak pay”. 

i was so embarrassed and frankly disrespected that i walked out of the restaurant immediately. i wasted no time calling an uber home. after getting in the uber, i turned off my phone and went to bed for the night. when i woke up, i had several missed calls and texts, along with frantic voicemails. he pleaded with me “please baby, i just wanted to know if they take freak pay”. 

i called him back, and let him know that i needed space and that the stunt he pulled made me feel very unheard and embarrassed. i’ve always known he was somewhat of an oddball but i never thought he would embarrass me publicly like that. 

i decided to block his contact from my phone, and block his socials.

"WIBTA for not caring for a dog?  My grandfather passed away a month ago and I inherited his home that I was raised in. (Grandparents took me in through out my elementary, middle, and high school years.) 
I moved out and away shortly after when I became a dad. Grandpa got really bad after my grandma passed away so I moved back to take care of him during his remaining days. He died and left me the house along with everything in it. He was a horder and old so I took over and cleaned the house and fixed it up so he could see its former glory one last time before he left us. 

Now on the subject in question. 
He left his dog (obviously). Small little terrier. 

I hate dogs and am not an animal person in general. 
Not for no reason but I’ve been attacked and just have had bad experiences before so I never wanted to care for one and go to great efforts to avoid them usually. I don’t have time to care for this animal. I’m gone usually all day with other priorities and feel like I shouldn’t be responsible for an animal when I literally cannot give it the correct amount of love and attention. No other family members want to take it because it does NOT play well with other animals or kids. He has already ruined countless things I’ve just finished repairing or replacing. Attacked my son for walking by him and generally will just bark at everything all hours of the night.  I told everyone that if no one wants to take responsibility for it I will be forced to have him come picked up and taken to a shelter. My wife isn’t thrilled about having the dog but said I’m kinda jumping the gun on what to do with him. My extended family says I’m cruel and heartless which I argue that me not having the proper time to care for it is more cruel but W/E.

"AITA/Controlling mom I feel like I keep trying to set boundaries with my mom but she just isn’t hearing me. She has done things like make comments about my weight before my wedding, took over and controlled the wedding itself, gone through my mail etc.
Now that I am pregnant after years of TTC, she is telling people before I do and even threatens to tell people if I take too long to do so. When the baby is born she wants to babysit but she wants to watch the baby at her house, where she has dogs that are 85+ pounds, not trained and constantly jumping on people and knocking them to the ground. One of the dogs also has a bite history and she is a heavy smoker and smokes in the house. I am not comfortable with this and keep trying to express it but instead she goes and buys a 1000$ nursery for her house.
She tells people how the baby is going to live with her and she would have full custody (there is absolutely no reason why my husband and I wouldn’t have custody of our child) 
She makes comments like “how dare you want to breastfeed, how is anyone else supposed to feed the baby. That’s so selfish of you” and how it’s HER baby, not grand baby.

"AITA for blowing up at my sister for letting our cat out? I (24M) and my sister (23F) have been living together for 2 years.

A year or so ago, I found a stray cat that had given birth to a litter. I took them inside and cared for them. I knew that I couldn't keep all of them from the very beginning. So when they were old enough, I tried to sell them off. There was one cat that really liked me, he would brush up on me and sleep with me. I named him Yeezy. I've slowly been trying to sell all of the cats off, except for two. They're both short-haired, but one is much more hyper, and does not match my personality at all, and the other one is Yeezy.

The only way to differentiate the two is by eye-color, but thats not even as reliable. And they can change their personality on a dime it seems. So its VERY hard to distinguish between the two.

Recently, my sister came over to my house she knows about the situation. And I had reminded her that whenever you leave to make sure that Yeezy isn't let out.

Currently we're going through a really bad storm. And yeezy was meowing at the door, so my sister, while I was sleeping let her out. She hadn't left the porch, but she grabbed her and took her to the end of the porch and she ""accidentally"" let her go.

I blew up at her. I told her ""I said multiple times not to let him out. And now as its storming you decide too?"" she said ""she was really wanting to get out"" and ""there's nothing wrong with letting a cat outside""

I decided to leave and stay at my friends house. I regret getting as mad as I did but was it warranted? Currently the power is out at my house, and I'm using a hotspot to type this right now. I'm increasingly getting worried about Yeezy. My mom says to relax and that I'm scaring my sister because ""i'm a grown man and she's a tiny women""

I would never beat or physically hurt my sister, I've never been that aggressive, and I have ways of coping that aren't beating other human beings. But I understand why she would have been scared

My friend on the other hand, thinks that I'm in the right for getting pissed at her. But i'd like to hear you guys.

"AITA for an Argument over Takeout Food?  
I, 23f, and my boyfriend, 21m, have been dating for 5 months. The first issue came in several instances of him asking me to throw trash away out of his car. This, in itself, is such a small task and one I would do gladly. But, it became increasingly annoying and upsetting when I was constantly the only one doing so at his request, and certain situations making me uncomfortable. For example, it would be night time and he would pull up to a dumpster at a random establishment whilst it being dark and ask me repeatedly to throw cups out from his car until I give in, ignoring my vocal discomfort and safety concerns. Most of the time, he would not drive away until I gave in and did as he requested so it would turn into a huge argument. This was a constant thing. When I would express my discomfort, he would call me crazy/psychotic for overreacting over simply throwing away trash. A big breaking point for this issue was one day when I was late to work and he locked his car doors preventing me from entering until I threw away some trash for him. I told him after this that we needed to take a break. My mindset was that he was showing signs of being this controlling, even though this is such a minor thing like throwing trash out, it did not bode well for what was to come in the  remainder of our relationship. Moving on, we have been staying at his parents’ home when I come over because he is on break from college. To add a little bit more context to what I'm about to say, his dad is a pilot and I have heard him state multiple times that he doesn't mind buying food for us. We were hungry and he asked his mom if we could use his dad’s card to order pizza, she said yes as long as he asked his sister if she wanted chicken wings from this place. He made a big deal out of this and was refusing to even consider her until I made him ask her. The three of us got together and she suggested ordering two 8 pc of the wings, which I agreed with. He replied firmly saying only one even though she, and I, wanted two. We were all 4 sharing one pizza, so logically this made sense. He stood his ground and refused to do so saying it would be too expensive, even though it wasn’t his money we were using. Fast forward to time to pickup the food, I told him I wasn’t going with him and that he could go by himself since he wanted to be so controlling over the food situation. We argued back in forth. He ended up telling me to go home. I live an hour away, but I did not fight him. I packed up my stuff and left, only to receive messages and calls telling me to come back and be ‘normal’ and eat pizza with them while 20 minutes into my drive home. AITA in this situation?? ",0.4
"AITA for not immediately believing my boyfriend over a stranger? Me and my boyfriend Adam have been together for 3 years. Over the past 6 months, there have been a few instances that have wore down my trust in him. He brought two girls home from the bar and they were laughing and saying stuff like “don’t worry we won’t tell your girlfriend” because they thought I wasn’t home, we had a fight, he left and spent the night with them. Another time this girl he used to work with told me they had been flirting, after denying it for a while he admitted that they had been flirting and he had been hanging out with her away from work and he deleted the texts so I wouldn’t know.

We’ve always known each others phone passwords and have been allowed to look through them. Well, a couple months ago I noticed he changed it. He said he didn’t want me to have access to his phone because he didn’t want me invading his privacy.

I recently got a text from a random phone number, and they told me that they were a coworker of Adam and wanted to warn me that he and Amber were flirting at work, and when some of them confronted Amber and asked them if they were fucking, she didn’t deny it. She didn’t say yes, but she laughed, blushed, and avoided the question. Everyone took that as a yes, so since then everyone knows that they are a thing at his work place. The coworker told me they wanted to stay anonymous to avoid drama at work, I said I understood and thanked them.

Well, in my dismay, I ended up figuring out his phone password. I found a text from Amber that said “Great Adam, our coworkers just asked me if we’re fucking!”.

I confronted him about it and he said that they weren’t sleeping together. I asked why Amber didn’t deny it when questioned. He got mad, and said that if I don’t trust him then we might as well break up and if I bring it up again he’s leaving.

"AITA for being hurt that my BF broke up with me on his holiday because of a fortune teller?  Hey all. I’ve (23F) been dating my BF (25M) for about a year now and some things have occurred during our relationship:
1. He asked me out (prior to being official) and I saw him the next day shoving his tongue down another woman’s throat in front of me. They stayed together for a month and then he chased me after they broke up, I rejected him a few times which led to him badmouthing me behind my back. Long story short we’re now together. I told him how that made me feel but he got angry at shut me down saying it was before we were official so I needed to let it go. I have. I also found his ex girlfriends sisters, new women, and a lot of people connected to his ex. I gave him the opportunity to tell me the truth but he swore on everything he loved that there was nobody on his phone. When I found out it was somehow my fault for reacting to it. 
2. His cousin has told me I was “toxic, didn’t deserve him” and yelled at me when I cried at those remarks because he didn’t want to see me cry. I told my BF that his cousin made me uncomfortable as he was on all of our 8 first dates as his sidekick and I also mentioned how I was hurt that my BF didn’t defend me in the moment and just sat there. My BF decided to tell his brother about this and his brother messaged me saying I needed to stop acting like a highschooler. 
3. I went to a pre planned Europe trip with my friends and family for 3 months. He asked that I don’t do anything that disrespects him. I called him and updated him as much as he asked, didn’t go to bars or clubs and sat in the hotel room most night. My BF is now on his holiday he promised the same treatment back to me. However he barely texts, calls and goes to bars every single day. When I mention his promises to me he tells me I’m ruining his life and that I’m toxic. I tried to explain that I’m just holding him to his promises that he also made me do, but he says that he’s gone back to his home country and wants to enjoy it. 

That brings me to today. He saw an older women, a fortune teller who told him “there is a woman putting pressure on you and she will destroy your family”. Obviously I knew how this would play out (if it’s even true I’m not even sure the lady said that). His family will all hate me and blame me for anything going wrong in the future. He has done a lot to hurt me however the part that gets me is that I’m the one constantly reprimanded by his family for reacting to being disrespected, and he’s defended for the disrespectful actions. Not once have my family hurt him or yelled at him, they all welcome him. He said it was for the better to end this relationship and he won’t pick me over his family. But HOW can you do that, on the other side of the world, because of a fortune teller you met that day? 

I guess AITA? Am I wrong for always voicing how things make me feel. Sometimes my explanations on my feelings turn to anger but it’s because I feel like I’m not listened to or valued. Am I just a bad girlfriend. I don’t know. Someone please tell me AITA and what to do. ",0.47
"AITA for ""forcing"" my friends to get me a gift for my birthday celebration? I (17m) am turning 18 this year, I don't know how it is in other countries, but in Germany here it's a pretty big deal for some people since you're allowed to drink all alcohol and become an adult.

I don't usually celebrate due to my birthday being in the middle of summer break here (27th August), and most of my friends being on vacation by then. That means I don't get the bare minimum ""happy birthday"" texts from most people either, and even when I try to celebrate after summer break, I feel like it always was seen as just another ""hangout"" or something, and they never get me any gifts either. 

I never was mad about this, since I was just happy enough cause they hung out with me at all. But this year is my 18th birthday, I don't want it to be another meaningless day. I plan on celebrating the week after summer break with all of my friends and I've been making it pretty clear that I want gifts, and If they're not gonna get me one they might as well just not show up.

I mean, I've always given my friends gifts, even for Christmas when it was unnecessary just cause I like giving gifts. I don't have all the money in the world of course, but I always tried thinking of a creative gift they would like, and not some gift card or money cause I think that's lazy, unless they ask for it but even then I try to think of a second gift I can give them.
I know I'm not supposed to expect anything back cause that seems greedy, but at some point it really hurts when your friends constantly forget about your birthday and stuff. Like why can't they do the same for me?

I even told my mom this recently, and she was super baffled cause she always thought my friends got me something even when I didn't celebrate my birthday. The most I ever got were some keychains 2 years ago (which I really love, don't get me wrong) and some manga 4 years ago. I don't read manga🧍but it's the thought that counts?

Most of the time they tell me some ""I'm not good at gifts"" excuse like ??? All of my friends know what I like cause I yap about things I like all the time, it can't be that hard. This year I got a pretty big gift box for my friend (19f) and she said ""well if you got me this, then I guess I need to get you something for your birthday too"" so she wouldn't have gotten me anything if I didn't give her something?

Pretty much I'm asking if I'm the asshole, cause I feel bad for ""forcing"" them to buy me something but I don't wanna have another sad birthday this year that doesn't feel special. Like I've never had a classic birthday party where everyone gives me gifts or anything, I wanna experience that too. ",0.27
"AITA for canceling an Amazon order? So I (24F) use to let my younger cousins Henry (21M) and Alice(19F) use my Amazon account. Genuinely did not care cause I used to live with them and got tired of them always telling me to buy the whatever for them. 

Then the oldest cousin started dating a girl named Sarah (19F) who I absolutely do not like. The reason being that last year she basically used me as a getaway driver to steal a couple hundreds of dollars worth of crap from the mall. Ever since that day I never said a word to her cause she’s not my friend and I don’t like that she put me in a situation I wasn’t aware of till it was too late.

But at the end of the day she was dating my cousin so I just stayed quiet and minded my own business. 

That was until I heard that she and Henry broke up about a month ago. Since they broke up then I no longer felt the need to care about the girl. And I knew Henry was always ordering stuff for her using my Amazon account when they were together. Then one day Sarah texted  Alice to use my Amazon account. Alice asked me and I said no. So Alice told Sarah that I didn’t want her to use my account. And instead of the accepting that, she went to go ask Henry. And Henry bought the item she asked for, knowing damn well I do not like the girl and don’t want her using my stuff. So I canceled the order. After I cancelled the order I changed my password to the Amazon which then kicked out everyone who was using it. 

This caused a bigger drama than I expected. My aunt is defending Henry saying “Well if you’re letting him use your Amazon account then he should buy for who ever he wants. Why would you cancel the order?” Like I understand I let him use the account, but I let him use it for him. And the only reason I tolerated him using it for his ex was because they were together. 

So AITA? 

Additional info if it matters : Sarah was just ordering a bed rail for her younger brother. Besides the fact that I don’t like her for using me to steal, their relationship was just toxic. Sarah would cheat on Henry constantly. She would break up with him for a couple months so she can be with other guys but once it was around the holidays she’ll go back to him so she can get gifts. Just recently this girl brought her new boyfriend to a family party knowing damn well my cousin was going to be there. No one in the family likes her because of how she treats my cousin. ",0.03
"AITA for telling my husband I am limiting contact with my SIL & not allowing her around my son unless I am present? My SIL (husband's sister) has been a huge pick me gir since l've met her. After my husband & I got engaged, she made comments to my husband that she felt some type of way that he'd be getting married before her (she's older than he is). I made her a bridesmaid since she's his only sibling, which was a HUGE mistake. She made sure to make my entire wedding process about her. She cried at my bachelorette weekend saying it'd never be her turn, turned down our music while we were trying to have a good time saying the music was too loud, yelled at my younger sister to hold my drink for me at the club (I never needed nor asked for help holding my drink). Every person in my life who has ever interacted with her has said she is very rude, ignores people, or looks at them with RBF.

Fast forward, we now have a 7 month old baby who she consequently is not close to because of the distance l've kept from her due to her behaviors. She kept making remarks to my husband that she felt jealous that my sisters were closer to my baby than she was. Well I finally confronted her about all my issues with her & told her how I felt. She was apologetic & said she wants to have a good relationship with me.

Shortly after this, she has a conversation with my husband, saying her feelings were hurt by what I said. That she felt like I was being ""fake"" in all my interactions with her because she ""never knew"" I felt any negative way toward her. Which I had told her when speaking with her, that I had not been direct with her before because I was still making excuses for her behaviors, trying to have some sort of relationship with her. She then proceeds to lie to my husband, accusing my sisters & friend of urinating in her bag at my bachelorette party. My husband who knows my sisters & friend (who he was friends with first) very well knows they would NEVER do something like that.

Now, I don't feel like I want any sort of relationship with her, much less have my son be around her. If she can't respect me or my family, then I don't want my son around someone like her if I am not present as well. I told my husband I would still allow for her to come around (limited) as long as I am there when she's around my son.

My husband says he feels sad about that because he wants our son to have a relationship with her. As a new mom, it's been extremely important to me to make sure my son is surrounded by honest, kind, & genuine peo' which she is not. AITA?",0.29
"AITA for making my guest at work feel uncomfortable? So, I'm a restaurant manager with over 10 years of experience.  This couple came in, I greeted them, sat them down, and explained the menu. I made eye contact with a smile here and there, but mostly focused on the menu while explaining it to the guy. I even have glasses, so it might have looked like I was looking at her, but I was really just focused on the menu.  He ordered, and I turned to the girl to ask if she wanted anything. 

She immediately looked away and gave me attitude, saying she'd decide later. I didn't know what was up with her, maybe she was having a bad day. I repeated the order and left them alone.

I was the only floor staff that day, so I was constantly checking on tables, making sure everyone was good. The girl was chatting with her boyfriend, so I left them be.  I know the general rule of thumb is to avoid tables that have had a bad experience, but I had no choice!  I also gave her a few glances as she walked by, just to make sure she knew where she was going, like I do with every guest. My GM is using that against me, saying it made her uncomfortable, but that's part of my job!  

Later, she complained to my GM that I was staring at her and made her feel uncomfortable. She even said my chef was staring at her, which is ridiculous because we have an open kitchen! My GM checked the cameras and sided with her, giving me a warning. Not to mention she was giving me attitude throughout the entire course of her meal when I’ve not done anything to her. 

I'm so frustrated! I was just doing my job.  I'm not going to apologize for being attentive to my guests.  I'm not even attracted to her, for what it's worth. Now they’re making me out to be a perverted predator which is miles far from what I actually am. I've been completely vilified for just doing my job, and I'm not sure what else I can do. 

So, good people of Reddit. AITA?

**Edit:** I'm a pretty athletic guy, so I understand some people might find me intimidating. But I'm always professional, and I don't understand why she'd feel so uncomfortable.",0.55
"AITA for not paying attention to a friend's birthday plans I will first I guess post this without background info for the sake of trying to be objective. 

I (28F) have a group of friends, we are all girls in our late 20's to early 30's. We have a large group chat together. At least 5 out of 11 of us have started to have a general dislike towards one person. 

Personally, I think she's someone I'm fine to keep as an outer circle/friend for specific hobbies and situations but I would no longer consider her one of my closest friends for various reasons. 

This friend, I'll call her Alice, her birthday is coming up soon. I thought it was a little strange she had yet to mention anything she wanted to do to celebrate, but figured she would bring something up eventually. 

Yesterday, I saw that she tweeted on a private account that she has for ranting and whatever. (I don't know if she remembers that I follow her there.) Basically she was saying about how she feels like everyone hates her and nobody responded to her subtle hints at birthday outings so she was feeling extra depressed and wondered if she should just go on her own. 

I shared this with some of our mutual friends and they were also confused because while we've been distancing from her, we definitely wouldn't have ignored her trying to make birthday plans. 

I scrolled back through the chat and discovered that she had mentioned an event that would be cool to go to for her birthday but no questions or comments about concrete plans like setting a date or time. [Edit: We didn't ignore this on purpose, she didn't try to actually make a plan so everyone thought it was just a casual suggestion and were waiting for her to initiate a date/time.]

None of us brought it up in the chat but today she messaged directly something among the lines of: Well since nobody responded to my attempts to make birthday plans I'm going to go do A and B and if you want to come you can. 

I decided ok I'll bite and responded that I never knew she had brought anything up for her birthday, to which she clarified the instances. The first one was the one I figured out and I'm pretty sure the second one never actually happened because I can't find any traces of her bringing it up and neither can anyone else. 

I said oh sorry I was waiting for you to ask or clarify about a date and time. Others responded along the same lines and that this coming weekend would be difficult because they're busy and a bit far away, so we need to make plans more ahead of time. [Edit: Dates and time suggestions were made and apologies for not realizing she was trying to subtly initiate plans! We said we were happy to do something but one friend is currently in the process of moving, making it difficult to meet up.]

She didn't really respond to this and later changed the subject, so I replied asking if we were going to make a plan or not. She said she didn't want to mess up whatever everyone had planned already but if someone wanted to come that would be nice. 

Nobody has responded since. [Edit: I am going to say I am down to go hang out, the vibe was kinda rotten earlier so I didn't reply and I felt at a loss?] 

I think this is where we might be the assholes, not doing more to resolve the tension or I guess just being straight up that we don't want to hang out with her that much. 

However, I am a personal believer in not giving into passive aggressive-ness and also everyone this year has very clearly planned their own birthday celebrations and set everything up. 

Final additions and context: 

I wanted to see what people thought about this specific issue but to add context about WHY we've grown much further from this person over the past few years:

Alice has skipped out on one birthday this year because she was hungover and left other birthday festivities early because she made plans after the fact. She also skipped out on an overnight trip because of money but then bought concert tickets that were much more expensive, and when we said we thought she didn't have money, she responded with ""Well I mean I want to spend money on what I will enjoy more."" and amongst a plethora of other grievances has generally never seemed like she puts out friendship ahead of much else, but gets easily upset over things like this. 

When she comes to us with problems, we used to always be supportive or give advice as we would with anyone else, but are always met with arguments. ",0.84
"AITA for asking my bf to choose between me and his friends?  My boyfriend (M 23) and I (F 21) have been together for three years. We got together in Winter of 2021. A few months into the relationship, I found out that he was cheating on me with a girl from his friend group (Let's call her Sally). As soon as I found out about him and Sally, I confronted him and he pleaded with me and begged me to not leave him. So, I didn't. A few months later I found out that he was cheating on me with Sally again. This time I decided to let his whole friend group know about it. I also told his family (they've known me for a long time). Another girl from his group (Let's call her Kelly) let me know that they have known about my bf and Sally for a long time and they lowkey wanted them to be together so they wanted my bf to leave me. Now, I was also friends with these people before I found out about the cheating but after hearing what Kelly said, I felt betrayed. Now, my boyfriend obviously apologised once again and as things slowly started to go back to normal, I asked him to respectfully cut off his friend group. He said that he would do it, and he did cut off majority of those people but he is still friends with Kelly and another girl (Donna) from this group. And whenever I hear that he's been hanging out with Kelly and Donna, I feel extremely betrayed and hurt and it always leads to terrible arguments. He always Apologises but things always go back to square one. 
Now, i don't want to be unfair to him, so I'll let you know his reasoning. He says that it's hard to cut off Kelly and Donna because they go to the same classes and apparently he has to talk to them. Last night, we fought again and I gave him an ultimatum. He said ""Fine I'll cut everyone off, but our relationship will never be the same""

"AITA for Accidentally Dropping my 4 year old cousin? This is a fun one. I (M14) recently visited with my immediate family an aunt/uncle's in which they have a 4 year old cousin who i'm just going to call George because why not. When I arrived the Aunt (Cindy from now on because she feels like a cindy) was carrying George around and letting everyone hold him. When he got to me and I was asked if I wanted to hold George I said no as I don't know how much a chubby 4 year old weighs nor do I care to find out, and I didn't see a reason to hold the kid I could talk to in Cindy's arms or George can walk.

  
Cindy insists and says it'll be fine and I should hold him because it'll be fun. I again say it's fine and to go onto my grandpa who was next. She extends her arms and as she drops George into my hands despite my instruction,  my instinct is to pull away and George falls on to the floor below. He's fine but whines like crazy for 10 minutes as you'd imagine a 4 year old would in this scenario, She picks him up and yells at me before I scream at her about how she shouldn't have dropped him and walk off. My mother is now upset at me, not for ""dropping"" him but for ""making a scene and screaming at Cindy"". The rest of my family hasn't brought it up, and the Uncle agrees with me (he cool like that though)

"AITAH for being uncomfortable with my bf’s girl best friend I have been with my bf for over a year now and he means a lot to me and I believe that he should be friends with whomever he pleases but for some reason his girl best friend, I’ll call her Ash, makes me very uncomfortable. I have tried putting my feelings aside to let him have fun and I have even thought it was my overthinking that caused me to think this way but I’m just not sure anymore. Me and my bf are long distance so it creates a barrier in our communication. He has known Ash for around 4 years and I got with my bf after knowing him for about 3 weeks. As you can tell, he has known Ash longer than me which is why I hate to invade on their relationship. My bf and I have only had arguments about Ash for the past few months since I was introduced to her halfway through our relationship. I tried to be her friend at the beginning but she just shrugged me off and never made an attempt. And the thing is she is dating my bfs male best friend. There were little things at the very beginning of me knowing about her that made me take a break from my bf because it felt that he was choosing her over me sometimes but we worked it out. I have communicated how I am uncomfortable with certain things such as them wrestling in the pool and him saying I love you. He stopped touching her and I was happy about it but continued to say I love you. I acted like it didn’t bother me but it did. But yesterday my bf was texting Ash about how she was “defending her shitty bf” (what my bf said). And as he showing me his screen on FaceTime he stops and said “oh sorry my phone was gunna die”. I said ok and didn’t think much of it. At this time I was perfectly ok with them hanging and texting. We fixed our last problem so there was no need to be upset. But then today my bf tells me that he stopped screen sharing because he said he loved her. I would have aloud him to say I love you to her but it’s the fact that he hid that from me and lied. He did tell me yesterday that she said I love you and I didn’t care about that. I was just hurt that after so many arguments over their relationship that he would tell me the truth. I asked him why he did what he did and he said he didn’t want to hurt me. I told him it hurt me more by lying to me. He told me he would stop being friends with her if I wanted it to be that way but it’s not what he wanted. I don’t want to control his life but I also don’t want to be uncomfortable. He seemed unhappy about how I felt and I just don’t know what to do anymore. I have talked to her in person and she is nice to me but she will only ever talk to me if it’s about my bf and if she’s forced too. I just need to know if I’m in the wrong here. ",0.13
"AITA for ""breaking girl code"" I (13f) am going on a ski camp with my school. Me and my friends have been planning this day to go out and buy food for ski camp for ages. We made a google document and we were adding photos to each others names. She started to add a ""stalker photo"" on it and i asked her to repeatedly stop. She wouldn't so I started adding pics of her ex next to her name (it was a stupid move). She asked me to stop, so I did. Then she started ignoring me.

The next day i asked her what i did. I had broken ""girl code"". I apologised to her and she told me she needed space.

The same person is making plans for that day on the discord chat we are all added to. I see that the plans don't include me and i mention that. Later on in the school day, on the chat she says to me ""You aren't invited, "". I ask why. She says,""We already made the plans, you will just slow us down. Mind you we had these plans for ages. Apparently I am not invited because se organised it and all. I repeatedly ask her why i was uninvited and she stick with her reason of me ""slowing them down"". Then she finally tells me the real reason. The real reason was because she didn't want to there as things would be awkward and she organised it so she can choose who goes.

Later that day the entire group goes and stuff.

Then I cried on the way home because I really wanted to go. I saved money, I starved myself and stuff.

"AITA for threatening My mom I will dump her ashes in the dumpster after she dies Basically, back in high school, I was bullied by a girl. When I complained this to my mom, instead of taking my side, she joined the bullying by gaslighting me, which aggravated the situation caused me in very serious depression for a long time. Years after when I finally found out what happened, I hold a grudge towards my mom. 

Recently, she was suddenly lovebombing me. But it made me feel uncomfortable cause I know she is a capricious person and it looked so fake to me. To confirm, I questioned her that bully thing in high school, in a resentful and provoking tone, which may make me look like a brat or an ungrateful bitch, and asked for an apology. But she was headstrong, saw this as a personal attack towards her, and can never apologize. Then to defense herself, she threw a lot of attacks at me, like vile, vicious, ungrateful, can't fit in, which she loved to say that to me when I was on high school. So I was triggered by it, and told her, if you ever dare say I can't fit in to me, I will throw your ashes into dumpster after you die. Now I calm down and thinking, that's poor communication, I can solve this in a better way, but I was in such a rage and frustration. Am I an asshole for saying that to my mom.

"AITA for “kicking my bf out” and making him wait a week to come back?  My (29F) bf (30M) have been together for a little over a year. We moved in together after about 4 months. My biggest issue with him is after any little conflict or argument he says so “we’re done”. Or so “we’re breaking up”. Or suggest breaking up. Or say “maybe we should just break up”. Or says he’ll just move out. He’s done this about 5 or so times. He explained to me it’s just his defense mechanism. He wants me to say no baby I want us to work it out. I want you stay. Pls stay I love you. Things like that. 

But I expressed that just makes me feel less secure in our relationship. Every time something happens he’s ready to leave or break up. It’s never huge issues either. So I never understood why his reaction is to run. But he says he’s working on it. And will communicate instead of just saying we should break up and things like that And I told him the last time he said it. If it happens again I’m just going to say okay and that’s what it’s going to be. I tried setting that boundary. Bcus I’m starting to feel maybe that’s what he deep down really wants. 

On Monday. We got into an argument about his trust issues with me. I never cheated or gave him any reason to not trust me. He just has trust issues. He made a huge assumption that I could easily prove him wrong about. He did ended up apologizing. And then said maybe it’s best if he moves out and has his own bcus he’s putting his own trust issues on me. 

So I said okay. That’s fine. I’ll help you get your stuff. Then he makes it seem like I’m kicking him out. I reminded him that the last time I said I’ll just say okay and let him do it. 

He leaves stays w/ a friend. And he has been apologizing and begging to come back. However, I told him I just need my space. Give me till Friday. Then he can come back and we’ll talk again. 

Today is Thursday and he’s fed up. Feels like I’m being an asshole and feels he waited long enough. Doesn’t want to stay at his friends house. I said okay well can you get a hotel room for one more day. I’ve been working. Haven’t had real time to think about things. Just am not ready. Now he’s looking at me like I’m wrong.

"AITA for turning off the AC every day? I am a minor, still living with my parents and brother. (TW) I've been struggling with an ED for about two years and last month I was around 95lbs. It was hell in the winter, my school has constant ventilation from outside for fresh air so I'd have to layer to be in the building. I talked to my mom (56F) about this, and she seemed to care at least a little. Never anything past ""oh that sucks"" though. Now it's summer, and the highest it's been so far is 88F. She had central air installed last year and hasn't been able to use it till now. It hasn't been much of an issue since she's been getting home late, so I'll just turn it off in the morning. I've tried lowering it and talking to her already. She has the temperature at 60F in here, I don't know how low that is to most but I'll only start getting hot around 75, so 15 under is a lot. She's around 180-200lbs, and the highest I can get to right now is 110. Both my boyfriend and I have tried bringing this up, she's a bigger person and she can handle colder temperatures. He told her that it was realistically on the highest setting, taking 20 degrees out of the air. She laughed and tried to change the subject. I've been trying to lower it during the day, so she could raise it when she got home and I'd already be asleep. She isn't working right now though, and might not be going back. She just raises it every time I lower it, so I've been turning it off. The basic on/off switch is next to my room, but the remote to lower and raise it is downstairs where she stays.

"AITA for refusing to share my recipe w gf's family, and tearing into them abt neglecting her? To clarify, my girlfriend is trans, which is why I could almost carry a child. She's only in contact with her uncle Rob, his wife Jen, their son, and her grandma. I got along with them until they kidnapped my girlfriend while I was in hospital. They live on the outskirts of a city, with no public transport access unless they drive her to the city centre. It was their son's birthday and I convinced my girlfriend to go, I felt bad she was stuck in the hospital w me. From the hospital it was only a 1 hour bus trip, and she said she'd only be there for a couple hours. I had suffered from a miscarriage, i was kept overnight for monitoring. They wouldn't drive her to the bus stop, forcing her to stay overnight. They knew why i was in the hospital, but ""family comes first."" so, i know where i stand.

Afterwards, we decided to limit contact and only respond if they reached out. We recently moved into a new house, and they asked to visit. We declined, but they're very persistent. Since everyone in the family went to culinary school, I cooked something simple—my nan’s steak with bourbon garlic cream sauce. Rob liked it and asked for the recipe, but I didn't really want to share my family heirloom recipe, so i playfully said, ""It's mostly love."" Rob started yelling at me, and accused me of fearing he'd show me up since he went to culinary school, and my girlfriend wouldn't rely on me anymore. I asked who else she could rely on, he did not like that, and got louder.

I reminded him they could have taken her out of an abusive home anytime but chose not to, because they didn't want to go near her mother. they chose spite over protecting their own nieces and nephews. I said she was forced to rely on me, because they weren't there. She was removed from her home, and put in with a foster family, separated from her siblings and then when the foster family moved, she had to live with my parents. i was 16. she had to move in with her 16 year old girlfriend. Rob called me a ""nobody-bimbo"" who'd never be part of their family. I argued that I was as much family as his wife, especially since I almost carried their niece's child. Jen, who apparently didn't know, started yelling at Rob, grandma defended him, saying we’re too young to say who's family. In anger, I retorted, ""Oh, now you want to speak up, miss three-times-divorced?""

She apologised about the hospital, saying she absolutely would have drover her back if she new that's why i was there.

"WIBTA if I said I wasn’t comfortable about a group fancy dress idea? I (19F) am part of a friendly camping group with my family and a few other families. Every year we attend a small local camper van event with a themed costume party. Usually we are voted best dressed as we are a large group who are able to put a lot of time into our costumes. It is also a very jokey event and isn’t super serious. The overall theme this year is Kings and Queens. Last time I saw the group the ideas ranged from Knights of the Round table to Monty Python and the Holy Grail. But without consulting my family, some of the others decided on the theme of drag, which I found out this morning from my mum. 

I am the only person (who I know of) who is queer in the group but I am not trans nor do I do drag, and most of the group (my friends and the event) consists of Gen X people, with one of the dads (I’ll call him Mark) having a bit of a habit of saying things that have made me uncomfortable in the past (lowkey homophobic, transphobic and racist jokes). I would suspect that the entire thing is his idea as he is best friends with the mother from the family (I’ll call her Tina) who organises the costumes, and she tends to be a bit of a pushover as she hates upsetting people. One of the kids (18M) has performed in Kinky Boots in drag but is not queer and I haven’t had the chance to talk to him about it, which is the only experience that anyone in the group has with drag that I know of.

I worry that they will take the theme too far, start doing offensive stuff and portray really harmful stereotypes. My gut reaction was that the idea could become offensive really quickly with some of the people involved. The whole dress up event is supposed to be super comedic and I think that this particular theme isn’t suitable as it portrays real experiences in a current community which in an already difficult time for LGBTQ+ people like myself. But at the same time, I’m barely an adult and not super close to anyone in the group like some of the others are. I could cause fallouts or argument within the group which could result in my family getting kicked out if Mark gets in a really nasty mood about it. Tina had good intentions but has had trouble standing up to Mark in the past which has resulted in a family leaving the group before. 

I raised my concerns with my mum (55F) and sister (16F). My sister brushed me aside and said that there was nothing wrong with it and I could just not participate. My mum said that she could suggest other themes to the group like playing cards or something. I was also told that my Dad hasn’t been told about the theme and I know that he would be very uncomfortable with dressing up in a drag.

Would I be TA if I raised the issue further with the rest of the group, which could potentially cause a rift in the group and get my family kicked out? (No real names are used in this post)",0.02

Bear in mind it was like 1PM and I still hadn’t eaten anything, it was basically my breakfast.

Look I feel fat but my bmi is well within the healthy weight range but all her comments are just making me feel really bad about myself.

"AITA for telling my MIL she can leave my house if she doesn't stop policing how I talk about my stepson? I'm (31f) married to Jake (33m) who has a son Devon (10m) with an ex Christy (34f). Jake and Christy broke up when Devon was a baby. They have shared custody 50/50 since. Christy remarried when Devon was 2. Jake and I met when Devon was 2.

I love Devon. Our relationship is good. But I am not his mom. He is not my son. When Jake and I got engaged he referred to Devon as our kid. MIL got so annoyed and said I am not his mom and never will be so Devon is therefore not my kid. I told her that was true, I'm just a bonus in his life and he's going to be my stepson (at that point he wasn't yet my stepson). She told me I should make sure I don't forget my place in his life. Jake told MIL that she had no right to talk to me that way and it wasn't even me who claimed Devon was my kid, it was him claiming he was ours.

Another time after Jake and I were married I called Devon my stepson. MIL only heard the son part and told me yet again Devon has a mom and I'm not her. I told her I said stepson. She was like oh, good, make sure you remember that.

Devon and I had some trouble for a while. Christy was encouraging him not to be nice to me like he was to his stepdad. So Devon had a period where he was disrespectful and said we're not stepmom/stepson. We did therapy, it helped. We went back to stepmom and stepson. He did make it clear he didn't want me to call him my son. I respect that. I told him I'd always respect those boundaries for him but please let me know if anything does change, so I can make any needed changes and keep us strong.

MIL randomly asked sometime after this if I was back to claiming Devon as mine. Jake told her to stop. He told her she knew I wasn't doing that and she needed to let it go. We spent some time away from her, she apologized, mostly because FIL wasn't interfering like that and saw his grandson and son still.

Jake and I have a son together now. Now MIL has flipped a switch because Jake and I have our own son together. She has decided I'm a monster for calling Devon my stepson still and she's now policing me staying stepson instead of son. It's not like it comes up that often but it comes up often enough for her to be bothered by it. If I say I'm here to pick up my stepson instead of son, or say this is my stepson Devon. Jake told her to knock it off and she remembers what happened before with her policing me like this.

MIL dropped by the house to see the baby while my husband was at work. She brought it up to me again. She said now that Devon has a brother we need to stop the step crap and I should be calling both boys my sons. I told her to drop the topic. I did not want this to be a fight again. She ignored me and told me I need to do better. I told her she needs to leave my house if she can't stop policing how I speak, that I would not allow it. She hadn't expected me to follow through. She also didn't expect Jake to be on my side. She said I was rude and refuse to discuss it like an adult.

"AITA for telling my (f22) boyfriend(m22) to not vent to his female friends about me? Hi all. I (f22) am wondering if AITA for telling my bf (m22) to not talk to his female friends about our problems. They’ve been friends since childhood but I am just uncomfortable with him venting to another woman about our problems. Especially since I haven’t met her yet. 

Also he’s told me that when she feels sad over things, they talk which I am completely okay with, but there are times where they’ve went out for drinks one on one together and I know for a fact I am not comfortable with that. I suggested that if he does drinking with her I’d rather him at least invite 1 guy friend because I fear the alcohol along with the vulnerability they may be intimate with each other. I don’t know her and I don’t know if I want to meet her right now because my social anxiety has been getting bad for reasons I don’t want to disclose. ",0.69
"AITA for educating my gf's nephew?  My (22F) gf's (22F) nephew (8M) came over earlier. He has always been a trouble maker, but defending himself with 'I'm just joking'. He in particular likes stealing things. 

I was wearing shorts with pockets, and at one point I felt my shorts go light, like my phone had disappeared from my pocket. I was waiting for a very important call so I looked for it frantically. He scared me by creeping up from behind and going 'oh look I've got your phone! Bet you didn't even notice! It's unlocked, ooh let's see what's on here!' before proceeding to start looking through my private messages. This has happened to me at least 3 times now but he'd never looked through my personal things before. 

I do not like having my privacy invaded or my things being taken from me without permission, so I took the phone back and told him off, educating him on why taking people's things without their permission isn't okay. He started crying and whining saying it was just a joke. 

Looks like his parents found out because I got an angry call from my gf's sister's boyfriend yelling at me and calling me an a-hole and a b word for upsetting his son and not being able to take a joke. My gf agrees with me but her sister and her boyfriend don't.

"WIBTA if I refuse to wear a saree that my in laws have chosen for me to wear on my wedding reception?  Sorry in advance everyone, English is not my first language but I am a content writer so you guys should be able to understand everything.

Now, I am (25f) an Indian, and we have a ritual here. The wedding reception is held one day after wedding and in-laws give their DILs the saree they are supposed to wear for that particular function. I was well aware of that and I have seen this happening since my childhood. Now a little background for you all. My wedding is in 10 days and the date was finalised back in February. I do a job and I have invested my weekoffs shopping and planning most of the wedding. 

I bought my wedding saree in March and that same day I liked another beautiful Benarasi Saree that I bought for wearing at the reception. Now, I discussed the thing with my fiance and asked him if his parents will be okay if I buy the saree and he told me I should go ahead and buy it and his parents would be more than happy to reimburse me because they are supposed to buy that for me anyway. He gave me the money I spent for that saree and I gave the blouse piece to my tailor so she could make a beautiful blouse for me. It was all sorted by May.

Fast forward to today, my future FIL sent me a courier which contained the blouse piece of ANOTHER BENARASI SAREE and I was shocked to discover that they were not aware that I already purchased the saree that I am gonna wear for reception. I bought my finance’s suit everything in a contrasting colour and bought my jewelleries accordingly. But NOW 10 days before I got to know my finance never told my future MIL or FIL that I already bought it in MARCH! 

So, I don’t want to disappoint them by not wearing the saree they have chosen for me. (I haven’t seen it yet, but I am sure it would be nice). But at the same time, I really had a vision with the Saree I originally chose to wear for this function and I am very upset right now that it will not be fulfilled. 

WIBTAH if I wear the one I originally planned to wear for this function instead of the one my future in laws bought for me?


Update: Just got off a call with my fiancé and he said it would be very “complicated” to talk to his parents now. I better wear the saree my future ILs bought for me and to make it up to me, he will purchase a new set of suit that will go appropriately with the saree. He will also go shopping with me again and bring the saree with him so I can find an appropriate blouse to go with it. P.S I have not seen the saree yet, he said he will send a picture tomorrow. 
Also, I am heartbroken and in tears as I write this because I believe all these could have been resolved with some better communication. 


Update 2: Today my fiancé denied that he ever had anything to do with it and told me “who asked you to go ahead and buy it?” And also told me I should wear the saree his parents have chosen for me (I still haven’t seen it). So, there you all go people I am marrying an asshole I guess. Lot of money has been invested and cannot call it off now, but I am very happy for the support you all gave me. Best of luck to me, will come back with another update after the reception. ",0.22
"AITA For telling my gay friend to be less gay? I'll be honest I do sound like quite an asshole here but let me explain, I, a 20 (M) Have a gay friend,21(M) I'll call him Jason. Jason is like, a really cool dude, no problem hanging out with him and he sets boundaries. But for some reason recently when we're scrolling on twitter, he asked ""What do mantits feel like?"". Genuinely jaw dropped. Knew he was gay but DANG that made me do a double take. I asked him what he meant and he turned to ask me again to repeat his question. I'll be honest I had no idea how to reply but it got me flustered anyways? I dont know why though.

I'll be honest, I've had a huge crush on Jason for years, and I haven't been very clear about it. It's almost like he's perfect for me but I'm not gay, I dont think so at least. I dont wanna be in denial but I cant hold on for much longer, I'm so close to just kissing him on the lips and calling it a day.

So, one day I walked up to him and straight up just asked ""Do you like anyone?"", sure it was weird as shit but if he liked someone, why be so 'gay"" around me yknow? I dont even know if I'm using that term correctly anymore. He often goes to movies with me, restaurants and dates, like we're an actual couple. I asked him to cool it, to distance myself and I felt really bad seeing him frown. 

  
We haven't talked in just about 1 week and 2 days, what should i do about it now though? I think I just need advice but no one's telling me shit. I'll be honest I was really harsh when I told him to be less gay, I yelled at him a little when he started getting angry asking if I was homophobic and such but I couldn't help it, I let my love dive under and my feelings escape. I was angry because I knew I was wrong. What do i do now?

AITA for confronting my husband after she had a 6 person orgy? I (27f) caught my (34m) pastor husband having a 6 person orgy after a service and don’t know what to do about it. My husband is a pastor at our church and is a very kind and attractive man and has even been hit on by some of the ladies that frequent our church. He has been staying after his sermons lately to “help with small groups” so I thought nothing of it. I was volunteering with the youth groups so I was at the church but I don’t drive so I had to wait for my husband to go home. The youth group was canceled yesterday so I went to see if they would like help at the youth groups but didn’t expect to walk in on my husband with 3 women on him and another 2 “doing their own thing”. I hadn’t walked and just looked through the window so they didn’t see me but I’m not sure what to do. Me and my husband have been kinda distant recently but he had been asking me what is wrong but I’m not sure what to tell him. This morning I asked him if he had been interested in any other women and he got super defensive and told me that if I had been thinking that then I might need to go see someone for mental help.

"AITA for refusing to go to a funeral? I'm 25 now and between the ages of 17-23 I lost both of my parents, 3 out of 4 of my siblings, 1 aunt and 2 uncles. All of these were unrelated but because of this I hate going to funerals. I will attend if it is close family member or friend but would rather not attend otherwise.

My girlfriends best friend recently lost her mum and my girlfriend has been trying to support her. The funeral is next week and my girlfriend said she was going to go to support her friend. 

She asked if I would attend with her but I apologised and said I would rather not. She knows why I don't like funerals so I remined her but she still asked again. She said it would mean a lot and that she doesn't want to go on her own.

I refused again and suggested she take another friend but she said she wanted me there. I said it's awful what has happened to her friend but I can't go to the funeral. 

She said I was being unsupportive and it'll only be an hour or two out of the day but I just repeated again that I'm not going and she knows why.

She just said again that I was unsupportive and that I should be there with her.

We need to make some changes to the parenting plan and I am trying to be incredibly reasonable about the things that I’m asking for and also the way we go about asking the courts for the change, I have provided him with the changes. I’m proposing about a month ago. I have since been asking him to send me the things that he would like to change I’ve gotten radio silence or “soon” anytime I’ve asked. We are coming down to the wire and I am not going to wait forever. He proposed a meet up in about five days. Wife with him and his wife not planning on bringing anyone because I’m not married. He is refusing to send me his changes and wants to exchange them at the meeting. I told him I need some time to process what he’s asking for so that I know what I’m willing to bend on and what I’m not willing to bend on and also not the emotional when I’m asking for what I’m not willing to change. Am I the asshole for saying that I won’t meet unless I have time to read over his changes? For the sake of clarity this new attitude of his has come about since the addition of his wife who may be a very lovely woman I have no opinion of her because I don’t know her at all, the changes that I’m asking for are more about him spending more time with his daughter than anything else I’m really hoping that we don’t need to involve lawyers or anything like that because it’s not necessary if we can all just adult.

"AITA for not wrapping birthday presents? I am terrible at wrapping gifts and much prefer just putting presents in gift bags instead of wrapping them and my girlfriend knows this. She is the opposite and enjoys wrapping gifts, It was my gfs birthday last week and I got her the presents she asked for along with a few surprises.

I bought a nice gift bags with some tissue paper instead of wrapping them and put the presents in the bags. I gave them to my gf and she seemed annoyed

I asked what was wrong and she said I have clearly put no effort into this since the presents weren't wrapped. I mentioned that it was the gift that mattered more that the wrapping and I had gotten her everything she had asked for along with a few other surprises that she wasn't expecting.

She just repeated that I had put no effort into bothering to wrap the presents. I just told her she was being ungrateful. She said I was being out of order for calling her ungrateful but I just pointed out that's exactly how she was acting.

"AITA for not allowing my younger brother to play a game he wanted? So, a few weeks ago my (23nb) brother (18m) asked access to my Steam account to play a game which I had bought years earlier. I denied it. Why? Because I don't like to share any account of mine. But the real reason was that on my Steam account there are a few NSFW and LGBTQ+ games which I didn't want him to know about. (By the way, he does know that I am LGBTQ+ but have always been iffy or outright ignorant about it.)

He started making a fuss about it and as a compromise I said that I will buy the game for him for his Steam account. He still went upto our mother and made a strong claim regarding why he should be allowed access to my account. Even my mother agreed with him. And obviously I couldn't tell them the real reason so I tried making my point but it wasn't good enough for either of them. Finally I just turned both of their wishes down with a stern no.

However they both got angry with me and said that I should learn how to share. A few other people have called me out to be assholish as well. In the end everyone got angry, including me.

"AITAH for keeping a secret? I (27f) work with one of my very good friends Julie (25f) at a small business of about 6 employees who all manage their own clients. Julie and I have known each other for over 10 years. My boss is also a very dear friend of ours and have been working together for the past 6 years. 

Julie found out she was pregnant and told me 3 months in that she didn’t want anybody to know. I of course supported her in any way possible, as well as advising her that she should share the news with our boss, as it would affect the company with her missing work once the baby comes 6/7 months later. 

Fast forward, she is 5 months pregnant and I am to the point of begging her to share her news with our boss, as it is getting closer to her due date and it will be much harder to find & train somebody to fill her position for the months she will be gone. And as previously stated above, our boss is a dear friend who would be thrilled with the news. Julie was nervous to say anything because she felt our boss would fire her out of inconvenience. I’ve expressed time and time again this will not be the outcome (especially since it’s illegal) and that our boss would be happy for her. 

This is where I feel like a rock in a hard place. Julie is now 7 months pregnant and is having her baby shower. As my last plea, I reached out to Julie two days before the shower to confirm that she told our boss the news, as our boss would inevitably find pictures of the shower on social media. I then find out, Julie has texted our boss that she is pregnant and will no longer be returning to work. Of course, our boss is totally shocked but responds with the upmost support & apologies that Julie felt she couldn’t share her news with her. 

I shared with my boss that I knew about Julie for a while and didn’t say anything and now she is extremely hurt that I didn’t tell her. My stance— I strive to be a great reliable friend. If I had told our boss Julie’s secret, it would show that I am not a trustworthy person or friend. Also the fact of it’s just not my news or business to share. Our boss does not blame me & understands why I didn’t say anything but is still hurt because she felt we were closer than that.

"WIBTA for playing a instrumental version of 'Cookie' by newjeans for a kids recital? I started taking piano classes around \~3 years ago with a company that does recitals for kids under 18.

"AITA: cause I don't let my partner buy anything without discussing it with me? I (21f) and partner (22M) have been arguing a lot about money. We have a 1 1/2yo daughter as well. I recently came across a great deal for a home and land. This would mean that we would have our own place and can move out of my parents house. My partner before meeting me would always blow all his money had no savings and would have to borrow money from other people. We currently pay around $1,000 monthly for all of our bills, but we have no appliances no insurance on our home which will be ootp for $1,000 for a year. he uses $800 for gas a  month. His job is 2 hours away. I'm still paying $1,200 off on my credit card which is an additional $300-400 a month. We pay for a sprayer to come for $69. We buy a  month worth of lunch for him at work which is $250. Plus we have 3 kittens and a bearded dragon to feed which is a monthly $150. He goes through at least 7 OTC inhalers a month at $30 each. We have to buy food and tp, paper towels, dish soap for the month and snacks for the baby. Adds up to another $300-400 a month. This leaves us with around $500 for savings a month if he doesn't buy drinks at work, and extra bottle of liquor when he goes to the ABC store, binge his work lunch foods at home on the weekends. Leave brand new bags of house snacks out to get stale and coffee creamer overnight on the counter. Which he does. So realistically, $250 additional a month.   I work 2 jobs and I am thinking about a third one for extra income. He keeps telling me I don't need to, but I feel financially insecure. He then buys things impulsively just because we have it and he uses my debit card when he know that the money in there sitting is for bills not for extra spending. So when I see an unexpected charge I question him and remind him before he purchases anything to let me know and talk to me to make sure we have the money. Then he lashes out at me saying he should be able to make purchases for anything he wants without going through me. I would love to buy myself something, but I just cannot justify anything for myself other than having a safety amount in savings.

"AITA For reporting my friends small business? My friend (Jason) recently bought a backyard pizza oven and decided to start making pizza to sell to his community neighborhood. In the past 6 months he has purchased an LLC and become and official business. I have a similar small business where I sell baked goods and pastries, its part time gig and i do it a few days a week out of a commerce kitchen I rent and then also do farmers markets on the weekends during summer and fall. I have my LLC, as well as a ready to eat food license, and have products sampled and tested through the Deptartment of Agriculture and signed off by the Cottage Food Laws organization... which is what is needed to sell ready to eat food to consumers in my state.

Now I will admit this post came from jealousy when I found out Jason only had his LLC. He has no food related licensing and has been selling roughly $500 of pizzas a week out of his garage to his neighborhood. I came to support him one day and the conversation went to me complaining about how all the licensing to operate a small food business runs me around $4000/yr.... and I was a bit taken about when Jason said he just never filled out any applications for that and ""doesnt need too because he is just a small operation right now"". I sat on it for a couple days, but it doesnt sit right with me that the rest of the small business owners in food are spending thousands on these licenses so we can be legally run, and Jason is bringing in a profit like its a childs lemonade stand. I ended up calling the local food authority for them to audit him on a weekend he was selling, and now he is no longer allowed to set up shop outside his home because he didnt have a home license either to make food in his house.

"AITA for deciding I do not want my cousin being my MOH anymore? My fiancé and I are getting married in April. Without a second thought, I made my cousin(we will call her Sam) my MOH. We have always been super close growing up, as we’re only a couple years apart. Typically, your MOH pays/plans the bridal shower and bach party- and these events take place close to your wedding. Due to the fact that my fiancé and I are paying for our wedding(we do not have help) I knew I wanted to spread these events out a little bit so it’s easier for me to afford. I never set any expectation for her to pay for anything, as she is a college student. I gave her a brief timeline- bridal shower in the fall, bach party in the winter, and our wedding is in early spring. She asked me if I wanted her to plan these events and I said yes absolutely, but I wouldn’t mind taking an active role and helping. Over the course of several months, she did not make any effort to plan anything. I would ask her how it’s going/send her ideas and I would get a short response along the lines of “that’s cute”. As time was passing, I wanted to get everything planned so it was one less thing to stress + I wanted to give my bridesmaids enough time to plan/save up money if need be. So once again, I sent her a super good idea for a bach trip I thought of, and Sam didn’t look into it or take action… so I begin planning it myself. Up to this point, we didn’t have an issue, the issue came when I sent the details for the bachelorette trip in the group chat with all of my bridesmaids. I let them know that we would be doing a weekend ski trip only an hour away from us so it was very cost-effective for everyone. I asked them if a date in January would work for everyone and let them know that it would be UNDER $300/person. She then texted in that group chat and said “sorry $300!?”. This was a little embarrassing for me, considering she’s my maid of honor, and I was super excited and pleased with the trip. I was confused so I texted her separately and asked her why she would say this as it’s very affordable for a bach trip + I gave them SIX MONTHS notice to save up. This then escalated into a big fight where I explained that it’s upsetting how she couldn’t prioritize her time for me and now she can’t prioritize her finances either to make me feel special for such a big milestone in my life. She claims that she won’t have time to work with school/v-ball and $300 is a lot of money. Not to mention, all of my other bridesmaids are broke college students as well and never complained about the price once. No matter what financial background you have, it’s not hard to save $200(the final price after everyone RSVP) in six months. She also goes out with her friends and spends money on other things frequently- so she could very easily pay. I have chose to go no contact with her since as I feel, I deserve an apology for not only her neglecting her MOH duties, but also the way she spoke so little of me and question my character during our argument.",0.92
"AITA for liking an insta post This is super nitpicky and I (f19) am genuinely unsure of how to assess the situation.

For context: 
There is an art account on instagram (maybe on TikTok too, I am not entirely sure) that takes videos of people that act really cringey or obnoxious and they parodize them by drawing really extreme charicatures of them while pausing the videos. One of the videos was about a girl sitting down in the middle of an airport filming herself whith the caption ""PoV: I am everyone's airport crush"" (something among the lines). 
The girl is really cute, it's just an obnoxious thing to post and I find it a bit embarrassing.

Anyways my sister (23) walks in 2 minutes ago asking, quote:  ""You are like a person that hates making fun of people's appearances, right? Like, you always correct people when they do that?""
To which I agreed, because when someone does that in real life, I shit on them making negative or assumptious remarks about other's appearances instead of just keeping it to themselves. I genuinely dislike that sort of thing.

Then she goes on telling me she saw that I liked the ig post and thinks it's hypocritical of me to find it funny/like it.
I go on to explain that I find merely the charicature drawing funny and that it satirizes the girl's behavior, I didn't think anything about her appearance at all. The girl is quite cute and I don't care about how she chooses to present herself.
I never commented on the post either, I just liked it.
Now she is judging me for ""not letting her just do what she wants"", even tho I never said she couldn't make the video or write the caption, i just found it funny, I didn't think too much about any of it in the first place.
I feel like something was overstepped by her and I really dislike her immediately scrutinizing my insta activity and then making assumptions about my intentions. My sister accused me out of the blue and I don't even know where that was coming from. It's however nagging at me and I don't want to turn my back on my values in that way.

"AITAH for ignoring my roommate's request to stop cooking strong smelling food in our apartment? I (F19) have recently moved in with two new roommates (F20 and M19) and everything was alright for the first month. Today my roommate has texted me, saying that they both are bothered by the smell of food I make and they want me to stop making anything strong smelling from now. They mentioned being sensitive to smells. I said I could make foods with stronger smells less often, 2-3 times a week, but they want it out completely. I think it isn't fair to me that I can't cook what I like at all, but also I wonder if one of them being sensitive to smells changes something. I thought my idea was a fair compromise but apparently not. So, AITA for ignoring my roommate's request to stop cooking foods that have strong smells?",0.27
"AITA for continually asking my boyfriend to not be on his phone? My (43f) boyfriend (40m) and I haven't been together for an extremely long time and have very different upbringings. He does have ADHD and spends a LOT of time on his phone. I've asked him if we're watching something if he could not be on his phone the whole time since he keeps asking me what he missed and we have to rewind or I have to explain to him. He gets mad at me for asking him to not be on it all the time or asking if he saw something since he always has his phone in his face. I've given up on this battle.

When we're with my family, people will be sitting around talking and he's on his phone. I've explained that this is rude and he should be interacting especially since he's so eager to make a good impression and integrate with my family. He's usually watching videos or playing puzzles. Occasionally it will be work, however, not as often as it is him just fooling around. He's told me that it's based on how his life is and who he is and I shouldn't try to change him. He's also brought up that my nephew (19m) is on his phone a lot. I've tried to explain that he's a teenager vs a 40 year old man. There have been times he's just handed me his phone so I can put it away so he's not drawn to it, however, me asking him to not have it all the time is a sore subject. 

He's an amazing partner otherwise and I'm very happy with him. I know it's a self-soothing thing and something he uses because of his ADHD (I've bought him a bunch of fidget toys to help him with that), but, I think there should be time without the phone.

"AITA for joining a sobriety program to prove a point after my boyfriend and his mum judged me for drinking? So, here’s the deal. My boyfriend (31M) and I (26F) have been together for a while, and everything was going fine until recently when he came home and dropped a bombshell on me. He told me that he and his mum had a chat about me, and they both decided they don’t like how much I’ve been drinking lately. For context, I barely drink, and when I do, it’s usually with him, and his mum doesn’t drink at all so she’s already one of those people. Also to note my boyfriend drinks, takes and sells class A drugs that his parents don’t know about. I work 5 days a week including weekends so when I do drink it’s on a Monday or Tuesday. But apparently, this has become an issue for his ultra-strict Nigerian parents, who have a habit of overstepping boundaries (they even open his mail and parcels at 31 years old!).

Now, here’s where it gets messy. Instead of coming to me directly with his concerns, my boyfriend told me they had this whole discussion without me and basically agreed that I should cut down on drinking (because I bought wine over to his parents house on a Monday night after I asked him if it was ok to which he agreed yes). I felt like my ability to make my own decisions was completely disrespected, and it seriously hurt that he didn’t even try to protect my dignity, defend me in my absence or talk to me first about how he felt, I’m more embarrassed his family now think I’m a drunk.

I was so pissed off that I decided to join a sobriety program just to prove a point, I will no longer be going out with my boyfriend and I’m planning on cancelling our trip to Ibiza coming up in 2 months —I don’t even have a drinking problem! But now, my boyfriend thinks I’m being petty and overreacting. He said I “took it the wrong way” and that I should just stop drinking around his parents instead of making this a bigger deal. But to me, this isn’t just about drinking; it’s about how he handled the situation and how he made me feel. His mum is talking bad about my character and he’s agreeing with her? When I think he should’ve protected my character in public and then came to me in private and suggested I didn’t drink in front of his parents anymore. If you think drinking a bottle of wine throughout the day once a week(if that) is considered an addiction then I’d rather just not drink at all. 

So, AITA for joining a sobriety program to make a point after my boyfriend and his mum judged me for drinking, or is he the one who crossed the line by not having my back and making decisions without me?",0.15
"AITA for giving mom in law specific instructions to care for our 3 month old?  We were out on a family trip - me, my husband,  my in laws and three kids ages 6,3, and 3 months. 

One night we decided to split up for dinner (my in laws would go first and then my husband and I would go later). They offered to watch the kids in the hotel room including the 3 month old baby, while my husband and I would go out to dinner.  

We had a two bedroom suite, and the baby was sleeping in one of the rooms in her crib so I told her to watch over her in that room. My mother in law wanted to take the baby in her stroller and take her to the other room where my two kids and father in law were so that she doesn’t have to sit with her in this other room. I said no, because the two kids will wake her up from her nap and spoil her sleep. Both are boys and are super loud so of course she couldn’t be bothered that room. And she cannot also leave her alone sleeping in a totally different room since we were in a hotel and did not have a baby monitor so it’s not too safe. 

At this point my husband got really pissed at  me for telling her to watch over the baby for the entire two hours, and yelled at me over dinner and basically spoilt my entire night over this. His stance was that I should not have told my mother in law to be with the baby the whole time. I should have instead let her put the baby in the stroller with the other two kids OR let her be unmonitored for a while. He didn’t care that it would disturb the baby, he didn’t care that she would possibly not be monitored for a while. All he cared about were that I told his mom to watch over the baby and he felt I was totally wrong for doing so and that it was unfair to his mom. 

Some prior context as well - my mother in law has a history of not prioritizing the baby on various occasions when she baby sits, and letting her cry while she finishes her cleaning or talking on the phone. Because of this I felt like I needed  to instruct her explicitly to monitor the baby and not be distracted by other stuff 

I even told my husband that maybe we shouldn’t go for dinner if I wasn’t comfortable leaving her and my father in law with the kids but then he said I have trust issues. 

 TLDR - AITA for telling his mom explicitly how to care for the three month old? ",0.88
"AITA for no long wanting my friend to be my Maid of Honor(MOH) My fiancé and I are getting married in April. Without a second thought, I made my cousin(we will call her Sam) my MOH. We have always been super close growing up, as we’re only a couple years apart. Typically, your MOH pays/plans the bridal shower and bach party- and these events take place close to your wedding. Due to the fact that my fiancé and I are paying for our wedding all by ourselves, I knew I wanted to spread these events out a little bit so it’s easier for me to afford. I never set any expectation for her to pay for anything, as she is a college student. I gave her a brief timeline- bridal shower in the fall, bach party in the winter, and our wedding is in early spring. She asked me if I wanted her to plan these events and I said yes absolutely, but I wouldn’t mind taking an active role and helping.(she plan, I pay) Over the course of several months, she did not make any effort to plan anything. I would ask her how it’s going/send her ideas and I would get a short response along the lines of “that’s cute”. As time was passing, I wanted to get everything planned so it was one less thing to stress + I wanted to give my bridesmaids enough time to plan/save up money if need be. My other bridesmaids starting asking where we were going/doing, I sent her a super good idea for a bach trip I thought of, and Sam didn’t look into, so I begin planning it myself. Up to this point, we didn’t have an issue, sure I was a little upset she didn’t seem to rlly care but the issue came when I sent the details for the bachelorette trip in the group chat with all of my bridesmaids. I let them know that we would be doing a small weekend ski trip only an hour away from us so it would cost-effective for everyone. I asked them if a date in January would work for everyone and let them know that it would be $200/person. She then texted in that group chat and said “sorry $200!?”. This was a little embarrassing, considering she’s my maid of honor, and I was super excited and pleased with the trip. I was confused so I texted her separately and asked her why she would say this as it’s very affordable for a bach trip + I gave SIX MONTHS notice to save up. This then escalated into a big fight where I explained that it’s upsetting how she couldn’t prioritize her time and now she can’t prioritize putting a little money aside each month either to make me feel special for such a big milestone in my life. She claims that she won’t have time to work with school/v-ball and $200 is a lot of money. All of my other bridesmaids are in college students and never complained about the price once + we’re super excited to go and celebrate. I don’t want to sound insensitive so a little backstory… she doesn’t necessarily “struggle”. She goes out with friends & spends money frequently, and in addition never works when she has the time/opportunity too. I work 3 jobs but feel as if I was her MOH I would work extra to give her the best wedding ever + still make the time to help out planning.",0.72
"AITA for yelling at my gf (20f) for trying to tell someone on the road that their trunk is open For context, my Gf (20f) and I (21m) were driving on the way to get some food for dinner. Guy in front of us has his trunk open. There wasn’t anything blocking the trunk from closing it was just open wobbling up and down. My girlfriend then proceeded to honk my horn and stick her hand out the window to try and get the attention of the driver infront of us to inform them of their open trunk. At this point I had moved her arm back inside the car closed the window and child locked it and told her to stop doing that because it was immature and getting on my nerves that she was so worried about a strangers trunk being open when he most likely knew it was open. For context. They are driving a Toyota Corolla. Same car as we were driving and if a door or trunk is open it says it on the dashboard. So long story short I yelled at her that it’s better to mind your own business in this day and not try to communicate with strangers we don’t know because for all we know they can be crazy and get the wrong idea.

"AITA for setting “boundaries” with my in laws My fiancé (23) and I (24) have been together for over a year now. In the very beginning of our relationship I found out my 22 year old boyfriend at the time still had communication with his ex girlfriend of 4 years. She was texting his phone, sending him payments for car insurance, and still was getting her mail delivered at his address. I was very uncomfortable when I found this out considering I was in his kitchen making cookies from scratch while looking up a recipe on his phone. It would've been a different situation had he told me before hand or just finding a way to mention it. That incident cause me to lose a lot of respect for him and caused me to have trust issues with him but we've since then moved past it. He no longer has any ties with her and we've grown together. Well unfortunately his dad brings her up 24/7 and I've asked her not to be mentioned as it's not important to him and I and it's rather disrespectful since l am his fiancé now. His mother has brought her up and compared me to her. Mean while I'm trying to build a bond and relationship with his parents because I know how important family can be. Well the last and final straw was about two weeks ago. I had two painful procedures on Tuesday and Friday so I took off the week so I could heal and get back on my feet. Well I found out his brother was moving back home from Vegas after only being there a month. So being the nice fiancé I am I offered to host for dinner. Everything was going good as to be expected since his brother rarely ever mentions her. Well sure enough as l'm reaching for a bite of this delicious basil infused cream tomato pasta his brother says "" Hey Clark do you remember at dad's apartment when you were f*#king your ex and you guys were so loud I could hear the moans and the bed move "" I was so shocked I kinda just froze up and gave out a weird laugh and all my fiancé said was stop, stop. After that incident I told Clark I was done associating myself with his family and that it was beyond disrespectful and I'm tired of his ex being brought up at all since l'm his current partner and we've been together over a year and are currently trying for a child. I’ve said my peace to his family which caused an even bigger issue that his mom and dad decided to blow up completely so no I had to go no contact.",0.34
"AITA for calling out my SIL disrespectful behavior AITA, 

My husband and I have been together for nearly a decade and he's extremely close to his family. Pretty much holds them at a higher level than me, his wife. His sister has always been a problem and no one cares to put her in her place. She's in her 30's and extremely immature due to the company she keeps. 

When we got married a few years ago, I chose to include her as a bridesmaid because I wanted to have a bond with her and what a s\* show that was. The entire time we were getting ready, she was in/out the room with her THEN boyfriend making jokes and just goofying off. When it was time to take pictures, she opted out because her ""corset was too tight and she was going to pass out\*. My other bridesmaid and I were more than willing to shoo her away because we we're over it. 

Fast forward, a few years, my husband and I are expecting a baby. When we announced it, my SIL snatched the ultrasound photo, took a picture of it and sent it to her NOW boyfriend saying ""LOL i have a surprise"" I was LIVID because, A. you're too grown to act like this B. stop making it about you and C. my husband didn't say anything to her, just chuckled and kept on with the day.

It's time for my maternity pictures and I asked her to please not post anything on her socials (she does part time photography and snapped our photos) She agreed and my husband reiterated that to her. I then come to find out she posted them on Pinterest. Without letting us know anything. Again, my husband doesn't say anything to her. 

I give birth and again tell everyone on both sides of the family to please not post my child on socials as I like to keep my family private. She goes behind my back and makes a ""close friends"" tab on Instagram and has been posting pictures there. I only found out because a family member of his sent me a screenshot innocently. I tell my husband and all he had to say was ""well you're blowing this out of proportion"" 

Finally, when his family came over our home after I gave birth, his sister proceeds to tell me, ""if you were put together, I would've taken pictures of you"" Um, I just had a baby and being ""put together"" was the last thing on my mind while I'm recovering.  After a lot of back/forth, I decided to call her out on her behavior and now his family is ignoring me and looking at me like I'm at fault. Again I ask, AITA?",0.11
"AITA for Financially Controlling my Wife I Dale (32M) am married to my wife Cindy (26F). We have a son Brandon (1M). 

I work and my wife works as SAHM. It's difficult financially supporting my family by myself, but there haven't been any alarming issues yet, it's just tight. 

I spend next to 0 money on myself. I have a budget for my wife for fun. She usually follows it, sometimes not.


Now, my wife has several friends who are great. Her ""best"" friend  Nancy (25F) is someone I despise. 

She's behind in life. Moves from job to job every couple months, lives with parents (nothing inherently wrong with this, but not using this as a tool to get ahead. She's just a mooch.) The real issue is her taste in men. I'm talking like men who think it's funny to point loaded guns as a ""joke."" For a couple years she has shuffled back and forth between the same 3 shitheads.

Worst part is she makes everything about herself and always gets my wife into her drama. For instance, I planned an intricate proposal. She got the date wrong and got pissed when I didnt cancel the whole thing. I'll say it, I fucking hate her.


So, she's found a new guy Steve (29M). He's another shithead. Even worse they've known each other for 3 weeks and are: planning on moving into together, ALREADY got matching tattoos of each other's initials, and... getting married...in vegas


Nancy wants  my wife to come to the wedding. Never mind the fact this premise is insane, but tickets alone are $500. This will be at least a grand all in. WORSE yet, they planned it for the 27th of December. No way in hell I can get work off. We'd have to get my mom to watch our son then and she'd have to travel over the worst weekend to travel. She's also missing valuable time with her son at his first REAL Xmas (when he's a person and not a blob of baby)

Here's where I was maybe an asshole. I didnt even entertain a discussion. I just fucking said no. I said it was insane, no shot.

Wife is now pissed saying I'm financially controlling her. I'm saying just deciding to spend a grand on a farce is insane.

"AITA for un-intentionally giving my wife body dysmorphia  I (29m) have been married to my wife (27f) for 3 years and had our first child 5 months ago and everything has been great until last weekend. So, once a month my wife and I travel down to my parents house for dinner with the family and its always been great, my family love my wife and they get along well. Most of all however, my younger sister (14f) really looks up to my wife as a role model, often commenting on how pretty and beautiful she is and how she wants to look like her when she's older. Now, my sister is a bit overweight and always has been since she was young but nothing too out of the ordinary. Although, as most teenage girls are, my sister is very self conscious about her body image.

Anyway, this dinner was different, we were preparing for the upcoming christening of our child. Everything had been planned bar the clothing arrangements for the event and so my wife was helping my sister look at dresses. As most 14yo girls would be, my sister was very excited for the opportunity to get all dressed up. Naturally, my mom and my wife were measuring my sister, everything was going smoothly until my wife makes a comment: ""Wow we are the same size and I've just had a baby!"". Now my wife is very petite but has maintained a lot of the baby weight so is still of a decent size. So, obviously hearing this, my sister burst into tears and ran out the room my mom gave my wife a look of disgust and chased after my sister.

At the time I was in the living room with my dad, only when I heard the crying did I go upstairs. I made my way to my sisters room to see what happened and my mom explained everything to me. Furious, I stormed into the room where my wife was and confronted her, only to be met with shock at the lack of remorse my wife was showing. She gave her detail of the story (almost identical to what my mom told me) and could not understand what she had done wrong. I explained to her my sisters poor body image and why she was out of line. My wife however, still could not see her wrongdoing. At this point I was ready to explode with anger. I told my wife that, whilst she still looks great, comparing my 14yo sisters size to her post-pregnancy body is unfair and demeaning. To my surprise, I was met with a look of confusion. ""What do you mean post-pregnancy body?"" My wife questioned. I explained to my wife that she still looked beautiful and it was perfectly normal,  she did carry some of the weight from her pregnancy.

My wife too burst into tears, shouting, ""How can you call me fat when I carried your child for 9 months!?"" she followed this by immediately storming out of the house and getting in the car home. Having explained what happened to my mom she appreciated me trying to defend my sister but slated me for ""body-shaming"" my wife.

In the last couple of days, my wife has been crying, sleeping in a separate room to me, and deleting recent posts. All her friends have taken her side demanding I apologise for what I said.

Should I have apologised?

I got everyone I know she wants to be there. But then there is our boss wife, who she has know for a year before I started working at our firm. His wife is very much so the epitome of two faced. One minute she is very kind and cool to talk to. The next if she has an attitude with you, she will go out of her way to bother you. And if you react she will run to him(the boss), and you obviously can't cross him. Since they are married, neither likes to hold the other accountable. And that has been the function of the business.

"AITA Because I had to get a ride to a job? Okay so I never really posted like this on Reddit so excuse me if I have poor formatting

For about 2 months now I've been trying to find a sustainable job that pays somewhat normally, and I just keep having no luck even though I have a vocational degree in Culinary, Pro-Start and Baking.

My Dad has been telling me to dedicate myself further but I literally spend a majority of days looking through job boards, reaching out on Facebook to old friends, and trying interviews just to get a bite.

So a few days ago I told my Dad I had an interview Tuesday at 3 and one Friday at 1 at different spots, he wanted to take my car to work because my sister was celebrating her 21st birthday by getting wasted at her boyfriend's house and said she'd take me there.

Anyway so then it's Tuesday and I'm starting to get anxious because my sister still wasn't home yet, but thankfully she got here at 12:30ish but then she asked me why I wasn't ready yet, and I told her that my interview was at 3, not 1; She tried arguing with me about how my Dad said otherwise and I said he probably just got details wrong.

So then she storms out of the house and leaves again until it's 2, then we leave and I assume that it would be smooth sailing from then on, it wasn't.

She then pulled up to the wrong restaurant, the one I'd be having an interview Friday on, I tried to tell her that she was mistaken again but then that resulted in a another yelling match, but at that point she was low on oil and her car was a smart car and wouldn't let her drive off again.

She then got teary eyed and shouted at me, screaming at me to walk home as she just beat up her steering wheel. I then walked to the hospital where my Dad worked and had to drive back to get her and take her home after she called a tow truck, but then both her and my Dad was pissed at me, my Dad later apologized and said he was just aggravated at some girl at work and took it out on me, but I still just felt fucking awful.

Long story short she cheated on him, he finally left and as soon as he did their 3 kids gained a new stepfather right away, their youngest is removed by CPS and his family does all they can to get her back. I even pitched in helping watch her while his grandma went to work since she was the one that had custody. His family spoils their 3 kids. Flash forward my bio daughter is making false allegations against my husband and yet I stayed because well I love him and we now have 1 kid at this point. My son gets removed by CPS and his family does nothing to help get my son out. Now we have 2 kids and another on the way and his family completely ignores them, he can't even be around the kids so I'm literally raising the kids by myself with no help from his family or mine. Finally I say something, the grandma ends up calling them every now and then and everything's fine for like a week. Then my husband tells me his grandma called and was so excited because she just gave his ex-wife money for them to do summer stuff and get new clothes because the kids wanted new clothes. I literally couldn't keep my mouth shut anymore and I'm now cutting off contact with all of them and considering divorce because my husband also has no respect for me and can't even speak up to them on my behalf.

"AITA for criticizing the photo my boyfriend posted of me?  Since today is national girlfriend day, my bf (26M) posted a collage of pictures of me (25F). he told me to go look at the post and see it. now i have bad self esteem issues, always have since i was very young, especially regarding my facial features. 2 out of the 6 pictures he posted i looked super bad in. bad lighting, skin looked bad, my nose looked huge, my bug eyes buldging, terrible pictures in general. unfortunately the first words i said were ""oh my god those pictures are terrible"". i did quickly after say i loved the gesture and the song he posted along with it but he is now super upset saying i hurt his feelings because i don't like the pictures of ME that he posted. and only 2 of them. he deleted the post, says he's not going to do anything like that for me again, and is calling me selfish and saying i ruined the day. i tried to explain to him i loved the post and i appreciated what he did. i also said if the tables were turned, i would ask what pictures he didn't like, and repost it without those 2. he's saying that anyone we know would agree that i'm being selfish and entitled for this, but i think this is just being blown out of proportion. am i the asshole? i feel really bad for not understanding if this truly is a bigger deal than i feel.

"AITA for asking my ex partner not to have his new partner around our daughter so much? I (21F) and my partner (21M) broke up earlier this year. We have a 3 year old daughter together. He and his new partner have been seeing each other for about 4 months. It has come to my attention recently that my daughter is around his new partner at least once or twice a week . I would like to add that he has our daughter 3 days a week. When I found this out it made me really uncomfortable as 1)I've never met the girl and 2) I don't think it's very good for our daughter to be around her dads brand new relationship that much especially considering she is probably still coming to terms with the fact that mom and dad are not getting back together and c) it feels like he is prioritizing his new relationship over his daughter. Let me expand a little on that last part. There were two weeks where he only saw our daughter 1 day a week due to work. I asked him how many of those two days did he and our daughter spend with his girlfriend and his response was ""I don't remember"". The week after those two weeks when he was back with her his usual three days, the first day he slept in until 3 o'clock leaving our daughter with our usual babysitter until he got up, and then when he got up he took our daughter straight to his girlfriends house. The second day he also took our daughter to see his girlfriend. The third day is when I had the discussion with him about me not feeling comfortable with our daughter being around her that much. When I talked to him about it I mentioned that I think he needs to be spending more quality time with our daughter, also that she's probably still struggling with the fact that mom and dad aren't together as it's only been a few months and seeing him spending all this time with a new girl may not be good for her, and thirdly that they haven't been together very long and it would be very bad for her if they broke up. He was immediately defensive saying ""what do you think we're doing just making out in front of her"" and ""we've decided we're going to last"". We got into an argument about it. I told him I think our daughter seeing her once bi weekly would make me feel more comfortable and that every other week I can take her on one of his days so he can spend some time with his girlfriend. He told me he will see what he can do about it but if he goes to see her and he has our daughter then that's just how it will be.

It wasn’t nearly as bad when we visited previously there were candles lit etc. I also said I was worried that it will stick to my clothes.

"AITA for “making fun” of my cousin’s weight? So I (20M) have been in university now for 2 years. I’m a fairly nerdy person and didn’t have many friends in high school, partially because my cousin, “Amy” (21F) was genuinely horrible the people I called friends. She wouldn’t be mean to me necessarily, but that was mostly because I was a man, and confident enough in my looks that she couldn’t beat me down about it. She however,  was pretty overweight in middle school, and was a pretty sore subject for a while , even though she lost most of it before her freshman year of high school.

Anyway, she graduated and is now a CNA,  3 years into college for Nursing. I went to a college halfway across the country, on a scholarship for cybersecurity. It’s true that while my grades are good, I’m not in a relationship and most certainly not looking. Amy however, is engaged to her high school sweetheart and they just moved in together. 

Our annual family reunion was last weekend, and she was there with her fiancé, absolutely ecstatic to show off the ring to everyone who would listen. I however, was off to the side on my phone. I don’t have a great relationship with that side of the family, I just wanted to keep my head down.

One of my uncles spoke up and asked how school was going. Amy piped up and said, “He’s fine with his computer games as always, you don’t have to pretend to care.”

Here’s where I may be the butthole. I said, “School is fine. I’m making good friends too, especially because you aren’t shitting all over them because you were embarrassed about your weight.”

She stormed off in a huff, and my family is upset that I said that about her, and it was a low blow to comment on how she looked after she said something harmless.

"AITA for telling my BIL and SIL to Fuck off, and should i apologise?  Bare with me, I’m not good at putting my thoughts into words so this may not make much sense or possibly be all over the place. 😂 welcome to my brain. 

I live on a farm with my partner and kids. We have 2 dogs, pure breed boarder collie (Zeus 1 year old ) and pure breed maremma (Apollo roughly 13 weeks old), 9 chickens and 2 lousy guinea fowls 😅.  Last Sunday, (28th July) my BIL and SIL came out with their kids and dog. Always enjoy them being out here, cousins playing etc, etc, but we always have an issue because their dog chases my poultry, every time it happens I’m having to catch the chickens and lock them up so they don’t get eaten. 
So obviously without fail their dog begins chasing the chickens. Which all they do is yell the dogs name which does nothing, So I finally snapped, I got up and grabbed their dog put its leash on it and told them to fuck off and no more dogs are allowed here. Which had their response of ‘she didn’t chase the chickens, blah blah blah’, like I wasn’t sitting there next to them and witness the thing chase them. So they packed up their kids and dog and my other BIL dog as well and left. 
BIL sent my partner a message saying they will not be back out here until I apologise for being an asshole. I don’t think I’m an asshole at all, partner also doesn’t think I’m an asshole. 

My oldest daughter is 7 in 2 weeks, and obviously I’d love for her cousins to attend, but they’ll only start talking to us again if I apologise. Should I?

"AITAH for asking my mom why her friend gave them expensive stuffs but only gave me a cheap scarf gotten from a local market  A week ago, my mom and I traveled to Paris and her friend offered we stay at her place. Two days ago my sister came and when she was leaving she gave my sister two expensive perfume and skin care products, also $200 which is equivalent to 320k in my country and then she gave my mom 3 expensive perfumes and skin care products but she gave me just a scarf she she said she got from a market in India. I know I should be grateful and I sound so ungrateful right now but I can’t help but be upset. I’ve tried to look  at the bright side like Atleast I got something but I can’t help but wonder why she just gave me the scarf and nothing else. Maybe I’m the AH for getting upset but I can’t help it. Did I annoy her or something or did she think I wouldn’t want any of what he gave my mom and sister. I’m just curious. 

When I asked my mom why her friend did this, she got upset saying I wasn’t being appreciative, Atleast she let you stay in her house and all that but she also stayed in the same house, as well as my sister but they got way more stuffs than I did. I saw the argument wasn’t going to end well so, I ended it quickly. Whether or not I’m at fault here, it’s fine. I just want to know why. 

Update: Thankyou everyone for the comments and telling me where I Was wrong or your opinions, it was much appreciated 🥰🙂. I came here to hear the truth which I already knew but I needed to hear it from other people so I would stop thinking the way I did so Thankyou for making me realize my mistakes 

Another update: Since I can't really reply to every single comment right now. I hope everyone who commented sees this, for those saying it was my behavior, let me makes things straight. My sister actually spent more time in her room than I did actually, though I'm way more quiet and shy than she is, I tried to mingle more than she did,I was in the room most of the time but so was she. just when she did she talked more than I did, as for the helping I never knew it was offensive to help people's workers, I mean I grew help hearing my parents say even if they work for you or they do something for you it's still good to help back, so I'm surprised now that someone is saying that not the case. My mom was even complaining I wasn't even helping enough. I don't even think its actually about my behavior because my whole life this is how I've been treated even within my family where everyone says She doesn't care about such things right so no need to bother. I think the first time I even told my mom how differently they treated me in such situations she said it's probably because you come off as someone who isn't bothered about this kinds of things, so no one will think to give you this things. She said when your siblings don't get something they complain so next time we know to give them but you never complain at all so we just assume it means you Dont want it then. So if it's about bad behavior that I know I don't have. And me not talking is also not it. Because believe me all the friends I've ever made in my life I made them from me not talking not me talking in fact I've made way less friends now that I actually talk than when I never used to talk to people. I'm not defending myself, I'm just further explaining things. And my sister actually mingled more with my mom and I actually mingled more with them, my sister would only be there if my mom was also there with them, I would stick around whether or not my mom was there with them or not. If I heard them talking about something that didn't concern me, I would move a way. But everyone who knows me knows I Dont talk much but it doesn't mean I don't want to be there or hang out or I'm trying to be rude. I've my mom's friend knows me a bit more than she knows my sister because we have spoken on the phone a few times, and she even said the first time, you Dont seem to talk much and then said jokingly but that's good these days talking too much can put you in trouble, I also don't talk much. while my sister has never spoken to her.",0.92

"AITA for Cancelling an After work Get together? I am a bit annoyed at my staff lately.

I frequently treat my staff every weekend as a gift to show my appreciation for all their hard work and as a way for them to bond by spending time together after work and would usually prepay at the restaurant ahead/event/purchase tickets to whatever they would be going to.

For some reason this time, they requested if they can just get CASH equivalent of whatever restaurant I would be treating them to for the weekend.

I was caught offguard.  
  
I felt a ~~bit~~ bad as it made me feel that they do not appreciate me wanting to pay for their get togethers. Aside from that I do not even think there would be many other companies would offer weekly get togethers for the staff for free.

Because I felt bad. I told them that it is meant as a gift and if they dont want to have a get together might as well cancel and still I will not give away cash.

I was then told by one of my staff whom I am close with that they feel bad because I am not willing to give them cash instead. AITA?",0.99

And after he said that I said “truthfully no one feels bad for you, you have a baby coming and you need to help around the house.” Everyone at the table was in shock that I said something but I have just had it.

"AITA for refusing to visit my dad with cancer because I don’t want to see my stepmother? I (21, trans M) lived with my father and my stepmother basically since I was a little kid. My bio mom is mostly out of the picture due to me being removed from her care due to abuse, but I’ve been with my father and stepmother since I was fairly little so she basically raised me.

My stepmother gave me the basic needs a parent does, like housing and clothes and food, and she wasn’t always bad. But she started becoming more abusive when I hit middle school and it’s only gotten worse since. I feel like elaborating in the post itself would muddy the post and make it too long but I’m willing to elaborate in the comments or wherever. Not all of it was physical but it was still abuse. My father tended to do nothing and usually just told me to let it go to avoid conflict.

When I was 19, my stepmother kicked me out over a petty argument and I ended up moving to my friends mom’s house and I’ve been living with her family for about the last 2 ish years. I made up with them briefly but then after having yet another petty argument, I made the choice to cut contact with my stepmother completely. She was blocked for a while, but I unblocked her because I saw her irl sometime after and she said if I had her blocked I’d get no updates on my dads health.

My father was diagnosed with aggressive bladder cancer sometime before I moved away. It’s been hard on him, and scary for everyone, especially for him. 

He keeps insisting on me making up with my mother and visiting. Since I am no contact with her I have refused and offered alternatives like meeting at a coffee shop, coming but bringing a friend, or agreeing to come alone if my stepmother steps out of the house for a few hours. He says he can’t meet me anywhere because he can’t travel well with his condition, and that he doesn’t want me to bring a friend because having all the medical equipment out is too embarrassing. He hasn’t given me any particular reason to refuse having my stepmother step out other than that she’s done a lot for us (my father was in prison before meeting her and had a hard time finding a job, so we would have been homeless and such without her) and that it’s ridiculous that I can’t show enough respect to just be civil in a room with her for a few hours. 

I told him as much as I want to see him I’m not willing to sacrifice my mental and physical health by interacting with my stepmother, and I feel that I’ve offered all the alternatives I can. He says I’m giving him demands in order for him to see me, and that he just wants support from his family since he’s having a bad time dealing with his illness. He’s upset I’ve made no effort to come help make his day better when he’s been having a terrible couple of years.

I feel like I’m fair for not wanting to interact with my stepmother. At the same time I’m not sure if I should just bite the bullet and visit since I’m not sure how bad the cancer will get, and I care a lot about my father. I’m worried I’m focusing too much on my own comfort and being selfish. AITA?

"AITA for telling my friend (F18) that she needs to give her ex-boyfriend closure? My friend (F18) (We’ll call her Lexi) said I (M18) overstepped boundaries and crossed so many lines when I asked her to break up with her boyfriend. Lexi was in a happy relationship for about a month before her parents forbid her from ever seeing the dude again. She never officially broke up with him, however. She ghosted him and he had no idea what was going on. That same guy, who is also one of my close friends, called me one day begging me to talk to Lexi to ask if she was ok/what was going on. He honestly sounded like he was a danger to himself, and I was scared. So, I told Lexi during one of our usual hangouts that she should probably talk to her boyfriend because he is desperate for closure. I told her that she was probably the only one who could calm him down. She later confronted him, officially broke up with him, and everything was fine. But I didn’t hear fron Lexi for a month after the official breakup. I text her asking what was up and why haven’t I heard from her. She unloads and tells me that she was pissed about how I “forced” her to confront her ex and that I was blaming her for her ex’s crazy, dangerous behavior. I told Lexi that I felt stuck in the middle of their breakup. Her ex was texting me and calling me asking about her, and he had nobody to talk to. Lexi said I should have gotten myself out of the middle of this situation, but I couldn’t just not pick up her ex’s calls and texts. He’s my friend too. I fully believed I was helping her ex by suggesting that Lexi contact him, so he gets the closure he needs and deserves. And that’s what it was to me, a suggestion, some friendly advice that she could take or leave. However, Lexi still feels like I forced her to do something and that I overstepped my place for even discussing their relationship. AITA?

"AITA for Refusing to Leave a Restaurant?  I (35F) and my husband (33M) went to a Mexican restaurant in we hadn’t tried in our city. It’s important to mention my husband is Mexican and I am white, and he has higher standards for Mexican food than I do. 

We ordered our meals and it was clear that the wait staff was new, and the restaurant was pretty Americanized but otherwise no issues placing an order and getting drinks. 

Then the food took a long time (over 30 minutes)  and he started to get mad. We tried the chips and salsa to tie us over but the salsa tasted sour. We let the waitress know it had gone bad, but she brought us another from the same batch so we left it. Once our food arrived, mine was decent but his was cold, so he sent it back. Then when it came out and it was still room temperature and he gets up and demands we leave. Starts freaking out/pacing and doesn’t want to stay. I offer some of mine and he refuses to eat it. 

He ended up sitting down and they reheated the food, but was pissed at me not supporting his decision to leave saying it was an insult to give these people our money. 

AITA for not supporting my husband here? In my life, I have never left a restaurant. You just don’t go back if it’s bad in my opinion and we already communicated our concerns to the wait staff and they took the feedback and fixed it. The food was edible, and I think I just find the idea of walking out overly dramatic. 

Edit: 

Thanks for the feedback! Understood I’m TA! I already apologized to him after. Should have asked for his meal to be comped at least. 

Couple notes for questions in the comments: 
1. The salsa was bottled salsa that came to the table as a side. Likely just stored incorrectly. Probably why I was less reactive since it wasn’t necessarily obvious to servers or kitchen it was sour. 

2. Didn’t consider asking for a manager. Kitchen was very small and the only server said it was her 3rd day. Maybe there was someone in the back but didn’t ask. 

3. Totally am a people pleaser! Someone could push me and I would probably apologize for being in the way and assume the best. My husband is hot blooded so we usually balance each other out but I think under reacted trying to calm him down.

"AITA for apparently cutting someone off in a parking lot?  Hello. I was coming back to work from a lunch break as my coworker called me and told me the store suddenly became very busy, so I was rushing a bit. I pull into the parking lot of our building behind some kind of work truck, and the work truck does a two-point reverse park into a parking space and comes to a brief stop. I figured they were parking, so I drove in front of them to get to a space next to theirs. As I get out of my car, the person is waiting outside of their truck and shouts, ""that was some asshole shit!"" at me. I thought I might have misheard them so I ask them to repeat what they said, and they did.

I'm extremely confused. I ask them what I did to upset them, and they explain that I cut them off as they were trying to use our parking lot to turn around on the adjacent two-way street. I explain to them that I thought they were just parking and that I was in a rush to get back to work, to which they say they don't care and insist I was in the wrong. At this point I get impatient and rather frustrated with this person so I tell them rather curtly (although not impolitely) that I do not have time to argue with them.

"AITA for laughing at my brother’s girlfriend’s psychoanalysis of me?  I [17m] am really into collecting colognes. I have 30+ full sized bottles as well as 50+ smaller sample sized decants (1-3 ml decants). Some of this admittedly is Christmas/birthday presents from friends and family, but I also buy with my own money, trade bottles I do have for bottles I want, and have a cologne review tiktok page that's popular enough for some companies to send me free bottles, so I don't want to give the impression of being daddy's money.

Anyways, my brother brought his girlfriend over, and I was giving her a tour of the house. We went to my room, she asked why I had so many cologne bottles, and I essentially said I always enjoy smelling new scents and am never satisfied that I've found *the best* scent when there's ones out there that I haven't smelt. 

She asked if I was a fuckboy, I said I don't think so, and asked why. She said based off of how I always felt the need to try out new colognes and could never settle with what I had being enough for me, I probably do the same with women. 

This made me laugh, and I asked if she had taken her first psych class or something. She got offended and asked me why I was laughing, and I admitted that I just frankly thought that was a really stupid analogy to make and inanimate objects and living humans aren't the same.

My DH have been having marital issues with his parents as they have ALWAYS BEEN in our business since day 1. I can imagine that’s why they feel entitled to give their opinion on things , but have gotten worse now that our child is here . We pay rent and have talked to them about boundaries and how they do not need to be in our business . Mind you I have been no contact with them for a while until we had a conversation months ago about it and according to my husband his mom was “going to change and I should give her the benefit of the doubt because she apologized for all the past things she’s done”.

My mother was born and raised in Korea, while I grew up in Canada. We never really had major cultural differences, but one thing in Asia is parents are usually more involved in commenting about what their children eat or how they dress. Everyone does it, my grandmother, aunt, etc, and my mother is actually way more laid back than others I've seen.

That being said, she's always worried about my health. I went through a period of intense stress when I was younger, losing weight (I was 157 cm/5'2 and 39 kg/86 lbs at the time. It wasn't an eating disorder; I wasn't living at home, so I would just not eat when I was stressed). After leaving that environment, I gained the weight back (5 kg/11 lbs).

However, my mother would still criticize my diet frequently. The thing is, I think I've eat cleaner than most now. I drink water exclusively for years after she talked about how sugary juice was. I reduced my snacking to once every week after she recommended I stop eating junk food. I don't drink. I admit that after the fiftieth time of her telling me to be healthier, it got on my nerves a bit.

Then, here's where I might've become the asshole. I was cooking broth with pork (well, not cooking, it was pre-made) for both of us, and she asked if we should add green onion. I said yes, and she put green onion as well as garlic. I told her the sauce already contains garlic, so we didn't need it. She said everyone did this so the broth doesn't smell. I told her we should follow the instructions of the package and only add condiment and when she didn't say anything, I fished the garlic out. After a moment, she said I should eat healthier and I just snapped. I said loudly that I did everything she wanted me to do, I ate rice mixed with vegetables (her most recommended diet) for three nights in a row before today. She replied that other people eat healthily  *everyday* and I said I did have something healthy today because I ate Greek yogurt with berries and almonds for breakfast (something else she insisted on). She didn't say anything for a moment before an, ""Alright, you win."" I kept going though, saying I can never win because if I eat unhealthy, she tells me to be healthier, if I eat healthy, she tells me to be healthier. 

Nothing happened after this, we ate together, and walked the dog together like we always do, laughing and talking. But I just want to know if I was the asshole or if it was a cultural difference where I don't like being commented so much on my diet while she doesn't mind. I obviously don't want to talk about family issues to friends, so I came here. AITA?",0.1
"AITA for asking my boyfriend if I could contact my ex for professional advice? I (28F) recently received an invitation for a job interview for a company I applied to. I am very excited because I would really like to get the job. While trying to find resources to prepare myself, I remembered that my ex (30M) from 14 years ago (we were together for 6 months in 2010), has been working at the company for a while. So I thought to text him on LinkedIn to ask for advice and guidance.
I proposed the idea to my current partner (26M) and he immediately refused. After his message I immediately replied that, if it made him feel uncomfortable, I would have not contacted him. He did not reply to my text and I think he is now upset/hurt.
AITA by proposing that?",0.2
"AITA for disagreeing with my mom and stepdad and talking back to them during an argument? My mom and stepdad got married 3 years ago. I'm not sure how long they were together before that but I know him and my stepsister like 3.5 years. Mom has me (16f) and my younger sister (11f). Stepdad has my stepsister (11f). I admit I never had the most positive feelings about my mom getting married to someone else. I always saw them as people she chose but not people I was choosing and I figured I could accept them being in our lives but knew from the start I didn't want him to be my new dad or his daughter to be my new sister. I can be friendly, not mean. But the dynamic isn't the same and I never wanted to work on that on my part. I love my sister and even when we fight I will always be there for her. That's not the same with my stepsister.

Back in April my sister was stressing about one of her friends and we were talking a lot. I was there for her and tried to help her out with that. I didn't know, and honestly never checked, that my stepsister was dealing with a bully. One day my stepdad was called to the school after an incident with the bully. There was a second meeting after the bullying was exposed and that's when my stepdad and mom told my sister and me. My stepdad said she was embarrassed about it and we wouldn't make a big deal out of it with others. But they still expected me to be there, offer advice, a shoulder to lean on/cry on and stuff. I didn't. My stepsister brought it up once and I was like that sucks, hope it stops kinda thing.

My stepdad asked his daughter if she'd leaned on me and spoken to me and she said no and that I had never approached her. He told mom. Mom asked me if I reached out for my stepsister like I would my sister. I said no. She told me I should. I said I hadn't wanted to. Mom was really surprised and asked me why not and I told her it's different doing it for my sister because I love her and want to be her support.

Since that talk, which was in May, there's a lot more talking going on about it. We argue sometimes. They have talked about how I have a duty as the oldest sister in the house. How when we became a family we agreed to be there for each other. They said this again three days ago and I disagreed and said I never agreed to anything and they did all the agreeing, that I went along with it because adults/kids but it should have been pretty clear I wasn't suddenly acting like an older sister of two. My mom argued back. Her husband was rambling to himself. I told them they could make me be civil, friendly, not mean, but they couldn't make me do more than that. I was really talking back to them. This annoyed them and they called me disrespectful and they told me I don't value family like I should. I argued back that I do but we have a different idea on who is and isn't family.

"AITA For telling my brother to go help my mum get the shopping bags? so 3 days ago me and my brother were play fighting when he threw a slipper in my eye on accident. it caused me to get a corneal abrasion, he didnt and still has not apologised for it ending up in my eye. his reasoning being 'you missed when you threw it at me' i said fair enough then. this abrasion has caused me to gain photophobia to an extent like looking outside or just being outside hurts my eye, this doesnt really happen with my phone as i can adjust the brightness.

that brings us to the main story, this morning my mum videocalled me to ask about my opinion on gym leggings, my eye hurts the worse in mornings and hurt even more today that i cried and had to cover my eye with my hand,. she saw this and was obviously very worried. as time went on my eye got better and i could see, so i went on my phone as usual with low brightness and played my moba game.

my mum called me again and i told her i was feeling better and it didnt hurt as much, but obviously she was still worried so told me to tell my brother that in 25 minutes he'd need to get up and come help her with the shopping bags. my brother did go to work last night, and came home around 1am but it was now 11:30 am so he had been sleep fof a good 10 hours. he was obviously pissed and said what does my eye injury have to do with going to pick up the bags. and how he'd been at work so i should go but my mum told him he should come. he goes and says he'll only come if he can take my phone. i gladly give it to him lol, i may be addicted but i can give it up for 30 mins. he takes my phone and then looks at my screentime, it was 18hrs, he said so u can be on ur phone for 18hrs but cant go out for 30. i try to explain that i can adjust my brightness on my phone but same cant be done for the sky... and for some reason the sky affects me  more than my phone.

  
he said 99% of people would say im the asshole for waking him up to this after he came back from work, i said its been almost 12 hrs since u came back and ur point is negated cuz i can adjust the brightness on my phone. thoughts? i do think i am the bad guy but i dont think its that bad

"AITA for not understanding My (24F) boyfriend (28M) talking inappropriately with his bestie who I didn't even know the existence of till now. They say it's just jokes 
First, let me apologize for the long and messy post. This is fresh so my mind isn't working the best. 

For some background info, I've (24F) been kind of on and off in a relationship with a guy (let's call him B 28M) for almost 2 years now. We have not met yet, it's been online only so far. But it was a serious relationship since we've been spending all our free time, literally any time we arent engaged in our work, with each other on call. And when I say we've been on and off, I dont mean that we broke up and didn't talk for a time period often. It was more like, id say I don't wanna be your girl anymore but continue to talk to him just the same as ""friends"". Long calls, every free time. Kind of stupid I know. 

So, today, he shared his Instagram details with me (I'm skipping details of why he did but i can share if it explains things further). He is not at all active on insta as in he just uses it to watch reels. He only follows like 4  people one of whom is me, others his friends. While in his insta, I come across a story in the home page of a girl. Getting curious, I go into her profile and read the messages between them. He literally replied to a story of her where she was wearing fishnets (he says this later in the messages) with ""youre making me weak for those thighs"", and then later on he says ""I would love to bite them and kiss where I bit"" and also ""I would take you to a shop to buy more hot hot stuff"" among other things. 


So i according to him and the girl herself, they are like gay besties (he isnt gay obviously, ig it's just an expression she's using to explain their friendship dynamic) and this was just them joking talking. "" we are weirdos"" and things like that. He on the other hand first say this was around the time when we were fighting which then I pointed out that we weren't fighting. Infact we were quite good and I was traveling a lot. Then he says the same.. that it's just stupid jokes. And most importantly all he repeats is trust me nothing happened, nothing ever happened or ever will. 


Please someone tell me I'm not losing my mind for nothing over this. I'm literally going crazy. I'd made life plans for this guy and I'm so lost rn. Please tell me If I'm overreacting for no reason and if I should even give this guy a second chance?

"AITA for telling a disabled person that karma must’ve gotten them? I (55m) have COPD and I can’t walk more than 100 feet without getting winded. I have a handicap placard for that.

A few days ago I was getting groceries and I parked my car in the handicap spot near the entrance as I physically couldn’t walk through the whole parking lot. On my way back I was confronted by a woman in her 30s who was in a wheelchair. She said I don’t look disabled and have no right parking there. I have a very low tolerance for bullshit, and I told her that my disability is not her business and that karma must’ve gotten her before and that she shouldn’t be surprised if she gets another blow. Then I got back in my car and left.

Unfortunately, my wife was around at the moment. She’s a very calm person and she’s scared of confrontation, saying that I should be above this. It’s a constant point of tension between us for the last 30 years. She told me that I shouldn’t have said what I said and that it was incredibly inappropriate to talk about karma getting her. I told her that she had to hear that and maybe next time it would stop her from bitching at strangers in public. She rolled her eyes at me. I told our son about that and he said I was in the right since some people have a tendency to stick their long noses into someone else’s businesses. I’m curious though whether it was an overreaction of mine.",0.75
"AITA for backing out of doing my sister’s hair the day before I was supposed to? 
Me (20F) and my sister (22F) have always had issues. She wants me to braid her hair for her tomorrow. She asked me about a week or two ago to do her hair, and we have had many arguements between then and now. Today was my final straw, and I am thinking about telling her no altogether. Please let me know if I’m overreacting?

For context, one of the main issues l have with her is her household contributions. We live with our mom, meaning we have shared spaces. She NEVER cleans our shared spaces. Tasks like taking the trash out, mopping the floors, cleaning the bathroom, etc., are tasks STRICTLY done by me or my mom. Another main issue is the car situation.

When I was 16 l worked 2 jobs to be able to get my own car by 17. Over a year ago, my sister got into a wreck with my mother's car, making MY car the family car. This new arrangement was (and still is) hell for me, since my mother's work schedule is insane. She has to go to work at 5 am (3-4 times a week), meaning either me or my sister has to wake up that early to drop her off. She gets picked up at 9:30 pm, which ruins a lot of my nightly plans. Then, she has a parttime job (2-3 times a week), where she has to go midday for a couple hours. I take my mother to her part time job, since my sister works during the day.

Since it is my car, and my work schedule is flexible, i've assumed TONS of driving duties. I also have to take my sister to work and pick her up too. This is difficult for me because I constantly have to keep waking up and going back to sleep and it takes forever for me to fall back asleep.

 With all this in mind, I recently told my sister ""If I have to take you to work, you have to take our mother to work. I'm not getting up twice in the morning to drive you guys around."" I feel like this is reasonable because, 1. she is the one who totaled my mom’s car, 2. she doesn't pick my mom up after work, or take her to her other job EVER, 3. she constantly uses my car even though she didn't put a single penny towards it, 4. she does nothing around the house. Despite me telling my sister this, she tells my mom that she's not taking her to work when she doesn't feel like it. So, I have to get up twice to give them rides in the morning and evening. This happens often, but I feel like it was dumb of her to do this the day before she wants me to do her hair.

Now, knotless braids take a long time. Professionals normally take 8-12 hours to do the style, so imagine how long it takes me. I enjoy braiding, but I don't want to reward my sister for her lack of contribution. I feel like I could be the asshole for canceling the day before. Considering how long it takes, she cleared all her plans for tomorrow. The braids average $350 but I charge her $50-100. I doubt she can get an appointment for tomorrow, and she most likely can't afford it on such short notice. Please give me some advice here. Should I just do it?

"AITA for Refusing to Let My Sister's Kids Stay at My House? I [35M] live alone in a two-bedroom apartment. I enjoy my privacy and have set up the second bedroom as a home office, which I need since I work from home.

Recently, my sister [32F] asked if her two kids [aged 6 and 8] could stay with me for a week while she goes on a work trip. She’s a single mom and doesn’t have many other options for childcare. I love my niece and nephew, but the idea of having them stay for a week is overwhelming. My apartment isn't childproof, and I’m not used to having kids around, so I declined her request. My sister was upset and said I’m being selfish and unhelpful. She pointed out that I have the space and could rearrange things for a week to accommodate them. I suggested she look into a babysitter or someone else from our extended family, but she insists that it would be easier and cheaper for them to stay with me. Now, my parents are also upset with me, saying family should help each other out in times of need.

"AITA for turning down a drink with the babysitting in-laws So me (m39) and my wife (f36) have a rare completely free child night out, to the point where they’re staying over night at their grandparents (the in-laws). For context we’ve not had that for over a year. We’ve had the odd evening off but usually have to be back to put the kids to bed.

The initial plan was to drive the kids over to their grandparents. Then we would commence our evening out. That was then changed without my knowledge.

The grandparents asked if they could meet us in a local beer garden, have a drink with us and then they’d leave with the kids. My wife messaged me to check if that was ok. I said no. On the grounds we’d been away with the in laws for 3 nights camping the previous weekend, they’re notorious for being late, they usually coerce my wife into having one more with them and I didn’t want to manage the kids in a beer garden prior to our evening out. I wanted a completely child free evening with my wife.

What I didn’t know was she’d already said yes, I was told I was being inflexible, that everything always had to be my way, that it was impolite not to meet them etc. 

I stood my ground but it completely soured things as she believed I was out of order for not meeting them.

"AITA for not understanding my partner? I in general tend to be a very direct person, I don't like to beat around the bush and the such, I'd rather just tell someone what I feel or think rather than try to drop hints and the such. This in part is because I would like others to do the same for me and it's a matter of respect, Id rather just tell a person how things are rather than try to hope they come to the conclusion with little bits of info given to them.

As I said, its how I'd hope others would be for me, I however tens to have an issue with this sorta thing at times where when someone doesn't tell me something directly then I don't always get it.

Now that the background of the event is out of the way I'll get to the main point, me and my partner have been watching a show together lately and have been hard-core binging it. We started it last weekend and have been watching several episodes every day since then. We've been steadily approaching the end of the show, and last night we hit a point where we could of finished it. He told me ""we could finish it"", I took this as, we were far enough along to finish the show, which isn't what he was trying to say. In his mind he was asking me if we could, and as a result he thought I was agreeing to finish it with him that night. So when we were about two episodes from it being done and I asked for a break he was quite upset and went to bed early, I went to go and cuddle with him and help him fall asleep before doing some thing with some friends once he was out

Me and him talked about it this morning and I said I was confused as to why he was upset, and he got irritated saying that if he didn't tell me directly what he was thinking that I wouldn't get it. He told me that apparently this was an ongoing issue (something we've talked about lightly in the past) where he will say something and I won't get it because he didn't specifically state what he wanted or needed. I told him it's frustrating to me just like it is to him because I hate that I can't understand what he's trying to tell me and I hate that despite my best efforts he ends up upset due to my lack of understanding.

That's pretty much where the conversation ended, with him looping back to his point of ""if I don't explicitly say something your not going to get it"", am I in the wrong here? I don't doubt that I need to improve and the such with my understanding, but at the same time I don't know if I'm in the wrong for not understanding someone's wants based off of what I feel is unclear communication.  
  
I told him that I don't think that it was fair for him to be upset with me for him not communicating his wants clearly.

"AITA for not taking down a perfectly fine photo for someone who is vain? I’m a 45F and I have a sister who is 43F. Recently, we had a large wedding in our family that became a family reunion. Lots of photos were taken with the promise we would share them on our private family whatsapp group. 

Some of the photos I took were casual shots at a brunch. There were twenty girls in that photo including me and my sister. To tell you about my sister, she has always been EXTREMELY vain. She’s very coiffed all the time but even worse is that she’s a social media addict. She posts obsessively every single day to prove she is fashionable, popular or show off her designer lifestyle. Her pictures are always so heavily filtered, she looks positively cartoonish. 

At the brunch, some of us were casual, some dressed better. She was perfectly made up and looked great. I posted the photos on our private family group along with a few other cousins with identical photos from their cameras. None of us posts on social media at all other than her, so we know they won’t be shared. The photos were very sweet and everyone liked the photos except…my vain and insecure sister.

She went ballistic on me! She called me up to scream and demand I take them down as she didn’t approve. How dare I share unfiltered photos of her, she gets to have final say of her image, etc. I told her absolutely not because others had requested them and second, how was she planning on getting the other identical photos removed? Was she going to yell at the other cousins? We all saw her in person that day, we know what she looks like. 

A few hours later, she decides to get revenge by posting unflattering photos of me on the group. I ignore it. She then sends me a text threatening to post photos of my college age daughter, who had privately battled an eating disorder a little while back (but has since recovered). The photos were of her at her lowest weight. That did it for me. I told her off and dared her to go through with it and see what the consequences are.


She kept threatening to do so for a day until my mother called me begging me to take the photos off as my sister was about to go through with it and do more damaging things. My mother agreed there was nothing wrong with the photos I put up but she couldn’t handle the threats as they were giving her palpitations. I told her if I took them down, we were enabling the bullying as my parents always did when we were growing up and it would only embolden my sister further. But my mother begged me and I took them down for her, knowing we had just accomodated an emotional terrorizer.

This is not the first time she has done something like this. She loves to create a scene to get her way. Between this and her vanity, I think she is a disordered individual.  It was accomodated a lot as children and still is to this day. I’m embarrassed to be in this situation as middle aged women but…

"AITA for staying at a West End show after my partner left? I am a massive fan of musical theatre and have been to many shows, my partner also enjoys musicals but not nearly as much as I do. We decided we wanted to go see Back to the Future on the West End, I was placed in charge of booking the tickets and I found 2 very cheap tickets that were the second row back, there were listed as restricted viewing but because of a speaker being next to the row, so I immediately booked them.

Flash forward to the day of the show, I told my partner we were sitting very close but not the actual place we would be sitting. We got into the theatre and sat down, we couldn’t see the floor and had to look up a bit but nothing major, then my partner begins looking at me like ‘are you serious’ so I ask them what’s wrong. They tell me that they can’t sit this close and it would give them a migraine if they did, they told me we had to go since they didn’t want to sit there with a migraine which is understandable. I told them that they can go home, we live relatively close to the theatre, and I’ll watch the show because I was really excited for it. They explode at me for even proposing the idea, saying that it was selfish to want to watch it without them, they then stormed out of the theatre. I stayed and watched the show without them.

"AITAH for still crying after it was obvious he was a red flag? I (24f) was in a relationship a few years ago with a guy. For privacy reasons I can't say his name but I'll refer to him as Bob (26m).

We met from a call that was started by my cousin. I thought he was cute but didn't think much. We got closer day by day. We were both obsessed with gaming so we would usually call at night at around 7pm till 9pm just to play games. He would always check up on me while I was at work. The occasional ""Have you eaten?"",""How are you"" and so on. 

One day there was a book event that was held near his house. I said as a joke in a group chat that had me, bob and someone of my other mutual friends ""Who wants to go with me?"". Not long after, one of my friends said they would go with me but shortly after that Bob says he wants to go. I told him that I was going with my friend because I thought he was joking and I don't usually go out with guys but he still insisted that he comes. The day we met was the day I realised I had caught feelings for him

A week later he confessed to me asking me if I liked him or not because we would always flirt with each other in a playful way. I confessed as well that I liked him then we dated for 1 year.

On a random day I got a text from Bob while I was in the gym. I checked my phone and he said he wanted to talk. I was confused and worried because he didn't refer to me as ""baby"" like he would usually do. When I got the text I immediately went back home. When I got back I answered. He then told me that he wants to break up because he wants to focus on work and thinks that I'm a distraction to him. It didn't make sense to me, he had a clothing company that he owned and works from home but of course like the girl I am I said that I respected his decision. I went into a 1 month depression phase after that. I loved him so much. 

A few months passed by. I was scrolling through my Instagram when I saw Bob posted on his story. I thought that was weird because he never does that. When I opened it, it was a post about him with another girl going to a tech con thingy. I didn't think much but it definitely hurt to see my ex doing so okay while I was suffering. As weeks passed by I saw Bob's relationship with the girl getting more and more... intimate. I got information later from a friend saying he was in a full on relationship. I was devastated, he lied to me. After awhile I had almost moved on and had become friends again with Bob.

It was his birthday, he didn't like birthdays. I wished him happy birthday and he was thankful. As a joke I told him post me on his story (stupid I know). He told me no since he had a girlfriend (he didn't know I know). Just a few hours later I saw he posted on his story. I clicked on it and there she was...his girlfriend.

"AITA for expecting my friend sells me back a car I sold her for the same price? I have a friend with a long history of being selfish, often not pitching for group things like food or gas. Despite this, most people let it slide because she's a pain to argue with. I accepted it as part of who she is, and never brought it up.

A few years ago, she went through a rough breakup, was a student, broke, and her car died. I had just received a car from my grandmother, an older model but in perfect condition. I could have sold it for $8-9k. Instead, I offered it to her for $4k to help her through a bad time. All it needed was new tires.

Now, a few years later, she's moving and selling the car. I told her I'd like to buy it back and she was happy about that. I assumed we'd work something out based on the deal I gave her, after discussing it, she hesitantly agreed to sell it back to me for $4k. The car had about 30-50k more km, wasn't well-maintained, and was used off-road (its not an offroad vehicle.) The car had like 1 minor issue she fixed. (this was after driving a shitty dirt road for months)

After this, she texted me saying she consulted w others and said she would sell it for $6,500. Her message was long, claiming it's her car and we had no buyback agreement. No apology or acknowledgement for the situation. Basically just a long justification about how she thinks shes in the right. Also i'm 98% sure that the response was from chat GPT - I was upset & felt used, and told her I wouldn't pay that price, that I felt taken advantage of and that her behaviour was shameful. I just dropped it after that.

So basically she thinks I'm the asshole for not considering her situation and saying the behaviour was shameful. While I agree she doesn't HAVE to do anything, as we did not make a buyback agreement, I just feel it's a crappy thing to do to a friend. Especially since I do need a commuter and I have been there for her SO many times. Tons of nice dinners I bought and made, taking care of her dog a lot and once for two months (unpaid) while she travels, letting her use my place to work bc her internet sucked etc. Honestly if she had given me a genuine apology I probably wouldn't have cared near as much, but the entitled attitude about this whole thing is shameful imo.

I explained that it's not like that cause it's just a movie but he said it's just the same. SO I was wondering.. AITA? ",0.25
"AITA for purposely not attending my best friends wedding?  Me and my friend are both 26 and I’ve been best friends with this guy since we were in Kindergarten. A little backstory before the main issue, the last 6 times I’ve seen this friend is because I made the effort. He moved one state over about 6 years ago, I went to visit him directly twice and then planned a weekend get together mid way one other time. I then moved to the west coast 3 years ago and proceeded to fly all the way back to the east coast two years in a row for his birthday get together. All the while him never making the effort to come see my new place on the west coast. Heck even when I was still one state away , I had to find out through social media he was home for the holidays. I send this guy birthday presents every year and never get one in return. The whole relationship just feels super one sided. 

Fast forward to last year, I get engaged and announce my wedding in Hawaii, I invite about 25 people, 19 show up and my best friend is one of the 6 that doesn’t. It’s a wedding in Hawaii so I get that it’s a tall ask. Mind you this is a friend that traveled to Puerto Rico and Mexico within the same year (so money is no issue here) he let me know very early on in the process that he wouldn’t make it. And overall it just felt like he didn’t even want to try and make it a priority. I had friends with way more sophisticated situations that made it happen. 

Now to the present, he got engaged a few months ago and just this last week told us the wedding would be in Michigan, he expects us to buy or rent tux and there’s a whole weekend planned around wedding where we will all stay in an air bnb. I live on the west coast, so Michigan is a trek. I have a plus one to the wedding but my wife wouldn’t be allowed to stay at the airbnb with the entire group. 

I have the means to make this happen but my pride is telling me to stand up for myself and not attend. The entire house will be all of my best friends and I’m sure the weekend will be a great time. I just can’t bring myself to continue on letting this friendship be a one way street. 

Am I the assholee for refusing to attend the wedding and should I voice how I feel or just let me not showing up speak for itsvelf?? 

TIA!! ",0.11
"AITA for making my SIL have a meltdown over a nickname? My (20F) soon to be SIL (21F) has never gotten along with me. She was passive aggressive towards me the first time we met, and over time she has become down right rude to me. I tried to be nice to her, going on shopping trips with her to try and bond with her, and she responded by implying that I was superficial. She said I was “high maintenance” and “shallow” because I liked putting effort into my appearance. She would say that I didn’t deserve to date someone like her brother and that he was too good for me.

Every time I attempt to be nice to her and patch things up between us, she said I was fake. She said I only wear makeup and stylish clothes to distract from my ugly face. She always says that she doesn’t understand what her brother sees in me, and that she couldn’t wait for him to break my heart and date a woman who is actually on his level.

My boyfriend has never defended me before, saying that his sister is just opinionated and “quirky”. He has also prioritised her before me on multiple occasions. He postponed our plans to move in together because his old apartment is closer to his sister and she’ll miss him too much. He even missed out on a ceremony where I received an award because his sister had a mental breakdown.

My SIL has called me countless of names in the past, including “bitch”, “cunt”, and “hoe”. So for the past few months I’ve been calling her a rather snarky nickname whenever I’m talking about her to my friends. Word eventually got out about what I’ve been calling her, and she confronted me, screaming sobbing and crying, saying I’d crossed the line. She cried so hard she couldn’t breathe and had a full on meltdown in public.

Now everyone is blowing up my phone asking about the situation. My boyfriend is furious with me. I’ve tried telling him that I was only responding to my SIL’s treatment of me, but he thinks I took it too far. I said she spent a year harassing me and making me feel like shit, I should be allowed to give her a harmless nickname.

"AITA for expecting more from my SO?  I (31F) and my (33M) SO have been together for 9 years and have 3 kids together. We aren't technically married. 

I stayed home with our first for 3 years. Then we moved, I got a full time job. I got pregnant again a few years later, I worked until the day before I gave birth. I had an emergency c-section(that's a story by itself). My maternity leave was short lived. I was only given 2 weeks paid leave then the other 5 weeks were unpaid. During my leave, we had new carpet installed in our house. He told me that if I didn't get on all fours to make sure all of our daughter's barbie stuff(a good portion of which are mine from my childhood) if was getting thrown out with the old carpet, he put no effort into helping me. I was 2 weeks post c-section, still had stitches, and crawled around to preserve mine and my child's toys. 
When I returned to work he was supposed to get paternity leave, he got the time, but never the money. He also told me, that he wouldn't be doing any of the household chores. So I became the sole income for our family, and the house keeper, 7 weeks post-partum. He never got another job. 

Fast forward 2 years, I get pregnant again. He was expecting me to only take 2 weeks maternity because this time, I was also, only given 2 weeks paid leave. When I told him I wanted to take 7, same as last time, he freaked out and told me we couldn't afford for me to take that much time off. But he couldn't get a job to help? (Ideally I would have take 12 weeks like a standard leave but being the only income in our house it wasn't feasible). 


He has been the SAHP for 3 years. 

The chores he manages to accomplish only benefit him. His laundry. Sometimes the kids laundry. 

The things that don't get done unless I do them, are as follows: 
Taking the dogs out
Feeding the kids breakfast
Feeding the kids dinner(I walk in the door from work and start cooking immediately, I barely get to say hello to my kids)
Going to the grocery store
Making the bed
Putting the children's clothes away
Vacuuming 
Dishes
Cleaning of any kind
Washing windows
Mopping/sweeping
Toilet cleaning
Taking the kids outside
Arts and crafts 
Games with the kids
Bathing the kids
Getting the baby dressed
Feeding the baby solid food(he feeds the baby puffy snacks and formula only) 

There are probably things I missed.

"AITA Wont Pay My Friends Deposit of our Bachelor Trip I am 29M living in AL. From 2013-July 2020 I previously lived in MS.

While there one of my good friends let me borrow his acoustic guitar. I had it for a number of months and one night in August 2019 when said friend spent the night at my place, I asked if he wanted the guitar back. He responded nah and said he'd get it another time. Fast forward to June 2020 I'm about to move from MS to AL with my gf. Before I move I ask my friend if he wants the guitar and he doesn't give me a response.

So I leave the guitar with my roommate at our shared house and move. I'm 50/50 but once I moved i let my friend who still lives in MS that I left the guitar with my old roommate who still also lives in MS so he can hit him up to get it.

Fast forward to the present, in September I'm planning a bachelor trip for my forthcoming wedding. And one of the groomsmen is my friend. I ask of the groomsmen a deposit so I can book our BNB for the trip.

And when I ask my friend he's like ""how bout for my deposit you take it out of the money of the guitar you lost"" Which whoa its been 4 years and not one mention of this guitar until time for the deposit for the trip. So I text my old roommate on the status of the guitar and he's like yeah its been 4 years I've let a student I teach have it because my friend never picked it up. 

I explain this to my friend and explain yo ive asked you multiple times if you wanted this guitar back and you left me no other options. And he responds ""I didn't let you borrow so you could leave it with (roommates name) and moving forward when you displace or damage something thats lended to you in good faith its up to you to replace it""

So he said he'll pass on the trip and see me at the wedding in the fall. Am i the asshole here? Like I tried previously to return the guitar to my dude and everytime the response was I'll get once i get it.

He talks about it being the principal that I owe him or I misplaced it. But i told you where it was and it was on you to come get it.",0.27
"AITA for paying for my sister to dye her hair professionally? I (16f) have two younger sisters Cece (12f) and Coco (4f) as well as one younger brother Cai (9m), and finally an older brother Matt (21m). This story covers Cece so I won't be covering the others as much.

About a week ago Cece wanted to dye her hair letting both parents know if she could go to the store with Matt or I, she could buy box dye with her birthday money. Cece has type 4a hair in the darkest shade of brown, when she asked me to take her to get box dye I knew that not only would it not stain her hair, letting a 12 year old girl do her own hair has a good chance of severe damage. Being the person I am I took her to my stylist, a personal family friend who works on all hair types. I played 170 us dollars for the service plus a tip of 35 dollars for fitting Cece in. I go home with my sister as I compliment her hair (she got pink and green referencing Mitsuri from demon slayer) After we get home Cece shows our parents, telling them about her amazing experience and around an hour after Cece is sent upstairs for bed I'm called down and yelled at for taking my sister to dye her hair. They say it looks like a train wreck and they won't be paying to ""fix"" it. I told them there's nothing to fix because her hair was done to perfection. After about an hour of fighting they said I would be grounded and that I was cut off from the family friend until I find a way to fix Cece's hair. I don't see the issue because they gave her permission to go and get box dye that wouldn't work and I spent my personal, hard work earned money. So AITA?",0.96
"AITA for making my uncle bawl like a baby?  My aunt(42F), who raised me and is very close to my family (my dad’s sister), married my uncle “Barry” six years ago. She was under a lot of pressure to get married back then (she was 36 and my family feared that she wouldn't be able to find someone if she waited too long). Barry, who works in AI, has a high post in AI development. Unfortunately, whatever higher being gave him intelligence must have fallen asleep for his street smarts - how he survived this far is astounding to me.For example, he once booked an 8-person vacation group on THREE separate flights and EIGHT individual hotel rooms in TOLEDO, Ohio, instead of Toronto. My aunt, who is very street-smart but impatient, seems to tolerate his quirks but I feel she must be tired of them. In conversation, she has alluded to the fact that she gets annoyed with his family who treat her like a servant rather than a daughter.

I am visiting my aunt's house this summer. For one of his biweekly brainfarts, he decided to weed the lawn without gloves and  got some dirt under his nails . He washed his hands ""thoroughly"" according to him but nothing came out. He started complaining loudly about how much it hurts and how he can't continue with his work. We took him to an UrgentCare where they said nothing was wrong with him. Once we got home, he started whining and complaining again and how ""he knew it was blood but the doctor must have been wrong"". At this point, I was fed up with his whining and told him ""The doctors are licensed and did a thorough diagnosis. You are an AI engineer not a doctor. Why don't you leave the medical stuff to them."" Apparently, my logic was too much for him and he started yelling, ""You are just a little, spoiled kid. What do you know about pain !"" I thought I was severely unlucky and had to deal with his second brainfart of the week immediately after the first and told him ""I am just telling you to calm down as there is most likely nothing wrong with you, according to the experts."" I'll be honest, at that point I was tired of his whining and I added on, ""The only thing wrong with you is that brain."" I know I should respect my elders and all that but I was sick of him. Until he said, ""It must be in your family’s blood to be this stupid, if you think I am dumb."" Stupidity was the only thing running through his veins yet he had the audacity to say that my family were the idiots? I lost my temper and yelled at him, ""The only stupid one is you. If you can't tell the difference between Toronto and Toledo, the social norms of booking rooms, of booking flights, then I can never attribute intelligence to that brain, no matter your career."" I probably shouldn't have exploded on him like that but I was done with his stupidity. Instead of a reply, he broke down into a tidal wave of tears and RAN to my aunt and told her ""what a mean baby I was"". The baby was in tears crying to his wife my guy, not me.

"AITA For not splitting ownership of my dad's house I inherited with my brother? My dad passed away last year and I ended up inheriting 100 percent of his house because around 35 years ago, I was added as a co-owner to his house when he refinanced it and since he died without a will, I ended up inheriting 100% of the house. 

When I told my brother that the property tax was reassessed at market value for the house, he told me that I should just split it with him since the property tax would remain the same. I refused to split it with him because his wife had made comments about selling the house and if I split ownership with him, there would be no guarantee that his share would go to my daughter, who was my dad's only grandchild since my brother doesn't have any kids. My dad said he wanted to give his share to my brother to make it even but he also had said multiple times that he wants the house to eventually go to my daughter because he understood how expensive houses have become. Additionally, I asked my brother if he would will his share of our dad's house to my daughter but he wouldn't give me a straight answer. So, I refused to give him half of the house because I want to be sure it goes to my daughter in the future.

Currently, the house is a rental and my brother and I are splitting both income and expenses but he wants me to officially give him half the house.

"AITA for wanting my roommate to contribute to rent after study abroad?  I (24F) live with two other roommates (24F) and (24M).  The other two are in a relationship and share a room.  My roommate, let’s call her Kate, was studying abroad in Italy for the last academic year on scholarship.  While she was away, me and my other roommate, Tony, were splitting rent and bills according to what we agreed on.

Kate got back in late April from her program.  Tony and I had agreed that we would give Kate some time to readjust and settle back down after her program.  We had a conversation in late May establishing the ground rules for the house since Kate is back.  

One thing established was that Kate would begin paying rent at the beginning of August and would be officially added to the lease that month as well.  (Tony had been paying 1100 and I was paying 1300// the new split would be Kate 700, Tony 700, and Me 1000).  Everyone agreed that was a reasonable timeframe for Kate to find a job and start making enough money to pay their portion of the rent/bills.  

Now it is August and I was only told a few days before rent was due that Kate doesn’t have a job and can’t pay rent in a message from Tony.  Which is frustrating too because I expected to hear something from Kate telling me that she didn’t have the money.  I haven’t heard anything either from Kate about the situation or expressing any apologies about missing the deadline.  

Since June Kate had applied to some jobs but has expressed that she wants a job that is fair paying and won’t treat her poorly.  Which I completely understand because I have worked several restaurant/corporation part time jobs where I was treated like a puppet.  But, it got to a point in July where I would come home and Kate would be watching stuff on her phone for hours in the living room.  I don’t expect her to apply for jobs with every living moment and I understand she could have been applying to places while I was at work. 

I am frustrated that Kate doesn’t have a job even though she has been living rent free for 3 months after graduation.  Tony has been supporting Kate’s groceries and personal care items since she’s gotten back.  AITA for wanting Kate to get a job and understand that she can’t keep taking advantage of me and the situation?

"AITA for telling my SIL off after she got upset that me being a ""new"" father means her kids will get less attention?  Yeah, I know, kind of cliche isn't it? The kind of thing you never expect to actually happen for real. But, here we are! Or rather, here I am! First, some context.

I (37M) was recently informed that I am a father. My daughter is 16 years old, and the result of a tryst with an older woman when I was 20. This is not a brag, it's simply informative. It wasn't a random one-night stand, we weren't strangers, we had known each other for several months up until that point and continued talking for almost a year afterward. Just never told me. Also, it wasn't an affair. I don't know why she never told me.

I met my daughter for the first time recently, and everything went well. We've been communicating almost daily via text. She's excited to get to know me, holds no resentment against me because she understands that I was never informed of her existence at all, and is excited to meet the paternal side of her extended family. All in all, everything went so much better than I was expecting. She's the spitting image of me, so there was no doubt about paternity, but we did a test just to be absolutely certain and the results proved that she is indeed my daughter 😁 We'll call her M. 

So obviously, I announced this news to my family. My sister was the first one I told, because she has been my Confidant since we were in high school and we don't keep anything from each other. But with M's blessing, I have also informed her grandparents, her great grandparents, and her uncle and his family. My oldest niece, the daughter of my sister, is extremely excited because now all of a sudden she has an older girl cousin. Very big deal for a 10 year old.


The problem is my SIL (22F), my brother's wife. We'll call her S. I'm not a rich guy, but as a bachelor I do alright for myself. I have a tendency to spoil my nieces and nephews with candy and sometimes toys when I visit. Well, my youngest niece, the daughter of my brother and S, recently had a birthday party. A lot of the extended family was there, including my own grandparents, her great-grandparents. Closer to the end of the party, S made a comment about how I didn't even know that M existed for 16 years and it shouldn't be such a big deal that she becomes part of my life now, because I was fine without her for so long and she was fine without me for so long. She said she just doesn't understand why I'm making it such a big deal. Well, despite the fact that I'm generally very slow to anger and always have been, I unloaded on her. I said some things that I shouldn't have, that I now regret, and left the party. S has been texting me all week about how terrible I am for what I said. My brother is on her side because it's his wife, but my sister is on my side because I was provoked. Our parents haven't been involved, but S has obviously told hers because they've texted me as well.

I don't regret my action, but perhaps I was a bit too harsh? It wasn't her first comment about the situation.

So anyway. AITA?",0.23
"AITA for calling out my son’s girlfriend’s dad? My son was at his girlfriend’s house and her dad walked into her room while they were playing on an iPads. He said to them “I hate to be this parent but what’s in your pocket?” to my son. My son said “my keys?” Then the father said “no, that.” Pointing at his pocket. My son omitted that he had a geek bar vape, which at that point the dad started patting him down and reached into his pocket and grabbed the vape. First my son texted me saying, I messed up and my girlfriend’s dad asked what was in my pocket and I said keys, but then started patting me down to find a nicotine vape. I know I shouldn’t have it but he put his hands all over me when I wouldn’t tell him what was in my pocket.

First, I’m absolutely against my son doing that let alone taking it to someone else’s house. So I was on board and had an effective conversation after my son and then the father texted me. When he texted I apologized for his behavior and told him I would have rather he not put his hands on him. But made the point I didn’t condone my son’s behavior. I ended up calling him instead of texting and he talked to me for 30 minutes about random parenting things that didn’t pertain to me or my son, just his daughter. His daughter had been struggling in school and her friend group. My son has been working and is a 4.0 student. I was being empathetic to his situation but felt like it was lost what we needed to focus on.

The following day I wanted to circle back to communicate that I didn’t like that you reached into my son’s pocket. I think if he was lying or not being respectful he should have just had him leave. I would never put my hands on his daughter in any way. It really bothered me and my son that you put your hands on him. So after communicating that he turned into a loose cannon telling me to “shut up” he’s talking not me, saying I just don’t want accountability and some other things I’d rather not mention here as it was pure hate speech. He was at a wedding reception and clearly intoxicated and I kept pleading that I just want to remind him I’m on board but like he was protecting his daughter, I’m just setting a boundary on him holding my son accountable without physical contact. He just kept telling me to shut the f*ck up.

The reason we got on the phone was because he texted me l saying:

He was lying to my face and I knew it. He was also in bed with my underage daughter doing something that was illegal (vaping nicotine). I’m sorry, I was being a parent. You have decided to let your child vape and I have not. So, we have different parenting styles. I treat your child like mine, essentially, whether we are out to dinner or whatever, I am supporting him and my daughter. But if your main concern is me holding him accountable for his behavior when with my daughter and providing her a drug essentially that you sanction, then yes, we are on different planets. Let’s keep our kids to ourselves. If you can’t get on the same page with me, they should not be hanging out. Let’s just pretend that my daughter is the bad influence and shoved a vape into his pocket. You are ridiculous if you think I’m going to be ok with his behavior. Feel free to search my daughter for drugs. I’ll applaud you afterwards. Seriously?!

My response:

I’ve tried to reason effectively with you and that doesn’t seem possible. All I can do is apologize for anything I did, which was threaten to sue you for touching my kid. (This was after he was yelling profanities at me and my attempt to get his attention to calm down) I don’t know how else to say I am on board with you guys. I am okay with you calling him out, sending him home, and notifying me etc. The only thing I cared about was you just not laying your hands on him. Why you are saying I allow this or think any of it was okay is beyond me. I also did not say any of this was your daughter’s fault. I don’t want to be against each other or put our kids in the cross hairs. How can we effectively communicate without calling names and being unkind?

Am I missing something that I felt how he handled it was inappropriate?

"AITA for not telling my ex wife I broke up with my girlfriend? I (45M) got a call from my ex wife (40F) saying she wanted to talk. This is very unusual for us considering we don't communicate unless it has to do with our kids. We have 3 children in their early teen. I reluctantly agreed and was then bombarded with questions. 

She wanted to know why didn't I tell her I broke up with my ex girlfriend (43F)? How come everyone else was informed when it happened and she was just finding out months after that fact? Why have I been letting my ex girlfriend and her kids live with me and our children if they weren't together anymore? Does this mean she and her husband are allowed to come over and see the children now? By now she was emotional and crying. She told me I was an asshole for not telling her it happen as that means this opened up the door for her to be closer to our children. 

I sighed and told her that this didn't change anything and my dating life is none of her business. I didn't tell her the first time my girlfriend and I got together either. The only reason I had told her about my girlfriend and her 3 children was because they were moving in.  I explained to her I was going to tell her about my break up when my ex girlfriend and kids had moved out. She didn't like my girlfriend anyway, so I also didn't want to tell her because I didn't want to hear the 'I told you so's. This didn't change anything having to do with our children so its none of her business.

She then freaks out and calls me an asshole. She says she doesn't give a crap about me and my dating life. She  says my girlfriend was the main reason we had so much turmoil in co parenting. She, my ex girlfriend, was the reason she, my ex wife, wasn't allowed at the house. She was the reason my family had to have 2 of each holiday as she refused to be in the same room as my ex wife. My ex wife then tells me, if she would have known we broke up when it happened, then she could have been spending quality time with our children in their home. I told her she knows now so we can move forward in co parenting our children then hung up.

A little context. I have full custody of our children. My ex wife had a mental break down and was deemed unfit. She still sees them every other weekend. She and her boyfriend, now husband, use to come over the whole day to see the kids. When my girlfriend moved in, she said she didn't feel comfortable with my Ex wife coming over. So we started having shorter outside visits.

After that conversation I went to my parents house and asked them who told my ex wife. Expectantly my mother says she had let it slip, but she also had no idea my ex wife didn't know as its been 4 months since the break up.

"AITA for wanting my foreign boyfriend to be more proactive at using my language when living in my country? Hello Reddit,

I live together with my boyfriend in my hometown. I work full time, he's currently unemployed.

Since my boyfriend is from a different country, he doesn't speak my language fluently. He has been here for 2 years and he's been studying it on Duolingo the entire time, while refusing to take any paid course in order not to impact our budget for what he feels isn't necessary (I have insisted).

He's making progress and can now make basic conversation if we go out with friends. On the other hand, on top of some housework, I handle our utilities, finances, any interactions with health professionals, bureaucracy and in general anything that requires more attention than small talk about the weather.

Recently, I've started feeling like... I appreciate Duolingo and the small talks, but I resent the way he immediately pushes anything else to me without seeing it as (controlled, I'd still help) practice.

I've expressed that I'd appreciate it if sometimes he could try to find ways to deal with things without waiting for me to do them. He says that there's no point because his language skills aren't as good as mine and I'll just be faster, but I think...

A) that when I have to deal by myself with things for two people, even an extra 5 minute call ends up being a lot

B) if both ways are equally available, I'd love for him to at least try sending an e-mail if he doesn't feel confident calling. It'd save time even just if he used DeepL and I re-read it. He says e-mails are too slow

 C) that I just wish my to-do list was smaller! He says it makes sense for me to do things because I have a better memory. I try to write things down, but I can still happen to forget something. There's just so much. I don't want to have the entire responsibility just because I make an attempt while he makes writing a post-it sound like a doomed effort.

Yesterday he forgot to do something at the post office and, tonight after work, he asked me to call them instead of trying to use the Customer Support chat or writing them an e-mail himself. Maybe they really wouldn't have replied before a day... but he waited the same amount of time!

I told him that I'm burdened by being in charge of everything that involves going out of his comfort zone. I'm afraid that if we have kids I'll just be in charge of 3 people whenever we have to deal with adulting or remember that we have to do anything at all.

I want him to be more proactive. I've lived abroad with little language before and nobody was there to help me, so I had to get out of my comfort zone A LOT, but maybe it's automatically my responsibility to do these things now since I am, in fact, here and I can help.

He says that this will all get better once he learns more of the language, but I've gotten afraid that the problem lies with his attitude. When I said this, he insisted that I'm overreacting.

"AITA for yelling at my MIL? So some backstory to this moment: I 40F) let my daughter (autistic, 10F) borrow my phone for a YouTube piano tutorial and I stepped out of the room. Her dad was running errands and during that time he clipped a car (minimal damage and no one was hurt). He tried to call me for the insurance card and our daughter hung up on him twice before I got my phone away from her.

He was justifiably angry because he thought initially that I was ignoring his calls. There was some yelling and frantic stuff but yeeees where it gets worse.


I was venting to MIL that I was frustrated that I had been yelled at when I was trying to fix the problem and all she has to say is that I ""need to get over being yelled at"" and she proceeded to lecture me on being too emotional and kept reiterating that I needed to calm down and get over it.

So I felt the lecture wasn't helping me calm down and I said I was going to go to my room to calm down and she grabs my arm to stop me.
Nothing rough but it sent me into a fit and I screamed at her not to touch me. I told her I don't like being grabbed when I'm upset.

She stormed off for a bit and refuses to believe I feel ashamed or am sorry for my fit. Hubs is annoyed that I didn't keep my emotions in check (he did apologize for being mad at me about the phone)

So AITA?

"WIBTA for telling a friend she is too much Hi everyone, I need some advice. A few years ago I met Alice ( fake name). We weren't that close, she was friends with another girl but she quickly , kinda forced herself into my life. By calling me a lot every day, texting... to make a long story short she kinda forced the friendship. It has been 3 years now, and to be fair I am kinda overwhelmed by her. She is way too much for me, she calls me everyday every hour when I don't reply to her asap or call her back asap she will be like "" oh you don't love me blablabla"", she trauma dumps on me everyday tells me nobody cares abt her and that she is all alone, when I spend hours and hours listening to her. I am a person who needs a lot of time off, and I isolate myself a lot , she takes way too much of my energy and idk what to do anymore.
 I told her multiple times that I need space and that I can't call her all the time but it's like talking to a wall. I really do appreciate her a lot but it's a lot for me. I can't deal w her traumas and issues, I can't listen to the same boy problems anymore. It's always the same thing, I keep on giving her advice and listening to her but atp it's just overwhelming for me, I also have my own issues like, it's really a lot . 

Whenever I bring this topic up, she brushes it away and laughs saying stuff like "" but you got a social friend that needs a lot of attention so you have to be social w me"" girly pop no, I do not have to do this. 

So yeah pls give me some tips to say this to her , again, and all anyways thank y'all.

"AITA: Did I put my friend in a bad position when I wasn't even part of the meeting? Background: Jake(manager), Tom(manager), Ken and I work together. Tom, Ken and I are friends inside and outside of work. Jake,Tom and I are in the same department. Jake and Tom are both managers and I am a lower level employee in their department. Ken is in a department that works closely with us on certain projects.  Ken and Tom don't like Jake. They think he's incompetent, a liar, withholds information etc. At times they have collected evidence of their grievances and submitted them to Jake’s manager and spoke to the head of Jake's department about it. Jake is my direct manager, I'm not his biggest fan but I am not trying to cause any workplace issues and try to keep my opinions to myself. 

The incident: A couple months ago, Tom let Ken know that Jake thinks we (Ken and I) are plotting against him since we are close friends. Ken told me this while we were hanging out after work one day. Obviously Ken and I are not plotting against Jake. Apart from complaining once in a while while hanging out, I don’t say anything about any issues I have with Jake. Ken told me not to tell anyone about what Jake had said about us supposedly plotting against him. 

At work the next day, Tom came into my office to complain about whatever Jake had done wrong that day. After a few minutes, he decided to leave my office in case Jake noticed he was in there talking to me. I said something to the effect of “yeah..we wouldn't want him to think we're plotting against him”. Tom (who was the one who told Ken about Jake's concern)  laughed and left my office. 

Soon after that, during a meeting between Tom, Jake, Ken and other coworkers, Tom made a comment about people “plotting” against people that made Ken have to cover for the fact that he knew about Jake’s concerns. I don't know what was said or how it made Ken look bad since I wasn't there. 

The next time Ken and I hung out, he chastised me saying I put him in a bad position by talking to Tom about Jake's concerns and that I made him have to cover his ass when Tom brought it up in front of Jake.

Now, I may have messed up by making the comment to Tom the day before. I honestly didn't think anything of it at the time since Tom was the one that told Ken originally anyway.  The way I see it, I didn't put Ken in a bad position, Tom did. I didn't bring up the comments during a meeting, Tom did. I didn't discuss Jake's comments with anyone that didn't already know. Tom might have brought it up during the meeting even if I hadn't mentioned it the day before! Tom should have known better than to bring it up in front of Jake unless he was purposefully trying to start something. Honestly, Tom is the type to say rude things in meetings because he knows people won't stick up for themselves in that setting. 

I apologized to Ken for putting him in a bad spot and I have already distanced myself from Tom but it's been bugging me ever since. Was I the A Hole?

"AITA for refusing to give up the family dog? My (23F) husband (27M) has told me that he no longer wants to keep one of our family dogs.

For context, we first got this dog from my husband's mother when he was around 16 weeks old when she found him and two of his siblings on the side of the road; he is now around 18 months old. We took him in to ease her load, and since then, his brother was put down due to aggression, and his sister got hit by a car. All three dogs were destructive and reserved around humans. Luckily, we spent much time with our dog and got him to trust us. We got a DNA test done, and the results showed that he is a mutt. He has every sort of bread in him you could imagine: German shepherd, pit bull, bulldog, Australian shepherd, and even chow (to name a few). Part of me has wondered if he's too much of a mixed bread to train correctly and has lousy genetics.

This dog is my husband's dog; even though it was a joint decision to bring him into the family, he bonded with my husband. Their relationship has been strained recently as we've moved house, becoming homeowners. Our dog is high-energy. He can't sit still ever and has even put a significant dent in our living room wall. We have two young children, who he is never aggressive towards, but he constantly knocks them down, jumps on them, and scratches them. This dog also loves to chew on everything. He's destroyed countless toys, clothing items, Xbox controllers, and remotes. He has also started to chew on our deck and destroy the outside furniture and the hose. We try and redirect him, but he doesn't care. We've bought him stimulating toys and a bunch of sniffer treats, but he destroys everything we buy him. We spent over $2000 on training for him, and even after months, much progress has yet to be made.

Our yard is not fenced, but he is hooked up to a long leash to move while outside alone. He likes to dig holes and has been digging into our foundations over the last few weeks. It's caused the deck's wood to crack, and he's chipping away at the concrete. He's also tried to dig up our neighbor's fence, and we've had to fill it in numerous times.

That leads me to the problem. My husband no longer wants to keep him. He feels like we've tried everything we can afford to do to correct him. He worries he will cost us more money in the future, and we won't be able to repair whatever he breaks. He is also concerned that he will accidentally hurt the kids.

From my perspective, I feel guilty knowing that we took him in as our responsibility, and now we are giving up on him. I feel bad for the kids, who will be sad if he goes. I never felt connected too much to this dog, but I still view him as a part of this family, and a part of me struggles with the idea of not having him around. My husband now believes I am picking the dog over his happiness, as he continually feels financially stressed about what the dog will do next. He is the only one who works; I am a student.

"AITA for being too open about my reasons for not drinking at a family dinner? 

I'm a 34-year-old man who hasn't consumed alcohol since the beginning of 2023. I have a 2-year-old daughter and a lot of lingering trauma from my dad drinking a lot. He wasn't an alcoholic in the traditional sense—he still worked and provided a good life for us materially—but he was always drinking. I could never connect with him outside of his drinking. The smell of alcohol, the slurred words, the way his mood would change—it all left a mark on me. I don't want the same for me and my child. I want to be present and fully engaged in her life without the influence of alcohol.

Everyone in my life has accepted my decision except my father-in-law. He constantly asks why I don't drink and makes jokes like, ""Oh, it's just wine, it's just grape juice,"" because he thinks it's hilarious. I've told him multiple times that I don't drink, but he doesn't take me seriously. It's frustrating and tiring to keep saying no.

Last week, we met my wife's sister's fiancé for the first time (they live in a different country). We were all getting dinner, and the fiancé asked what I was drinking. I said nothing, and he asked why I don't drink. I kind of lost it. I told him the truth—that my dad was a drinker and I don't want to put my child through what I went through. He looked taken aback and didn't say much after that.

Later, my wife told me that I was an asshole for being so open about it at the first meeting and making things awkward. She said there was no need to bring up my dad's drinking and that I should have kept it simple. I argued that I've had enough of being questioned about my choices and that maybe now her dad will get the message too.

"AITA for smoking when my husband said no Hi, me and my husband both used to smoke last year. He had to leave the country and decided to quit smoking and I started to feel pressured into quitting as well but it was not as easy for me since I was relying on nicotine to feel better and less anxious. I tried multiple times but couldn't quit completely until a few months ago when we started vaping instead.
Ive been cigarettes free for 2 or more months. A few days ago my vape ran out because it was defective and it was getting used when I was not using it. Therefore it ended before my husband's did. I asked my husband if he could share it with me but he refused. I was needing nicotine a lot but couldn't afford a new vape for the moment, and decided to get a pack before i can afford a new vape.

"AITA for cancelling plans with a friend because I know it would end with me spending a lot of money I don't feel like spending  I live in Delaware. One of my friends lives in New York City. They're originally from Delaware like me but they moved up there. Occasionally I'll visit the city to hang with him and to have a fun day out but I've noticed in the last 2-3 times, I'm spending more than I normally would otherwise. 

When my friend comes down to Delaware to be with his family, we'll catch up and go out and it's not that costly but when I visit him in NYC, its like he wants to only go to the most upscale environments possible. I get it. We used to be in the same ballpark financially and we used to have fun going to a bar for cheap drinks or to a museum or whatever but now he makes 4-5x what I do. I make roughly 60K a year. He clears 275K a year so he doesn't find those activities that fun anymore as he can afford more. The last time I was up there, we went to three different restaurants in one day. One for drinks, one for dinner and one for dessert. I didn't think much of it at the time but later on I realized I spent close to $200 then adding in all the other things we did it was closer to $320. It's a bit crazy for me. I was supposed to go up there tomorrow to hang but I just cancelled because I'm not in the mood to burn $200 to $300 when down here I'd typically wouldn't do that.

"WIBTAH for never help cleaning my home? 
I (14f) don’t do any type of cleaning in my home unless it’s my mess. If I didn’t do it I ain’t finna clean it. My dad always ask me “why don’t you help keep the house clean?” When I was 7 and my younger sister was 6 we would always clean the house. Dishes, sweeping, wiping tables, etc. The only appreciation we got was a “good job.” Now we don’t clean at all.

Now, my younger brother who is seven likes to try to clean but does terrible. And my disgusting nephew who is ten is the nastiest person I have ever met. I have older, older siblings btw. 

Not to go into too much detail but he’s like a rat packing food in its nest. He had food all up in this room and stolen food that got moldy. It makes to hallway smell so bad. I don’t even let him step foot in my room or touch me.

My brother and him are so nasty. I don’t leave my room. I have said many times before “I don’t clean after big ass kids that can clean for themselves.” I am entitled to only cleaning my room and MY used dishes. 90% of the time I’ll clean everything I use. Which I only leave forks and spoons in the sink.

They leave all types of food and trash on the floor. Which will never be touched by me. I simply say “pay me $5 and I’ll do it.” Which never happens. Plus I try to avoid standing up for so long because I’m prone to pass out easily. So WIBTAH

"AITA for calling my dad a male chauvinist after he showed ZERO empathy when I complained about being a woman in tech?? Posting this on a throwaway account on the offchance my dad finds this.

I am 26F, work in tech as a software engineer, and I had a really rough day today. Actually it's been a rough week. I was laid off early last year and only managed to land a new job in May. I've been living with my dad for the last year to save on rent.

I constantly feel like I'm not good enough at my job. A large part of this is because I feel like I’m constantly getting undermined. For example, a lead on a partner team I have to work with constantly goes over my head to ping my mentor and boss, even though he knows I am the project lead. I feel like I get constantly talked down to or ignored. It is a large codebase to ramp up on, so when I’ve been unfamiliar with how some parts of it work, I feel like some team members use that as confirmation that I’m not good at programming. All in all I’ve been feeling very demotivated and disempowered. 

I was explaining all of this to my dad. He initiated the conversation when he noticed I was upset after a meeting. Instead of genuinely listening and being supportive, he basically pushed me down even further. Maybe he was just trying to play “devil’s advocate”, but it was not what I needed. I felt like he was blaming me for the problems and implying that I’m encountering this because I’m not presenting myself well enough or am being too sensitive or maybe that I am not good enough to be the leader of my project area yet.

I was already upset and hearing him challenge me on this, on me literally just sharing my feelings with him, made me want to scream. I said some heated things I’m not proud of but he escalated it. For example I first tried to disengage by saying “You know what? Forget it, never mind. You wouldn’t get it” and he kept egging me on saying “What wouldn’t I get? Why wouldn’t I get it? Just say it”. So I did. 

I said he wouldn’t get it because he’s a shitty dad and a chauvinist who has no empathy for any perspectives or feelings other than his. 

Some other heated words were exchanged and it ended with me breaking down into tears and him extremely upset. Now we are not talking.

I feel like shit for some of the awful things I said to him but I am so frustrated. We haven’t communicated all day and when I tried to talk to him in person he wouldn’t look me in the eyes and he just said in a quiet voice that my words really hurt him today.

I understand that but I feel like I am owed an apology as well. Why should I be the one groveling for his forgiveness when he was the one who started this and showed zero empathy to my feelings or problems?

"AITA for taking my dogs side  AITA for defending my dog

Hi, I, 32 yr old female, recently moved my 2 yr old son, 4 yr old GS dog, and myself into my boyfriend’s house.  We have neighbors now, who also have dogs. My German shepherd Lola, isn’t used to having neighbors. The adjustment has been stressful to say the least. Which leads me to tonight’s incident. It’s a Friday, boyfriend and I have worked a long day, just trying to enjoy a cold on in the shop, while our son plays. Next thing you know we hear a bark from the neighbors dog. I’m thinking ‘seriously!’ I find Lola chasing after one of the neighbors dogs (who mind you was in my yard.. (it’s important later)). The old woman immediately starts yelling. At this point Lola is no longer chasing the little dog, she is making her way into the house because she knows she messed up. 
The woman continues to yell at me to get my dog under control. I proceed to ask her if her dog is okay. She continues to yell. So i asked her “was your dog in my yard?” She said what? I repeated myself. She said that’s not the point. We have all had problems with your dog. I told her “Your dog comes into my yard everyday to pee. Do you want to know how I know? I watch for him. For the simple fact I know that he is scared of my dog. Now I’m going to ask you to keep your dog in your yard. And before you accuse Lola of anything you’ve heard. I doubt you got the full story.” She said. Lucy would never! (The other neighborhood dog) i said look just keep your dog out of my yard and I will do the same. 
The argument got heated if im being honest. Some of its a blur. I do know she told me I needed to respect my elders because she didn’t like how I was talking to her. I did tell her you are not my elder. I dont know you and you don’t know me. She told me I don’t try. I said try? So what I’m a little anti social? 
She also accused me of letting Lola be out front by herself. I told her I’m actually sitting on the porch when Lola is out front. You just can’t see me.

"AITA for not checking on my friend after she dropped out of my wedding party? I was very excited to ask 2 of my girls who I see the most to be in my wedding party. Let's call them (Lisa & Shelley). 

They both said yes and it was great. But 3 months in (4 months before the wedding), Lisa said she couldn't afford it and was dropping out. I said it was alright but I was a bit hurt. 

I had so far asked them to buy a dress that was around $100-$120, and had paid for drinks and food at the one meeting we've had. 

Lisa (& her bf) both work and make decent money, and pay low rent since I rented them a suite as I manage a building so I was confused that they couldn't afford it.

Shelley isn't working MUCH so I said I could help her pay for her dress if it would help.  

After Lisa dropped out I asked Shelley if she was still ok doing it. Her & Lisa are very close also so I just wanted to be sure. She said she did and that was great.

That same night on our group chat with the other 4 girls in the wedding party, Shelley started texting that it was crazy I expected them to pay $100 for a dress to be in the wedding and dropped out on the chat. 

I was really hurt and felt confused why 2 of my closest friends who I have ALWAYS been there for, wouldn't step up to be a part of my wedding when I would do ANYTHING to be in theirs if they asked.

As my wedding isn't far I needed to replace one of them soon and knew the perfect girl to do it, so I asked her the next day so she could have time to prepare etc. 

She was SO happy, and said she'd be honored. I had wanted to ask her but we already had 6 people each, so I was happy that I got a chance to after what had happened. It honestly made the hurt of my 2 ""besties"" dropping out a bit less.

I didn't need to replace Lisa because her bf was in the wedding party too so they just both dropped out.

After about a week of nothing from Shelley I get a text message saying how awful it is that I didn't check on her to see how she was doing or to make sure she didn't want to do it before I replaced her.  

I am absolutely FLOORED that she is angry with me about this! 

She has since sent me messages saying how hurt she is and that she doesn't know me anymore and has started saying BAD things about my fiance to people they both know.

I don't even know if there is a friendship to salvage after this.

"AITAH for calling out my ex from years ago?  I (28f) dated a guy for a couple of years in my early 20s who was pretty verbally abusive. He would very frequently call me names like disgusting, retarded, idiotic, etc. Mostly it revolved around him distrusting me and accusing me of either cheating or wanting to cheat. It got so bad that on my graduation night from college I got tipsy and playfully smacked my girl friend’s ass and he stormed off, yelling at me and calling me disgusting and accusing me of cheating for playing with my friend. 

He sort of owned up to this after we broke up, which was like 6 years ago. Then we didn’t talk since. It just would periodically pop into my head and make me so furious to remember. 

More recently, however, I also began to realize how he had coerced me into sex in public places. Sometimes I played along and had fun, but I remember 2 instances where I had repeatedly said no because it was horribly unsafe, and he physically pushed me around and called me names like “you pussy” for not wanting to do it. This week it really hit me how messed up this was to be both pushed into sex like that and simultaneously constantly shamed for having a sexuality at all. So I texted him out of the blue calling him out. He responded taken aback and sort of apologizing for his behavior but not owning the coercion piece.

"AITA if my best man and groom accidentally took my wallet from my wedding and blame me for it 
My best man and my groomsman both live in Florida and I live in tennessee and they came up to be in the wedding. Wedding went great and we all had a lot of drinks. Towards the end I was still talking to people before the dj says the bride and I “have to leave right now everyone is waiting”. We had no idea what that mean so we went downstairs and we are very confused when we see our relatives making a tunnel with their arms for us to drive to our hotel. We are many drinks deeps so we just go.

Next morning we have no car, no keys, no wallet since it got left at the reception and I ask my wife what happened to all of it. She told me that her mom and the bridal party cleaned up and grabbed everything after and was going to bring it to the air bnb in the morning. Later I get a text from my best man saying that the groomsman got called into work (which pissed me off because he said he got off) in Florida…and they carpooled…so they have to leave immediately. I don’t think too much of it and I make a mistake of assuming it my wallet got dropped off.

Come a few hours later after we meet with our in-laws we head back to the air bnb to pack up. No wallet (or the bag it was in with my jeans too). I call my best man and they have the wallet. They start to blame me saying I shouldn’t have forgotten in the first place and I get mad saying they had the wallet and they knew they had it so they should have made sure to drop it off.

My wife surprised me with tickets to Halloween horror night for our honeymoon and plane tickets so it was important that I had it since we left the next day (2 days after wedding). I got lucky and my mom was going to an airport which they were nearby and she had to drive back my wallet to me.

He is the youngest of my 5 children. Relevant to the story, I lost my first daughter to a negligent act by a family member while they were supposed to be watching her. 

When my son's bus came after school, he was not on it. The driver contacted the school, and they said he wasn't there. I, of course, start to panic and call all over to find him. Finally I got someone at the school who said ""he got on the wrong bus."" They were turning the bus around to take him back to school (not home because... reasons). I told them I was going to pick him up and not to put him in another bus. 

When I got there, the office lady said the bus just got there and began to walk me out to it. Once again she says, while laughing like it was a silly thing that happened, ""yeah, he got on the wrong bus. It happens."" 

I said, ""He didn't get on the wrong bus. He's 5. Someone PUT him on the wrong bus."" At that point she looked back and just then realized I was livid. I looked at her and asked, ""so who put him there?"" She stammered a little and said she'd find out, and they just got a bunch of new teachers. 

When my son got off the bus his hair was soaked in sweat. It's 106° F outside, the bus had no air conditioning, his water bottle had not a drop in it, and they did not have a harness on him. They had to start putting a harness on him because he gets up and runs, which almost caused an accident the year before. This was at a different school for pre-k. 

It turned out it was a teacher's aid that put him on the wrong bus, and I never got an answer as to why his IEP (an educational plan for special needs students) protocol wasn't followed. 

My knee-jerk reaction is to chew everyone out, call the school board of education,  and switch schools because my son doesn't have the ability to say his name, where he lives, or identifying information. He can't let someone know if he's thirsty, dizzy, or hot. This wasn't 1 mistake, but 3 very serious mistakes to me. So, with all that going on, do I give them another chance or go scorched earth? Am I overreacting? Would I be the a.h.?

"AITA for being scared to marry my fiance I (25F) have been engaged with my fiance (28M) for about 2months only. I started dating him over a year ago when I was going through a bad divorce (My ex husband cheated on me) While I was initially excited, I have recently been terrified of marrying him. We are in a long distance relationship and plan on living together shortly after the marriage happens. I’ve noticed we want different things and also a few things in his personality that terrify me. I want children now as well as a man who is masculine. My fiance doesn’t want children any time soon which has caused a bit of friction. He is more of a softer man and while there is nothing wrong with him not being very masculine, I sometimes find it unattractive. The other day I asked him to order me something under $15 and he charged me for it which made me cringe. I confronted him about it and told him he’s cheap in the way he always charges me for everything to the cent. Meanwhile he still owes me a bit of money that I don’t believe he intends on paying back. He tried to make up for it by buying me something  expensive but I still was kind of grossed out by the whole situation. It didn’t make it better that he kept saying “wow I’m kind of jealous “ in regards to the gift he got me as if he expected me to get him that (or something)in return. We dont go on a lot of dates since we’re long distance which is why I am surprised he is so cheap when it comes to me. He doesn’t have to waste money on taking me out or getting me things frequently so I don’t understand why he is so cheap. I love my fiance and I talk to him every chance I get. He is very sweet  and caring and I love that I can trust him to be loyal. Al he does is go to work and other than that he’ll just be on the phone with me all day. But sometimes I feel like I’m wasting away my youth and “prime” years on this person. I also feel like Im in very deep with this relationship. I guess I’m on here to see if I’m looking into this too much and am getting too much in my head or if yall would feel the same way",0.5
"AITA for not passing on a message? My father's friend has split up with his wife recently, and my father invited him to stay with us for a while. My father seems to be showing a lot more sympathy  with him a lot more than he did with me when I discovered the woman I'd matched with on Tindr and was talking to for weeks was actually a pig butcher. Just to say, his friend  is not my favourite person and seems to think I'm here to serve him. 

There is a problem with the internet connection in the area, they are saying they are going to fix it but they've been saying that for months. In the meantime, there is nothing I can do about it. The account is in my name. I come in from work, he's moping about like a slug, soon as I enter the living room he's put in the password(without asking me I'll add) starts complaining about how it's less than 1MB/s moans about it all night to me. I know it's slow, works okay(Not great but I can still play GW2) for me in the office because I like to plug things in to the modem.

The next morning I'm getting ready for work. It's about 7AM and he appears in the kitchen(damn do I miss mornings to myself.) He told me to tell my father he was heading out to watch his son's Brazillian Jujitsu tournament. He actually said it like it was an order not a request. He got in his car and drove off. My father wasn't awake yet so I decided not to interupt his sleep and not to make myself late for work, so I left for wrk without waking him up.

The next morning his friend was complaining about me not passing on the message. He could have done it himself, not told me to do it like I was his personal servant.

Anyway I wasn't up for another night of him complaining so I told it like it was, ""I'm sorry that even though you could have done it yourself and I had a job to go to, I failed to wake my father to tell him you were going to watch your son probably lose at his Pseudo Martial Arts tournament.""

My SIL is getting married in a month, I am a bridesmaid, and my daughter (the only young female child she knows) is set to be the flower girl. My SIL I believe has only asked me to be in the wedding because she wants my daughter in the wedding, and her mother pressured her to ask me. She didn't even ask me directly herself to be in the wedding she texted me. Unlike the other 3 bridesmaids who got a cute gift and asked in person. I haven't been included in any of the events, or planning of the wedding, she has had all of the other bridesmaids over to her home to make thier bouquets together and has gone on a spa trip with the other bridesmaids and never invited me, when I asked her about this she straight up said ""oh, I didn't even think about you sorry!"" And the  currently this weekend she is at the beach with all of the other bridesmaids and I wouldn't have even known she was having her Bachelorette this weekend if she hadn't been posting on SnapChat, and Instagram.

"AITA for yelling at my grandfather? My (15M) grandmother died about 2 years ago. Naturally, my grandfather (83M) was absolutely devastated for a while. He kept on playing voice notes of her for a while, even up until a few months ago. I was hearing from him that my relatives from my mothers side of the family (he's my mom's dad) were pressuring him to find a new wife, because in my culture, you just have to be married if you're an adult man. He told me how disgusted he was by it, and how he couldn't believe that some of the people encouraging this were close with my grandmother before her unfortunate passing. However, I've alway suspected in the back of my mind that he might remarry, although I never spoke about. However, I recently learned that he found a girl he liked, and asked for her hand in marriage. I'm unsure of her age, though I think she's in her late 60s to early 70s. I was appalled, and still am appalled, that up until a few months ago, he was crying while replaying voice notes of her telling him she loves him, and now he's suddenly ready to move on. He asked me, my parents, and my sister, if we want to come, and I of course let him have it. I told him (screamed, more like) that all he wants to do is get back what he lost, when in reality it's gone forever, and he should just accept it like the rest of us. He's 83 years old, he should really just sit down and enjoy life, but not like this. He didn't even think to discuss it with anyone, he saw the woman, he liked her, and asked for her hand in marriage, and she somehow agreed. The wedding is planned as if it were for a crazy-in-love couple in their 20s. My mom just stopped talking to him altogether. However, all my cousins, aunts, and uncles are saying that instead of screaming at my grandfather, I should feel happy that he moved on. So reddit, AITA?",0.88
"WIBTA If I decided against illustrating my sister's book? Hello All! I (31F) have a sister (33F) who wants to self-publish a Halloween kids book by October 1st of this year. Being a visual artist, she insisted that I illustrate it for her, as I have helped her in similar ways for other projects of hers. I reluctantly agreed (verbally), reluctant because that is a lot of work and pressure on me, especially since my specialty is animals and this story is entirely people based. She intends on paying me $600AUD for 20 fully rendered drawings, to be done by September 22nd. She sent me an email that drafted out all of the pages and picture ideas for the book, I didn't have time to look through it properly within a day of her sending it, and she sent me a disappointed text message that night that basically said ""If you can't take 5 minutes to read the email, then it won't be done by the deadline. I'm sad and disappointed as I was hoping we could do this together. I would need to find someone else to illustrate this and the Dudley book that you wanted to do."" The Dudley book refers to a kids book based on our beloved late dog, that I always expressed interest in illustrating, she claims that she'd need to keep the same illustrator for consistency's sake. 

She emotionally backed me into a corner, I hate confrontation so much that I remediated the situation by assuring her that I'm willing to do it. But now I'm having second thoughts. I'm worried that if I stress and work myself to the bone to get this done in time, then she'll just throw another book for me to illustrate in time for Christmas and the cycle will continue forever. It takes her about 2 hours to write a story, but up to 50+ hours worth of work for me to illustrate it. Basically slaving away for far less than minimum wage. But I'm not sure if I've left this too late to back out, or if I would be the A-hole for saying yes, then saying no after and leaving her no time to find another illustrator.

"AITAH - Took wrong food container for lunch I (38F) just got a very strong “talking to” from my husband (39 M) that has gone on for way too long for taking the “wrong” container of dinner from the night before for lunch yesterday. 

He demanded to review what I wrote prior to posting. His response to reading the following is “Your response is, I’m not sorry you should’ve done even more than you already did to ensure I wouldn’t waste carrots that were meant for you. Which will make YTA”.  This is so silly and embarrassing that I almost hope no one reads this. 

What happened…

The night before last, my husband made chicken and dumplings for the family. We are both trying to be better with our food consumption and are intermittent fasting. Our dinner = lunch for the next day. He wants me to be very clear that these are NOT leftovers.

Yesterday, getting ready to leave for work and packing my lunch, I sent him a text confirming the smaller container was mine. His reply was “no” and in response I told him “I don’t need that much”. The container of food he packed for me was way more than I could eat and I knew it would be wasted. His response back “you will need it” and that he was “going to eating something else for lunch”. Rushing, I take the container with less because it seemingly didn’t matter because he had other plans for lunch.

 I go to work, heat up my food and I don’t finish it all. I don’t particularly like cooked carrots and there were so many so that was what was mostly left behind. I come home yesterday evening and nothing was brought up about the container switch. 

THIS is my fault! I forgot to empty my lunch bag yesterday when I came home. This morning when he sees my lunch bag, he opens it and sees my container from the day before. He is highly upset that I didn’t finish it and that there were so many carrots left that he could have eaten. We get into an argument  about it.

 We were in the same room while he was packing them and nothing was said about him packing the lunches a specific way. I always take the lesser full container. This scenario seemed no different than any other scenario. 

How I ended up here…

He told me that I should take this to Reddit and if I do, that I would “get eaten up”.  That this is insane that I don’t understand that he shouldn’t have to waste his time to communicate with me because he cooked and packed the lunch. I should just take it. He shouldn’t have to put more effort in than he already does. 

We have always struggled with communication and I just feel that it would have been simple enough for him to just say “hey, I packed our lunches a certain way. Yours has more but mine has more carrots in it. I also wanted less bread/dumplings”. 

I am very appreciative that he cooked for the family and even offered to help prepare it. I don’t appreciate getting “talked at” like I’m a child that needs a scolding. If he talks about one more goddamn carrot, I’m serving him papers (not really). Am I really the asshole here? If I am, I have to profusely apologize to him.

"AITA for occupying the parking spot in front of our neighbor’s house? My husband and I live on a street where parking can be a little challenging. Every house on the street is a two family house with a driveway (large enough for two cars). However, there are usually two or more families living in each house, most of whom have cars. This results in a shortage of parking. My husband and I have two cars, but we are tenants in the house we live in and the owners use the driveway so we have to park on the street. My husband works from home so he usually parks his car across the street in front of a neighbor’s house and leaves it there. If we need to go out we’ll take my car, or I’ll park my car in the spot when he moves his. 

Yes there are other places we could park and leave the car that isn’t in front of someone’s house, but we like that spot because no one is able to park in front of or behind the car due to the driveway placement and it’s convenient.  The owners of that house park in their driveway, but they have 2 other families as tenants living there as well. One of the tenants in the house called us assholes for “dominating the spot” so that the people who actually live there can’t ever park there. I told her to get over it because it’s a public street and we could leave our car there as long as we want.

"AITA for excluding the gf of a friendgroup-breaking relationship from hangouts? (Names have been changed.)

For background information, the former friend group consisted of five people. Two men and three women. We got along fairly well until the end of last year when Jason (M20) and Lily (F22) started dating 3 or so months into the friendship. The signs were there, so it wasn't all that unexpected. Lily was the same nationality as all of Jason's previous partners, and Lily stayed behind to help him clean (his place was the usual hangout grounds). We congratulated them and Jason expressed that he “didn’t want to ruin our friendship” by dating in the friend group. Cool, right?

Well, I (F20) noticed very quickly that Jason was becoming less active in the chat, not reading messages for days, sometimes weeks on end. The chat gradually died, Andrew (M23) creating a separate chatroom for the remaining three after being frustrated by his disregard. The three girls’ chat consisting of myself, Lily, and Tiana (F20) died off as well.  A few months passed without news from Jason.

Fast forward to 2 months ago: Jason has contacted me and Tiana in a separate group chat, explaining that his ghosting session lasting for months was because he felt uncomfortable interacting with Andrew. He would not elaborate on what was wrong, claiming that he would talk with Andrew when the time was right. Apparently his reasoning for ghosting myself and Tiana as part of the package was so that he “wasn’t forcing us two to pick sides.” We expressed our disappointment with his behavior and haven’t interacted with him since. Andrew expressed confusion and expressed guilt for dragging us into this situation. Apparently the uncomfortable situation happened in January and Andrew still doesn’t know what he did wrong. Jason described his dynamic with Andrew as ""toxic"" (verbatim) in a separate series of messages to him and I can't see how his behavior is any different.

Meanwhile, Lily has been trying to reconcile with the three of us, having separate sessions to explain her side of the story. She confessed about feeling stuck in the middle, and how she feels sad about the friendship going awry. She has contacted myself and Tiana so far but hasn’t interacted much with Tiana afterward. Andrew hasn't informed me of any contact from her yet. I understand but feel frustrated that she witnessed this debaucle from the side up until now, afraid of ruining the comfortable dynamic she built with her boyfriend by calling out his avoidant behavior. 

Here is the dilemma: The three remaining members of the friend group recently got together to celebrate Tiana’s birthday and Lily seems to be upset that she wasn’t included. I think there is still tension between Andrew and Lily (her being Jason’s gf) and believe it would have been very uncomfortable to have her with us. 
AITA here for not informing her beforehand?

Sorry if this seems choppy, English is not my first language.

"AITAH for telling my mom to stop making excuses for my sister? For context,I am the oldest sister(23) and will refer to my middle sister as “B” just so it’s less confusing. My middle sister has been diagnosed with adhd and has gone through a plethora of treatments. B also has a history of stealing money from my mother. My mother who used to be strict is now taking a more “gentle parenting” approach with B. B is 17, lazy, plays video games, goes on discord aka a neet. 

I have a job and help pay for the phone bills in my household until I move out (I’m leaving in two months). I didn’t have a problem with this until one day, I was doing laundry and found a wad of 50$ bills in B’s clothes. My mom and I confronted B about this and what did she do? She cut her hair and victimized herself. Not much changed from that day…fast forward, my mom is on a trip (she didn’t even let me know until last second) and I’m looking after my sisters and the house.

Next day, I notice a new pile of dishes and can we guess who left them there? B. This time I am fed up and confront her. What is she doing? She’s applying makeup. I tell her to do the dishes and instead she calls my mom. My mom tells me to let it go. I admit, I did lose my composure but I had just had enough of everything.

"AITA for not immediately telling my friend what our friend said about her  At work I (29) had a group of friends, we were all very loyal to each other and cared about each others feelings.

I went out with 2 friends I used to work with and C who I still work with but not really friends outside of chatting at work sometimes. Me and C weren't drinking as we were driving but the 2 other girls were. C mentioned something about my good friend at work, B, that she had bad b.o, and one of the girls agreed, both said it in a nasty way. I was shocked as I had never noticed it before, and very annoyed that they were saying nasty things about her at all, especially to me since they knew I was goid friends with her. As one of the girls later reminded me I was very defensive for B and kept defending her, then I was talking with the other girl about how I felt so bad for B because she has such bad body image already, and how she shouldn't because she is very pretty and nice personality.

I felt I needed to tell her as I would want to know if that's something people were saying about me, especially if it's something that can be easily fixed.

When I went to work on Monday, I saw myself and B's friend E (B's best friend at work) and said to her about what happened, my main concern being worried about how B would react as I was worried she would spiral about her appearance. We both wondered how to say it to B in the nicest and most helpful way. I suggested bring her to dinner and saying in a gentle way what C said and that we're telling her because it's something I would want to know, and I've had problems with sweating alot so I know good deodorant to use.

I saw E again on Wednesday and we talked about it again, she said her mom suggested we don't say it to her because we never noticed a B.O problem with her. I said that since I knew about it I know I can't not tell her. Then E said something about saying to B that C was talking bad behind B's back, I thought that was already a given seeing as how I said about telling B what C said already, it wasn't my main concern, how B would react and feel was.

I was off work the next day, then on Friday me and B had the same shift at work, we had lunch together and I felt like she was in a good mindset and I was going to say to her what C had said (in a kind way obviously), the only reason I didn't was because I felt because I had involved E I should wait to say it with her or at least consult her.

I went home from work and saw on instagram that B and E were at dinner. Then B left the group chat saying she was sure we'd find out why soon. I sent her a ? and she said E told her what C said and that I was 'basically trying to protect him' and how she's done with me. E never spoke to me since then so I don't know how she came to that conclusion. I never wasn't going to tell B that C said that, I was never close to him and only sometimes talked to him at work.

"AITA for not eating anything but a salad at McDonald's? Yes, you read that right and here's the context: I have 3 kids at the age when it's common to celebrate your birthday party at McDonald's. It happened that all three of them were each invited to a party in the same week, the last two parties being one after another. 

When I had to order my food for the party, I literally could not stomach another McWhatever sandwich or anything like that, especially given the fact that I have already eaten there two times, so I found a salad on the menu and ordered it along some water. 

The bday boy's parents approached me and explained that what I ordered was too expensive for their budget and asked me to order some regular menu. Honestly, I saw it a little rude or maybe tacky, because when I have guests, I'm trying to accomodate their needs, plus, the salad was indeed more expensive than a regular menu, but not by much. But anyways, no judge, maybe they were struggling and had a certain amount saved up for the kid's bday, so I confirmed with their request, telling them I won't order the salad. 

I went to the cashier and bought the salad myself since, as I said, I could not eat junk food anymore (ik the McDonald's salad isn't exactly healthy, but better than fries and sandwich imo), and I did not want to go hungry and stare at everyone eating. Also I did not want to force the parents to pay for me since I don't know their financial situation. When I returned to the table, another mom asked me where I've been and I said that I bought the salad. Just that, not that the parents refused to pay for it. She said something along the lines ""well... they would have brought us the food, you shouldn't have to buy it"" hinting that the parents would cover up the food. I shrugged her off and sat down. 

At the end of the party, the bday mom approached me and told me that I should be ashamed by the ""stunt"" I pulled with the salad. She said I humiliated them in front of everyone by not accepting anything else from them and basically called them cheap in front of everyone. I explained that while I understand they may struggle with finances or something, they couldn't force me to eat only what they can afford or nothing at all. I explained the 3 parties situation and also added what if I was allergic to something from the menu. She told me that if that was the case, I should've stated so people should have known. I told her to stop worrying so much about what other people think and left. My husband said that maybe I should've just sucked it up and order an ice cream or a pie if I didn't want a menu, anyways something that they could've afforded in order not to make them feel bad.

"AITAH for not knowing how to have a relationship? I (16M) have a very good friend (16F) who has been a big part of my life for the past year or so. Recently we have started to get into arguments over how I don’t seem to be putting the same effort into the relationship as she is. She’s typically the one who is calling me and texting me first but I will start conversations occasionally.

I’m weird in the sense that I am not used to having good friends. For most of my childhood, I was in the gifted programs and didn’t really connect with people. I believe this plays a part in how I act today. I am introverted and I'm just not good at pursuing people. When I think about someone, It just stays as a thought and I don't think about texting or calling them. I just let it marinate like “Oh I wish I was with so and so right now” but I don't do anything. Now, if my friends invite me to events I'm more than happy to join I just don't plan.

She says this is so abnormal and I just need to learn how to talk and plan things with people. She claims it feels like I don't really care and that I don't want to talk. This is not how I feel but I understand where she is coming from with the evidence given. I believe that I can't just change the way I think after 16 years and that's just who I am.

So, I am in a place where I don't know if IATAH or she is. She says that it is all in her mind and she just needs to expect less from me as it's not who I am, but I think that she's wrong and just saying that to be nice.

"AITA for nicknaming the “family” dog.  Back in May my little sister turned 10, she got a chihuahua for her birthday. This was a very very big deal and she promised the sun, sky and the stars she’d do everything for it. As we all know and were prepared for she did not. Oh well life goes on and puppy who was named Boba after the tea has become more of a family dog. 

I live next door.  3 years ago my childhood dog and our family dog passed, we had lots of nicknames for her: bear, seal, baby dog, cheesle, honey bear, Rosie bear, the list is never ending but this was a family thing okay. 

We got Lulu in 2022! Border collie X she’s a good girl and she also got some random funny nicknames. I call her Louie, loubear. My mum calls her…. Potonski. Which evolved from Louis Vuitton. 

Regardless as we can see this has never been an issue.

Boba just doesn’t have a ring to it for me, it’s my first time having love for a boy dog. My boy cats name is shade (he permanently goes by The Shane because it’s hilarious) 

I just have been calling him bobbie and bob or little bob or the bobster. My family will correct me to say Boabster, boabie, boab, boabs, or little boabs. I seriously think this sounds like boobs. I haven’t said this because I don’t want to be rude. Regardless I think Bob is hilarious, he is tiny and a tiny man. If someone is around I will use his government name, or if it’s training I will obviously or on a walk etc. 

I keep getting told not to say Bobbie at all and last night he came up to me during a movie and I greeted him, I was once again told off by my mum which I up until now have assumed is a joke. I said “you have the worlds weirdest names for Lulu, you call her patronks and tavosnkee? I can’t call him bob?” She snapped back “Well he isn’t your dog is he? So get over it and call him his name” 

This morning I went back over to ask about it because it felt very uncomfortable and I was told im being rude in their house by disrespecting their boundaries 

I told them I didn’t realise they were that serious, im not trying to rename their dog whatsoever and just entertaining myself quietly with how he’s just a little guy. 

They told me boabs is his nickname and I have to use it. I ended up just laughing at them and having to leave while being told I am immature and rude.

"AITA for telling her to cover up for my birthday celebration? Long story short my fiance and I are going out tonight to a few bars for my birthday. Last time we went out a few months ago she wore a skirt that was extremely revealing. I mean just walking around this skirt is riding up her and shes wearing a thong and i mean you can see everything the entire full moon. I told her after the fact this made me feel uncomfortable. For some background her and i are getting married in 42 days. We have 2 children together. Ages 1 & 2 years old. Today I asked her if she could cover up to make me feel more comfortable just tonight because we are celebrating my birthday. My exact words to her were ""Could you not wear a skirt where your cheeks are out. It'd make me feel more comfortable"". To which she responded ""When i get the courage to wear something a little more revealing it makes you uncomfortable? I'm not f*cking 30. Let me f*cking live. I don't tell you how to dress"". Which kind of through me off and now she is not going and called me disrespectful and she also wants me to tell her sisters why she is not coming also. AITA? I just want to have a good night for my birthday celebraton. Wish I never even said anything now.

"AITA for not accepting my husband's new obsession with anime? When my (24F) husband (25M) and I first started dating, we went through all the normal discussions of our likes and dislikes. One of my strongest aversions has always been anime for a variety of reasons, which I made VERY clear. Obviously it's a subjective take that not everyone agrees with, but happily for me, my now-husband agreed and said he hated it too.

About a year into our engagement, I found him watching an anime (Attack on Titan). I was taken aback but he said one of his best friends insisted he watch it and it ""wasn't one of the bad ones."" I watched with him and agreed it wasn’t so bad. But a couple weeks later, I found him watching another (Berserk). Again he said his friend recommended it and it wasn’t cringy. I tried watching but tapped out and begged him to make that the last anime he watched. He assured me he wouldn't go any further.

Fast forward a couple weeks and he had not only started watching two more animes that he admitted were ""a little cringy,"" but also had a self-proclaimed obsession with Berserk, spent hundreds of dollars on Berserk books, and said he was getting a Berserk tattoo. I shut down the tattoo on the grounds that I did not want a permanent anime reference on his body that I would have to look at every day. He called me unreasonable, saying that I had no reason to hate anime so much. I replied that whether or not it seemed reasonable to him now didn't matter because I made it clear how I felt from our first day together and he's the one who started watching it despite that.

We're married now and he just keeps sinking more and more into anime. He starts a new show every few weeks, each one cringier than the last (which he admits), and all he wants to do is watch them. A big part of us spending time together after work used to be hanging out and watching shows or movies, but now he'll hole up watching anime until bed even when I tell him I'd like to watch something together. Every now and then it really sets me over the edge and the argument starts again, with him saying ""there's no reason for you to hate it so much"" and me responding ""reasonable to you or not doesn't matter because I made my feelings clear before you decided to get into it."" All we do is go in circles.

From my perspective, it was extremely disrespectful for him to make this a hobby when he knew perfectly well how strongly I hated it; and it’s even worse that he sticks to it despite the friction it's causing in our relationship. From his perspective, I don't have a ""real"" reason to hate it so that shouldn't stop him and I'm being a dick for continuing to bring it up. I really want to resolve this so I need to know, which one of us is the asshole here? Or are we both in the wrong?",0.8
"AITA for paying my mom back half the money  My mom gave me money for rent when I was in between jobs. I told her I would pay her back as soon as I got paid. As my pay day was approaching, I kept making jokes about how I’m so excited to get paid and finally be independent again. She would always follow with “just make sure you pay me my money first, just make sure you pay me first”. When I get paid, my paycheck wasn’t enough to pay her back 100% of all the money I owed her from rent. So I paid her 65% then called her asking if I can pay her the rest when I get my next check. She’s so upset at me for not sending her all the money and is saying “my word isn’t bond and if I tell someone I’ll pay them back I need to pay back the full amount and she said this doesn’t speak well on my character. Is she being a narcissist? If your daughter isn’t able to pay you back the full amount is that something you get mad at? I understand if I paid her nothing at all, but I gave her the most I could for now. I told her she’s making it seem all about the money and she’s saying it’s just the principle but I think this is to cover that up. ",0.98
"AITAH for asking a random girl to sleep with my friend? Hii, bare with me on this one.

So I(22F), my partner and six other friends are vacationing around Europe right now. One of our friends, let's say Eren, is still a virgin (22M). I don't care about it, lol, but he is very frustrated regarding this matter. 

So two days ago we were in Budapest clubbing in our hostel when this girl approaches me and my boyfriend and two other friends. She introduces herself (solo traveler), and we invite her to stay with us. Eren is somewhere else. During the night she points at one of my friends, who's in q relationship, and asks whether he s taken or not. I tell her he is and she goes ""I'm not even going to bother, I only like having sex with inexperienced guys"". This girl is physically pretty and fun to be around so I point out Eren and tell her she should hit him up in those case.

We left this morning and two hours ago Eren came humming at me. Apparently he and this girl slept together and texted over the day and she said something along the lines ""glad x told me your a greenie;))""

He is very very mad at me for talking about his private life with strangers (which I swear I did not indent to do), and for making someone to ""pity him"" to have sex.

My boyfriend sides with me (not the most objective source), and so does another of my girl friends, but the rest of the group is being neutral/defensive and kind of ignore me.

AITAH? 

Edit: Thank you for your insight. I do understand where I was wrong and hopefully I will be able to fix this with Eren. That begin said, to bring some more clarification, he never said that he wants to save himself for someone important, wants a meaningfully connection etc. I obviously don't know what happened between them and what she said, but in the morning he stated that he ""finally kicked the ball inside the net"" (it sounds weird translated, lol, but it's a local saying) with a pretty girl. Didn't sound attach or anything, but I wouldn't really know, obviously 

Edit 2: The reason I did not go to Eren in the first place (I'm not saying it's a good reason, but that was what I thought atp) is that he is not peroxide social and has a hard time talking to both men and women. He is shy and I don't think he would have made the first move. But again, I do know I am in the wrong and I will apologize to him as soon as he will want to talk to me again.",0.15
"AITA for telling my mom I won't take care of grandma when she comes over for the holidays?  Right so, I(27F) live with my mom ATM. I'm working on moving out until the end of the year but some stuff has thrown a wench into my plans and it probably was pushed a bit further down the line. 
I do share a few bills with her and sometimes we split, sometimes I pay, etc.

I've a full time job also.

Anyways, a year ago my grandma 80+F came to spend the holidays with us, mostly Christmas but it was basically Christmas and new years. It was super exhausting for me because my mom (62F) basically left me to do every single thing.

I had to be changing her soiled diapers, I had to be spending full time with her, I had to help feed her, take her to the bathroom, towel her when she was done, clean her up when needed, take her places, etc.

And honestly I just felt so grossed out. The ONLY thing my mom would help with is cleaning the sheets and she'd do that while complaining loudly that ""I could do it because it was so easy.""

Now, I don't mind spending time with my grandma, I just think it's unfair that I have to become a full time carer for her when she travels over. (I've visited her and her house is adapted so she doesn't need help, but our apartment obviously isn't.)

We also have dogs that I have to care for full time because my mom refuses to acknowledge them.

Today we got into an argument because I said that if grandma spends the holidays with us this year that I shouldn't be the one caring for her full time. My mom called me selfish, claiming ""it's my house too! I can invite whoever I want!"", saying ""fine! So when your friends are over I won't cook or do shit for them!"" (She didn't even cook for my friends, I did everything but ok), and saying that ""it's your grandmother, show some respect!""

Anyway. AITA for setting this boundary?

EDIT: clearing some stuff I found brought up in the comments! 
-Grandma doesn't have a caregiver, but she does have a lady who goes over to her house thrice a week for company, basic care, etc!

- grandma doesn't live alone, she lives with one of my aunts and my cousin. Me and my mom have lived with her as well at some point for most of my life, anyway

-im not saying I find gross to spend time with her, or find her gross. I find gross to clean the diapers, beds, soiled stuff, bathroom stuff. 

EDIT 2 (and probably the last one)

Last I had a long conversation with my mom where I was very firm on my side. I did give her suggestions that I've seen in the comments such as the temporary doggy daycare, or hiring an extra hand, stuff like that. She was very, very against it at first, kept trying to escalate the discussion and I let it stew until this morning. During breakfast she brought the subject up again, and said we could look into hiring someone, after all. She saw I wasn't budging and that she'd be the one doing the work.

Also, yes, I want to speed my move before the end of the year. 
Thank you everyone for the comments and ideas, it really helped.",0.1
"AITA for not inviting my BIL to my son's birthday  I (29F) and my spouse (30M) were invited to my brother-in-law (29M) and his fiancee (28F) wedding in June. Let's call them Carl and Elisa. Everything was pretty great until later that night. For context I suffer from Flicker Vertigo, a photosensitive triggering epilepsy, that can lead in serious situation to partial paralysis. So yeah, pretty serious condition even if not ""deadly"". Some medication exist for helping symptoms, but none can prevent a bad photosensitive reaction. For another context, Elisa is a nurse. 

So my whole family in laws know I have photosensitivity, we told them a bunch of time. We even told them again the day before the wedding, to wich Carl said: ""well you can go outside when the DJ put some, if it's in his program, I can't do much"".

Fast forward to 8pm,  my spouse and I were outside to take some fresh air and relax, then our son (5M) went to run inside, so we had to go back in to watch her. I had no idea what they were doing inside until I opened the door and almost lost consciousness in 0,01 second. They gave like 200 strobe sticks to the guests, lights were close, it was pitch black, only the strobe sticks to light the place. In other words, the worst situation I could ever been as someone with flicker Vertigo. I don't usually go to party, since I don't want to stop people from having fun, but I was not prepared for this as his own sister-in-law. 

So that 0,01 second I was in that room, was enough to become disoriented, nauseous and dizzy for almost one hour.

The worst part is that nobody checked before if I was or not in the room, so If I were at the bathroom or whatever and went out, without anywhere to go (the dance floor is right in front of the entrance) I probably would have had a serious reaction.

I was in panic mode and was crying (one of the symptoms) and asked my spouse to go home since I can't even go back in, not even to go to the toilet. Carl and Elisa went outside to check why I wanted to leave and while I was still overwhelmed, told them that they knew I was photosensitive and that epilepsy is not a joke. To what Carl answered: ""I know, my bad"". 

My spouse wanted to stay, so I had to wait for a whole hour in the car.

They never wrote to apologize for the situation or anything, my spouse is telling me that I am overreacting. I feel like putting my health in danger is not overreacting? 

So I don't want to invite them to my son's birthday party since they don't seem to have any respect for me. But I also don't want to cause any problems in the family and I feel bad for their kids (10M and 7F) since they really like my son and vice versa.

 I understand you can forget some stuff, but they could at least apologize. 

Should I only invite their kids? ",0.5
"AITA for not accommodating neighbor and turning off dryer I rent half a duplex in the PNW with a small backyard space that belongs to my neighbor who rents the second half. My washer/dryer vents into the back space. For years they have been fairly crap neighbors with a range of complaints from my infant being too loud (they have two children plus a loud yapping dog) to my dryer venting lint into the backspace (I had it repaired). The latest is their request that I not run the dryer at all midday while their kids play outside because it creates heat. When they first asked, I was so caught off guard and like a people-pleasing millennial said I would see what I could do, but couldn’t commit to that. In one week alone, they’ve texted me four times asking me to turn off the dryer because their kids were either outside or wanted to go outside to play. AITA for not responding and letting the dryer finish its cycle?

Side question: my preference would be to live side by side and not deal with each other. I don’t want to rock the boat and create animosity, but I also want to say something to the effect that it’s unreasonable for them to expect me to turn off the dryer mid-day at their beck and call.  I want to nip this in the bud where I continue using my dryer at will (not at night while people sleep, but mid day) and they stop texting me. ",0.05
"AITA for wanting a barking/growling dog out of my yard? Here's the situation. My family and I moved into a country house in 2018, and recently, our neighbors have let their 2 dogs run into our yard. Since we live in the country, the houses are a decent distance apart and what belongs to somebody should be able to easily stay in their yard. The dogs have been over countless times, any time of day. My family and I have tried calmly talking to the dogs, tried to pet them, and offered to the neighbors to buy the dogs treats to form a bond with them (so they stop barking and growling), however, the owners said, ""they're just not that kind of dogs."" So for months, we have been putting up with chasing annoying dogs out of our yard. 

Here's where the problem comes into play. A few years after moving into this house, a cat would come over a lot and it would be hungry. We started feeding it, and over time we got too attached, named it, and now it lives with us. BUT it technically is not our cat, it has been a neighborhood cat for years (before we even moved in). 

The situation that happened today has happened before, but not to this extent. 

""Our"" cat was wandering in our backyard, when all of the sudden i hear the neighbors calmly calling for their dog (pay attention to the word calmly. They never punish the dog(s) or change their voice to let the dogs know they're in trouble. Instead, to get them to come back to their yard they offer them treats, like the behavior is something to be rewarded?) I already know what's going to happen to I start to run to our cat because I could already tell the dog was gonna chase the cat. Before I even made it to the cat, their dog was less than a foot away from him, barking and growling relentlessly. I yelled at it to get out of our yard and shooed it away, and my mom asked the neighbor (the homeowners son) if they had a leash (in a nice manner). The neighbor replied, ""Yes?"" in a snobby voice, and then the owner of the home came out and asked my mother if she was yelling at his son. This became a large argument. 

To make a long story short, my parents told the neighbors we don't want the dogs in our yard because they are not nice dogs. The neighbor then said that the next time ""our"" cat goes in their yard it's not gonna be pretty (which i find funny because before this it had never been a problem, and I have watched them pet ""our"" cat, he's the sweetest thing and causes no trouble. ALSO, none of the other neighbors have ever had a problem with him, everybody loves him.) 

I want to know, are we the assholes since ""our"" cat also goes in their yard when technically he shouldn't? 

I feel like the neighbors viewpoint could be fair (keep your pet away, we'll keep ours away), but in a sense it's different. 

The cat has been here, he is an outdoor cat and does nothing bad. Technically, it shouldn't even be our problem when he isn't truly ours. The dogs live inside, and act nasty to us, they have no right to be roaming around in our yard when they act the way they do.

"AITA for not letting the mother of my bfs other child touch my baby Long story we’ve been together for 7 years rocky relationship but the mother of his other child has always had an issue with me. She always talked smack about me loudly on the phone with him so I could hear. I’ve always been there for her daughter as much as I could. I love her like my own, I have never talked badly about her mother at all. I honestly have too busy of a life to focus on her. In the past I read messages on my bfs phone from her talking really badly about me. She was angry when she found out I was pregnant and said “whats next marriage ???” She called me a crazy psycho bitch because I asked if my bf could stay home the week I was due ( his daughter had a soccer tournament that she wanted him to drive her to). The messages I saw actually hurt me because growing up I had shitty step parents that weren’t there for me and I’m the opposite with her daughter. I’ve never had any issue with her mother and I don’t even speak about her to my bf. 
Now on to the question, my bfs dad passed away and the first day the family all went to see his mother. The baby mom came to drop off her daughter and I said hi to her. She ignored me didn’t even look at me and just greeted everyone else. Okay I thought I’m not going to cause any issue because there are bigger things we’re dealing with today. It was awkward she stayed and didn’t speak. After she left everything was all good the daughter gave me a hug and we went on with the day.

 Fast forward to today ( 4 days after seeing her) I was holding my baby she walks in again walks right past me doesn’t acknowledge me at all and tries to squeeze my sons face saying loudly “Hi “baby’s name” I politely asked her not to touch his face. Then she gets argumentative with me yelling don’t ever touch my daughter then. I told her she needs to acknowledge me if she wants to meet my son. She walked out of the house and yelled “Bye “baby’s name” while glaring at me. There is clearly some issue she has with me but we are supposed to be focused on grieving right now I thought it was hurtful that she didn’t  put her emotions to the side and acknowledge me.  

 Anyways the day went on my bf told me to just be the bigger person and not cause issues. Later on her daughter wanted to come to our house so my bf went to drop us off and go back to be with his mother. His daughter didn’t have an overnight bag so he texted the mom and she said she’s not aloud to stay at our house because of me. Obviously this upset him and he’s already stressed he got upset with me. But am I really the asshole here for not letting her touch my son when all throughout these 7 years she’s talked so badly about me. 
* just adding this in I don’t let strangers touch my child so I thought at least it would be respectful for her to talk or say hello to me first.

"AITA for consindering not going to my twin brother's wedding? My twin brother (25M) and I (25M) always had a lot of fights growing up, particularly during our teenage years. He moved out of our mother's house when he was 20 to live with his girlfriend while attending university. We virtually never talked back then. Only after our 21st birthday did we start to slowly build a distant kind of friendship. At that time, I also moved out of our mother's house to live abroad while attending Med School in a neighboring country.

It's been four years since I started Med School, and we basically see each other only on Christmas and New Year's Eve. Outside of that, we talk for about half an hour over Discord every five or six months.

In a few weeks now, he'll be marrying his girlfriend of over five years. The main problem is that I wasn't asked to be one of the groomsmen. I didn't even receive a doggone proper invitation; now that I think about it, all he ever said was vaguely something on the lines of ""*I'm getting married, buy a nice suit*"".

His reason for not including me in the groomsman list was that ""I wasn't part of his friend circle all those years he was dating his girlfriend in Uni"". Now I'm sitting here thinking about whether I should even go to this wedding, considering if I should even book a plane ticket to attend.

My girlfriend says it would be nice for me to be present at this moment in his life, but I'm conflicted. Part of me wants to be there because it's the right thing to do, but another part doesn't want to pause my study and work schedule to be there for someone who never even visited me despite all my invitations over a four-year period (considering he could have visited me by making a one-day road trip during the holidays).

"AITA for keeping a cat around that causes undue stress on my wife? Two years ago, my wife pushed really hard to get a furry animal for her birthday. She wanted a dog but we live in an apartment and are away for most of the day so we compromised on a cat, which my wife has never had. I want to stress that I did not want us to get a furry animal, out of a fear of their lifetime bills, but accept that in a marriage you sometimes have to compromise. We decided to adopt a senior cat that was very sweet. She loves attention and playing, and has a very funny personality.

Now this cat has some issues. She was involved in a house fire that burned most of her ears off and caused damage to her nasal passages. As a result she sneezes a lot, with full on boogers streaks, and looks a bit off all the time. The boogers thing upsets my wife, so I try to clean it when I notice it, but it happens pretty regularly, and I don’t always catch it immediately since i’m not always around. This cat is also a bit messy and can sometimes track a bit of poop out of her box. I want to stress that this is rare, but it’s probably happened six or so times in the last two years we’ve had her.  I clean it up whenever I realize it has happened. 

Now the big one. She hisses at my wife. Not all the time though. She will beg for treats from my wife, ask for pets from my wife, and even lies next to my wife. It’s only when my wife is holding something in her hand and walking around. It’s a super odd tick, and she’s never scratched or bit anyone in fear, but this really upsets my wife. Tonight one hiss “ruined” my wife’s night and she decided to go to bed early despite being in an amazing mood before it. 

I’m stuck because my wife is at her breaking point. She works long hours and feels like she can’t relax in our apartment because of the cat. She wants to give her back to an animal rescue.  However, in a bizarre twist of irony, that cat is my best buddy. She warmed up to me, trusts me, and runs up to me when I come home. I’d go so far as to say she is my favorite pet I have ever owned. 

My wife wants her gone, but I think she’ll die there if we give her to a rescue. She’s old and not the most pleasant to look at. The thought of our cat suffering her last days out in fear and loneliness makes me legitimately want to cry. I’m caught in the middle. 

Tonight we got into a fight about the whole thing as my wife is giving me an ultimatum. The cat or her. I told her I’d do more research than I’ve already done and see if I can resolve these behavioral issues but, again, my wife feels like I am not validating her feelings by not taking the cat somewhere else. I’ve tried offering to do everything for the cat (I do for the most part anyway) but my wife says she can’t relax with her around and that she’s got to go.

"AITA for asking my adult son and wife to pay rent. Let me start by giving a little backstory. I was a stay-at-home mom for many years, and due to religion trapping me in a terrible marriage,I had 8 children and 25+ years of hell. Most are grown now, and only two are teenagers. I went back to school, and I spent the last few years dealing with PTSD from being a Covid ICU nurse. That trauma was the last straw; I'm leaving the church, setting boundaries, and asking for a divorce. Right now, I am spending all my effort on getting my ducks in a row and working towards getting to a place financially to make that happen. In the meantime, to put it lightly, there is an uneasy truce, separate bedrooms, and keeping my opinions closed. All of this is to say that although I gave everything I had, I spent all my time in survival mode and wish I could have had that stability so I could have been the mom I always wanted to be.

Because of this, I have gone through years of therapy, including trauma therapy for PTSD, read countless books, and tried my best to listen when my children complain about their traumatic childhood. I have apologized for spanking them because studies now show that it is not a grey area and is detrimental to children. I have tried to explain why I chose what I did at the time that I did it, but I also apologized for hurting them because although it was not my intention, it still hurt them.I financially supported my adult children because I hoped they would save money. Eventually, they would leave the nest and because this economy has sucked.

One of my married sons prefers my soon-to-be ex's avoidance of confrontation and has leaned to siding with my husband in this divorce (by the way, I didn't ask them to choose sides, but he has, and he let them know we were getting a divorce without me, etc.) has just suddenly stopped taking my calls and so has his wife. Due to a previous conflict earlier this year, adult children were asked to contribute to the electrical bill, $200 a month, and spend 16 hours in service around the farm in lieu of rent. When I tried texting about getting items back from my son, he didn't respond. When someone went over to ask for the items, he brought them over, and despite trying to talk to him, he walked by like I wasn't even there.

Did we argue some point? Nope. Was I a jerk about something? I have no clue. I have no clue what the hell is going on. So this is where I have to ask if I am being an asshole. If a friend I was letting stay with me out of the kindness of my heart started treating me this way, I would ask them to leave. So, after talking to my STB ex, who doesn't want to ask them to go, I thought it would be fair to ask them for the fair market value of staying in the poolhouse for rent. Since he doesn't want to do this. Then only my half of the rent, they still need to pay electricity and hours of service for his half of the rent, starting Oct 1st. AITA?",0.15
"WIBTA if I dropped from being MoH at my friend's wedding? So this is something I've been feeling conflicted about for a few weeks now and want some outside opinions.

We brought up what the plan was for me and planned on dress pants and shoes with a long sleeved button-up shirt and vest, possibly a tie too. I was ecstatic about it as I felt like that was a very ""me"" outfit and it was a look I've been wanting to try out for awhile but never had a reason to buy. She agreed and that was that.

Today I suddenly got a text from her about the wedding outfit. She restated that she didn't care what I wore to the wedding, but her parents (more so her mom from what it seemed like?) really wanted everyone (bridesmaids) to wear dresses. She says it's really important to her mom and that she wants to respect her mom's wishes and would love to find a dress I would be comfortable wearing.

I impulsively and reluctantly agree out of guilt but then text her asking if I could think on it for a bit. She says ofc and we go about our day. I ended up talking to her later in person to explain why I don't like to wear dresses. I didn't want to try to give excuses, rather to give my perspective and how I feel. She understands and never really wanted to ask me to wear a dress. She did it out of pressure from parents since they're funding the wedding. I told her that if it is really that important to her parents that the MoH is in a dress then I'll step down if I cannot bring myself to wear a dress (which will probably happen). She says she understands and will talk to her parents about it. I get a message later saying it's set in stone.

I feel guilty if I were to step down over not wearing a dress, but I don't want to try and be someone who I'm not at her wedding. My brother recently got married and I got forced into a romper since that was the compromise I had with him and hated every second in it. I don't want to repeat that feeling.

I adore her family and want to respect their wishes. I get told by my parents that I can suck it up and be uncomfortable for a day, for a few hours, and to not make a big deal out of it (basically what happened at my brother's wedding), and that I'm just being stubborn and selfish for not thinking about my friend (who said they didn't even care in the first place). Am I in the right to stand my ground with my boundaries, or WIBTA to step down over a dress?",0.05
"AITA for going to a concert the same night as of my sisters birthday? My sister is a very chill person until it comes to her birthday. Whenever her birthday is literally a month away she acts like the apocalypse is happening and just turns into a selfish brat to make sure everything goes her way.

Well 2 months was her birthday and the same night Madison Beer, one of my favorite singers. Was coming to my city and my friends already bought me a ticket to come with them. Obviously my sister was pissed at this and even yelled at my parents to force me to not go. But, my friends already paid for the tickets and my parents didn't like wasting other people's money so they let me go.

I was having the time of my life that night until I got home. My sister screamed at me and said I ruined her birthday party I felt bad at first but then I realized I just taught her that not everything will go her way. So I went back into my room and had the best sleep of my LIFE.

Like I said its been 2 months since then and she's still holding a grudge against me but I really don't care. AITA?",0.05
"AITA for what I said to my brother after he was a dick to me? I (24F) am living at home for the summer until school starts back up in two weeks. It’s already been a long summer with the fighting between my mom and I, but it got worse tonight after my brother (22M) showed up unexpectedly. My brother moved back in with my dad to stay with him until he started training for his new job. Idk what happened, but he packed all his stuff in the middle of the night last week and drove back to my mom’s (literally west coast to east coast). He didn’t tell anyone he was leaving and didn’t ask my mom if he could come back until he was already on the road. So she had no other choice but to say yes.

After a couple of days he got here today. Everyone was happy to see him, and I was too, but I am mad at him over a few things (another story for another time). He had to take the bonus room since I’m still in the guest room (again, unexpected visit). He got all his stuff up there, brought his dog and cat in, and then told me he was going to lay down upstairs. He told his dog to behave, then went upstairs and “laid down” (he was actually setting up his gaming pc), leaving me to deal with his dog. 

I have nothing against his dog. He’s sweet and very playful, but also very energetic. He was wanting to play and jump around with/on my mom’s two dogs, and they weren’t having it so it was a lot of barking. I was watching my other brother (8M) for the night while my mom and stepdad went out. We were trying to watch a movie and we couldn’t even do that because of the dogs barking. I kept yelling at his dog to stop and he wasn’t listening. My brother (22M) comes downstairs and leaves without saying anything. I ask where he went and he replies “can I not go to the store for 5 mins?”. He came back either fast food so clearly he didn’t go there. I was pissed that he was just leaving his dog for me to deal with while I was clearly watching our brother.

My brother (22M) went back upstairs (w/o his dog) while I was still dealing with all of them. I kept yelling at his dog, and then my brother comes downstairs and tells me to stop yelling at him and “treating him like a mutt” (ironic because he’s yelled at and called his dog a mutt when he misbehaves). I got mad and told him maybe he should, idk, take care of his own fucking dog and not expect me to do it. We got into it, and it ended with him taking his dog upstairs (and acting pissy about it) and him calling me a bitch. I told my mom and she didn’t say anything except to stop fighting.

 I texted him a few hours ago telling him to please not call me that again and if he’d like we can switch places to where he can watch our brother and try to deal with three dogs and two cats that hate being around each other while I go “lay down”. He read it and didn’t respond. I feel kinda bad about my response, but I felt like it was warranted. He’s been saying he’s so tired from driving for 4 days, but imo he made that choice himself and it’s not like my dad kicked him out. So, AITA?

"AITA for replying rudely to my friend after she gave me packing advice?  
My friend came over while I was getting ready for a walk. I had a pile of items I needed to pack into my bag, I grabbed my purse to get started. My friend then chimed in with, “Oooooo, big things first,” trying to give me packing advice.

 I told her that I’ve packed a bag before and continued with what I was doing. 

She responded with, “I’m just trying to help,” and seemed quite short with me after that. 

While I don’t mind someone giving advice to try and help someone I felt her advice was unnecessary and a bit patronizing.

"AITA for snapping at my MIL about constantly helping her move stuff My in-laws are generally nice people, but my MIL can be sometimes unbearable. They’re in their late 60s. FIL is at times injured with nothing in particular. 

She’s got painful opinions, likes to blame my generation for things as old people do, but the thing is, she can’t sit still.

She’s always got a plan. A new project. A new vision. It always involves changing something for little to no reason. She’s never happy in general, so it’s a byproduct.

She’s moved many times in the past few decades because of bad financial decisions. I’ve helped each time, no problem.

But lately, every time we go see them, there’s an assignment. Move air conditioners. Move heavy boxes and tables. There’s always something.

My wife asks me if I’d like to go see them this weekend. We have a 3 week old newborn. It’s been a long few weeks.

I said sure. Sounds good. They live an hour away. That’s all right?

No.

My wife then mentions a day later that they need help moving things from one studio to another. Apparently they hired help but the hired help was cheap and they couldn’t do all of it. Heavy stuff up and down stairs. It’s not exactly urgent but needs to be done at some point. My BIL also has a newborn at home but lives further away.

I was pissed. When we got there, we first had lunch, and MIL asked how newborn adventure was going. I was fuming in my head still and just said

“It’s really tough MIL, She’s not sleeping well, wife and I are exhausted, and the last thing I wanted to do was take a road trip with the baby and help you move stuff. Normally it’s fine, but this isn’t really the best time to lump in a baby visit with one of these moving projects. I’d rather pay someone to do it for you, it’s a little bit annoying”

And of course, this started a problem. I got accused of not being “family minded” and that this is “part of being part of a family” and all this guilt trip stuff.

I’m not buying it. As nice as she is sometimes, this particular issue is constant, and with a newborn at home, I feel SHE is being disingenuous about family.

They wanted to go hiking to a waterfall then camp out somewhere overnight. I was really excited to go until my bf said he couldn’t make it because he was dog sitting. some backstory, my bf introduced me to the soon-to-be birthday boy and his best friend who are both in the group. It felt wrong of me to go on an overnight trip for HIS best friend without him. Im definitely comfortable with them and consider them friends, but not close enough for an overnight trip somewhere.

I told her that i really do want to come but i don’t want to sleep overnight unless he is there because i wouldn’t feel safe without him. Then the others were trying to convince me to convince him to come.

"WIBTA if I asked my uncle to rent me his old condo for not even half its market value? Let me start off by saying my uncle is a multimillionaire the condo is *completely* paid off and he only pays the bills for it. It’s also right next to the college I’m going to go to. Like I could bike there and not have to worry. He bought 20 acres and is talking to contractors about building himself a mansion and asked my aunt if she wanted to move in to his old condo.She doesn’t want it and asked if I wanted it. I do. 

The thing is with school starting up my hours are going to get cut to just 36. Meaning I’ll only make 2,200 a month. Even an $800 a month would be cutting so insanely close to poverty it wouldn’t be feasible with other bills and obligations. Would it be rude to ask if he’d be willing to rent it out to me for $500? Is that too much to ask? We’re not that close but he’s always been nice to me.

"AITA for not being happy enough and not wanting to go anywhere with my bf Prefacing this to say I have emotional / mental health issues. I'm very negative and depressing. I'd love to not be but I can't be chipper when I'm constantly being talked down to, berated, yelled at, treated differently etc. 

We ""went out"" yesterday. I haven't been outside in over a year because it always goes like this. he yelled at / lectured me the entire time, we drove there and left immediately so it was a complete waste of the day. It was awful.

He always does this. Gets my hopes up about going out, talks about it like we've made plans, then later acts like he never said that and that I'm holding him to unfair standards.
I tell him I dont want to go. I don't want to go anywhere with someone constantly angry with me and I don't want to fight or be lectured in the store. I don't want any gifts from someone that is going to just use it against me later and call me ungrateful or that will be the reason we are without food for the week because he's dishonest and prideful about how much money he has.

But he doesn't take no for an answer, berates me the whole way there, brings up several situations in which he claims that I've screwed him over (but it was actually him that took all my money and ran up my credit card to 10k and it went to collections) but apparently that was my fault too. He loves bring this up randomly and then patting himself on the back like he's won the argument even though I've only stopped talking because he refuses to admit what actually happened or what was actually said. This is the case for many things in which he starts to call me a liar bcus we have completely different memories of conversations and events.

Then he's angry at me in the store because I'm not happy to be there and I don't want to look at anything. I can't even comprehend what's on the shelves & he's still snarling and glaring at me. 

So we leave, he's still berating me the whole way back about how I ruin everything with my attitude and behavior. 

He leaves and goes off to his basketball games and to get the kids that have been out all day (the place he was at earlier before he realized I was at home waiting to go somewhere as we had planned... )
and of course now is talking about how we will go out next weekend. 

I really don't even want to bother, he always dangles things in my face, gifts or rewards or future plans and they never happen and are usually used as a means to yell at me for something.",0.75
"AITA for refusing to help my friend financially even though I can afford it? 
TL;DR A friend asked me for $4.5K due to financial struggles, but I refused because my parents taught me financial responsibility, I worry it might strain our friendship, and I don’t feel responsible for her financial issues. She called me selfish and uncaring.


Context - I (20M) am a college student in the US, coming from a wealthy family overseas. Recently, a close friend S (20F) has been struggling financially as she had to pay unexpected medical bills for her family and has asked me for help.


She knows my family is well-off and assumed that it wouldn’t be a big deal for me to lend her some money (around $4500).


Here’s the thing - while I do have access to a considerable amount of money, I don’t feel comfortable giving away that much money. Growing up, I was taught the importance of financial responsibility. My family’s money is for my education and living expenses, and not for me to be giving it away.


Additionally, I am also worried about the potential impact on our friendship, as I’ve had similar situations ruin previous relationships. I don’t want her to feel jealous or pressured by the debt, especially if she has trouble pay it back (I don’t need her to - but she insists).


I also feel as it’s not my responsibility to bail her out. I feel bad for her situation, but I don’t think it’s fair for her to rely on me just because she knows I have the means.


Although I explained all this to her, she got very upset and called me selfish. She said “true friends” help each other in challenging times and that I am showing my “true colours” by refusing to help.


I am starting to feel a little conflicted and guilty, so I’m thinking of going to my parents about this after reading some of your advice here. AITA?


Update: After much consideration and reading through the advice here, I decided to formally end my friendship with S. I realized that our values and expectations in a friendship are fundamentally different, and her reaction to my refusal reinforced my concerns about the potential strain on our relationship.

"AITA for calling my sister's boss her ""sugar daddy""? So, I (32F) have one older sister (35F) who works for a mid-size business in our city. The business is owned by one of her old schoolfriends (36M) and she has been working there on-and-off for the past ten years. Her role is pretty much being an assistant to her boss. She picks up his laundry, orders his groceries, feeds his cat, etc.

By her own admission, she doesn't work very hard. But she still gets a good salary and benefits, like health insurance and travel fares. Because of this, she has no real interest in developing a career and is happy to stay where she is for as long as she can. There have been times over the past ten years where the business has let her go due to budget cuts, and she usually just stays with our parents rent-free until the company can afford to take her on again.

I am in a different field (medicine) that requires me to work very long hours for an okay salary. I don't make much more than my sister and I don't get nearly as many benefits. My sister sometimes receives bonuses too, if the company has scored a big project, or sometimes her boss will fly her abroad with him for a conference. She receives gifts from him if he travels without her. He got her an iPad Pro the last time he left the country.

She does like to brag a little bit when he spends money on her but as far as I know, nothing inappropriate has ever happened between them. They're just good friends. He is married with two kids and his wife is pregnant again.

My family met up for a Sunday dinner recently, which was cooked by my sister. During the dinner, my sister casually told us that her boss/friend is now paying for her to go back to art school and do a master's degree. He will continue to pay her full salary while she studies, as long as she can still run errands for him between her classes. She asked me if I would ever consider going back to school to study, seeing as I'm ""so unhappy"" with my current level of pay.

I couldn't help it, something in me just snapped. I told her that we weren't all so lucky to have a sugar daddy footing our bills, some of us actually have to work for our money. My sister immediately became hysterical, asking me how I could throw such ""accusations"" in her face. I realised too late that she thought I was implying a sexual relationship between her and her boss, but by the time I had worked that out, she had already slammed her bedroom door and wouldn't talk to me for the rest of the night. I left and I haven't spoken to her since.

"WIBTA if I say no to my kids going on a cruise with my ex? My ex and I have 50/50 custody of our kids (13,8,5). He makes more than me with his new wife so they take the kids on vacations fairly often, which I don’t have an issue with.

The problem is he doesn’t follow our agreed rules in the parenting plan. 

We are allowed two weeks of vacation per year, and only one day can be missed school unless the other parent agrees to more missed school. If we can’t agree then I have full authority to veto in even and him in odd.

Last year he would never tell me until last minute, and they would miss *days* of school. He’s required to tell me 30 days before with itinerary of what they are doing/ where.

The kids missed over 15 days of school last year and the majority were his vacation days. The school was sending out letters about it.

This year, school starts on the 14th of August. He has planned a cruise for the 28th til the 7th. 

Once again he planned and paid for this without saying anything about the missed school. He told me about a week or two ago it was a cruise because the oldest is not technically his so he needs a note saying she can go

I’ve been thinking it over and I’m not okay with them missing seven days of school for a cruise they could have taken during breaks or summmer vacation.

"AITA for hanging out with my friends distancing friend? I have never posted before so bear with me please.

I 32 (F) have a friend 36 (F) who honestly is upset with me because I went to target with someone she was once / still kind of is friend with. Some background, let’s call my friend that is upset Lisa and the other person is question Donna.

Lisa and Donna have been friends for a few years and would even say best friends there for awhile. Lisa is getting married this year and Donna had a prior engagement so she will not be able to attend, at that point is when it all started going downhill. Keep in mind most of this is one sided as I got my information from Lisa. Since the unattending of the wedding moment Lisa has been very upset with the fact that she wouldn’t drop everything to be at the wedding and started to really talk bad on Donna. I don’t know their friendship like that but I was being fed that Donna was not inviting her to things, talking shit about her, etc etc. 

Meanwhile Lisa is still inviting her to things, bday parties, movies, the bachelorette. I am trying to be as supportive as possible but for me if someone ain’t worthy of my friendship then they aren’t my friend anymore, period. So it was weird to still see them hang and have Donna come around. I am not as close with Donna but for the sake of this next part we have hung out together, she has been invited to my events.  I would consider us acquaint friends. 

Well this last Friday we were all at Lisa’s birthday dinner and Donna and I happened to be sitting next to each other.  Obviously we started talking as it would be awkward as shit if we don’t and kind of just caught up. We are the more outgoing of the group so it’s easy for us to shoot the shit and have a good time. While we were there she mentioned she wanted to go shopping and I piped up that my week was rough and retail therapy could be fun. Nothing else was said but as we were leaving Donna asked if I wanted to meet her to go to a store and I said yes.
Come to this morning and I am somehow having a real discussion with Lisa about how I was “catching up like best friends” and “hangover 1 v 1” that it’s  contradictory of me since I am been at Lisa’s side. 

This is my honest take but this is why I am here because maybe I am missing something. For me, it was literally just letting off steam with someone I knew. It’s not like we are now bff or we are talking shit. I am in my 30s not middle school so idk how I am feeling guilty for hanging out with another person.  Yes, they have been drifting apart but Donna keeps coming around and we are going to continue to see each other. It almost feels like instead Lisa is trying to control the friendship? But idk why.

Am I the asshole here? Maybe I needed to be more mindful of her feelings but it all feels so juvenile to me.  ",0.03
"AITA for asking my friend to pay for our dinner I have this friend for a long time (20 years). We frequently go out together. Since I earn more, I almost always paid the resturant bills myself. This has been the case for 2-3 years. Even we go out with my vehicle always, he never pays for gas also.
But now a days, I'm struggling with my expenses, so the other day when he asked me to go out, I told him to bring his vehicle and he refused and kept on saying that I'm being selfish. But he eventually agreed to go. And now after our dinner, I found out that I don't have enough cash ( it could cover the bill but I always like to keep some extra cash ). So I asked him to pay the bill bill ( and I'll pay him later ) or split the bill.

"AITA for giving my dad my headphones without telling him why Using a throw away account that I made by accident a while ago.

This is probably such a non issue but I feel bad about it. I'm 21M and autistic. A while ago I was on a road trip while my dad was driving. At one point he put on a podcast. I don't mind listening, but podcasts are hard for me to follow because of all the talking and get overwhelming, plus he's a bit deaf so he has the volume up high. I didn't want to force him to turn it off, so I tried everything to block it out, putting on my headphones, covering my ears, even putting my jacket on my head, unfortunately it didn't work. Finally I offered him my headphones instead, thinking this way he can use them to listen and I don't have to hear it. Instead he threw them back at me and turned the radio off, and seemed mad for the rest of the trip. I felt really bad about this because I never meant that he had to stop listening to his podcast.

Usually I'm very direct (my dad actually hates this) but this time I wasn't feeling good and didn't have an easy time speaking. The one time we met with the psychiatrist who diagnosed me, my dad was very supporting and spoke as though he does an amazing job and accomodates for me all the time, but in reality he usually only does things once or twice and stops. I have asked him to turn down the volume on the tv, etc, before, but he usually acts upset about it so I try not to ask too often anymore. However I was scared to embarrass him in front of the doctor, so I didn't say anything. It kind of bothered me that the doctor thinks we're doing great when we aren't so much though.

The reason I think I might be the asshole is because I know that it's passive aggressive to not say exactly what you mean, and I didn't say anything, just offered him the headphones. I definitely try not to expect people to read my mind. Whenever I ask my dad to adjust his behaviors, he acts put-upon like it's a big favor, so I'm worried that I'm being too demanding and not working hard enough to deal with my intolerances.

Edit: A lot of people are telling me it's not a good idea for drivers to wear headphones. I didn't know that, thanks for letting me know! As for my behaviors, I did exactly what I wrote, nothing more or less. I guess trying to muffle my hearing could be interpreted as passive aggressive, but I wasn't intentionally trying to communicate anything by it. Thank you :)",0.79

From its sexism to all its rules, it has restricted me and hurt me and brought me and all the people who live in this country nothing but suffering. It's not just a belief system.

"AITA for leaving with my best friend after my girlfriend insulted her? I (29M) have a girlfriend “Cathy”, (26F) and a best friend “Ava” (28F). To clarify, my girlfriend is really good friends with my best friend and she’s more than fine with our friendship.

Ava and I have been best friends since we were kids, I grew up poor and she was rich so she always made sure I ate and had a place to sleep– this girl is pretty much the reason I’m where I am currently. 

Even though I’ve got a job now, and try to offer to treat her she insists on paying and won’t let me pay her back. It’s her thing, I gave up trying and I’ve seen her do with our entire friend group so we just take it as a fun quirk of hers.

Cathy is pretty much the love of my life, I want to spend the rest of my life with her, so what I did was incredibly tough. The three of us and Ava’s boyfriend had gone out to eat. 

He had to leave early so didn’t pay (Ava said she was going to pay). Then, in true Ava fashion she went to the front desk under the pretext of going to washroom and paid the bill.

Obviously I tried my “let me pay you back, why’d you pay” things but she wouldn’t hear it.

Then, out of nowhere, my girlfriend accuses her of implying that she’s poor. Cathy said, “Listen I know you like to pay but I’m a fucking adult I don’t need you to pay for my meals like I’m a child.”

Ava seemed shocked and apologised. I was shocked too because Cathy doesn’t ever act like this and has always been fine with Ava paying.

I took her to the side and Cathy said “I don’t care if she’s your best friend she’s making me look pathetic.” She proceeded to insult her looks and her religion.

I got angry, because Ava was genuinely just a sweet person. I told her maybe she needed time to cool off, and walked out with Ava.

I called her an Uber and then drove back home myself. 

(Cathy has her own car so could take herself, she had not been drinking either)

When Cathy came home we fought because I “left with her”. 

Honestly I don’t know what’s going on. AITA? and please help me on how to avoid such situations in the future. ",0.29
"AITA for trying to limit the time GF spends with her parents/siblings/relatives because it negatively impacts her life? I (M35) am together with GF(32) - we are living together since 5 years. I have a full time job. GF has a part time job and is still working on her Bachelors degree which she hasnt completed in 8 years. The main reason for this is that she spends far too much time with her parents/sister/relatives. All of them live within a 5 Mile radius from us.

She calls her sister/parents every day and speaks 30 Minutes+ with each of them. On top of that she visits her sister/parents/relatives like 5-10x a month. Each time half a day or entire day. As a result she barely gets anything done. A Bachelor degree she should have completed in 4 years tops is only 2/3 done after 8 years.

Our appartment is quite dirty because she doesnt clean much - because she has to spend so much time talking/visiting her relatives. I clean myself but since I have a full time job and a family further away which I visit once a month - I cant do it all by myself.

Im afraid for her future - and told her that she should reduce the number of visits to save time she could invest into finishing her education - and getting a full time job. I told her that seeing her sister/parents twice a month and her more distant relatives once every two months is still enough and it would free her like a week of extra time every month. She talks to them every day for half an hour anyways.

She freaked out and treated me like an abuser that wants to control her life. AITA for wanting  her to prioritize her time and for thinking that this amount of time spent with her family is negatively impacting her life?",0.2
"AITA to not wanting to hijack my BIL's honeymoon alongsoie my wife ? I (28M) have been married to my wife (27F) for 2 years now. Financially we've both been struggling a bit in the past years, but our situation is mostly fine now, even tho we still live a relatively modest life and we can't afford to casually go to expensive trips in other countries. Even our honeymoon was ""only"" a trip to a beach from our country where we've been already and even that costed us quite a lot.

My wife's older brother (33M) is definitely much wealthier than us and is known for spoiling his now fiancee (30F) with gifts and expensive trips. My wife definitely commented a couple of times on it and I could feel she was secretly jealous about it. She and her brother are definitely very close to each other and he helped us quite a bit during the times we were struggling financially and he even allowed her to be a bridesmaid at his his wedding (even tho my wife and my BIL's fiancee aren't really close). 

Yesterday my BIL announced in front of their family that he wants to reward his sister for putting so much effort into planning his wedding by full on paying for both of us to go together with him and his fiance on their honeymoon in Paris for a full week. Before I could say anything my wife immediately accepted it and hugged her brother, but then his fiancee started going at him about inviting us to their honeymoon without discussing it with her beforehand and my BIL defended hinself by saying he just wanted to help his sister experience something she can't do on her own. 

They were arguing when my wife suddenly intervened and told his brother's fiance to stop acting like such an entitled brat cause not everyone's as lucky as her to have a wealthy enough partner to support them. BIL's  fiance started yelling at my wife about how she's just a leech to her brother who took over her wedding and now wants to invade her honeymoon too. I eventually got my wife out of there and on the way out I told her that maybe it'd be better for us to refuse going on my BIL's honeymoon as his fiance's clearly uncomfortable with it. She asked me if I was an idiot for wanting to pass up a trip to Paris for free, that she worked way too hard to convince her brother to invite us for her to back up from it now. I told her that maybe she can arrange something else for us and I don't want to be the reason a marriage falls apart, but my wife told me their marriage is not our business but theirs and if it falls apart it'd be only my BIL's fiance's fault. 

I told my wife I want no part in this and I won't be going on this ""shared honeymoon"" and she started arguing with me about how she can't believe I'll act this way when she only did this for us and said that she'll take her brother's offer without me if she has to. We ended up sleeping in different beds and even today's my wife's still giving me the cold shoulder.

"AITA Repaired my Baby with no medical knowledge. Wifes BFF think i should have gone to ER While playing with my (first child) son (18 month old) he pulled his elbow. or i did. its a little hard to tell, basically i had his hand in my hand and he went into a different direction. there was a crunch noise and he started screaming. 

First step was cooling with a cool pad and cuddling with his mother, while i researched what happened and what steps to do. there was no bruising or swelling, but he had pain and discomfort. 

a short google search resulted that it was most probably a luxation or subluxation of the radial head on the elbow. a very common injury in toddlers which gained the byname ""sundays-"" or ""nanny elbow"" due to the commonness while playing. i watched a short video on how a doctor would treat it, but surprisingly it was very easy to handle, just a brief rotation of the arm while holding the elbow.   
i suggested that i could try that, i was farely certain i could do that, it would hurt for a moment, but than get better quickly. she was ok with it. 

so i sat my son up, grabed his hand gentle and rotated until i heard a click. he cried, but immediatly after stopped. and started playing, with his arm in full motion again after a few minutes. my son happy, my wife proud of her handy husband, and me happy it wasnt something serious i grabbed a beer, while the two went to bed. 

now is where the AITA part comes in.   
my wife told her friends and her BFF the whole story, that it did something, she doenst really know what, but it fixes it immediatly, and she is happy and proud.   
her friends gave her fire.  
only trained medical professionals should do that, that was a medical operation i am not trained to do (which is true, i am an office wage slave) and i could seriously hurt him, what if it was a serious injury, my action could have worsened it. 

i dont say they are wrong. but i had a screaming toddler, i was pretty certain i was right, and i didnt wanted to burden the ER with stuff like that. obviously if his arm would have hurt in the morning still we would have went to the childs doctor. but he has no ill symptoms and is not spareing his arm or something. 

are my wifes friends overracting, or am i to careless. Am i the asshole here?

"AITA for not supporting my husband's fan fiction? My husband has been dedicating a lot of time to a fan fiction project he's working on. On the surface, I have no issue with this. Fan fiction isn't really my jam, but we all get to have hobbies that fulfill and engage us.

However, there are a few extenuating circumstances around this project that are eroding my ability to be supportive and mirror his enthusiasm.

1. Conflict with other priorities: A few months ago, my husband and I agreed that we would be making a long-distance move in order to be close to family again. Step one is him finding a new job, but he’s barely tried. I feel salty that he made this huge commitment and then immediately ran from it into a new and time-consuming hobby.
2. The unrealistic expectations around the fan fiction itself: My husband intends to turn what he has written (probably a 50 or so page synopsis) into a screenplay that he is convinced will turn out to be about 300 pages. Here's the kicker: I work in the film industry. I know firsthand that a 300-page screenplay based on IP that the writer doesn't even own is dead on arrival. Like deader than dead. He claims he's aware of this too, but he still simultaneously harbors a fantasy that somehow, some way \*his\* script will be good enough to get made. I truly don't understand why doesn't just turn what he's got into some short stories and post it on Wattpad or elsewhere. 
3. General escapism: He's openly unhappy with his life and says that writing the fan fiction is one of the only things making him happy these days. He especially despises his job, even though he only works 12-18 hours per week. So the fact that he has this constant stream of life complaints but isn't trying to actually address any of them, and instead is burrowing deep inside a fantasy world of his own creation is... unsettling, to say the least.

Basically, fan fiction is all he wants to talk about, and, more importantly, it's all he wants to do. I feel so fucking let down, and I finally lost it on him last night when he commented proudly ""I can't believe I wrote a 300 page screenplay in just a few months!"" All I could think was a) no you absolutely did not, you wrote a synopsis, b) a 300 page screenplay is a failure in my line of work, not an achievement, and c) all of that came at the expense of our shared commitments to one another. So I scoffed, he demanded an explanation for why I'm so negative/defensive about this thing, and I told him:

\*It's not real. It has no future, certainly not the future that you're losing yourself in. Stop asking me to treat it like it's real. Stop prioritizing it over work, bills, moving, building a life that you actually like. For the love of god, please treat this hobby like a hobby and stop making it the center of our shared universe.\*

And you know what, on some level, I do think saying that makes me an asshole to some degree. But when I step back and look at the bigger picture, I can't help but wonder what the hell else I'm supposed to say or do?

"AITA for staying with my ex girlfriend for 3 years after breaking up?  I (M23) have been dating my ex (F43) for around 2 years and in total been with her for 3 years. 

In the first year it was smooth sailing and everything was good, texting each other everyday every hour and checking up on each other. She would bring me lunch to eat, cooked by herself. And after 3 months we had intercourse, with protection but after the 3rd time she wanted to do it without protection. 

This is where the problems started, I would have pregnancy scares that would plague my mind and I'd do endless amount of research and learn about whens the best time to have sex and what days are optimal. But it never worked in my favor. 

So the reason she didn't want me to wear protection is because it did not feel good at all to her, and it felt like I was using her. Eventually I caved in and tried to hold it in but I could not last more than 2 min embarrassing as it sounds. Nonetheless she still enjoyed it as she would get herself off first then id get off. Everytime this happened I didn't enjoy it until the end because I was fearing getting her pregnant. 

I have on multiple occasions and pleaded but I'm a people pleaser. She would get extremely angry and say we don't have to have sex ever again. Then when things cool down she would make her advances and I would cave in. Keep in mind we are still texting everyday to this day. 

I understand she's getting older and wants a baby, but I am not ready for one. I don't even got my life in order and still living with my parents.
So in the first year of dating, I called it off and said we should break up. 

What ends up happening is this routine we've been doing that she gets me to have sex with her and she always kisses me before I head back home. This has been going on for 3 years till now. 

So in total I keep telling her the relationship is off for around 5 times now. But it keeps ending up like this. 

Before you say break it off completely and block, I can't block someone that has been with me for 3 years thats bonded so close all for me to click the off switch on them and disappear forever. And if I tell her not to text me, she would reach out eventually.",0.39
"AITA for not going to dinner at my in-laws?  My fiance (22M) and I (21F) currently live in one of my in-laws rental properties about a quarter mile walk from their own home. When we moved out of their home to this property, they said they would like to do dinner once a week. The problem is that they want to do dinner on the weekends. We both work full time jobs and have a side job we do for a half a day on Saturday or sunday. Because of working and commute time we only have time to do chores and grocery shopping on the weekends. 

For context, we both wake up at 5:15ish, I leave for work at 5:45, he leaves for work at 7:30 and we don't get home until 5:30, have to make dinner, take care of our cats (which he does in the mornings before work) and do other daily chores like the dishes and laundry. We normally go to bed around 9. On the weekends, we have to do our second job, grocery shop, do nail clips for the cats (11F and 5moF), meal prep for the week (Breakfast and Lunches), vacuum the house, mop, bathrooms, change litter boxes, check oil and we like to do a date night Saturday nights. When we lived with them, we would do family dinners on Sundays. My fiance's younger brother (20M) would routinely not show up to these claiming to be busy with other things. The other issue is that the dinners can be anywhere from 3-7. 

My in-laws do not plan things well. They will tell us about dinner plans the day of, do not tell us when dinner will be and expect us to drop everything when they text us that dinner is ready. We have asked them to let us know at least two days ahead of time to let us know what day and time dinner will be. They have not done this so we have not been going to dinner because we have been busy and have assumed there are no plans because they have not given us warning. While we could have assumed that there would be dinners on Sundays, we have told them that weekends don't work for us because it is our only time to do most things. This is our first time setting a boundary with them and my FIL called my fiance earlier today when we told them we couldn't make it to the dinner we didn't know about til this morning and was incredibly mad we haven't been to dinner even though they have not given us a heads up for about three weeks since we first set this boundary. 

We have been spending more time with my family, which could be part of the problem of them being angry with us, but my family asks us to do things at least four days in advance and has never thrown a hissy fit about us not being able to make it to their events. They also live a half an hour drive away and we do not have time to go see them during the week days while we can easily walk a few minutes to see my in laws.

"AITA? I’m starting to dislike my boyfriend’s daughter. So I (25F) have been with my boyfriend (27M) for coming up 3 years now. When we first met his daughter was only 2 and was the sweetest girl. Her mom isn’t around much. She lives with us 90% of the time and his parents only live a couple of blocks away so help out as much as they can. 
When we first met I noticed she didn’t have very good manners but put it down to her only being 2. Yet as time passed I have noticed more and more. I do believe most of this is due to her being mommy coddled and not told no. For example, if she decides she doesn’t want to feed herself (nearly every meal time) he will spoon feed her. She is 5 1/2 years old. If she decides she can’t dress herself (most mornings and evenings) he will dress her. But it is to the point where she is at school and doesn’t know how to put her clothes on properly or write her own name. If she wants something she isn’t meant to have a tantrum will happen and he will pander to her instantly.  
My boyfriend’s mom mommy coddles her a lot too and his daughter is horrible to her, shouts at her, hits her, doesn’t allow his mom to speak etc but both my bf and his mom allow this to happen and laugh thinking it’s cute.  
I have took on a lot of responsibility when I got into a relationship with him and I knew what I was getting myself into but as time passes it’s getting out of control. When she and I are alone and I’m taking care of her, which is a few times per week, she is lovely, calm, no attitude, polite and never complains but the second her dad walks into the house from work she changes and becomes horrible to me. She moans, cries, throws tantrums, complains, refuses to do anything for herself, gives me the most awful looks, blames me for things I haven’t done plus so much more. If anyone gets her anything she is so ungrateful and expects more or expresses how something isn’t good enough or that she wanted something different. 
I have tried speaking to my boyfriend but he thinks it’s funny and that all of it doesn’t matter because she is only young. I do understand that she is young but even her teachers have said that she is a bit delayed because of how stubborn she is. 
Tonight I had enough and told him that she has a horrible attitude and all of the “cuteness” doesn’t matter because the behaviour ruins it all. Well as you can imagine he blew up with me. Called me many names and made it very clear that she will come before anyone else, which I understand and don’t disagree with but he lets her walk all over everyone around her and doesn’t give her consequences to her actions. He got extremely personal bringing up my ASD, depression, family issues with my family, my appearance etc all because I said his daughter’s attitude was horrible. 
I have been wanting to start a family with this man and I’m starting to consider if this is really what I want my children to grow up to be.

"AITA for not listening to other people during D&D games?  I recently just started playing Dungeons and Dragons and learned about meta gaming. For anyone who doesn’t know, and to my best understanding, meta gaming is basically making personal choices based on information your character wouldn’t *actually* know. 

For example, If someone in your party had something happen to them while your character wasn’t around, but you as a player hear the story unfold through the other player and the dungeon master, you can’t make decisions with your character based off of that information. That would be meta gaming.

Anyway- long story short, in order for me to not meta game, I simple don’t listen to anyone at the table when my character isn’t in the scene. It’s not that I don’t care, but it’s easier for me to not meta game when I literally don’t know anything. Whenever the dungeon master is doing his thing of course I tune in, but otherwise, I’m out. Sometimes I scroll my phone but most of the time I’m reading up on my moves and character bc I don’t wanna make a fool of myself when it’s my turn since I’m playing with experienced people. 

Theres six of us all together, the DM and 5 players. Three people really have a problem. They say I’m being disrespectful and that I clearly only care about myself. Whenever I do anything in the narrative for my character, they make remarks like “make sense” basically calling me selfish or whatever else the situation calls for. 

In my opinion, the game has been better for me as far as the story goes bc I genuinely am making blind decisions. They disagree and say it’s about table etiquette. 

My DM and one other player don’t care either way and my DM says we should all be able to play the way that works for us, but their snarky comments or talking loud when it’s their turn and my character isn’t around is kinda getting to me.

Idk if it’s just me or if getting the hang of not meta gaming is difficult as hell. Maybe I’m just stupid lmao 

AITA for not listening as a way to avoid the problem? Or do I need to swallow it and just listen to everything? 

Additionally, would I be the a*hole if I asked my DM to write me out of the game? Being hounded is making the game less fun for me. They also keep making decisions that are basically ways to bully my character in the game like not picking up extra supplies for me or bringing back food or whatever and then playing it off as something else.

I’m the one that wanted to get the party together to begin with so I feel like quitting would make everyone feel like it was a waste of time and then they would be proven right in a way that I am selfish.

What do you think? PLZ HELP. 


Edit: omg lmao okay Jesus I get it!!! Stop being mean to me! IM JUST AN AUTISTIC BABY!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

I just wanted everyone to have genuine authentic reactions to their stories and have things to reveal and for our time as a party to be a real time of role play and discovery but I realize that’s up to my DM to control that narrative in that way and the social aspect is more important than game mechanics.

"AITA for telling my (25F) husband (38M) he should’ve told this man he was married ?  Hi everyone. 

I am 25F and my husband is 38M. We have been together since I was 18 and he was 32. We’ve had a lot of issues within our marriage but that’s another story. 

Anyways. My husband works with another co worker, who is married with 3 kids. My husband said this man is unfaithful and constantly would engage in inappropriate behavior with customers or even staff at work. 

Today, he saw my husband and I drive by and called. He said he “saw us drive by” so he knew I was in the car obviously.


He started going on talking about how another married man up there (his wife actually works next door in the other building) was flirting with a new female coworker for hours every single day. He went on to say “this female was fine as hell. I mean she was fine as fuck”.

That’s fine. I can’t help how other men talk nor is that my husbands fault but the guy continued to go on and then proceeded to ask my husband *twice* if he had ever saw this “fine ass frmale”.

First of all, I felt this was very disrespectful how he was talking about the girl but also the fact he was asking a married man with his wife right next to him, about looking at another woman. 

My husband just laughed and said “no”. 

Once off the phone I told him it’s not his fault most all of the guys (from what my husband has told me) are engaging in affairs and cheating, but I didn’t appreciate him laughing along.

I told him I thought a more appropriate response would’ve been “no, I don’t do that type of thing, I’m married” or something along those lines and that probably would’ve shut all that down.

He said all these guys at work do is look at women, cheat, and lie.

"AITA for allowing my son to ground my kid? I \[33M, bisex\] have an 8yo from a previous marriage. We were married for 5 years, and we have our son at the last year of our marriage, that's when she \[33F\] changed; she started neglecting our child and she became a party girl, going so far as getting into drugs. After a few months of trying to fix everything, I left and got full custody. That was 7 years ago.

About 5 years now, I started dating a guy; he\[27M\] and my children get along pretty well. My kiddo understands he is my bf, and he calls him Uncle ""Jim"". He is like his confident, friend, and when my son is upset, he likes to talk to him. My bf moved in with us a year ago.

Well, my ex started to turn her life right about 2 years ago, and last year she got married and this year she gave birth to their new son. For the past two years, she has tried to reconnect with our son (she was absent all the time before). And now she is pretty much a good mother to him.

A few months ago, she asked me if she could have our son for a month or so, so he can bond with his brother. After consulting with our son and his therapist, I agreed, but on condition it was going to be after midterm.

She got my son last week, and yesterday I got a call from her saying that my son told her that my BF sometimes grounds him when he doesn't do his homework or when he doesn't behave at school (my bf usually is the one getting him at school, he WFH).

She got really really mad, started screaming and telling me that he has not the right to ground him since we are not married. I told her that first she knows in our country same sex marriage is not legal and second, he has been in my son’s life more time than her and I allowed him to ground my son until a few months ago, after he moved in with us, also he has never punished him far than that. Is just grounding without tv or videogames, or he has to do some chores when he doesn’t want to do his homework, that usually makes my son rather choosing the HW than the chores.

She kept yelling and calling me an asshole for allowing any other guy to punish our son. She kept saying a lot of stuffs. Her family started to reach out to me to complain too, and my parents (whom I don't have a good relationship with bc I'm bi) also joined the complaint.

"AITA for feeding my nephew chicken nuggets? I (18F) was looking after my nephew (6M) today as my sister (23F). My sister is an “almond mom” and very strict on what my nephew consumes, which I think is absolutely going to cause him eating disorders in the future. I don’t usually look after my nephew, this was a last-resort option as her usual chilcare was unavailable today.

Before dropping him off, she gave me his lunch and dinner and requested that I give him the meals she had cooked when he was hungry.

Around noon, I gave him his lunch, which he ate. However, when it came time for dinner, he didn’t want to eat the meal my sister had cooked for him as he dislikes vegetables. At this point, I was already very tired from looking after him for so long, didn’t have the energy to insist he eat something he didn’t like, and just threw some chicken nuggets in the microwave for him.

I didn’t intend on telling my sister this, but when she picked him up, he was excited to tell her about how good the chicken nuggets were and asked if they could buy some more. My sister didn’t say anything to me and told my nephew they’d go to the store and get some later, so I assumed she was fine with it.

However, she messaged me later than I was irresponsible and a jerk for feeding her child things that she didn’t approve. I argued that a few chicken nuggets wouldn’t kill him and that I didn't have the energy to argue with him about vegtables, but she insisted that he needed to have a balanced diet.",0.38
"AITA for not getting contact info from a friend after 3 yrs For some context, me and this friend have been friends for about three years,(we met at our towns local theatre group) and have had a great time together.

That is until recently it seems in the past year she had been dropping hints here or there, but i didn’t pick up on them.

"AITA Job options for both of us I’m a vet, no certs, no degree… have worked in construction or sales since I got out of the army (2015) was sole income while my wife got her degrees(B. Applied mathematics, Masters in data analytics) she has a good job(100k) does not like it and hasn’t for over a year. I’ve both not had a job while I renovated our home(full reno) and worked a sales job in the last 2 years. Was presented with an opportunity to go work out of state and make an equal income to her while also improving my skill as a high level finish carpenter. Right after I found out about this opportunity she reached out to an energy company through her brother and got an in to meet with an high level guy. He basically said he would create a job for her but that would require her to be out of state 3 weeks a month… which also means I can’t do my current job in sales that requires a night or two away from home a week. (9yo at the house) so for her to pursue this I need to quit and find part time work… if she stayed at her job I could pursue the out of state work. I understand this energy job could be huge career wise for her so I have been nothing but supportive… but after encouraging her to find something new for over a year I feel like she’s being selfish by taking on this new roll… and it’s a maybe vs my guaranteed job with almost triple pay for me.

"AITA for trying to put the birthday boy and his wife in the center of a group of 14? On Saturday, my family and I gathered for dinner to celebrate my brother’s 34th birthday. We were a party of 14. Key members include myself (45f), my bro (34m) and his wife (28ish?f) [let’s call them George and Mary], my mom (70f) and her husband, and three of my kids (17-23). It may be worth noting that George & Mary were married at the start of January, and there is somewhat relevant backstory that I will include in a comment should anyone wish more info.

When I arrived, there were 3 people there; I came with 4 people including myself. The table was a single long rectangle, which means that whoever sat at the end would not be able to converse with the folks at the other end. Usually that was the last people to arrive; George, Mary, my mom, and their parties had not yet arrived. (Our adult stepbrother arrived between the two parties.)

I immediately suggested rearranging seating so that George and Mary would be in the center of the group, so everyone could chat with them. The people already there agreed, and my husband and two of my children, who had already sat down, started moving.

While we were shuffling seats, George and Mary arrived. I tried to wave them to the middle of the table and was blown off. Then Mary mentioned that my mom wanted to sit next to George. My mom was already 20 minutes late; we usually tell her that we are doing something half an hour before we do it  because she is consistently 30 minutes late. I said, “well she should have arrived on time.”

I later clarified with Mary that what she had said was that my mom was the one who wanted to sit next to George, not her mom and not that George wanted to sit next to our mom. 

We were all finished and leaving by 6.

Everything seemed fine until 11 last night, when I got a 5 paragraph text from Mary. She said she wanted to have a “conversation” “as it’s important to me to address things directly when they arise.” She brought up the sour grapes from her wedding dinner (no assigned seating), when she accused me of “took it upon myself to orchestrate those seating arrangements…Unfortunately the same thing happened today” - I took it upon myself to orchestrate seating” without consulting with her. She told me this was unacceptable because “it’s vital that the focus remains on the person being celebrated and that their wishes are being respected.” At no point did George - who is very vocal - complain to me. 

I have not texted her back. Am I the asshole for trying to ensure the birthday boy and his wife were centered and accessible to everyone before 14 people sat down?",0.14
"AITA for not making my partner food when I made food? I originally thought this was no big deal but now I'm second-guessing myself.

Yesterday, my partner (23M) went out for dinner with his friend, and I (22F) had the idea of preparing some food for myself. I was thinking of making some sort of barbecue marinated tofu, and I mentioned something about how I would experiment with tofu or something like that while driving him to the restaurant, and that there might be an experiment waiting for him at home. He didn't seem very interested and responded fairly noncommittally, so I thought that if I made enough, I could set aside a portion for him whenever he got back, but since he didn't seem that interested, no big deal. 

The catch is: we're in the middle of moving, and some of the ingredients are at our other place. While stopping by there to grab what I needed, I ran into a mutual friend/roommate of ours who happened to also be hungry. They suggested coming back with me to the other place and having some food as well, and I had no problem with it, so I said sure.

We ended up cooking some BBQ tofu, nothing special. The food was ready right around when my partner called asking me to pick him and his friend up. In a hurry to meet them, our mutual friend and I just basically divvied what we made into two bowls, wrapped them up, and brought them with us. My partner didn't seem to care when they noticed the food we had.

After we got back home, while my partner was in the shower, I decided to make some food. On the drive back home, my partner had mentioned he wasn't hungry, so I figured I didn't need to ask, and cooked some plain pasta and added some jarred Pomodoro sauce to it.

When my partner saw the food, he asked me why I didn't ask him if he wanted some before starting to make the food. I replied that he said he wasn't hungry, but if he wanted, I could make more pasta. He said it was normal in his family to ask if someone wanted a portion before they started making something, and he was upset that I had made meals twice in the day without caring to ask or save some for him. He also said that when I had said ""there might be an experiment waiting for you when you get back"", he had assumed I would save a portion for him.

I thought he would not care since the first time, he was already out getting food with his friend, and the second time, he had said he wasn't hungry earlier. When I brought this up to him, his response was ""that was an hour ago!"" and he said I should have asked regardless. Admittedly, when he called to request a pickup, I was just focused on quickly packing up and getting to the car, and forgot in my haste to set aside a third portion.

At the start of this, I thought you didn't need to ask before making yourself food if others wanted any, but now I'm not really sure. I'm kind of terrible at telling how to behave in situations like this and the way I grew up certainly did not encourage asking about food like this. AITA? How do I make this right?

Edit: I didn’t expect this to blow up. I’ve been responding to comments and clarifying details so I figured I should edit to add some context and information:

- My partner was mad at me not for making the food itself, but mostly for not asking him if he wanted some before starting to make food both times. He said that it shows I didn’t think of him when making the food and that it was expected that I should ask him if he wants some. He claimed that I should have set aside a portion of the tofu for him because I had already told him about the “experiment”.

- He did not ask if I wanted anything from the restaurant, nor did he bring anything back. He also didn’t invite me because I’m not friends with the person he had dinner with (nothing bad happened, just don’t know them well). I didn’t really have an issue with not being invited or brought food.

- Some people have asked about the driving thing. He does not have a car or license, so I’m the only one able to drive us around. He has a bike and our transit is fairly good (for the US anyway). Typically I’ll drive to his work, between our places, and if we need to go do errands.

- l did not intend to invite mutual friend over - they just happened to be hungry and ask if they could have some of the tofu I made. I said sure because I had no issue with it.

"AITA for ""tough loving"" my depressed younger brother? Hi all. My (24) younger brother (22) seems to be needing help. So for background, my brother has a job, some savings, he hangs out with friends/chats them up online. He dropped out of high school when he was very close to graduating. My mother and I tried talking to him about the time he was going to drop out, since he wasnt doing his school work, and he broke diwn crying about how he thinks he's stupid. And even now he seems depressed. He'll get into moods where he's very aggressive/short/annoyed. Sometimes if for example, me him and my mom are all listening to some tunes on the tv, he'll sometimes change it to a depressing song, such as NF - Let you down. And we tell him straight up that this isn't the vibe, but he has done this multiple times. Or sometimes he'll make comments in the videos, such as in Post Malone's song ""Mourning"" Post says ""Don't wanna sober up... thought I was strong enough..."" and he'll make a comment like ""guess I wasn't strong enough"". Or he'll make (what I assume to be) exaggerated comments about how good life is. I've tried telling him he should listen to happier music rather than what he listens to, but he says he likes the sad music more

Ever since he's turned 21, he's been very into drinking. Not an every day thing from what I see, but he acts like a completely different person/very outgoing once he gets drinking. He's had many bouts of laying on the bathroom floor from throwing up.

With that, his room is also a mess. I've taken the liberty of cleaning it twice and he's dirtied it up again. Never vacuums, cans of pop and alcohol everywhere, clothes everywhere, plates with food from days ago, etc. He also doesn't time his chores very well such as taking out the trash, or cleaning out the dishwasher as it'll take him days to do it. He doesn't practice hygiene very well as he'll take a shower maybe every other day (he needs more because he has terrible acne everywhere unfortunately).

He went to the gym with me once due to him getting a lot of anxiety/emotions when he and this girl he was talking to broke up (they were also coworkers so he had to see her). I was very stoked to have him work out with me since he woukd have a healthy hobby, but soon after he never asked again, and when I asked him he said he's happy with his body.

Today him, me, and my mom went to see a movie, all was well. Then we go to eat, and he appears fine. But once we sit down and order some drinks, he starts talking about like he needs it right now, he still appears fine. But then he becomes very closed off and ticked like something was bothering him very badly. He went into his phone the entire time, and when my mom tried prying him, he didn't want to talk about it and he talked about how he shouldn't have ever come. He then asked for the keys to the car so he could sit, and then downed his drink. When I talked with her later, she said he looked like he was about to cry.

With all this, I wonder if I lack sympathy for him somewhat. I feel bad for him and want to help him when he gets like this as I imagine he's figuring out his feelings. But I start to get into the mindset of tough love when he doesn't do better for himself and he keeps engaging in his unhealthy living/trying to improve his mind state. This has been going on for years and I feel like he resents me somewhat for it because he always gets moody when I bring up the chores, or even trying to better himself in general/it goes in one ear out the other.

I don't know what to really do for him. I try to think that I'm doing good by trying to be a ""guide"" for him, but I'm not sure. AITA for judging his lifestyle while trying to better him by trying to teach him responsibility and the like even with his depressive state?",0.79

"AITA (25 yo Black F( for keeping roommates security deposit? A sublet came to stay at my place a few months ago. Everything was cool, until a noisy neighbor kept them ap at night & they had argument.  They always paid cash, no receipts. They were unhappy with noise from next door so they broke the lease. I told them they need to give 30 days notice for me to find someone new and they said 'F*ck you', took their things, threw the keys at me, &started yelling they want their security deposit right now. They were loud and angry and threatening to call the police, so I left. 

The next day they called me multiple times & after I calmed down, I told them just let me go to the place and inspect. When I got back, they pushed me through the doorway, not hard, but confronted me asking for their 'security deposit' 2000$ They loudly yelled so neighbors can hear, I am calling the cops on you. I ran out & stayed with a friend. 

The next day, the police called me saying they would arrest me for petit larceny, since I was keeping their stuff. But I just turn my phone off after that. I am in shock tbh.

"AITA for snapping at my 15yo cousin and not acting like an adult?  Okay so maybe my cousin Josh’s (15m) current behaviour is puberty but he’s been acting crazy. His mom told us that he got into some trouble so she can’t leave him alone at home so my mom offered to watch him. 

I thought it’d be fine but he has way too much energy. Which would be fine but he’ll randomly start running up and down the stairs and while he’s doing that, he refuses to let anyone else on the stairs or else he’ll throw a tantrum. Then he’ll just… open and close taps over and over again. Same with the stove, lights, the windows, and doors. And this one time while we were eating dinner he just stood up and threw all his food onto the carpet in my bedroom. And he just laughs! Not to mention the fact that he’ll start fighting with me over stupid shit like the TV volume or my outfit choices.

The other day, I was in my room trying to do work and he stormed in and started opening and closing my window. I immediately asked him to get out and leave me alone but the weirdo started jumping on my bed and singing some stupid song. I yelled at him to stop bothering me and he immediately went “you’re such a buzzkill, no wonder your bf left you” to which I responded “yeah and no wonder your dad left, you annoying piece of shit.” 

Well guess who bursted out crying. My mom immediately ran in and started yelling at me asking me what I did and when I tried to explain to her she told me I crossed the line and should’ve acted like the adult I am instead of lashing out at a child. When my dad came home he got upset too and well my aunt was especially angry and said I need to watch myself. I told them over and over that I have been putting up with him like an adult for two months. I haven’t said anything to him no matter what exactly because I am 23 and he is 15. But I can’t take it anymore and anyone would’ve snapped having to deal with him. 

My parents told me to have more empathy for him and that he’s going through a tough time which okay fine but why does that give him the right to irritate me? And besides who cries like that at 15? Hell who even acts like him at the age?? I really don’t think I’m wrong but everyone else does and I suppose I reacted immaturely. I snapped. AITA? ",0.14
"AITA for telling my friends they got hacked Okay, second AITA post today. 



I used to have interest in cybersecurity, and I have known about websites that exist solely to check if you have been hacked before or breached, and im also aware of websites similar to whitepages but are more updated, more accurate, and carry more personal information thats all readily (and legally) publically available. I recently found a website that checks if your email has been found in breaches, but it also searches to see if a password has been leaked alongside it, and if it is, it shows you a censored version of the password and gives you a identifier that can be used to look it up if you know what your doing. long story short, public records, and tools that exist to show you what data of yours is on the internet, the purpose of which is solely to protect yourself. 

  
Heres where I ask if im the asshole. I tested these 3 websites/tools i found on myself, and found previous passwords that i had used but no longer use. the thing is, im security conscious, and alot of my friends are not, and they are not technologically abled either (meaning if i explain stuff like this to them, they are highly unlikely to understand). So, in a attempt to be a good friend, I looked up their names, found their personal info that was publically available, i then checked to see if they'd been hacked before, and they had. I then checked for the passwords that had been leaked, and uncovered several, PER PERSON. In my attempt to be helpful and protective, i immediately requested their information be removed from the first tool (which gave me, the initial parameters to find their stuff), and then i alerted my friends about what i found, and asked them if i can send them the passwords that were leaked, so in case they still use them they can change them. The reaction i got, was the opposite of what i was expecting. They were very angry, that i had searched them up, without their permission, and that I had found their passwords in previous data leaks. They used words like ""overstepping"" and ""personal boundries"", claiming i had violated such. However, while i did apologize, i explained to them its all already public information, and i was just trying to help them. One of them, is a good friend of mine, and he was particularly upset, that i had looked up and found his wifes information, and without thinking i had also alerted her, trying to see if i can send her the passwords, so she can change them if she still used them. 

  
So 4 out of the 5 people I had alerted to my findings, were HIGHLY upset about the fact that i found this. However all of it is A) legal, B) public records, and C) giving worryingly accurate results. So the question is, am i the asshole?

  
TL:DR am i the asshole for finding my friends leaked data, and then alerting them that their data had been leaked, then asked if i could send them the data, so they can mitigate potential problems in the future?",0.36
"AITA for not having a relationship with my in-laws AITA for not wanting a relationship with my husband’s parents

I am 26F, married a year and half ago to my husband, 29M We are Indians, and usually Indian families stay in big joint families with our parents. 

I was raised by a single mom, parents divorced early on in my childhood. Mum raised me and made me whatever I am today.

husband’s family includes his mom dad and younger brother. We’re just back from our honeymoon and my MIL starts expecting weird things from me. I should cover my head at home, wear traditional indian clothes( things like these might be stereotypical in some cultures, but I have never seen or heard of these before), act like a full time maid, cooking, doing the dishes, laundry, etc. 

I also work a full time job as an accountant, and it is very taxing on me with heavy schedules.

MIL cannot speak a word without it being a taunt. She would never answer in a straight voice, with her always trying to demean me or scold me. FIL would act like an authoritarian patriarch, ordering everyone around. I heard things from my BIL that my husband and I should not go out on dates anymore because now we ‘live in the same house’ so we do not need to go out to meet each other. The audacity and the remarks they have made can be a whole thread. 

My husband is a good person, but he is very naive and gullible. My in-laws would gaslight him often into believing that I did some act, that caused this reaction from them.

he would also, when angered; display a huge reg flag behaviour, cutting me off emotionally and just being rude and manipulative.

They have tried to create a scene by calling my mum up, and trying to set up an intervention that hey your daughter did this, she said that,etc. And they would disrespect her, say she is alone, take digs at her, and yell at her. I made it clear to my husband that this is not at all acceptable and he and his parents need to respect her.

Now, I give his parents a cordial relationship where I don’t greet them, but I also do not disrespect them. I respond to what is asked, and do not back answer even if they are being rude. I ask them what they need, but I do not go out of the way for them.

AH because- my husband feels that I am only focused on a relationship with him, and am not putting in efforts on his family. When i told him that my relationship with his parents is not entirely my fault, it is theirs too, and that this relationship is now strained, and not something for him to repair. In order to repair it, he himself is trying to strain the relationship we both share. he flipped and said i do not want to make an effort to fix things.

NTA because- I have tried to be super kind and nice to them, but they would always either taunt me or yell at me or try to control me, which does not really work with my values, which my husband knows. Also, they do not want my husband to have any relationship with my mum, they get paranoid and have caused a lot of arguments in our home whenever we go to meet her.

Since he deleted the conversation, I asked him what was said. He says it doesn't matter, I handled it. But just for giggles, I'm curious about the conversation. He still won't tell me. After about 10-15 minutes of trying to pry details out of a simple question, I just gave up.

"AITA for not attending my dad’s wife’s daughter’s wedding? My parents divorced when I was 22 (2013). Shortly after, my dad met T on Match.com and moved in after three months of dating. Their relationship was challenging from the start. T has a tough personality and a different parenting style she aggressively imposed on my dad, causing tension with my brother and I as adults. My dad reluctant to make T happy, generally flexed to her demands. Despite this, my dad and T married in Hawaii, where my brother and I attended. T's daughter was not invited (she has 3 children with 2 separate partners and the reason for her not coming was due to it being complicated). Over the years, my relationship with T remained strained as she was controlling and distant, often prioritizing her marriage (or herself) over building a blended family or opening up. The situation culminated in 2022 when I was invited to T's daughter's wedding. Context: I have no relationship with T (have met her <10 times over the last 10 years) and was uncomfortable with the thought of my dad walking someone else down the aisle, along with other fatherly duties.  

I expressed my concerns to my dad, seeking clarity on his involvement, he said he understood and would let me know. Over the months, I never received a definitive answer. As the wedding approached, I communicated my reluctance to attend, which my dad struggled to accept. After deciding not to go, my dad sent a long hurtful text message accusing me of punishing him, T, and T's daughter, and he subsequently banned me from our family cabin (which my mom and dad originally built when my brother and I were younger). Now claiming this is ‘his cabin’ and he can’t justify me staying there after the ‘damage’ I have caused and ‘the gray cloud I cast’ over the wedding. The aftermath strained our relationship further, as he continued to state an apology was required to the family for my absence, which I felt was unjustified. The situation worsened when my grandpa passed away and I was notified out of the blue via a text message from my dad. When asked if I should come out to be with him and my brother (at the cabin) he said I could come only if I made my own arrangements. 

My dad and I remain at an impasse, unable to reconcile without an apology that I don’t feel is necessary to give, as I believe my actions were not intended to harm anyone and I was upfront and honest about my boundaries. Also, T has never expressed or communicated any issue directly to me (aside from blocking me on Facebook which I no longer have) but rather back channel apology demands via my dad. It doesn’t feel like there is a genuine interest to reconcile as an apology wouldn’t truly mend things that have happened over the last 10 years. I would like to move forward, and have expressed my desire to re-establish a relationship but my dad confirmed it would be difficult unless I showed I am ‘truly remorseful’.",0.02

He picked the flavour of pizza, Pesto Chicken, and personally I find it a little bland so I grabbed a mini Tabasco 57ML. Now we both like spicy stuff and he was totally not opposed and I know he likes it too, we just didn't have any at home. 

Anyway, fast forwarded, oven, pizza cooked, eating pizza, now... we each take a slice and i put a good amount of tabasco on mine, and i say want any? He says no no he likes this pizza as it is. Great, so we're eating eating and I am really loading up my slices. Okay, somehow I've only had 3 or 4 slices, half the pizza, and the entire thing of tobacco is gone, yeah maybe I""m a big or eat quickly. He was on his computer at the same time.

Anyway, he's only had 1.5 slices and I saved his half/the rest of the pizza for him, but now he wants tobasco and when he goes for it there is literally none left. He says it's impossible I finished it and asked if I dumped it out or something? I said no obviously not I must have finished it. It's NOT big the container is only 57ml. Yes it wasn't a huge pizza for that amount of tobasco but I didn't think it had flavour and I wanted to feel something. 

Anyway, he seems to think i'm some sort of monster or that I like chugged the tobasco. even if I did so what? I just drenched it, I wasn't even thinking. so anyway, he didn't finish the rest of the pizza out of some spite? said it wasn't that good, even though he was just saying the opposite, and I didn't finish his either because there was no tobasco left and it tasted terrible without it. so anyway the next morning, i go to the grocery store and buy a big tobasco and leave it on the counter cause i think its funny then go to work. i get home and THE TOBASCO IS EMPTY. but its one of the large ones. I said where did it go? and he says i finished it. and im like thats impossible thats so much tobasco. and hes like see??? who could finish a bottle. and im like yeah mine was 57 ML that is like 500! i said did you dump it out? hes like no i ate it with lunch. anyway, i know he dumped it because its impossible to have that much, but then hes saying the same thing about what i did, but i actually ate mine. is this gaslighting?

"AITA for uninviting my 13 year old to my wedding?  Me (F33) and her father (M36) split ways 2 years back. My daughter and I had an OK relationship. I'm getting married in October. 

My daughter recently made an IG reel (she has a small following of 3000 people) of how she is so excited that she has a wedding to attend to soon. She said in the reel that she is going to attend her mother's wedding and she is excited. Then making a sad face she said and I quote ""it doesn't matter that it is a sinful wedding and my mother has decided to become a slave to a homewrecking white lady. A wedding is a wedding and I will get to make so many ootd type things and have so many posts to share. It's going to be exciting."" 

I was extremely upset. I saw the comments and her father told her to delete the reel. Some people in the comments were showcasing sympathy for her. I called her father immediately and he apologized numerously and said he will make sure that she deletes it. He said he has no idea why she would make such a reel. After 10 minutes the reel was gone. My daughter wasn't picking up my calls so I texted her asking why she was spreading lies and doing this kind of stuff and being a disappointment. Then she called me after some time and started yelling that I am the actual disappointment and that she is ashamed to think that I'm her mother as an ""independent black Christian woman"". Before I could say anything, she cut the call. I was basically horrified and depressed for a few days. I contacted her father again asking if she will be coming for the weekend (I have her during the weekend and he has her during the weekdays irrespective of vacations unless we agree to something). He said she doesn't want to come to my place. And I asked him if it was his idea to make our daughter believe all this and he said a bit angrily that why I was accusing him then I got angry and said you are the one she spends more time with. He calmed down and explained that he himself is an atheist and has no clue why our daughter has gone this way. He said that a few months back she had become interested in Christianity (I am a progressive Christian and our daughter had discussed wanting to practice religion as well and I was supportive). I know her father isn't a bad person and he genuinely seemed confused. 

So I emailed my daughter (she blocked me everywhere) if she is coming to my house this Saturday and that she cannot block me cause I'm her parent and have custody. She replied with a nasty email and so I replied with ""Ok you can come back to my house from November and she is no longer invited to my wedding.""

I (29F) and my best friend (29F) booked a holiday to Rio for later on this month. I booked and paid for it entirely out of my own money after a very lucky lottery win of about £10k. We’ve both wanted to go for years, and after the win, I told her I’d treat us and take us on holiday. She paid nothing toward, just the renewal of her passport, I paid for it completely. 

We were set to go in 2 weeks, but this weekend I saw red and cancelled the entire thing as it’s too late to change the passenger and too late to change the dates. The only outcome was for me to go, or cancel and lose money. 

Why did I cancel? This weekend my friend and I were discussing our plans for our trip and she mentioned “Oh, well John* is due to land the day after us so we can ask what he thinks to our plans?”

John (27?M) is her most recent boyfriend. John is not a nice person and I do not get on with him at all. I had no idea he had booked to go when we were there, and after asking he booked as a solo traveller AFTER I booked ours, so essentially coming on holiday with us. A little background on John is he is unemployed (legally, he’s a self proclaimed “pharmacist” if you catch my drift). I don’t trust him, he essentially love bombed my friend, he never has a nice word to say about me when we all get together. 

After I cancelled, both my friend and John called me TA (among many other names) and I’ve not spoken to either since. A few of my friends have said I acted quickly without thinking and would have had a nice time either way. AITA?",0.19
"AITA for ruining finances for my gf and myself.   Hello everyone, I (26M) am an international student and made a pretty big mistake by getting a credit card during university, despite having a minimal allowance and no job.
I ended up using it irresponsibly and now I'm saddled with over $4,000 in debt. I'm currently employed, but my income barely covers essentials like food and bills, so paying off the credit card has been slow.
My girlfriend (26F) of 7 years also has credit card debt, but she has been much more responsible about paying it off, even though she had a very low-paying job recently.

During this time for about 6 months or so, I supported her with food, entertainment, fuel, and other necessities whilst also paying off minimum on my card.

The last few months have been tough, and one of her car insurance payments, which is set up as a direct debit from my account, got returned because I didn't have enough funds. I genuinely didn't realize this had happened as I must have missed the notification. Unfortunately, this has likely affected her credit score, which was never my intention. She also spoke with her mom about this and I feel like she, like any parent, is quite disappointed with me. 

Now, my girlfriend feels that our financial issues are too much to handle, and she doesn't want to continue the relationship especially with someone financially unstable and irresponsible. I completely understand her perspective as everyone wants a partner who is financially responsible and stable, and I failed in that regard. 

I've apologized, but it seems she's made up her mind. She has pretty much called me a horrible person for not having my shit together at this age and wants to go separate ways. 

I'm torn about what to do next. AITA in this whole situation?

"AITA for refusing to talk to the guy i’m fwb with when i know he is with another girl Me and this guy are really close friends outside of the hook ups, we talk every day and if i’m honest sometimes he does act as if we are dating when we are alone. Because of this over the time we have known each other (only about 4 months) there have been times when we have fallen out because i was confused about what he wanted because from the get go both of us made clear that we didn’t want a relationship. The whole time we have been talking he has been acting in a very similar way towards another girl who we will call Polly. Me and polly used to be good friends last year but we would fall out a lot because we are just very different people but i didn’t hate her at any point even when she hated me. Me and this guy have clashed a few times because he has been with her and it has always made me even more confused about what he wants from me especially if he is getting the same thing from someone else. Honestly it’s probably just my own insecurity but it makes me feel like i’m not enough and he likes her more.

Recently they have been spending a lot more time together, she has a lot more money than me and is able to go and do more things and visit more often because the journey involves a train which i can’t always afford to do. 

it’s not the fact that they are hanging out that bothers me and i’ve come to accept that it’s going to happen and he isn’t going to chose between us. I’m okay with that but when they are together he still messages me and i really hate the way that makes me feel. He takes ages to reply when he is with her and while im waiting for him to text back all im thinking about is what they are doing and if i think about that i will get upset and take it out on him which isn’t fair because he doesn’t owe me anything. It just means that arguments happen and i hate that so i’ve taken to just not replying to him until i know they are no longer together and i’ve been doing this now for a few weeks.

Last night he was asking me if anything was wrong because i had barely spoken to him all day and i said that i didn’t want to speak to him when he was with Polly because it upsets me and im trying to stop arguments happening. He replied saying that he didn’t really get what was upsetting me about it but he will leave me be if that’s what i want 

something about the way he said it really made me feel like i was just being petty but i don’t feel like i am, im trying to do the opposite because i know that i dont have the right to be upset but im going to be upset and that wont change. Avoiding him when i know they are together works for me but im worried i am being unreasonable

"AITA for calling her ugly after what she did??  So I'm in secondary school and I'm black but I live in a PWI so I'm not friends with any black ppl my age. It's now the summer holidays and there's this girl I used to be friends with called Jessica and Jessica can get really annoying sometimes. She always says the N word and if you call her out for it she denies it she calls Asian ppl ching chongs and she says stuff like curry muncher or fried chicken muncher. Just very immature. So fast forward to a couple days ago and me and my friends are talking about guys they have a crush on and they say names of some guys. then they start making fun of each other for who they used to like . I then say Jacob (who is Jessica's crush) is the best looking out of all of them but they're all still bleh. Jessica wasn't online at that time. Then when she was she went into our bigger group chat with all the boys and like most ppl in our year and asked if I liked him now. I said no. Then she started getting annoying and saying stuff like you said he was good looking which I never said, but yh. Then fast forward some messages we start talking about celebrity crushes and one girl says Jacob Elordi. Then Jessica calls him a downy and says he looks like he has down syndrome.And ATP I'm pissed because earlier on she told everyone abt a boy I used to like and stuff so then I just said. If anything Jessica's an uppy, down syndrome was afraid of her. Saying she has down syndrome would be an offense to ppl who have it as you'd basically be saying they look like naked mole rats. I never say stuff like this because even calling ppl with downs syndrome downys is bad. Then she sent a picture of a girl with down syndrome and captioned it this you. To which I responded no but she's actually really pretty. Then I'm not even lying Jessica said the girl looked like this 😑. I said so you're making of disabled ppl now.I was making fun of you because you're ugly not because of your condition (no she doesn't have a condition, and up syndrome isn't real) 

But I just want to know AITA, because I feel really guilty but then again. This is kinda stupid tho",0.18
"AITA for not fulfilling my sister's demands and allowing my nephew to be a child? English is not my language, sorry for mistakes.

My sister (Mary, 28f) suddenly had to go on a business trip. Her nanny couldn't come, so Mary left the child (Nick, 8m) with me (32m) and my wife (Ann, 29f). Nick will be staying with us for two weeks. This is great, because due to Mary's work, I haven't seen Nick that often.

However, Mary brought several sheets of paper with rules that we must follow while we are looking after Nick. And they were very strange. Example:

*- Nick must not be allowed outside for more than half an hour a day*

*- Nick is not allowed to eat anything above or below room temperature. The food list is also limited: I'm not talking about sweets, but, for example, pasta, meat or bread*

*- Nick must be under constant supervision, even in the shower. In bed, we have to check on him every half hour*

*- Nick is absolutely forbidden to interact with strangers and their pets*

Of course, I asked questions. Nick doesn't have any illnesses or allergies. There are no injuries, either Nick or Mary. He doesn't go to a psychologist. So I don't understand where such a list of rules came from.

When Mary left, my wife and I asked Nick what he wanted to do. He said he didn't know. And at that point, Ann and I could be assholes. Because we talked it over and decided to give Nick the opportunity to be a kid for at least two weeks.

Nick was delighted. We weren't doing anything forbidden in the sense that kids shouldn't. However, during his first week with us, Nick:

- Tried cold ice cream instead of the ice cream from the microwave

- Met the girl next door and her dog

- Watched his first cartoon! Ann suggested ""Aladdin""

- Showered alone

- Started learning to ride a bike

Nick fell over his bike and got a bruise. Nothing serious, but Ann taked him to the hospital. The doctor congratulated Nick on his first bruise and we celebrated with cookies. This was on Friday. On Saturday, Mary was standing at the door of the apartment.

The doctor contacted her and told about the bruise. Mary quit her job, spent a lot of money to come and get Nick. She was furious and screaming. According to her, we are irresponsible people who obviously can’t read if we can’t read the little rules (4 pages of text) and follow them. I tried to calm her down, but Mary continued, resorting to insults.

When she called Ann an “empty belly” (we are trying to have children, but we can’t), my patience snapped. I yelled back at her and told her that she was making something out of her son that was incapable of life. That all we did with Nick was let him be a child. Mary took Nick right out of bed, and I haven’t seen them since.

About a week passed. I understand that we failed because we really didn't follow the rules that my sister set for the child. But on the other hand, Nick seems to live in a complete vacuum under his mother's supervision, and Ann and I just showed him another life.

So tell me, AITA?",0.2
"AITA for walking out of a wedding when I realized it wasn’t child free My son and DIL got married this weekend. I have custody of my niece and she has grown up with me since she was 6. My son was never happy about not being an only child but we went to therapy and overall I thought it was a lot better. 

The invitation came and it told us it was a child free wedding. We reached out and it was confirmed by my son. So our niece couldn't come, that also ment we needed to put childcare in place. The wedding it 5 hours away, we drove.

We get to the wedding and it wasn't child free. There were multiple kids and even a baby. I didn't want to make a commotion at the wedding so we left and started to drive home. I sent my son a text saying that he lied to us. That if he didn't want his cousin at the wedding he could have said so but instead he lied. I told him I didn't wish to cause issue and have a good day.

We missed the wedding, and my son has been all over the place. My new DIL called and claimed it was all a misunderstanding but we have the invite saying otherwise. 


The drama has spread, and other people are chimmikg in, some would have also left while to there think we should have sucked it up and stayed.

"AITA for burning all my textbooks to get back at my dad?  Im M16. Ive had a terrible year, my mom left and my dad brought us to live with my aunt in another state. I broke up with my girlfriend and i don't talk to anyone in my new school. Because of that it’s been difficult to be optimistic about things and get to doing stuff again. I don’t really have the energy to do anything anymore and im barely passing my classes. I just sleep all day and do nothing which is probably my fault but I just don't feel like doing anything ever.

My brother who lives in southkorea (im korean) just came back recently to visit. He hasnt been back in a while because he was doing his military service. When he got back he asked what happened to my grades because I used to be a straight a student but since moving I havent been doing as well. And he said I sound tired all the time even thought I never do anything.

My dad didn’t know much about my school because my aunt and him can’t really read or speak english so he only found out about it when my brother mentioned it after he saw my report card. My dad suddenly had an outburst about my behaviour when this was brought up. He asked me what I’m doing with all my time besides wasting it. And I couldn’t answer him.

This is a little strange but I like to solve rubiks cubes a lot. I used to spend all my money on cubes and before I moved I used to participate in a lot of speed cubing competitions. I had like over a hundred and some of them cost over 70+ dollars, and I paid with my money I got from saving / part time jobs. After my dad asked me whats been happening to me lately and I didn’t say anything, when I was at school he took like all of my cubes and threw them away. 

When I found out I was so angry. I mean they were kind of my only hobby and some of them were really old and sentimental. My brother and my aunt tried to defend me and said he went too far. But he just ignored us. He said I’ll only be allowed outside when my grades went back up. And he added that it wouldn’t be a problem since I don’t go out. Which I was a little hurt by.

I was really angry. So I burned all my textbooks and worksheets right outside the house just to get back at my dad. When he saw he was so angry he told me to get out of the house and almost trashed my room but my aunt stopped him. After that he cooled down for a while and I locked myself in my room since then so we haven’t talked.

I think that he shouldn’t have thrown away all my cubes. But it might have been an overreaction to burn all my textbooks. It's also my fault that I don't do anything at all all day. I don’t know if I am wrong here. ",0.5
"AITA for telling my boyfriend I dislike his father? I (25f) live with my boyfriend (26m) for several weeks now- ever since I got thrown out of my previous rented apartament because of my landlord’s greediness. My boyfriend immediately invited me to live with him, as I cannot return to my parents’ home yet (because of my job here- they live several hours away) and I welcomed that proposition with joy- I wanted to live with him for a long time.
My boyfriend lives in his family house on the outskirts of our city with his widowed dad. He never moved out because he never had to- he went to the high school and uni here, now works in the city. He is quite content and never wanted to move out, even when I offered to rent a flat together last year- he said he wanted to save money, so I went to live with a roommate instead. 

Now I live with my boyfriend, his dad and his dog, and I am so tired… my boyfriend’s dad is a grumpy, old man who is extremely attention seeking at the same time. He constantly tries to provoke me (for example, by calling the female Olympics Team „stupid c**ts” and looking for my reaction to the slur; by eating the food I buy and complaining it’s bland and tasteless, but most importantly- by negging my boyfriend constantly). My boyfriend is a hardworking young man, who spends an awful lot of time at work (2 jobs) as a doctor- same as me. Despite that, his father often calls him an idiot, along with worse names. He likes to shame him in front of me; telling jokes about his „poor appearance” or the way he does everything wrong. He constantly leaves a mess in a kitchen, then watches me clean that up, saying nothing or making jokes about what a poor job I do loading the dishwasher.
He listens to our private conversations, even behind closed doors. He walks around the house wearing nothing but his underwear, which is his God given right, as he is the owner of this house, but still makes me uncomfortable.
Whenever I offer to my boyfriend that we could move out for a few months before another important chapter of our careers start, he tells me he doesn’t want to leave his widowed dad alone.
But the way they talk- barking at each other- and the way his father often calls him, treats him like sht and orders him around like a boy makes me sad- and I feel terrible for it, as this is the house of both my boyfriend and his dad and I’m living here thanks to their good will. However, I am pretty sure both of them are quite happy with the situation- my boyfriend doesn’t have to move out and can live with me and his father has another person to order around like a slave- and neither wants to change the situation. I am supposed to move out in November, but I can no longer imagine another week with this man under the same roof.
So I ended up expressing my thoughts aloud. Now my boyfriend is hurt, as he feels I am harsh for the lonely old man who cannot express his emotions properly. AITA?

"AITA for this fight with my mom over her controlling behavior? For as long as I can remember, my mother (F42) has been very controlling over me (F22) and my brother (M16). She constantly makes comments about what I wear, how I do my hair, my makeup, who my friends are, and always tells me how she would have done things differently and her ""way"" is the better way in any given situation. If we don't do something the way she would have done it, she goes on and on saying, ""Well, I would have done this"" or ""If it was me, I would do that."" When I was in high school, she would go through my phone every night, opening text messages and Snapchats, even replying as me sometimes.



I've always butted heads with her, but it got really bad when I turned 18. She magically expected me to start paying rent (I went away for university and lived on campus, only being at her house during breaks and summers) and paying/cooking for EVERYONE in our household. I was a broke college kid just trying to graduate. Now, I've graduated and landed an incredible job where I can pay for rent and buy groceries for myself, but that still isn't enough. My mom has vocalized that she wants me to buy groceries for my brother and herself and cook dinner for them when I get home from work at 5:30, even though she's been at home all day since she doesn't work. She is unwilling to compromise and thinks it's selfish of me to cook dinner only for myself after work.



Last night, we had a big blowout because I was asking her permission to see my boyfriend. Yes, at 22 years old, I still need to ask my mom's permission to leave the house. She proceeded to tell me that she didn't like him out of the blue, saying I'm out of his league completely unprompted. I've been with my boyfriend for a year now. My brother adores him, but my mom rarely even says hi to him or engages in a conversation. Now she's spinning it around, saying she makes the effort and he's the one who doesn't engage, which simply isn't true. After she dropped the unexpected bomb that she didn't like him, I excused myself from the situation with tears in my eyes and cried alone in my room. My brother heard me and came to check up on me. Then my mom burst into my room—because, yes, she doesn't knock before entering. I told her I didn't want to talk and that she had seriously hurt my feelings. She didn't respect that and started to tell me she didn't say she told me to break up with my boyfriend. I replied she said almost everything except that, and she put me in an uncomfortable situation. She then proceeded to call my boyfriend a loser, stupid, ugly, fat, and weird. My boyfriend is educated in mechatronics engineering and goes to the gym daily.



Now my mom is saying I'm choosing my boyfriend over her and giving me the silent treatment because I told her she was controlling and had no business putting herself in the middle of my relationship, especially when it was completely unwanted. So, AITA for finally calling her out on her continuous controlling behavior?",0.1
"AITA For making my sister discuss the spreading of my grandfather’s ashes with his daughter, my mum? Sorry for the long title, using a throwaway account just in case. 

My sister (39f) and my mother (59f) have always had a tumultuous relationship, it’s been hot and cold for years and many bones of contention happened after my maternal grandfather was diagnosed with dementia and moved up to our state by his brother and SIL. My grandfather requested he live closer to my sister and her two small children as he adored them and knew my sister wasn’t working, so more opportunity to spend time before he deteriorated. He moved two hours away from my mother and I, both of us working full time jobs. Mum tried her best to get up to where he was living as much as she could between her work schedule however, my sister took on a caregiver role. As he digressed into his illness, he came to a point where he needed to be in a nursing centre. Pop’s brother and SIL were EPOA’s with my mum being a guardian of his health. The SIL made it her mission to make my mum have very little involvement in the decision making of her father’s health and wellbeing, despite the legal paperwork. All plans for his care was discussed between my sister and pop’s SIL. They both came to an agreement he was to be placed into a care home half an hour further out with no input allowed by my mum. Unfortunately, he was chemically restrained in the home (which is illegal in my state) and passed away 2 months later. According to conversations supposedly had between my mum and sister, mum did not “want” the main urn, just something small - however, pop’s SIL appointed the large urn to my sister and we were to get “anything small we wanted from the funeral home catalogue.” Mum has expressed over the course of 8 years since his passing that she hurts knowing she never got a say, was never given anything as a memory gift (my sister also has all of my pop’s belongings) and that she was never given the main urn.

This brings me to Saturday just gone, where my sister was discussing with me her desire to take our pop’s ashes and spread them because she “is ready” I very quickly reminded her it was a conversation she needed to have with our mum as he was her dad and she needs to have her voice heard too, my sister was taken aback and haphazardly agreed to have the conversation but I could tell that she was pissed off by me mentioning it.

In the past, I have cancelled on her multiple times for different reasons. This past year and a half we have both entered adulthood and have chosen two different paths, she had a baby, while I started college, she wanted to go out and do things, but I needed to stay home and focus on school, since I lived on my own, I had to pay my bills keep my apartment clean and find a part-time job, as she developed more pregnant and I was entering exams we barely saw each other,  and I thought it  was fine to see each other once a month, I been trying to survive as well as trying to  find a job, family issues , which is still the current situation, however I have been on break for 3 months from school and have one month left , however, I still cancel on her even though I may not be busy.

I feel that this text she sent me is something she’s felt for a long time, and there’s an accumulation of frustration from the past year as we used to hang out every single day, but that’s what you do in high school and we are adults now which is a hard reality. 

But now I don’t know how to respond cause I do feel like a shitty friend, all I really texted her was that I was sorry, I don’t know why I am the way I am and that I apologize for that. I don’t think it was the best response but I I just feel exhausted.",0.14
"AITA for asking my friend to pay for his portion of the Airbnb even though hes not coming?

 At 9pm a friend asked my partner if he could get a ride back to his car with us, which would have meant a 10+ minute detour, before we picked up our son. Not a huge delay admittedly but he also asked us very late in the evening, so we didn't have much time to adjust our plans at that point, I was socially exhausted and looking forward to a quiet drive back, and we had to go relieve our relatives from watching the toddler and get him back to our house and hopefully all get to sleep quickly and in time for work Monday morning.

"AITA for sneaking out and leaving my mom's kids alone to hang out with friends? Hi everyone,

I (17F) am in a tough situation and need some perspective. My parents are divorced, and I spend time at both my mom’s and dad’s houses. At my mom’s, I have a stepdad and three younger half-siblings (4, 7, and 12).

Whenever I’m at my mom’s, I’m expected to babysit my siblings. It happens every single time. I’ve told my mom multiple times that I don’t want to babysit and that I need time to hang out with my friends, do school work, or just have some personal time. She doesn’t listen and forces me to babysit anyway.

I got fed up with it and came up with a plan. Since my 12-year-old sibling is pretty responsible, I decided to sneak out the back door after my mom and stepdad left. I figured the 12-year-old could handle things for a couple of hours while I hung out with my friends. 

This plan worked for a few times, but then my mom came home early one day and found out I wasn’t there. She went insane, yelling at me and saying I was irresponsible and put my siblings in danger. She even called my dad to complain about it, which made things even worse for me.

Now, my mom is saying I’m grounded and that I can’t be trusted. My dad is upset with my mother, as he understands my side a bit more. I’m feeling really stuck because I just want some freedom and not to be forced into being a babysitter every time I’m at my mom’s.

But she said she had to reserve her time at home for her bf so she doesn't know in advance when she's free, so I should just keep calling her and trying to set up a date. So I stopped calling. In 2020, during pandemic, I found out I had cancer, had surgery, treatment and was then happily declared cancer free. I only told a handful of ppl about it when I was going through it and then made a short post on my socials once it was done. She saw the post and called me bawling asking why I didn't call her, how she knows we're not as close as before but she's been busy, and basically made it all about her. I told her it was the pandemic and no point spreading worry when I knew it would be okay (my cancer was easily treatable and caught super early). She tried ending the call with call me when you feel up to hanging out. I countered with I'm fine whenever so you call me whenever you're here and free. She said no, you call me okay? I never called. 

Finally on to the main incident. Recently a bad storm hit our area. My cousin was out of town. She called me to see if I was okay. I was very surprised at the call and told her I was fine. She then went on to tell me she had been thinking about me recently and started crying over me. I asked why. She said she was worried about me because I'm single and alone. If anything were to happen to me, nobody would know and nobody would be around to take care of me. What if a fire happened, or my house collapsed, or even a zombie apocalypse (yes, she said this), I would have no one to save me or protect me. This is why she's so grateful to have her boyfriend and I should really try to get myself a boyfriend too. I snapped. I cussed her out, told her to get over herself and I didn't need her pity party. I can save and protect myself. If I need help, I have my trusted circle of ppl which she's clearly not a part of. Told her she doesn't have a boyfriend either since he won't acknowledge her as his GF in public and I'd rather die than be in the kind of relationship she has. And if a zombie apocalypse occurred, she'd be safe because she doesn't have enough brains for them. She got upset and said she was only showing concern for me and that we're FAMILY! I told her to take the F in Family and F herself.",0.02
"AITA For Giving My All my Tenants A 3 Month Notice Before I Sell The Homes? Me and my wife own 8 homes around our area that we rent out. 2 inherited, others bought, and my wife and I have kind of lost interest in the landlord thing, and we're looking to sell. We've been renting to the majority of our tenants for about 2-3 years, with some new ones in the mix too. 

I gave all our tenants 3 month notice to move out, and one of my tenants sent me a very nasty text message, calling me a jerk for ""Putting them out of a place to live,"" (I'm giving them 3 months time, I think that's enough time to find another living arrangement and pack up) to which I just ignored. 

I told my wife about it, and she said that ""he has a point"" and that we could always extend it to five months.

"WIBTA If I Refused To Make A 2.5hrs Round Trip After Work? So my (23f) boyfriend’s (25m) car is in the shop right now because he got rear ended. It’s been almost two weeks, but it’s supposed to be ready this Thursday. 

Due to plans that were made before his car was damaged, my bf is currently at his mom’s house. He isn’t coming back to our apartment until Wednesday, and his mom (late 60s) is supposed to drive him. However, she’s apparently been implying she doesn’t want to/isn’t going to and that she expects me to come get my bf. She had no problems driving, especially long distances (she’s driven solo out of state 300+ miles twice in the last month) and she has no job/obligations, and no plans on Wednesdays, so I don’t know what the problem is.

I am working on Wednesday. I work in a kitchen, and my shifts are 10-12 hours. They’re exhausting, it’s always hotter inside than outside (and we’ve been experiencing a heatwave), and driving the half-hour home afterwards is enough on its own. If I were to drive from my job to her house, it would take an hour, and then from her house back to mine and bf’s apartment is 1.5 hours. So a 2.5 hours round trip, AFTER a 10-12 hours shift in a hot kitchen.

We have floated the idea of her driving bf to my job so he can just hang out until I’m done and then I take us both home from there instead of driving the extra distance, but she doesn’t seem to like this idea either. Picking him up tomorrow (I’m off work) isn’t an option because he has to be at his mom’s on Wednesday, but picking him up Thursday isn’t an option either because I’ll be working that day, and if he isn’t already here he won’t get a ride from his friend to the body shop to pick his car up (he’s desperate to have it back and I DONT blame him at all, I’d be up the wall at this point tbh). 

Would I be the asshole if I stood my ground on not making the drive and asked his mom to drive him?",0.21
"AITA for making my stepdaughter eat a jalapeño after she convinced my daughter to eat one? Throwaway account as my personal account has too much personal information.

We ordered Papa John's (I know, don't even get me started) for dinner the other night, including with the peppers that come in the box. My husband loves spicy peppers. My stepdaughter (12F), who lives in a different state with her mom usually, was in town visiting for the weekend. 

When the pizza arrived, she told my daughter (5F) that the tip of peppers weren't as spicy as the rest of the pepper. My (38F) daughter believed her and took a bite off the end of them before spitting it out. She immediately started screaming and crying. I got her milk and tried to calm her down, but she was inconsolable. 

My husband (41M) asked Stepdaughter why she would say that to our daughter. She said she'd never tried them and didn't actually know what they tasted like. I know she would do it deliberately and said so. We then told her she had to eat the entire end of one of the other peppers because it was her fault my daughter was so upset. She did, and then ran upstairs crying and didn't come out until the next afternoon.

"AITA for spoiling my girlfriend’s cousin’s engagement? This happened back on July 4th, but people are still sore about it. My girlfriend’s cousin (let’s call her Miranda) invited us to her place for a BBQ. A few days prior, Miranda posted a picture on Instagram of her and her boyfriend, George. It was a photo of him on one knee proposing to her. The caption read something like “I said yes! Can’t wait to marry my love.” She has a lot of followers, and a lot of people liked it and commented with congratulations. My girlfriend and I both liked it and commented as well. A few days later was the BBQ. George and most of her family was already there. After we got settled, we both said congratulations to them both. Everything went silent. Miranda, George, and their parents looked horrified. Miranda’s parents said, “You told them?!” And she shook her head. Of course everyone around them was surprised and said things like “You guys are getting married?” “Congratulations!”. My gf and I instantly knew that the rest of their family didn’t know yet. It was so awkward, and Miranda and George seemed very uncomfortable. Later, Miranda’s mom angrily took us aside and told us that it was supposed to be a surprise. George was planning on doing ANOTHER proposal at the BBQ, this time for the family. We explained that they already announced their engagement online, and the mom told us that most of Miranda’s family doesn’t use social media. Apparently the first one was just for friends and the internet. Later, George ended up proposing again anyway, but it felt so awkward. It seemed like it was supposed to be a big moment. The fact that everyone already knew kind of ruined it. We felt so bad. No one really talked to us for the rest of the party. Miranda and George wouldn’t even look at us. When we left, we talked about how we shouldn’t have said anything. Then again, we thought that it would’ve been weird if we congratulated them online and not acknowledge it when we saw them in person. We’ve been talking about whether we should have said anything. My gf said no one from that side of the family has spoke to her since. AITA, or in this case, are we?",0.1
"AITA for telling my girlfriend that she can’t have sleepovers, go on trips, or go on dates with other men? I (31M) have been dating my girlfriend (23F) for 6 months now. Overall things have been very good. She does have several guy friends but, I don’t have a big issue with them as long as she sets clear boundaries with them. 

Things have mostly been cool with them except for with one guy (we’ll call Steve). I don’t want to make assumptions but I think Steve may be in love with my girlfriend. 

Whenever they hang out he has always tried to spend time with her alone, while I was away for work they went skiing together (which I don’t think is a big deal) but he insisted on staying at her place to “escape traffic” that night. I told her tell me the full truth and she claims he never tried to make a move or nothing happened.

Fast forward a few months and Steve invited her on a 3 day biking trip (just the 2 of them) and she agreed to it. I told her I was not ok with it and we had a huge blowup and she eventually cancelled on Steve.

Since then we have had several discussions about appropriate boundaries which sometimes I feel like we’re beneficial and sometimes weren’t. I then told her if she wants to remain in a relationship with me then no dates with, no sleepovers with, and no trips one on one with guy friends. She calmly said she needed time to think about it and I gave it to her.

She did sleep with one of her “guy friends” before we made it official and I forgave her because I genuinely felt like she wanted to reconcile and admitted that she screwed up and wanted to fix it. This is why I am extra cautious.

"AITA for being angryat my gf for going through my texts ?  

We've been dating for almost 2 years now. I don't know why she's acting strange all of a sudden. My team has a new member a girl(lets call her A)and we clicked pretty quick. She's a good friend I'd say. she know that I've a gf and my gf knows her too. They haven't met each other yet. So yeah like i said, A nd i are good friends so we text each other often. I've noticed how my gf's not feeling cool about this. But there's nothing to worry about as I don't plan on cheating her. She sometimes still makes a big deal of this. 

Anyway, I saw her going through my texts sent to A. I got angry and upset of this. I thought she trusted me. She made a problem of one particular text that I made. A and I were talking about body and exercises so I just said I'd show her my biceps the next time we meet(i know this might feel like we're flirting but i clearly wasn't) I love working out and just wanted to show that I've them. Because A was making fun of how I don't have them. My gf claimed that A's flirting and that I played along. 

Now now, the bigger problem is she going through my texts which are supposed to be private. Shouldn't I be the one making a scene here ? She went through my phone and made things worse. She's claiming that I am overacting and she's the right one here. Like what? ",0.94
"WIBTAH for telling my s/o the truth Hi, English is not my 1st language but I'll try my best narrating. My boyfriend and I have been dating for 5 years now, it was my birthday a month ago and I still haven't moved on from what happened. Days before my birthday my boyfriend started acting weird, j checked his messages and found out that he's been hanging out and grabbing lunch with his co worker. Who I believed had a thing for him, it's in the way she always needs his help and the way she always wants to be with him. Nonetheless my boyfriend and I had a fight about this a while back and we moved past it. So you can imagine my confusion when I saw that they were planning lunch together days before my birthday. I confronted him about this and he explained that it was nothing more than just consulting from her because hee is planning a surprise for my birthday, initially when I asked what their lunch and the secrecy was about he said it was work related. He deleted those texts with her but i already had screenshots when I confronted him. We had a huge fight and he apologized and even got her(co worker) to call and explain that there's nothing going on between them. On my birthday though we only got takeout and that was it, no surprise in place. He gifted me a brand new counterfeit apple watch which had issues. It was glitching and had issues. When I asked what the real surprise was he said he planned a dinner date but i ruined it by snooping. Am I wrong for feeling disappointed?",0.2
"AITA for telling my baby's mother not to let her family members meet our child until after I do?
 (Throwaway account)

Long story short, I got a former FWB pregnant. This is the first child for both of us. We're on good/friendly terms, and plan on co-parenting together. We were discussing the birth plan, and she mentioned that she wants just her mom and sister to be in the delivery room with her. Totally understandable, and I've got no problem with that. It's her medical procedure, so it's her choice. I told her I would wait outside the room and come in to meet our child as soon as the birth has taken place. She responded by saying that I can come in shortly after, but for the first little while it would be just her, her mom and her sister in the room with the baby after birth. At this point, I put my foot down and explained that aside from her, I was going to be the first person to meet and hold our baby (not including the medical staff obviously) and that as the father, there was no way I'd be waiting in line behind her mother and sister. I explained to her that for as long as the baby is in her womb, this is 100% her show and she calls all the shots, but the moment our child is born, I have all the same rights as a parent that shes does and should be given the same level of importance. She didn't disagree with me, but still thinks I'm being a bit petty. She said that it would be unfair to ask her mother and sister to be her support people in the delivery room and then tell them they have to wait to meet the baby until after I've had a chance to come into the room and do so. I think I'm being very reasonable, and firmly believe that the first people who meet the baby aside from the doctors and nurses in the room should be the mother and father. Her mom and sister can hold our child after me.

"AITA for making a dessert with my 2 year old for a potluck. We had a potluck at work last week.  I made this delicious brownie & cookie concoction with a caramel sauce.  When I made it, my 2 year old was by my side and ""helping"" as much as he could.  

  
When I put the dish out at the potluck I added a sign that my son helped make it.  I thought that was the right thing to do in case people had an issue with it.  A co-worker who has made it known does not like kids, She has complained to HR about my kid being around at the end of the day for 15-30 minutes.  

  
This co-worker approached me and said that it wasn't fair that I made a dish that she wouldn't eat.  I told her I just made the dish, i'm not concerned with who did and didn't eat it.  She said that making a dish that wasn't made in a safe way and bringing it is not okay.

"AITA for not asking my boyfriend to hang out more? Recently, me (f16) and my boyfriend (m17) have been arguing a-lot. Im not going to get into details but all of the arguments stem from him doing something to upset me (being mean, refusing to talk to me, etc) and then him getting annoyed that I immediately don’t get over it and move on. He’s been refusing to communicate with me about anything which has caused more arguments in which he’s been threatening to stop asking me to do anything with him/ inviting me to things because its not his job to include me. Every time this is brought up I ask if he’s upset i don’t ask him yet he denies it (a little background - he’s never been very good at understanding his own emotions and we’ve had conversations about this before). Last night we settled an argument and we both said we were good from now on, but today he didn’t speak to me at all, left me on opened when I tried to start a conversation and when I asked him to watch something with me later that night be told me he would be too busy playing rust with his friends. I think I have overreacted, but I got upset and asked him if he still had a problem and if he wanted me to leave him alone since I seemed to be annoying him which led to an argument where he stated that I only have a problem when he’s not asking me to do things and leaving his friends for me, and that he’s done and its my job now. I do understand where he’s coming from here but asking him to do things when he’s with his friends all of the time is so nerve racking for me especially since recently he’s been very mean and stated a few times that he hates doing things with me because i’m so annoying.

"AITA for being judgmental of my friends relationship? I have a really close friend, Shae, who is in a relationship with John.

I like John a lot and I adore their relationship, and I love my friend Shae. We're really close and talk daily. 

The issue I'm having: Shae and I are both bi. No feelings there whatsoever, obviously. Even the thought of it grosses me out. She feels very much little a little sister to me.

But we jokingly flirt with each other and say we're married. This joke started way before John and I was really happy that he was fine with that humor, so we didn't need to stop.

But yeah, it's very silly and not serious. I'll say I'm going to bed and she'll say ""without your wife?"" We're just never serious.

Randomly our other friend asked why John was cool with those jokes. She brought it up randomly and said since you both are bi, it seems weird to allow. She basically said she'd feel uncomfortable if her husband was joking like that with a girl.

I said it made sense to me, John gets we're like sisters and just being stupid. I don't think he's worried.

But my friend said something I didn't know. She said, ""He's fine with me flirting with girls that I'm friends with! Just flirting, but it doesn't bother me.""

This rubbed me the wrong way. I said, ""But not with guys?"" And she said, ""Honestly, it would be weird to make these jokes with a man."" 

So I basically called her out. I said I was disappointed hearing that because it seems to me like he takes w/w relationships less seriously, and that's why he's fine with it. I said if he was cool with it with men, it would be fine, but super problematic that it's only an issue if you flirt with men. I said I thought John was better than that, but he's treating lesbian relationships like their lesser.

That threw her off and she said she didn't appreciate me being judgmental towards her or John, and she likes that he's fine with it. She said she respects my POV, but she was sad to hear me talk that way.

"AITA for not letting my bf’s friend announce her pregnancy at our housewarming? I 27F and my boyfriend Ben 30M recently moved into a new house. Me and Ben are both very social, so our housewarming group is quite big. Because of this, we planned our housewarming over a month in advance so everyone was available and able to make it to our house as we have moved 1.5hours out the city so for most guests it’ll be a 3hr round trip. 

My friends are from different social groups- some college friends, co workers and friends from my gym group while Ben has a big friendship group from high school, where it’s 8 of them and their SO’s. His high school group try and used to meet every month, but it’s hard as people have moved (one of them abroad) and his friend Lisa 29F and her partner are in the army.

Lisa messaged Ben that she is pregnant and she wanted to announce the pregnancy at our housewarming. She said it’s a weird ask- but they’ve been friends for so long and she really wants to make the announcement in person and their whole group struggle to all meet together and this is a great opportunity. She said her partner will be deployed just after and they wanted to announce the pregnancy together and before she is showing.

I think my guests will find it a bit awkward and Lisa and her partner only know Ben’s high school group/ they don’t know any of our mutual friends that well. Ben also agreed it’s unusual- but the abroad friend won’t come back just for a pregnancy announcement- he’s in the city for his mom’s birthday. 

I said maybe compromise by asking the friend group to come earlier and then Lisa could announced it- but the whole group can’t make it that early, and notifying them now a week away from the housewarming was late notice. Lisa suggested instead she can tell the friend group privately- but I think it’s still strange.

It’s a housewarming party not a wedding so this isn’t the hill I want to die on. I don’t know Lisa well enough to outright say no and her and Dan have been friend for 17+ years.",0.21

I stated that I had vodka I could bring. Girly responded that she hates the taste of my liquor. I then offered to bring a variety of juice to mix my liquor with to mask the taste. She then called me a ""cheap-ass"".

 I explained that I would be happy to buy her a $5 biggie bag instead of buying an extra 200ml of something for her that I already had 20oz of to provide everyone with for free anyways. 

Girly got mad saying that I always have to fight her and then pulled out of our movie plans all together. 

Should I have just bought her her own drink? To me it seemed like she was mad at me for offering 18 bottles of Poland Spring I had on hand because she likes Dasani if that makes sense. I asked my other friend, Kitty, in the chat if I was being a bitch and she said she saw both our sides, HOWEVER Kitty wont answer if she will come see the movie despite Girly dropping out so I think she low key agrees with Girly and is just afraid to tell me.

I ( 26 F ) work a corporate job and i have a colleague ( 50’s f ) . I wouldn’t say i have an issue with her necessarily, we just never always seen eye to eye so we are not very close & our interactions are minimal. One week she was having her car repaired and she asked if i was willing to pick her up and take her home from work . ( we live very close to each other - within 3 minutes  ) . I said sure no problem, I would  just have my dog with me because he goes to daycare while i am working . I told her that my dog likes to sit up front with me & he gets a little scared in the backseat , so she will have to sit in the back while my dog is with me . she chuckled and said “yeah okay” . I replied with “i’m so serious , but i will see you” . 
Monday morning I arrived at her home with my dog in the front seat . I texted her “here” and she walked out. She stood at the passenger door with a confused look on her face . I rolled down the window and told her “hop in the back, when we drop him off you’re free to move up front” . She scoffed and said “i didn’t think you were seriously gonna let a dog sit up front over me” . I told her again - “he gets scared in the back, i told you prior this is the arrangement” . She rolled her eyes . Typically i don’t tolerate disrespect in my car - but i let it slide . I dropped my dog off at day care and told her she is free to come up front . No response . Before walking into the office I asked if i was taking her home today and if I am still gonna pick / drop her off for the rest of the week . She said “not if you’re gonna make me sit in that back while that dog sits up front “.. i replied “No worries then” !! 
This coworker told everyone at work i made her sit in the back while my dog sat up front . a lot of people are calling me an asshole and said i should have let my dog sit in the back , or even drop the dog off first then turn around and get her .

"WIBTA for Buying a Car my SO Likely Won't Drive? A little backgound:  41M, SO is 38F.  We have three kids; 15M, 10M, 4F, and a live in BIL.  My oldest is turning 16 next year and already looking forward to driving.  My goal is to give him my car and pick up something cheap but enjoyable, which his brother will inherit upon turning 16. 

I'm a big car enthusiast, but I don't want to buy something nice or too powerful,  just to pass it on to an inexperienced driver.  We have the means, but there's just other things to put our money towards.  I've settled on an early 2000s 330.  They're fairly reliable with maintenance and probably my favorite generation of BMW.  Most of my driving is a long commute to and from work, or running a combination of one or more children and/or BIL to things.  Never do I have everyone in my car.  Our van, which my wife daily drives, is the family hauler.

Here's where things start to bother me.  We've been married for 15 years and together for 17.  In that time, I've bought two cars for my primary use.  She had heavy influence on what they were, even finding my current one online and taking me to the dealership to look at it.  I wasn't thrilled, but it served it's purpose, especially when we were young and getting finances sorted.  

Anyway, we were talking this weekend and she told me I need a  small SUV.  I don't enjoy SUVs, and with the van, they seem redundant.  The cars I'm looking at would absolutely fill the needs of our family and still put a smile on my face.  Small but practical, economical and inexpensive, while looking nice.  On the other hand, she sees all sedans as impractical and uncomfortable.  I can already see her refusing to drive it or even ride in it, much as she does with my current.  She constantly complains about my car and mocks me for it, and the kids have picked up in complaining about it.

"AITA if i don’t want to share the inheritance my dad left me with my stepmom? Crossposting because I want as many opinions as possible. 

I could really use some advice please! 
So for some context my dad passed away a few months ago and I inherited a pretty substantial investment portfolio. It was solely shares from the company my father worked at while i was growing up. 

My mom unexpectedly passed away in 2012 and my dad remarried in 2021. We are dealing with the probate process and I’ve discovered my dad left tons of debt (which my stepmom and him racked up by taking over 10 vacations a year).

The issue is my dad never updated his will after he got married. Everything is left to me, but in the state we live in my stepmom is legally entitled to 30% of his estate. She already got the house and their joint checking account. And the investment portfolio i received passed by operation of law and is not subject to probate. however, i found out my stepmom can apply to get her elective share of that within 6 months of my dads passing. And honestly, i really don’t want to share it!! My stepmom was not around when my dad worked for the company those shares are from. My dad spent the better part of 60 years working his ass off and it just makes me mad that my stepmom comes in 5 years ago and now thinks she’s entitled to what my dad left me. 


So I want to ask the collective - am i the asshole if I sit her down and try to explain to her that I feel like what my dad left was always meant for only me??!? ",0.2

I love them both dearly as they’ve both stuck by me through thick and thin, particularly when I went through a pretty bad time at the end of 2022. I’ve always tried to be there for them whenever they needed me.

At some point between 2022 and 2023 Jemima and Patrick started to drift apart (what I’ve heard from Jemima is that Patrick said some questionable things that she was offended by and simply decided to distance herself from him as a result). To this day, Patrick is unaware that Jemima feels this way. 

I’ve had issues in the past where friends have refused to come to my birthdays because they’ve had a problem with someone there. All I want is to be able to celebrate my birthday with my best friends and for there to not be any problems. Even if they avoid each other, I just want to see them.

I’m convinced that wanting them to come along and be uncomfortable for the sake of me is being selfish, but I don’t want to exclude either one. They’re both my friends and I want to celebrate my birthday with them both. I’m really nervous about how to proceed here.

"AITA for comparing my work schedule to my roommates autism and ADHD? 
I’m a 21yr old female with a 19yr old roommate in a college town. To start things off, they are just a subletter for the summer, and they were moving from a dorm room to one of the rooms in the house I am currently living in. They do not have a license, so my roommate at the time and I agreed to help the subletter move all of their things to the house. Mind you, this was also 2 days before their lease officially even started, but we let them move in early because they had to get out of the dorms by a certain date, so my roommate slept on the couch so that the subletter could have the room. We PACKED and moved boxes and bags of things to our house with little help from the subletter. So we were already off to a poor start. 

The subletter had disclosed their autism, ADHD, and other mental health issues to me randomly one day when I was making lunch, kinda trauma-dumping, but I made a note of it. I knew the importance of clear communication. I wrote down all the chores and housekeeping items that had to be done, and was very clear with what I expected them to do. The list included things like cleaning off dishes before putting them in the dishwasher, no shoes in the house, cleaning up spills after yourself, etc.They did at first, but as the summer went on, dishes were being left out with food in them, pots filled with pasta sitting on the counter for days on end, moldy bread, you name it. 

I had asked multiple times for them to clean up after themselves, and they would tell me they would, but they did not. I am working full time this summer. Subletter does not have a job. They do anything except clean up. I have been keeping up with my duties and chores that we agreed and signed on and they have not. We got into a heated argument because they wanted to invite a MAN they met ONLINE who they had never met in person to SPEND THE NIGHT. I was not comfortable at all with that, so I shot it down fast because overnight guests had to be approved of, and I didn’t approve. Subletter starts calling me an asshole for not letting their “friend” spend the night, and how I’m constantly asking them to do things, never letting them have guests (even though I have never had a problem with other people coming over during the day) and that I’m not understanding of their autism and ADHD making it difficult to do common household chores like doing the dishes. I got extremely upset and said that if I can work 40 hours a week and still do my dishes along with all the other things I do to keep the house clean, they need to grow up and just learn how to do the dishes. And also not inviting strangers over, but to me these things are fully reasonable. 

Well now I am being called ableist and a terrible person, and the subletter just isn’t listening to me at all anymore, and not responding to my texts because I’m not “respecting their boundaries” and being unreasonable. AITA?

"AITA? Or do I have a bad friend? 
Apologies in advance, this is a bit of a TLDR since I’m bad at being concise.

To start off, I signed a two year lease with two friends on a house. One of the friends turned out to be a bit problematic but I found a way to live with it. I’ve been best friends with the other one (let’s call him John) since third grade and we’ve had our fair share of arguments but nothing detrimental. About a year into the lease, I had something urgent come up that required me to move in with my girlfriend. This caused some trouble since I couldn’t break the current lease, so I’d have to pay for two leases making it financially difficult for us. Discussing this with my roommates didn’t result in many solutions. They weren’t willing to take on a new random roommate which was completely fair since I’d probably be the same way. And taking me off the lease would financially burden them as well. Eventually I found a solution that didn’t burden them. What hurt me though was that John didn’t empathize whatsoever. In fact, he pretty much told me that my girlfriend should go live with her mom who is multiple states away. I was shocked that he would recommend this because he would never want that to happen to him.

Anyways, things settled down and we were able to move on. About a month later though, a mutual friend of ours since middle school (let’s call him Zack) got kicked out of his house by his alcoholic dad, leaving him with no car, no money, and nowhere to go. To me, this was the perfect opportunity to have him move into the old house I was still paying rent for with the two roommates. And I didn’t even mind paying the rent until he is able to get back on his feet. Unfortunately, when this was brought up to John, he became hesitant and said he can only move into the vacant room temporarily and then has to find his own place because the two roommates are comfortable with their current living situation and don’t want to mess it up. The problem is, Zack doesn’t even have credit built up so nobody will even consider him as a tenant for a while. 

I’ve talked to John since and told him that in my opinion he is letting a friend down. He got somewhat defensive about this and kept referring back to how he’s already comfortable with current arrangements and doesn’t want to change that. Am I the asshole for thinking he is being selfish and a bad friend?",0.65

Last year when we had it it was clear both people in the household were ordering things from themselves.

"AITA for dreading my friend’s wedding and wanting out? I (23f) am one of two MOHs for my friend (25f). She got engaged last fall, the wedding is next month. When she asked me to be her MOH, I didn’t know how much I was saying yes to. I’ve been a bridesmaid 4 times before this so I didn’t think it would be much different except for helping more with planning and parties. All of the weddings I’ve been in were VERY tight budgets

We had the bridal shower a few months ago, and she was disappointed. I personally spent around $300 to give her the vibey, cute shower she wanted but it left her disappointed. There weren’t as many people in attendance as we wanted and the gifts she got were lackluster. She acted happy, but her smiles never reached her eyes… and she was quiet the whole time (unlike her)

I was happy to spend that money as I have
a modest lifestyle (about 40k yearly, which is far more than most of the party including the bride make) and I budgeted, figuring the other costs would be reasonable and similar to past weddings.

After seeing how disappointed she was, I wanted to do better with the Bach party… I came back with questions and made 3 Pinterest boards… none of which she wanted to see. After making a sort of plan based off her wants, the cost/person would have been over $250. I’m not comfortable asking the girls to pay that kind of money… I’m not the best at communicating via text (we live over 2 hours apart) by asking her questions via text she got so stressed she texted me to say she didn’t want a party, that she was frustrated. This was back in the first week of June. 

After cooling off, she decided to wait to plan until the month before the date of the party… we are nearly a month out, and I’ve not heard from her. I tried to give her space. The other MOH hasn’t been much help because she is CRAZY busy with work and doesn’t get paid much. 

I was texting the other MOH; being a month out is making it hard for me to plan… my car is in terrible condition so I would need a rental… I don’t own the clothing for themed outfits… I don’t have money budgeted for the bach party because I don’t have an idea what it will cost… there is 0 solid plans and taking off work is an issue because my company has some major training/updates the whole month of September/October…

Bridesmaid dresses… She chose a site where I was unable to order it to my measurements so I need alterations. The dress was $150 and the quote for alterations is around $200… 

It’s making me soooo anxious and I don’t think I want to maintain this friendship after the wedding is over… I’d never ask to drop out, but I dread all of this, and I don’t want to be at the bachelorette party… help… AITA?",0.04
"AITA for giving my bf the cold shoulder over a car? I (25F) and my boyfriend (29M) have been together for almost 8 years, w/ a few breakups in between. We have 2 kids together and one each from prior relationships. During our last breakup, I decided to do what was best for our kids and I purchased a home by myself. (We previously only had a 2 bedroom apartment). My bf decided to get back together and move in about a month after I bought the place. One of my requirements was that he help financially. During our relationship, I have been the ""bread winner"" in a sense. I have always maintained an income, while he has hopped from one job to the next or not had a job for long periods of time, when that happened, I paid for everything. Including HIS car payments, all of rent, groceries, his insurance, everything for our children, etc. During that time I did get myself into around 15k of credit card debt, and I at one point had 4 separate jobs while he had none, trying to make us okay.

  
Fast forward to now, where I am hitting a bridge wondering if I am a problem. My bf has been here for about 8 months now, and he does help with half of the mortgage. But everything else I pay by myself. (Groceries, gas, power, daycare, medical, internet, streaming services)  Literally everything else, I pay it myself. I do not have a great paying job, have fallen behind on payments for my credit cards to the point I'm deliquent, and so on. My bf did not have a good paying job either, but I nagged for a few months expressing my financial worries, and he just found a new job that pays better as of a few weeks ago. 

About a week and a half ago, he came to me expressing how much he wants a new car, specifically a Tesla. Now, he just got a car during covid(Subaru if anyone cares), & it doesn't have hardly any miles on it. My car is around 12 y.o. with over 200k miles and a few problems. During this conversation he expressed that he works next to a dealership, has been wanting to go look, etc. I told him that I would support him getting a new car if the payments are lower and he just wait a few months until we are back on track financially, with him helping out more, etc. We agreed to those stipulations, and that was that. 

Until a couple of days later where I overheard a conversation with his dad, and his dad expressing that he would co-sign on it, and how to go about it. I obviously was upset because we had agreed to wait a few months until we are back on track. And he clearly wasn't. When I brought up my frustration and our agreement he said he was only asking questions and ""inquiring"". Well, as you can guess VIA the caption, he came home today with a Tesla. It has higher payments, and he did not wait like we had spoken about. And I am livid, I am not speaking to him, I am upset, and I feel like nothing I said mattered, our agreement as a couple did not matter. And he is as happy and care free as can be.  AITA?",0.36

My sister and I have never been very close, but we've always tried to maintain a relationship. However, throughout the planning process, she has been incredibly critical of every decision I've made.

I really want my wedding day to be a joyful occasion, and I'm worried that having her there will just add stress and negativity.

"AITA for questioning my teacher about the joke he made about the accident i suffered Well, today me and my brother was hit by car while crossing the road to go to school.  
The driver was looking the other way as he drove straight towards me, i got hit in my ribs and fell to the ground, thank God nothing worse happened, but my principal sent me home earlier to rest because i got a few scratches and was having trouble breathing.  
While I was at home, my friend texted me that our physics teacher made a joke about the accident i suffered in the morning.   
She (and my other classmates confirmed what she said) said that a girl made a joke that she could stop a truck with the power of her mind (by the way she is eighteen years old, not 9 lol) he answered: ""if you try to do so, you will end up just like \*my name\*"" and everyone started to laugh...  
It is nothing bad, but when i heard he did this i got blinded by rage and sent him a text, because to me what happened was not a joke (in my country students and teachers have a less restricted relationship, so much so that we call our teacher by their names. Thats why I took the liberty of sending him a message).  
In the message, i told him that i didn't like what he did, hoped he understood his mistake, and that i didn't gave him the permission to make fun of me, especially in an occasion I wasn't there.  
He than answered me that he did not made fun of me, that he was giving an example of inertia and before I questioned anything i should know the what really happened.  
I got so angry because what everyone said, was that his """"""example"""""" was joke intended, and it was not an example, but an addition to the girls joke.  
I, then, replied that if he said something that made everyone laugh, then it was a joke. And then I added that even if it was just an example, I didn't give him permission to use situations that happened in my life as an example for a lesson.  
I know it was not that big of a deal but this situation pissed me of because this teacher has been picking on me for years, and using my accident as something to laugh just made me burst with anger....  
But, still, I really wanted to know if I am an asshole for questioning a teacher

"AITA for not having a full accessible birthday party? I (21F) recently had a birthday in Cancun, Mexico. The original plan was to invite all of my closest friends and my mom and we stay in an all inclusive resort. I paid for all of us to have matching outfits and all of us to get our makeup and hair professionally did before our beach photo shoot. But, sadly, my aunt decided that she would come to even without an invite. I tried to oppose this idea with my mom but she said just to let her come. 

Now, I do not mean to be any type of mean to people in wheel chairs, but, it would become very daunting to have to roll her around in Mexico the entire week long trip. Which, normally, if it was a friend would be fine, but my aunt had a tendency to complain when things don’t go her way. 

This was even worse for me because this took a large gap out of my money. At this time I was only working a small job because I hadn’t got into school just yet. So, when my aunt started to ask where her outfit was and her hair makeover I had to try to nicely explain to her that if she wanted this extras that she would have to pay for them herself. Me saying this got her riled up and she started to yell at me and my mom about being cheap and “too poor to even care for family.” This did not really affect me much, but this did affect my mom devastatingly. 

I continued on with my party and one of the activities was a private club that I had booked that had full catering, music, and a bar. But, once we got there I noticed that she sat in the corner judging me the entire time. Then she proceeded to yell at our catering guests because they didn’t have any vegan options for her to eat. But, what really broke me was when she “accidentally” spilled whiskey on my 50 dollar outfit and my nearly 100 dollar hair, ruining both of them. She said that she had tripped because of how nauseated the lack of vegan food made her. I screamed at her and said that she would have to pack her bags and move out of the resort (that I paid for) that night and stay somewhere else for the 3 day remainder of the trip. I yelled at her and said that she cannot come and ruin my party just because she was too broke to even have a birthday party when she was my age. I also said that maybe she should put the weird interest that she had with me into her daughter who is in jail. This made her cry and she disappeared after I said this. My mom went after her and told me that I should have handled the situation differently and my friends said I was being a little harsh.

 Than i asked again in may- this time in messages if she was still coming (Cuz ppl can change their mind- and my parents were torturing me abt it) but she didn't answer.

Literally left me on delivered for a month

 Either way- i saw her again in june and i asked face to face if she was still coming because she didn't answer me (some say i was too insistent but my parents were killing me with questions about the 'invites' (Cuz i was supposed to do the 'party' at my dad's- Yey separated parents) 

She said that she was gonna come and that i was soooo annoying with the nonstop questions. Than said she didn't have to rlly answer me (tho i'm not sure if i was supposed to hear that as it was muttered to another classmate)

This is where i might be the asshole, i was so damn annoyed that she ignored my messages for a month- than was an ass about her answer last time and that now she was literally taking my attention from the test that i said 'yk you don't have to come. Not like anyone will notice' (yes- a little rude but i was stressed cuz i didn't wanna fail the test)

The mf hugs me again, KISSES MY DAMN NECK .... Like what?- and leaves without saying anything else 

After the practical exam when we got outside mom called me an asshole & a b*tch for saying the comment so bluntly & probably hurting their feelings (tho she did use more- curses lol)

I asked some of my friends if i was really the asshole but they were devided

"AITA- Party Invite Led To Disagreement My wife & I have been,what we feel to be,close friends to another couple for almost 1 1/2 years. Our children are best friends and we are also neighbors. We have game nights and family dinners. We also established a facebook messenger chat group amongst the 4 of us. In early April my wife sent a message with our availability for our next game night. In that message she said ""our next available weekend is May 17-18"" along with an explanation of why. My birthday is May 8th. She sent a message saying "" ****'s birthday is the 8th. So that weekend, 10-11, we are thinking of going somewhere like a national park to celebrate""

Fast forward to the middle of July. They came to our home for an evening hang out. During the course of conversation a question was asked about a certain drink that was had at his wife's birthday party. Her birthday is May 9th. My wife replied with ""what party?"" Up until that point we had no knowledge of a party for her. It was a surprise party that her husband had planned for her that apparently took place on the weekend of May 10-11. I'm unsure of the specific date. Needless to say, we were both shocked and confused that we were not invited but we didn't push the issue. Her husband said it's because we were not available that weekend.

About 3 weeks later I made a joke about a 'secret party' on our FB messenger chat thread. My wife wrote this message verbatim - "" It would've been nice to have been asked. We would've gone. Didn't know shit about it though. Just saying 🤷‍♀️😓""

The husband did not receive this well at all and feels he did nothing wrong. He also mentioned that if someone informs him they are busy he feels no need to inform them of any of his plans. He stood his ground,as did my wife, and it has caused quite the rift in the friendship. 

Even with the prior knowledge of possible plans that weekend, a courtesy invite would've been appreciated. He feels otherwise.

"AITA for telling my roommate to deal with his own dog? TW: pregnancy loss

Some context:
My husband (30m) and I (30f) have been TTC for 4 years now, including two rounds of IVF, both of which resulted in miscarriages, the first was missed and we didn’t find out until 11w (embryo measured 8w+4), and I passed the pregnancy at home at what would have been 12 weeks. The second, we caught the heart stop beating at 9 weeks, and confirmed the MC the following week, and I had a D&C at 10 weeks. That D&C was 3 days ago.

Yesterday, my roommate was out with his girlfriend (they’re “trying to work things out” for the 6th time in the 2 years we’ve lived together). There was a thunderstorm, and his 70lb dog started freaking out. I was trying to sleep through my pain, so my husband went downstairs to comfort the dog. After about a half hour, he came back up, because the dog wasn’t settling & trying to climb all over him and he wasn’t dealing with that. The dog started scratching on the guest bedroom door, which was closed for some reason. I woke up and thought he trapped in there, so before painfully getting up, I texted my roommate asking if dog was locked in there for some reason. While waiting for a response, I did get up and saw he was actually locked out of the room, and corrected myself in the text. Roommate said “that’s weird, maybe he thinks we’re in there.” 

I opened the room and the dog sniffed around, and then I spent a half hour trying to get him into my roommates room, because usually during a thunderstorm, if we put him in there with the curtains closed, and a blanket over him, he’ll settle and fall asleep. In the process of trying to coax him into the room, he jumped on me twice, the second time sent me spiraling into pain, and I’ll admit I was frustrated when I texted my roommate, but I don’t think I was out of line. Adding the text conversation to the comments, which started a whole argument, my main point being his dog is not our responsibility, and his main points being I have no heart for not wanting to constantly care for his dog, and how dare I disrespect him by telling him he needs to deal with his own dog.

Lily also has an autoimmune disease that makes her gain a lot of weight and she had always been insecure about it. While I think the insecurity is ridiculous as there is nothing wrong with her, I get where she is coming from after being mercilessly bullied in high school, to the point that the whole prom party was all her grade singing how fat and ugly she was, (I don't think I have to explain how much I hate her former classmates) So she was very nervous about this and  asked me to go with her and stay for a while, I was not a fan of the idea but ended up going anyway.  

When we arrived and started talking, I noticed what an interesting person John was. He studies astrophysics and I, being a nerd, fully engaged in a conversation about it, and was blown away by his intelligence and perspective, truly felt a kind of connection, while Lily wasn't following us at all and felt left out.

He then yelled at me and drove me home in silence.

I tried texting him to clear the air because I knew I’d see him again and didn't want another outburst.

Last week Mom called and said that her friend had a cat, Ryan, whom she unfortunately needed to find a new home for. Ryan is around 12, and Mom's friend adopted him from a rescue shelter when he was about a year old. She loves Ryan very much and the decision to rehome him was very difficult, and wanted to be sure he was going to a loving home. I asked why she needed to rehome him, and she said that both of them have age-related health issues. Her friend has arthritis, and has trouble bending over and holding Ryan's mouth open to give him his daily kidney pill. Ryan is a Maine Coon mix and has very long, thick fur, and now that he's older, he has trouble grooming himself, needs to be brushed regularly, and is prone to hairballs.

I told her I was sorry to hear this but unfortunately I can't take him. She asked why, and I told her that caring for an elderly cat with health problems was not something I was prepared to do, and that he probably wouldn't adjust well to a new home with a new human. She said she understood. A few days later I got my kitten, a 9-week-old rare orange female tabby shorthair whom I've named Tangie (because she tangerine-colored), and I told my mom when I got her but she seems to have forgotten. I love my mom and overall have a wonderful relationship with her, but she does tend to miscommunicate and sometimes forgets things (she's been like this my whole life so I highly doubt she has dementia).

Yesterday, Mom called and said that she had told her friend that her son was thinking about getting a cat, and now her friend has it in her head that I have agreed to take Ryan, and that I agreed to let her come over periodically to see him. Then she said that can't be bothered telling her friend that I changed my mind (WTF?), and insisted that I take him. I said no, and she said that I'm being cruel, and if I don't take Ryan, he might have to be put down (aside from his kidney dysfunction he's healthy and active). I asked her if she asked anyone else if they could take him. She said no. So it's either I take Ryan, or he's put down. We argued for several minutes and she was growing increasingly angry and yelled at me before finally hanging up.

I’m very angry at my mom for trying to guilt trip me, but I also feel bad for her friend, and for Ryan. However, Tangie is my first priority right now until she gets settled.

AITA for not adopting Ryan and getting Tangie instead?


EDIT: I forgot to mention that Ryan has a history of fighting with and seriously injuring other cats, which was something that my mom's friend was aware of when she adopted him from the shelter. I think his original owners waited too long to have him neutered, or maybe he wasn't neutered when he was taken to the shelter. I don't know for sure, but in any case, my mom's friend was told that one of Ryan's requirements was that he be the only cat in the household.",0.83
"AITA husband's (37m) alarms are driving me nuts (30f) Hi!

This is an ongoing problem that I'm beginning to lose my rag with.

So I'm currently eight months pregnant and touchier than normal which could be contributing to how annoying I'm finding it, hence why I'm posting as I want outside opinions as to whether I'm overreacting or this is something it's reasonable to be annoyed about. 

My husband (37m) and I (30f) have been married for a bit over a year. We were originally together for a couple of years a decade ago, broke up, stayed friends and then reignited the relationship two years ago. Got married very quickly afterwards and began talking about kids shortly after marriage. Baby is very wanted and we're very happy together and have a strong relationship but this is driving me insane.

My husband's alarm(s) can go off anytime between like 5.15 and 8.45 depending on what he's got on for work that day. He refuses to get up at the first or even second alarm, minimum third and regularly more than that. I have no issue with an alarm going off a couple of times as long as it doesn't continuously play but, like this morning, I end up having to roll over and kick him to get him to turn the damn thing off. I historically would have no issue with being woken up for the day anytime after 7.30/8 (I work freelance so have no real need to be up but prefer waking by 8ish, but sleeping badly due to pregnancy so I'm more protective over my sleep at the moment). 

What ends up happening half the time is that I'm up because of his alarms and he's in bed for longer. Which is extremely annoying. I wouldn't mind as much if he actually bloody got up, I get up on my first alarm if I need one no matter what time it is and how tired I am because THAT'S THE POINT OF AN ALARM.

He sleeps on the sofa now if he has to be up before 6 which is what is making me think I'm being unreasonable - but without fail, if he's in our bed, every morning (even one morning last weekend after I reminded him to turn the damn things off when we were lying in bed the previous evening) the alarms start and are ignored and I'm up and he isn't.

 NB I won't mind being woken up by baby. I can't see him not getting up for baby as well. It's just his fucking alarms he ignores. And we don't have much time left of ideally undisturbed sleep. And it just feels really selfish.

"AITA for making a light hearted/funny comment on my friend My friend (24F) visited my town (23M) last week, and a small comment from me created a huge rift in our friendship. We've been friends since college (5 years). She’s a great person, but we have very different personalities. She and her friends often made fun of me, and though some of her jokes were hurtful and disrespectful, I usually let it slide.

Last week, she and her friend came to my town for an MBA fair. They asked me to show them around, but I explained I couldn’t spend much time with them because of my full-time job. I met them for lunch on Wednesday, spent about 4 hours with them, and drove them around. I told them I couldn't join them for the rest of the weekdays but could meet on Saturday.

On Thursday, after their MBA fair, they called me. I politely declined their invitation to meet and lightheartedly asked about their event, referring to it as potentially a gimmick. She replied, ""Why do you want to know about the MBA fair/event? You're not even interested."" I responded, ""That's fair, you guys carry on – I have a meeting to attend,"" and ended the call.

Her friend later contacted me about Saturday plans, and I said I was available, but they informed me they were busy shopping and suggested meeting another time. I was fine with that.

Two days later, I texted my friend to check if she got home safely. She ignored me and accused me of being inconsiderate for not spending enough time with them, not calling/texting after work, and making fun of the MBA fair. She ended by saying she never wants to speak to me again and that I'm difficult to deal with. I didn't respond, as I felt saying anything would worsen the situation.

She has done this before and expected an apology, which I gave in the past. But in this situation, I’m confused and shocked that she took such a small matter so seriously, especially considering how often she has made hurtful comments about me in front of others.

But, AITA in this situation? I’m confused over the fact that she took such a small matter to great heights ",0.17
"AITA for not being okay with my boyfriend taking shrooms? My boyfriend m17 and I f16 have been long distance for about a year now with small occasional visits every few months for him to see his friends in my state. He is flying down tomorrow morning and planning to take shrooms with two of his friends at a view point. He called me and told me his plan and told me who he was doing it with. I told him that I am not okay with it as one of the friends he is planning to take it with is super untrustworthy and already put him in unsafe situations before and along with that resents me. This would be the third time he has taken shrooms and I have told him countless times that I am uncomfortable with it because of past relationships i’ve been in where substances were abused including shrooms. The first time he had taken them was back in December and it was after a long argument ending in him saying “It’s my life and I’m going to do what I want.” I’ve tried explaining to him in a few different ways on why I am uncomfortable with him taking substances. I used to abuse prescription pills and other various substances, so it’s not like i’m in the dark about what taking anything is like. The few people I’ve dated and been friends with had overall abused every substance they took and it completely effected my relationship with them. The past two times my boyfriend has taken shrooms he has told me he would not continue using them until I was okay with it and that he would be sober of everything for a while. Both times he’s said it, the sobriety has never lasted more than a month and a half. I understand that he wants to have fun and I don’t care if he smokes weed or drinks in regulation but I’m not comfortable being around anything else like that, based on my past and what i’ve experienced. He always tells me the same thing about how shrooms could positively benefit him as a person and his overall health and I’m open to being more educated on it in the future, but for the moment am not comfortable with him taking them. He has lied about it in the past and just tells me he doesn’t understand why I am uncomfortable with his use of it. Every time I bring it up from a different perspective and try to explain how if he was uncomfortable with something I was doing I wouldn’t continue to argue it as long as it’s not outlandish. He constantly compares it to him saying if he was uncomfortable with me leaving my house then I shouldn’t do it. I fully don’t understand how those are even close to the same situation. I have reason to be uncomfortable with substances right now and am not saying that I will never be okay with it ever. I am open to being enlightened on what he wants to do in the future but in the moment would prefer that he respects that i’m uncomfortable being around that. I don’t know how else to explain it and would appreciate some advice or education on the topic. AITA?",0.75
"AITA to consider divorce? My husband and I have been married for 6 years. We have 3 kids under 3 and one on the way. We were active people before kids but I have always been more home-bodied and enjoyed reading.

We have had our fair share of struggles and I have built up a bit of resentment towards my husband over small things. Like while i'm pregnant, my husband would ask me to get something for him like a drink or a snack. However, when I ask him, he would ask ""why"" or say that I can get it myself. And he is constantly on his phone however, while he’s writing paragraphs to his best friend or siblings, I would simply get ""Ok” or an emoji. This past weekend, my husband was out of town for a bachelor party and I went to the water park with family. One of my kids went with my parents so I only had 2 kids in the wagon, along with their diaper bag, the wet clothes bag, and an extra towels and clothes bag. I told my husband of my struggle of pulling the wagon uphill, pregnant btw (15w), and that by the time I got to the car, I was gagging, heaving and had to do breathing exercises. My husband's reply was a laughing emoji.

I feel like a lot of resentment stems from when I was pregnant with our first kid. For our first two years, I was working and studying full time. I had two miscarriages during this time because my job was physically demanding. So when I got pregnant, we agreed for me to leave work. But I felt like a burden to him because I felt like he was always angry with me. We did end up talking about this 2 years later and he admitted that he was angry with me because he felt like I was doing nothing.

I am currently a SAH mom and my husband works. I take care of most of the housework and caring for the children while he works. However, this is where my want of divorce stems from. I feel my husband rather prioritize his hobbies over spending time with me or our family.

My husband will work his shift then maybe 3 out of 5 days, he'll leave to go play pickleball. Sometimes, he will come home for 15 minutes to an hour before he goes to play or will go straight to the courts. By the time he comes home, he eats, showers, and then we're taking the kids to bed. When he doesn’t play, he's usually busy doing his own thing. He's a busy body and needs to keep his mind occupied of the next project/thing is what he claims. There are some days where he asks what i’ve done but I can't recall a single day where he has watched all our kids by himself or for more than 4-5 hours.

We have had many discussions before of how I felt. These discussions never usually get anywhere and essentially, he's said that I don't have any hobbies or I don't do anything anyway. That he's getting older and it's harder for him to be more active now. I asked him to spend some time with me and he yelled at me saying he's not going to sit there and do nothing. He has also claimed my reasons are so small to have a divorce.

"WIBTA? Looking for Advice! As backstory, I (32f) was born with severe issues with my throat which meant most of my childhood till I was 14 was spent on the operating theatre having surgery that more often than not failed or made things worse. It’s meant I have severe ptsd; I can’t wear high necks or jewellery around my neck, or scarves , and I can’t swim. Stuff about the throat freaks me out. 

Back to present day, I bumped an old acquaintance a couple of days ago, and found out they’d just had surgery on their neck (throat cancer), and they’d love to meet up properly and catch up soon. They pulled their head up to show the scar and I went into shutdown. I don’t remember how I got home but the next thing I remember is my neighbour sitting me down on my couch. 

They texted to arrange a meet up and I responded as honestly as I could, that I’d really like to be there for them but I’m having some ptsd atm that I need to work through before I can be a friend, however they’re welcome to call me anytime or text.

"AITA for making plans and wanting to stick with them  

I invited 2 friends to an event.  I thought when I talked to one about getting a table and that the place gets crowded we had agreed to 6:30.  The day of the event I asked the one what time they would be there. She stated they (I thought bf and her) made dinner reservations for 5:45.  I was like okay I'll make sure the other friend is still good with 6:30.  At that point I was not told they were all going to dinner.  When I asked the other friend she said she had reservations at 5:45.  So the event I wanted to go to and thought I had friends to meet me now meant I was left out of dinner and would be by myself until they were done. I was told that I knew about dinner.

"AITA for only slightly considering sending my parents an invite to my wedding? I (25m) have been with my fiancée Gracie (25f) for 7 years. We're getting married next year and we've reached the point I have been dreading the most; the guest list. The reason I dread it is because I'm just not sure what to do about my parents.

I'm not close to either of my parents. We don't talk very much (3 times we talked in the last 7 years). Gracie has never met them. I don't see a future where they are an actual part of my life or my future children's lives. But they are still my parents, they're already suffering the loss of one child, and they have attempted a little more contact than the 3 times that I ignored.

BG: Before I was born my parents had a daughter ""Courtney"". Courtney died very suddenly and unexpectedly when she was 3. She had a health problem that had not been noticed at any point before. My mom literally passed out the day Courtney died and found out she was pregnant with me that same day. Extended family rallied around them from the time Courtney died to the time I was born, they did all they could to help my parents so they would actually try to focus even a little on me. Extended family bought everything I needed but my parents didn't want me, they wanted Courtney and they expressed this to several people in both families. After I was born my parents refused help from family and they became very isolated with me. People tried to reach them but were rejected.

I grew up in the shadow of Courtney. My parents had no more kids after me. They told me they felt like it would be a betrayal to Courtney's memory, that they were *her* parents and just because she died it didn't mean they could move on. Courtney's anniversary and birthday were one of two ways every year. My parents would either sink into a very depressed place and refuse to do anything or speak or eat. Or they would insist we mark the occasions together and they expected me to speak to Courtney like they did.

I never felt loved or wanted. I had the basics of food, water, shelter and clothes provided. But the rest of it was not there. And I know they hated finding out about me the day Courtney died. To them it was the ultimate worst news ever after the worst thing ever.

After I moved out, the 3 times I talked to them it was clear they wanted to talk about Courtney and me being there for her anniversary or birthday that year. I didn't accept any other attempts to talk from them.

So now I'm just not sure about the wedding. Gracie's parents were horrified when I said I was only slight considering sending an invite to my parents They know what's up, and yes I mean they know everything, and they said I should still invite my parents. Gracie told them it was for me to decide and not anyone else. They told me to really think about how big of a step it is and how I should be looking to heal and help my family not stick it to my parents. I told them it was more than that and I didn't want them there. But they couldn't see that as anything other me being wrong.

I barely earn enough to pay my monthly bills so I can't afford to live on my own despite having a full time job. My mom has asked in lue of me paying rent and food I need to do the dishes and run errands for her. By errands I mean every single delivery and person that comes to the property needs to be collected by me. I work from home this can be disruptive but I don't mind. I usually wash the pots and pans in the dish washer. My mom asks me to not do this anymore, my response to her was if this is the case can she just put hot water and soap in the pots as soon as she is done cooking, becuase I do not have the time, nor do I want to, scrub pots for hours because there is sauce dried and burnt into it. Her response was that I am ungrateful and that becuase she buys the food, cooks and works a lot I should scrub the pot.

Now, this situation is totally different than that situation. I am currently pregnant expected to give birth next month and have been extremely sick and dealing with major issues in my pregnancy. 6 weeks ago our other dog gave birth to 11 puppies and I refuse to help my partner with them. The reason I refuse to help is because when he told me our dog was in heat I told him do not put our female and the male together because one I am pregnant, two the market is bad for dogs right now. And three his schedule wouldn’t allow him to give them the attention they would need. Now they’re six weeks old and he’s mad because I refuse to help. He expects me to pick up after them, feed them and handle the selling side even while he sleeps all day ( we works from 5PM-3AM) I told him I’m not doing it and it’s his fault these puppies are here and they’re his responsibility because he purposely put the parents together knowing what the outcome would be.",0.96
"AITAH for not letting my friend discipline me like I’m her misbehaving child? Me (23F) and my “best” friend (25F) have recently gotten into a bit of an ongoing argument. I will fully claim responsibility for this because I feel like I’ve just snapped. 

We have been close friends for about 2yrs now and we just travelled overseas together. The entire holiday was focused on making her happy so that her mood didn’t ruin my day and her day. It started with her inability to get dressed/makeup etc. on time. We would constantly be leaving the hotel at 9pm (most places close at 10). I would try to kindly ask her to try getting ready a little earlier because we’re missing out on experiencing Europe. I booked dinner for 8:30pm and asked her to start getting ready at 3pm. We ended up leaving the hotel at 9. I kept quiet to not cause an issue with her. 

We spent 6 wks together 24/7. I’d text, updating my partner and parents on what I’m doing for the day. She would then see I’m on my phone and stonewall me for the day. I tried describing that stonewalling me makes me anxious and I’d rather have a conversation than drag out 1-3hours of silence because she can’t communicate. After multiple bouts of stonewalling she concluded that I shouldn’t go on my phone and I should check in with her every single time I wanted to go on my phone. 

This brings me to this week. I hug her goodbye after a lunch we had together, during the hug I tickle her and she reprimands me like I am a child in the middle of a restaurant. I later tell her that it was not nice being spoken to as if I was a child and she has reprimanded me like that many times before. She tells me she acted out of “desperation” for me to “respect” her as she’s mentioned she doesn’t like to be tickled. I apologise to her for the action but I still wanted to discuss her constant need to reprimand me like a child. “Don’t say this”, “don’t do that”, “tell me before you go on your phone”. I tell her it’s impossible for me to keep track of what I can and cannot do and hanging out with her has become a game of mental gymnastics. I snap and tell her all the disrespectful and hypocritical things she does to me such as making me sit next to her while she’s on a phone call with a friend (meanwhile I can’t even answer texts), constantly being late for anything even special events like my graduation, etc. Small petty things that built up and caused me to snap because I never judged her until I felt like I was being controlled like a puppet. 

Now she is telling me that she has trouble expressing herself and that I am perpetuating that because I’ve brought it up? Repeating that it’s hard for her to talk when she’s sad. So, even the argument that I started to try and get her to understand has now become a discussion of why I’m in the wrong.  To me it seems I must take accountability for everything and she takes accountability for nothing. In the end I told her that this friendship feels like a relationship that I didn’t ask for.

AITA for sending my (35F) daughter (7F) to her father's (36M) for the week with an empty suitcase because they always complain about her clothing being inappropriate? 

My ex husband and I divorced 6 years ago. 4 years ago, he married his now wife, who has a son the same age as my daughter. My daughter and I live in a different state than my ex, so when she visits, she has to fly unaccompanied, and therefore only sees him a couple of times a year. 

My ex and his wife are wealthy. They belong to the country club, his hobby is racing cars, and they both drive luxury vehicles (Porsche and BMW). I, on the other hand, am a single mom in marketing. I make ok money, but it's still a struggle to make it to the end of the month and cover all of the bills. But, I must say, we have joy. My daughter is happy. She has friends. She may not be the most stylish, but I cover everything for her before I even consider buying anything for myself. She's clean. She's presentable.

For the last couple of years, every time my daughter visits, my ex will call me to tell me her clothing is inappropriate for their lives and that I need to go get her new clothing before she visits. I'll be honest, I just kind of brushed it off the first few times because I didn't want to rock the boat. But then something just kind of snapped and last December, I told him that if he thought her clothing was so inappropriate, he was welcome to buy her a new wardrobe, as her clothes work for our life. He didn't really like that answer and told me so. 

Before she left to visit for a couple of weeks last month, he called me to remind me she needed more appropriate clothing for their life. I was, admittedly, pissed. So I grabbed her usual suitcase, put in the things she absolutely needed like her blanket and teddy bears, but left out all clothing.

He was pissed, to put it lightly. He called me screaming that I was being immature and ridiculous. I told him that if her clothing is inappropriate, he should go make sure she has the right, appropriate things to wear. Clearly my judgement is flawed and they would have a much idea of what she should wear.

He's now threatening to take me back to court, which I can't afford, but his new wife's family are all lawyers, so they would have no problem affording. I think he's just bluffing, but I also think if I apologize, they'd let it go. I just... I'm having a hard time coming up with an apology that feels real, as I can't tell if I am in the wrong here.

"AITA for telling my friend who moved in with us to leave? CrossPosted from r/AITAH

Disclaimer- this is my throwaway!

Reddit,

I (26F) have been friends with ""Roomie"" (26F) since 5th grade. We met at Sunday school and went to different schools but got close again in college, partied together a lot, and even have matching tattoos. Recently, Roomie moved in with my family and things have gotten really tense.

For some background, my husband (35M) and I have a son who is almost 3. Roomie has had a lot of medical issues which have made it hard for her to work, but she has been working as a camp teacher until the end of this week. My husband did not want her to move in with us, but I pushed for it and he finally agreed. Roomie knew that I had to argue with my husband to get her a place to live with us rent-free. She moved into my office space and has been here since the end of May/early June.

Since moving in, she has asked me for money a few times, which is fine because she always pays me back. But when I couldn't lend her money once, she got upset and said it didn't feel like we were friends anymore. She also gets upset when I ask if she left something out or has a plan for something she left in the kitchen.

This morning, she told me it was only two weeks left to be civil, and I said if that was too much time we could move it up. She then said she'd leave today but hasn't moved anything yet. I told her she could stay until the weekend if she wanted, but she reiterated that she'd be gone today and then sent me relatively shitty texts insinuating that I only care about her when she's happy and not when she's low. (I do care, I just can't be her punching bag anymore.)

So, AITA for basically ending the friendship and telling her to leave if she doesn't like it here? I feel like I could be at fault because I told her I wouldn't kick her out the day her seasonal job ended, but I sort of did and told her she could leave if she wasn't liking it here. I want her out now after today's conversation. If I'm the asshole, I'll wait until the original date, but part of me wants to tell her to get out ASAP.

Thanks for your thoughts. ",0.23
"AITA For Something that happened with my Dad? I (15M) got caught cheating on a test, and my Dad (who lives across the country from me) told me to go pet my dogs and show them love for him, as that’s all he wanted from me. There’s been some type of issue that I have that I get really uncomfortable when I show affection to an animal in front of people. I have no problem hanging out with my dogs, but comments such as “oh you’re so cute together” just make me uncomfortable, and it’s really difficult to explain.

When I FaceTimed my Dad, I faked petting them, to make him happy, which my Mom called out, making my Dad hang up very quickly after. I told my Mom about my reasons for fake petting, as she did not know why I was “trying to provoke my Dad”, as I wasn’t doing it to provoke him, but to avoid comments that made me feel really weird. My Mom understood the story but told me to tell my Dad. Not as a way to justify, but to explain.

When I told my Dad my true reasons, he texted me back saying:

“Whatever 🤬! I don’t care what happened 10 years ago you need to get over it and when I ask you to do something you need to do it.”

For extra context, my Dad did not know that I had an issue with affection towards animals in front of a camera.

I know I should’ve obeyed my Dad, but how badly did I screw up?

EDIT: There is no trauma of any sort, I just find it awkward to show affection in front of others",0.13
"AITAH for making a dad joke My stepson, Alex, was around two years old when I married his mother, Sarah. His biological father passed away before he was born.

Alex is now 14, and we've been having some challenges with his behavior. Recently, he got into some trouble, and I set a consequence for him. In response, he snapped, “You’re not my real dad. I don’t have to listen to you.” It stung a bit, but I know he didn’t truly mean it. I calmly told him, “I’m still your guardian until you’re an adult, and while you live under my roof, you follow my rules.”

This happened a couple of days ago. Today, we were out running errands when Alex said, “I’m starving. Can we get something to eat?” Trying to lighten the mood, I quipped, “Nice to meet you, Starving. I’m just your stepdad.” My son burst out laughing, while Alex looked mortified. Sarah wasn’t amused and told me I should be the bigger person.

I thought it was a harmless dad joke, and my son found it hilarious. AITA for making a joke at Alex’s expense?",0.86
"AITA for expressing frustration about my boyfriend’s texting habits? 
I'm a 22-year-old woman in a long-distance relationship with my boyfriend, who is also 22. We've been dating for about three months, and while things have been going well overall, there's one issue that's been bothering me. 

My boyfriend is a great guy, but he seems to have a habit of leaving me on read or taking a long time to respond to my texts, even though he’s usually active on social media. I understand that people get busy, but it feels like I'm the only one putting effort into keeping our conversations going. 

I've tried talking to him about how it makes me feel, but he says he’s just not very good at texting and doesn’t realize it bothers me. I’ve been feeling frustrated and hurt, and I'm starting to wonder if I’m overreacting or if my feelings are valid.

It should be known we have an 11 year age gap (28f & 39m). The last time we slept together was about three weeks ago, then about four days ago she told me she was going to be working locally as a SB. Prior to that, she had been working but it wasn’t locally, just outta state and it was only phone calls.

I don’t know how to handle this, I felt fine with it being outta state but since bringing it closer I feel angry and belittled. She had expressed to me it wasn’t something that would happen close, but she changed her mind which she’s allowed to do. But I feel betrayed by it and worry it’s gonna escalate into something sexual…if it hasn’t already.

"AITA for not visiting my boyfriend in the night after he got a broken toe nail? So basically my boyfriend went to play football and broke his toe nail into half. I presume it bled for a while and it was hurting, but then it stopped bleeding. I understand he must be in pain, but he also drove to have dinner in the office post this incident. And then went to see the doctor with his flatmate. It was 9/10pm and the emergency doc advised him to get surgery done (normal or plastic). But then after half an hour did his dressing, gave him injection and asked him to go home. Now my boyfriend asked me to visit him in the night and he knows I don’t like travelling in the city in the night by myself, and I like 1 hour away from him. I only got back home from his flat this morning. I told him it doesn’t make any sense for me to visit him only to come back home in the morning. I just feel like he exaggerates small stuff and he just needed me to make all this effort so that he could feel better. Idk. I have been working so much and only got off work at 9pm. The past week has been too hectic for me, he knows this and expects me to do back and forth because he got injured. His flatmate was there with him the entire time and was going to go in the morning also with him to see the doctor. I don’t know I sometimes feel like he behaves like a baby and needs too much attention. I have grown up around men who when they get hurt don’t bother about it so much or even in severe conditions go to the hospital by themselves, get better and come back home without dropping a sweat. 

Am I being too insensitive? Why is this bothering me? I plan on marrying him someday and I don’t know I already feel like in a lot of ways he would be needy.. do men change after marriage and having responsibility on their shoulders? Tbh I didn’t even understand why would he need his roommate also to go with him, for a thing like this? Like he expects him to wake up early morning so both of them could go to the doctor together and he asked me to join as well since I didn’t go in the night?

I’m actually terrified writing this because I feel like I might get stick… but I haven’t anyone else I can really talk to. I’m a 39 (f) and my partner is 40 (m)… my partner is diagnosed with ASD / alexthimya and narcissistic personality disorder. We don’t live together due to his difficulties and that is something I respect. I’m NT so as you can imagine the communication can be quite hard at times. He doesn’t always understand the context of what I’m saying sometimes, even though I try to be as simplistic as I possibly can. 

I’ve tried my best to accommodate to his needs in every way I can. I tried to explain that in relationships that are built on certain, basic values and foundations.. ie trust, honesty, loyalty ect.. you get the picture.  Anyways, I’ve explained to him that I don’t want sensitive conversations that I’ve had with just him to be relayed to his family ( I’m not overly keen on them and have as little as I can to do with them, I’m not rude I just choose to stay away) , I want to feel safe that I can have these types of conversations with him without the fear of them being told to other people… he thinks that I’m trying to control him and that he can speak to whoever ever he wants about whatever he likes.. I feel like this is a stab in my back and a breach of my trust. He makes a point in telling me that his mother’s opinion will always be right and valid over mine. Unfortunately she enabled a lot of his bad behaviour over the years. I helped him get his diagnosis’s and arranged therapy to help him with his issues. None of his family bothered ( I appreciate this has zero context to the situation in question). 

He made a point that he would happily do it again because he wants to live ‘his truths’ and that he can do as he pleases. I don’t want personal information and conversations to be spoken about. If I try to speak about any issues  or concerns that I have regarding the relationship, he shouts at me and then storms out of my house, then proceeds to ignore me for days and days on end till I apologise even though I’ve done nothing wrong. I appreciate that I’m a fu**in moron for staying but for some reason I struggle to leave. I really do love him and when he’s nice to me it makes me think he might actually change. 

This isn’t the first time he’s done this sort of thing. I feel like a destroyed person inside and I feel depressed. He makes me feel guilty for having emotions.  Anyways, AITA for being upset over him sharing private conversations with family and other people?

"AITA for not feeding my friends at my ""party"" for being late? I (F20) planned a small get together with my friends that was supposed to start at 6pm.

The plan was for me to cook for everyone and then I had a sequence of cool drinks with themes and inside jokes and everything.

I triple checked the time with everyone and they all understood the plan. They were going to arrive just when the food was about to be ready. They knew all the hard work that went into it and all the planning + they know how picky i am with being on time :)

First guest arrived at 7:50pm, I had finished eating a grotesque amount of turkey by 7:30 (my plan was to turn of my lights and ghost everyone) but i decided to act as if i didn't have enough time to cook.

I fed them beer, crackers, butter and jelly.

I had over 4 pounds of turkey, cheeses, the best mashed potato iv tried in my life and a bunch of international side dishes (Spanish tortilla, Causa Rellena, Shrimp Cocktail, etc) all of it sitting unrefrigerated in my room till 2am.

"AITA for Confronting My Family About My Brother Being Praised for the Bare Minimum? Throwaway account because my brother knows my main.

I (21F) am having a major issue with my family, especially my mom, over my brother (23M). To give some context, my brother and I have always been treated differently, but it's really started to bother me more as I've gotten older.

Growing up, I was expected to help out around the house, get good grades, and be involved in extracurricular activities. My brother, on the other hand, was never held to the same standards. He would get praised for doing the absolute bare minimum – like taking out the trash once in a blue moon or managing to get a C on a test he barely studied for.

Recently, things have escalated. My brother dropped out of college last year and has been living at home, working part-time. My parents, particularly my mom, treat him like he's some kind of hero for even having a job, despite the fact that he contributes almost nothing to the household. Meanwhile, I'm juggling a full-time university schedule, a part-time job, and volunteer work to help me get into med school. And yet, any accomplishment of mine is met with a ""good job"" at best.

Last night was the final straw. My brother came home with groceries – something he has never done before – and my mom acted like he'd just donated a kidney to a dying child. She went on about how ""helpful"" and ""thoughtful"" he is. I snapped and asked her why she always praises him for doing the bare minimum while ignoring everything I do. She got defensive and told me that my brother is ""trying his best.""

I pointed out that I've been trying my best for years without any of the praise he gets, and she exploded, saying I was being disrespectful and causing drama. My dad and brother both told me to drop it and apologize, but I refused. I ended up leaving the house to cool off, but things have been tense ever since.

I can't help but feel that there's some underlying misogyny here. It seems like my mom has different expectations for me because I'm a woman, and that my brother gets a free pass because he's a man. My friends agree with me, but my family thinks I'm overreacting and being unfair to my brother.

"AITA for not giving my friend the upsell cost of her ticket?  We have tickets to a very famous singers concert that I purchased on my credit card MONTHS ago for her concert in the fall. I bought 4 tickets for myself and 3 friends. 2/3 friends paid me immediately for their tickets. 

We actually have pretty good seats and had planned to make the trip a girls weekend. As the concert date is approaching, we’re seeing tickets in our seating area (and worse seating areas) sell for large amounts, like over 1k. We are all in our 20-30s, 2 of us are married with children, the other 2 are in school. If we could sell these tickets, we could put the money to better use. (Not that we wouldn’t be sad about not getting to go to the show but sometimes you just have to make adult decisions for financial reasons). 

If we sell the tickets, the 2 paid friends would get the full value of what they paid plus any extra money from the upsell. 

AITA for keeping the money made from my ticket plus the ticket the other friend has not paid me for? One friend thinks I should give her the money because she would have eventually (hopefully) paid (minus the original ticket cost). The other friend thinks it would be her loss for not already paying for her ticket. IMO I feel like I should be able to keep all the money until the original ticket price is paid.

"AITA for making fun of US supporters because of their US clothes? I'm French, living in a city where many olympic events are hosted. I was walking in the city center the other night, with some friends (we were a bit drunk) when I saw this small group of people (probably a family, with adult children), who were definitely US supporters: they were all wearing at least one piece of clothing with the American flag. It was very conspicuous and, in my slightly drunk European mind, a bit on the nose. I walked up to them and asked ""Are you guys from Canada?"" They didn't laugh, seemed a bit pissed too. I immediately said I was kidding and we had a short chat about the US basketball team, but they were clearly not interested in a conversation (which is understandable given how annoyed at me they were). 

Now I've been talking about this to my American friends and I was told it's possible they didn't even perceive it as a joke, just as an insult. I know French people already have the reputation of being rude or offensive so I guess I just confirmed that. It was just light-hearted banter in my mind.

My friend (32F) we'll call her Cindy, is a very high maintenance person in the fact she constantly requires attention and rarely considers others. She does suffer seizures and our friend group have often wondered if this has affected her social skills as things that seem common knowledge in social situations like, not interrupting, not asking overly personal questions or commenting on people's weight and appearance seem to continously go over her head. She is also the type of person that has and will make any event focused around her.

"AITA for questioning my boyfriend and I finances I am 19 years old, and for the sake of the story, my name is AJ, and my boyfriends name will be Max. I have lived with my boyfriend for a little bit over six months now and this is the issue that I’m having with our finances:  we found a place to rent in our city that’s going for only $500 a month. My boyfriend is responsible for paying the rent and I am responsible for paying the utilities as well as half of the groceries. Recently, my boyfriend and I have been putting money together so that we could have some savings in case of an emergency and for overall financial stability. In about two weeks we had accumulated close to $1000 with majority of it being my money. I pay the electrical bill, the water bill, both our phone bills and the tax fee for the apartment were renting which is around 600 a month. We both split 150 for groceries. I recently ended up in the hospital as I have really bad asthma and ended up taking $150 from our savings for the ambulance fee as well as to get a new inhaler. The rest of the money was kept in a box in our house, however, today, when I went to look for the box to put back the 150 dollars I had taken, it was empty. I called my boyfriend and asked him if he had moved any of the money which he said that he had used it to pay our bills and split the groceries. I was a little bit shocked. My  boyfriend makes a lot more than I do and I believed that him paying the rent would come out of his money and not our savings. I asked him how do you spend almost $1000 when the rent is only five and he said that he use it to get his half of  groceries as well as give his dad money.  I don’t know what to think. My boyfriend does make very poor financial decisions and a similar situation that happened with like this the last time. We were staying in a place before and we each had to come up with $1300 for a first and security deposit. I ended up putting $1500 because my boyfriend had spent his money but he needed for deposit and I ended up just covering it because I really wanted us to move. He ended up taking $300  out of the money for “groceries and basic needs” and then we both ended up paying the landlord, an extra 150 the following month, even though that was money he promised to put back. Honestly, I am just very frustrated.  understand that he may need the financial help but  I don’t understand where his paychecks are going because they are not going into our house and transportation for him is about $100 every two weeks so I simply don’t understand where all his money is going. I feel like an asshole because instead of trying to understand where he came from I yelled at him and told him that he needs to put all the money back by the end of next week, which I don’t think is attainable for him.

Post trip, about a week ago, in talking with my sister I told her I still expected her to pay the 5K for her share of the rental.  It wasn't my fault she pulled out, and frankly I didn't think she needed to cancel the whole trip over the dog.  She flipped out on me saying I was heartless and to make this request while she was grieving was mean.  I tried to calmly explain that I  wasn't about to eat the full cost of the house on my own. She says she shouldn't have to pay because she didn't go.  She also said I could afford it.  She was getting emotional and claimed I hated her dog.  Which is true, I didn't care for the damn thing, but I never brought that up at all to her during everything going on.  She said she spent the vacation money on her dog.  I said I would work with her on getting paid back.  She called me an asshole and hung up.

    
Since that convo, i've texted her checking in, I only asked about getting paid back once more.  I'm trying to be respectful, but also i want my money.  AITA?",0.5
"AITA for leaving my family when they asked me not to  Backstory: I'm a 32-year-old woman (F32) and my partner is 30 (M30). We've been dating for 2 years, spending most of that time on different continents. My parents knew I was dating but had little to no information about him. I tried to connect with them and keep them informed, but I never shared pictures because he's not white, and I didn't want them to form opinions based on his appearance.

When I informed them that I was planning to move in with him, their only response was to tell me not to sign anything. Recently, he proposed and I said yes. I also told my parents that I would be moving with him to another continent for a period of time. Initially, they congratulated me, but then I received a mean, uncalled-for, and racist message from them. They said my life would go to hell, warned me not to have kids, and urged me to come home. They even suggested he would take my passport and force me into things.

Their message was completely unfounded, and no one has taken the time to ask me any questions or to see if I am happy at all. Both my parents and my brother have tried to make me stay or come back home. Despite their feelings, I am leaving tomorrow and have decided to follow my own path.

AITAH for not taking their feelings into account?

"AITA for telling my friend about her pos boyfriend  Okay so I’m not sure if anyone’s going to see this but. My (22-year-old female) boyfriend (24-year-old male) has a friend (26-year-old male) and his girlfriend (20-year-old female) who we’ll call Jim and Shirley. For some context, I moved with my boyfriend to his hometown about 3 years ago and I met Jim's girlfriend Shirley for the first time. When they first started talking, she wasn’t really interested in him. They stayed together and ended up having a baby together and got a home together. Well, one night before they moved to their new home, we all had a moving party, with drinks and green. Jim gets a little too friendly with me. As I’m dancing and having fun, I start twerking on Shirley. Now, I didn’t see this. He turned around and said, “oh 
this is what we’re doing now huh” and motioned his d to my face. All of this came up when another night we were hanging out at their new place with some drinks, and Jim pulls out his 🔫 and starts to point it at his head. Shirley ended up having enough of it and her and her baby stayed the night with me. When we were getting the baby in the car, he’s literally telling this 1-year-old he wants to 🔫 himself. A while later, Shirley posted me on her story with my mention, and he added me. At first, everything was okay. I have stage 3 endometriosis, and this said day I was having a bad flare-up. I sent out streaks saying, “I feel 80” and he replied with, “does sex make it worse?” I said, “yes, my boyfriend has sent me to the hospital a couple of times over it.” He replied back with, “how lucky, that could never be me.” The conversation ended up taking a turn into something worse. Back a long time ago, I was going to hook up with Jim. This was back in 2019 or 2018. He added me on snap and the first thing I got from him when I added him back was a d pic. Instantly got the ick. He started talking about that day and how he was glad he didn’t come down because he would’ve fallen in love with me. I ended up having enough of this because it was so disrespectful to my boyfriend. Jim would never message me when he was home. Only when he went to work. Jim goes to work at 5 am, that’s the only time I would hear from him. If he was home, I’d be left on delivered or left on read, but if this man was at work he was in my notes 20 times. My boyfriend saw all of this happening in real-time. I dropped streaks with him on a Saturday and he’s usually off on the weekends. Monday morning he snaps me and I leave him on read. Well, he messages me again about our streak so I remove him because at this point I’m getting so angry. I end up telling Shirley everything that’s been said the last couple of days, and now I’m the asshole for even keeping the conversation going in the first place. I feel like I should’ve gotten more proof but he’s done some other things, like text his buddy, “daddy almost messed up with the vagina tattooed girl.” She ended up making me the bad person and removing me on everything. So, am I the asshole",0.38
"WIBTA if i snitched ?? i’m thinking about telling my landlord that my roommates partner is living with us. before you jump into the comments, hear me out. when my roommate and i signed our lease, our landlord was VERY specific that we didn’t have significant others living with us because of potential drama. that sounds fair right? well, going on about 3 months now my roomates partner has been living here, not approved by the landlord and not paying rent or utilities. at first, i wasn’t too bothered because i thought they’d be paying rent (making mine cheaper) but now they have no job and aren’t contributing. i have brought it up to my roommate several times and have been shot down each time. on my days off, the partner goes in and out of the apt several times a day slamming the door each time, stomping around at all hours (especially late at night) and it’s getting on my nerves. i used to have a quiet, calm place to live in… now i live with an elephant who doesn’t pay rent.",0.07
"WIBTA for asking my boyfriend to get fired from his job for my benefit? My boyfriend (M21) and I (F20) have had a family trip to visit my grandparents planned for months. My dad, brother, and I go twice a year— it’s about a 6 hour drive. We’re supposed to leave next week. This year I convinced my dad and my extended family to let my boyfriend of a year, and my brother’s boyfriend come as well. This took some negotiating with the fam. My grandfather is old fashioned so instead of us all staying on their farm like usual, the deal is that my brother, me, and our significant others are staying in an airbnb a few minutes from their house. My dad is paying. (I’m pretty sure he’s renting from a family member for cheaper than it would usually be.)

I’ve been pestering my boyfriend for over a month to request off work from his restaurant job and he guaranteed that getting off would be no issue. However, he’s already taken off for two separate family vacations of his own, one of which I also went on, and his boss recently told him that if he cannot take another weekend off. He’s the only cook on his shift so we can’t have a coworker cover it for him. The main event of this trip is a family reunion that falls on his working weekend. He also doesn’t have a car so we can’t drive separately.

Some important context with this situation is as followed:

a) I told him a week ago that I would understand if he can’t come but he needs to tell me now so I can plan accordingly. He promised he would come no matter what.
b) Him falling through on things is somewhat of a reoccurring issue that he’s supposed to be working on, so him missing this trip would be a huge blow for me. We’re supposed to leave 3 days after our 1 year and we made a big deal about us both doing better for each other and turning over a new leaf in the next year.
c) My family went out of their way to compromise with us despite their old fashioned values. My brother’s boyfriend probably wouldn’t have planned to come, nor would we be staying in an airbnb if it wasn’t for the fact that I was bringing my boyfriend. 

My boyfriend isn’t planning on staying at his job much longer anyway as he has kind of out grown it. He doesn’t mesh with management super well and all of his good friends who he worked with have recently left. He’s been talking about quitting. I know a piece of him is super attached to it though, and honestly I kinda am too. We’re both super torn on this situation. My trust will be broken if he doesn’t end up coming, and I will be devastated because I planned so many things to show him in the area. However, I don’t want him to let himself get fired if he’s not truly ready to leave, and then have him resent me for it. I wish he had been more forthcoming about probably not being able to come.

He asked me what I would do in the situation. Would I be the asshole if I told him I still want him to come on the trip with me?

"AITA My family member is disrespectful of my time, but gets angry at me for being mad about it. So I live together with a family member and I feel like they don't respect my time. The other day she went out with some friends to dinner. At 6:00 PM she tells me she is leaving the restaurant soon and offers to bring me food. She doesn't come home for 3 more hours until 9 PM and won't answer any of my calls or texts. When she comes home I get mad at her for brushing me off and leaving me hungry for hours. She then says that I'm too needy when she was the one that offered. ""Oh my friend showed up as I was leaving and I wanted to catch up with them"" she says. Ok then why couldn't you just answer me and tell me you were going to be later.   
""I don't want to be on the phone when my friend is there that would be rude."" So you don't want to be rude to your friend but it is fine to be rude to me?   
  
The next week she does the same behavior again. She goes to some get together at the casino and again is offering to bring me food back. She tells me she is leaving at like 3 PM. This time she doesn't answer me for 6 hours and then says she decided to leave town and is not bringing me the food. So I'm sitting around hungry all day and now I have to order delivery. Btw we share a car so that is why I didn't just go get my own food.  
  
I told her it's fine if you want to stay out later just let me know so I'm not waiting on you or even getting worried. She goes mental and is screaming at me and says that she is not accountable to me and that I am the asshole. I already know the answer, but for the sake of argument am I being an asshole?",0.08
"AITA for not saying please to my dad Context: Last night my parents decided to watch a movie in my room and frankly, I wasn't up for that considering my mom slept in my room the night before without asking (I like my personal space and I prefer to sleep alone. And she snores and I can't sleep because of the sound mostly, because im autistic). I made dinner and brought everyone a plate then sat down on my bed to relax after cooking. It was going all fine and dandy til I asked my dad to pass my drink to me. He looked over and said, ""Say please"". I wasn't in the mood and said ""nevermind im not in the mood"" then proceeded to try and grab my drink from my desk (barely a foot away). He then proceeded to grab my drink and held it from me and then repeated ""say please"". I rolled my eyes and said,
""Can I please just have my drink im not in the mood for this"". He repeated again, ""Just say please."" | said back ""I just did now, can I have my drink"". It went back and forth like this for a while and it got to the point where he was holding it from me and then tried to threaten to drink it/pour it out if I didn't say please. I reminded him that I was not in the mood and I didn't want to. He then took my drink and left my room yelling at me for being immature and a brat.

Today, he came into my room asking if I was still mad. I responded saying ""Yes, you tried to make me say please for my drink when I wasn't in the mood"" He then started yelling at me again for having no manners and etc.
I wanna clarify, I'm usually good with saying pleas, thank you, etc.. I just was not in the mood for it last night and I don't like being pressured/forced into doing/saying things I don't want to do/say.
But I know I can be stubborn and rude at times so I just want clarification if IATA?

"AITA for wanting my sister to get a job? Background information, I (17 F) have a sister (19 F) who refuses to get a job after graduating highschool over a year ago.She previously had a job the summer before her junior year of high school for a short amount of time.She has also done a few freelance gigs such as babysitting and house cleaning briefly but not without some pushing.She only agreed to do her first job if I applied as well but was very difficult to work with and often refused to do what she was asked and picked what parts she did. Henceforth she did not work there for long (maybe a week all together). I should mention that my sister(19),let’s call her Beth, has had a rough time throughout school and our parents encouraged her to try harder but never actually pushed her to do better. Because of this Beth doesn’t feel the need to apply herself to any of her work. She has struggled to get along with peers and tends to blame everyone for her actions. 
Beth currently lives at home along with me, and sister (20 F) who is currently working on moving in with our eldest sister (23 F).We are welcome to stay at home under the conditions of going to school or having a job. I’m almost a senior in HS and currently hold the same job as my sister (20) who also goes to college. Beth does not attend college nor plans to. Her chores in place of a job at home are meant to be doing the dishes, and other things which she doesn’t do without a fight.
When Beth is asked about a job, Beth claims that she is looking (has also claimed to look for multiple hours a day which can be proven otherwise) but also states it is very difficult.The reason she is not taking any jobs is because she thinks that she is not good at anything. But again our family has been encouraging towards her and her abilities throughout everything. The jobs she is “looking at” are customer service jobs such as grocery stores/fast food places, along with caregiving, and housekeeping. Keep in mind she does not qualify for many higher level jobs because she only has a high school degree and not much previous work experience. My family (immediate and distant) have tried to give her many options/opportunities for jobs by making a resume for her or going out and finding job applications. We as a family sat her down and helped her apply to 4 jobs online which she claims all have not responded. Beth has gotten very defensive when asked about the applications to the point of lashing out and offending my family. Her behavior has reached the point where she refuses to do housework or anything productive for that matter (including personal hygiene). She mainly sits at home and ridicules not only my sister (20) and I, but also our mother over small mistakes or questions. Beth has belittled our mother to the point of tears many times and doesn’t see anything wrong with it. I have lately been pushing Beth to get a job which has resulted in a terrible fight where the word asshole was thrown out. So AITA?

"AITA for telling my sister that she wasn’t my sister anymore?  So some context, I (26f) have 2 half siblings (48f & 46m) and 1 full sibling (32f). I have always been closest to my full sibling (we’ll call her E) as we grew up together compared to my half siblings who were well and truly moved out and running their own lives by the time I was born. 

So over the last year my half sister, we’ll call her L, has been completely off the rails with alcohol and mental health, she also has some severe narcissistic traits. My parents (we share a dad, but my mum is her step mum) have dropped everything to help her clean out her house, but a new business, help her get on track, but she refuses to admit she has an alcohol problem. So despite their help, she remains off the rails denying there’s anything wrong. 

Flick to last week. My parents who are in retirement have set off on a 3 month trip. Which is well deserved and we are all happy they are getting to travel to the places they’ve always wanted. So they made a group chat to share photos with a heap of our family. So one night L gets drunk and sends a message saying how awful she feels that they can travel all over the countryside but not come visit her in her new location and that every photo just makes her sad. She then left the group chat. 

I got severely angry about this, because my parents didn’t deserve that. They had already had in depth conversations with L about how they weren’t going in that direction and towing a caravan through the city is too stressful. And that they would come visit her another time. So for her to continue on this instead of just being happy for them is so selfish imo. 

So I sent her some text messages. Basically telling her how selfish and ungrateful she was. And that she needs to get her life together. Truth hurts sort of stuff. 

Now here’s to where I might be the AH, in my last message I told her she wasn’t my sister anymore after what she had done in the GC. 

I have no remorse for this, however my full sister and a couple of my friends think it was pretty harsh to say. 

I will also add that due to such a large age gap, I’ve never felt really connected to her as a sibling, more like a distant cousin. 

But now I’m questioning if I did take it too far, so strangers of the internet, AITA? ",0.86
"AITA for quitting the gym? Starting off by saying my fiance is very caring and loving, but this threw me off. I’m 5’9 and 91kg so i am significantly overweight but i try to embrace and love my body. After a lot of convincing by my fiance i joined the gym and started working out. It’s been a month and it just isn’t for me. I wasnt always over weight, i was actually pretty thin but gained quite a bit of weight when i started taking anti depressants.

Id been holding off on telling my fiance im quitting the gym as his reaction wouldnt be pleasant but i finally broke it to him today and he wasnt happy. He sent me a bunch of messages about my health and everything but one thing stood out to me, i will paste it below:

“I admit im attracted to you more when youre slim.”

This threw me off and i confronted him about it as it didn’t make any sense to me? He has also gained weight significantly since we got together. We’re the same height and more or less the same weight, but i have NEVER once made any comments or digs at him. When i told him this this is what he said: 

“men and women are different. For men physical appearance is also important. You have shat on me when i havent acted the way you liked ir my personality isn't the way you liked it so is that not messed up? Kay you like me more if i act a certain way. Is that not the same?”

I’m so thrown off that he’s comparing his actions that would directly affect our relationship to my weight? And him admitting that he finds me ugly? I try my best to be comfortable in my own skin because i spent most of my life being extremely insecure, but this conversation just feels like ive been brought back to stage one, and that all my progress is gone.

"AITA for not living near my in laws now that we have a kid?  This seems to be an ongoing debate that just had another flare up yesterday. My husband, kid and I live on the west coast but he grew up in the Midwest and his parents still live there. We bought a house in our west coast city last year and have lived there since 2013 (so this should have been no surprise). 

Yesterday my MIL told me she didn’t understand why we live there, life is so much harder for us than her pleasant suburban life with kids years ago and also made a pass at saying kids now don’t feel a responsibility to their parents (and their happiness). This all came up because my in laws are very close with our kid and she also adores them. They just had her for a week and MIL was sad we were going home and just wishes for weekly access to her. To be clear, I do really like my in laws and if they lived somewhere remotely close to our interests, I would consider it. 

We live on the west coast for work and lifestyle. We are very happy with our jobs, access to the mountains and the sports and sense of freedom it provides. We hike weekly if not more, I think where we live is stunningly beautiful (and yes, a bit grungy). My husband and I have previously agreed he’s happiest where we live and doesn’t want to move back just to be near them (because we both don’t want to live where they live).

"AITA for making my roommate finally pay his rent? This situation is tough and my husband hates our ex roommate so I am hesitant to follow his lead 100%, would love an outside opinion. 

We moved in with our roommate in early 2023, he recently moved out the last day of July, 2024. Before moving out, he quit his job and wasn’t able to find another for months. We paid his portion of rent, bills & sometimes food. He sometimes would get odd jobs (yard work & such) and would come up with a little bit of cash here and there ($20-50) but currently he owes us $950 & a bill for the costs of repairing his room after moving out (I’m just gonna give him the bill the apartment gives us)

I am a very patient person and I consider myself pretty understanding of hard situations and try to give grace whenever I can, but we’re stressed.

There was tons of other drama, lying, fighting, him practically moving in his girlfriend which we weren’t comfortable with (She was staying over almost every night by the end & even staying here when he wasn’t here) When he finally DID get a job he had problems with the first paycheck and though he started working halfway through July, he “wasn’t paid” until August. I took him at his word but got suspicious when he suddenly had a lot of food again, he and his gf went out to to eat and brought home leftovers in boxes, etc. I didn’t mention it because I didn’t want to cause more trouble. I just tried to be as friendly as possible.

Our final agreement was that he would start paying us back on the 2nd of August, then every two weeks (on his payday) after that.

My husband told me that if he doesn’t start paying us back (he doesn’t believe roommate is going to at all) then he wants to take him to small claims court. I wanted to give him a litttle a grace period in case something happened, mainly so there would be no arguments and we could just be pleasantly surprised if things worked out. We decided grace period was the 8th, giving him a week. 

I heard nothing about pay from him on the 2nd, or after, & I finally reached out to him today, the 6th, to ask if he could pay us by the 8th. 

He responded, letting me know that there was an issue with payroll at his new place, that they weren’t going to pay him enough yet. He said they gave him a little bit to help pay his rent and that he made up the rest by doing some odd jobs. He told me he can’t afford us until the 16th. 

He initially told me that he could pay $200 on the 2nd, I said as long as pays SOMETHING by the 8th, that would be fine. Even $20. But he has told me he can’t, but “if he gets anything before the 16th he’ll give it to us”. I don’t feel like I can’t trust this.

I want to be firm about this and respect my husband, but if he doesn’t pay us something by the 8th I don’t want to be the ass telling him we’re taking him to claims court. I get that stuff happens, but $20 is a manageable amount to come up with, as a show of faith.

If he doesn’t pay by the 8th & we take him to claims court AITA?",0.02
"AITA for calling my partner insensitive for not killing a spider? My partner and I have been living in our new apartment for a couple months now. We are currently in a basement unit that isn’t quite airtight. This means little critters can sneak in. I don’t have an issue with bugs. However, I have a very VERY intense phobia of spiders.

I’ve been dealing with arachnophobia since I was a little kid. I suffer from paranoia, so I will usually go into a panic attack if I see one inside my home. If it isn’t killed or at least taken care of, I will constantly overthink whether it would crawl on me at some point. Hell, it can get so bad that I would throw up if one got close enough or I’d have phantom touches of them crawling on me. 

When my partner isn’t home and I see a spider, it would take me quite some time to kill it since I would get paranoid it would jump on me if I got too close. I would usually throw something at it and pray it kills it in one go. Even after killing it I would still feel the overwhelming paranoia and sometimes nausea that comes with my phobia. This is why I would prefer to have someone else kill it.

When I see a spider and my partner is home, I would beg them to just kill it. However, they are not one to kill critters. They don’t like to kill them and would rather release them outside. I don’t necessarily have an issue with them putting it outside (I would still prefer to have it killed), but they aren’t really good at catching and releasing. In most cases, the spider breaks free and bolts away into a corner where we can’t get it and then I’d go to bed panicking. 

I have told them time and time again that it would be easier to just kill it when they see it instead of trying (and failing) to catch it and put it outside. However, they are quite stubborn on this and refuse to kill a spider at all costs, even at the cost of my comfort. An hour ago there was a large spider inside by the door and I begged them to kill it. Instead, they lazily flicked it away and it just crawled back inside and hid in a crack by the door. I argued with them that it would make more sense to just kill it and avoid the oncoming panic and paranoia I would experience, but they told me they just don’t care and will not, under any circumstances, kill a spider. 

I called them insensitive for it since I felt they were putting the safety of a spider over the comfort of their girlfriend. They just went on and on about how I should just kill it myself and I had to explain it to them multiple times that it just wasn’t that simple. I grew up in a household where killing spiders inside was normal practice, so I never really met someone who was dead set on not killing one. My partner isn’t vegan or anything, so this is just their feelings. Part of me feels like I’m overreacting about this, but my phobia has negatively affected my mental health over the years and I take it quite seriously. Am I the asshole for calling my partner insensitive over this?",0.85

I explained everything start to finish to him. he’s claiming i’m actively going out my way to lie and i’m lying about the whole thing which I am not. I even called my friend and asked her in front of him what we did that day and she said “prank calling” too. 

He said” If u think ‘prank calling’ men in a car park late at night ,lying about it when questioned and then deleting call logs is ‘not that deep’ or ‘doing too much’ then im sorry but its not going to work out between us and im ready to swallow that pill”

in my personal opinion i do think hes overreacting but i could be wrong, what we did was a little childish yes i can agree but we’re still just teenage girls doing silly things, but i dont think what i did was cheating.

"AITA for telling my husband I’m over what he does on social media?  Myself Female (28) and husband male (31) have been together since high school. We have two sons. Following the birth of our second son, my husband cheated resulting in a separation. This separation lasted 6 years, where I went off to further educate myself and get a degree. During our separation we had a few trials of getting back together, and he was caught on various dating sites or talking to women.  Eventually after boundaries were set, therapy occurred, We got back together, and things have mostly been smooth sailing. We continue to do therapy both individually, and together to help strengthen our relationship. We have an open phone rule, he knows my passwords and I know his. Recently, I was using his phone ( mine was dead) while we were on a car ride with our kids. I searched something on instagram because I wanted to show him a page in regard to a place we were taking the boy’s. Instantly I noticed his entire “for you” page was naked women, and his recent searches were such. I told him how this made me feel, and he became defensive saying he was unsure how his for you page was covered in naked women. My for you page, is literally parenting hacks, fitness ( I am hard core into fitness, my husband not), and other passions related to my career. After a long fight, he agreed to not look those things up. 

Months later, a similar situation occurs, where all of his social media is covered in naked women. He instantly became defensive and said he was not sure how it was like that, that he would just delete social media all together. I told him maybe he should if that’s all his social media is. 

Am I being an asshole, for being paranoid? Maybe he isn’t searching things up and this is just how it is for him? I don’t have any of that on my for you page. Even my fitness stuff is primarily just instructional videos and nutritional information. Am I being insecure and over reacting? I think the past of being cheated on plays into it for me, and I don’t want to over react. 
It feels awful seeing all that, and every time I use his phone I am afraid to open something and see that. In all other ways he is a good husband, and we have mostly overcome the problems in the past.

My wife contributes nothing for the mortgage and the construction costs which is quickly running up to the mid 5 figures. Also, I’m fixing what I can on my own to save some money.

Tonight I asked her nicely for a small favor that requires 5minutes of her time and is low effort. But she kept saying no, or I’ll do it tomorrow, or forcing me saying I need to beg her. This is her usual behavior, where she pushes things off and forgets about it. I’ll be honest, when I’m exhausted I can sometimes get irritated quickly. And today was a very physically demanding day (did a bunch of home repairs on my own). Eventually, I got upset and just told her flat out, if she doesn’t want to help me then just say no. Things escalated to a shouting match. 

I tried to mend things calmly. But she decided that she wants to ignore me and yelled that I always get my way. She said she refuses to talk to me till tomorrow. Also, every time we have an argument she defaults to suggesting a divorce. Which bothers me a lot since I have friends who have gone through one and it ripped them up mentally and physically. I don’t find it a joking matter, but she loves to bring it up even when we are with out group of friends. 

Also, I usually do a majority of the chores at home. When she was ignoring me she went into the bathroom. I was trying to clean up after dinner and was trying to take the trash out. I knocked on the bathroom door several times saying there is a thunderstorm outside and asked her to quickly pass me the trash so I can clean up for the night. (I take out the trash every night to avoid rats and bug issues). She refused to answer me in any way. I was patiently knocking and after a while I told her I will just come in and take the trash and leave. No answer, so in the heat of the moment, I just went in to take the trash. And she got extremely upset afterwards. 

We also had arguments over how to choose a contractor. I like to double and triple check with contractors on finer details like the materials, and how they will do certain things. But my wife likes to take advice from her mom (who doesn’t have experience working with contractors or managing home construction projects). They insist that I don’t be so direct with people. That I should come with a more gentle approach instead of ask straightforward questions. I disagreed and said I’m paying 20k+ for this work and I can’t afford mistakes or misunderstandings. So we had another argument about this. 

Please tell me if I’m the asshole. I am open to changing my approach in talking to her going forward. ",0.29
"AITA for keeping a baby from a short term fling? So I went and visited a different state for a few weeks, I ended up meeting this guy and hooking up with him a few times. I told him I wasn't on birth control and we started to use protection but he just took it off during the deed the first time and we never used one again. Dumb on both our parts but I wasn't dealing with with anyone else so I wasn't too concerned with anything. I also told him if I got pregnant that I would keep the baby, but I'm assuming he didn't take me seriously. Now granted it when I first found out I definitely was like hell no I'm getting an abortion, but I really don't know if I can bring myself to do it. I had an appointment sent up and I pushed it back because I just wanted to be sure before making any choices. I spoke to him yesterday and it and he kinda seemed mad because he thought I just wasn't going to keep it. But I explained to him that I just wasn't sure what I was going to do and I didn't want him to think I was just going to get it done and then tell him the day of that I wasn't going to terminate. I also offered to just raise the baby by myself and he said he's not the type of person but he's not ready for another baby and also we barely know each other. Which I understand. We also live in different time zones and even if I keep the baby the likely hood of actually both being able to experience life with the child would be minimal. Don't get me wrong I don't think keeping the baby is entirely the best idea but I just don't know if I can bring myself to do it. Any recommendations? Any advice?",0.17
"WIBTA 7yr Relationship  Over the last year, and especially recently...I've been questioning my now 7yr long relationship..me and my girlfriend have obviously had our trials and tribulations..we met in highschool and fell in love.

"AITAH for being “ungrateful” to my SIL after she threw us our gender reveal?  I (28F) & husband (32M) have been trying for a baby for 8 years now. After 3 failed IVFs, 2 miscarriages and MANY doctor’s appointments later, we are finally pregnant with our rainbow baby. We are so grateful yet cautiously optimistic.

I have always been super close to my in laws and have never had any issues with them, in fact they have been like a second family to me. Especially my SIL (33F). She has been there for us through this infertility journey more than anyone else we know. And, as you can imagine, has been wanting to celebrate this time with us. 

She begged us to do the gender reveal and we told her several times that we want to keep it intimate and just immediate family. We weren’t ready to announce our news to anyone just yet because I suffer from anxiety and ptsd from our previous losses.

Our gender reveal day came and despite our clear requests for it to be JUST FAMILY, she invited some of her friends, and friends of the family and her husband’s family. I was visibly upset and tried to hold it together until after the gender reveal to cry it out because I didn’t want to cause a scene. I felt like I couldn’t even enjoy my own gender reveal. I told my husband the way I felt and he agreed that we should confront her about it.

When we did, she took it very personally and felt we were being “ungrateful and unfair”. She said she had put a lot of thought into our gender reveal and just wanted us to feel celebrated after all these years. She thought “the more people the merrier”. I told her we are grateful it’s just that we had only one request that she completely disregarded and that she has to understand how this could have upset us. But she insisted that we were being “too much” and even “rude” for “coming at her” instead of “thanking her”. 

So AITAH for being “unappreciative” and upset or is she for not respecting my boundaries? ",0.22
"AITA for not inviting my husband’s friends to our wedding? My husband has a group of 5 guy friends he’s been friends with for ~14 years. 

A year before our wedding we went on a trip to Maine with one of my husband’s friends and his wife, Jose & Ashley. I invited my friends, Jen & Miles. My husband and I had fun and my friends Jen & Miles stated they also had a lot of fun. However, Jose & Ash has a different pov. 

I found Ash hid me from social media upon landing. I reached out to clear the air. She claimed everything was ok and stated she hid me from social media to take a break from me, and it’s what she does when someone is bothering her. I gave her the space to explain and she told me she felt uncomfortable bc “I hate white people” and didn’t like that I gave “unsolicited advice.” I tried to figure out why she made those accusations but she beat around the bush and said everything was ok. I dropped it seeing she wasn’t going to clarify but couldn’t shake off that she saw me as someone who “hates whites.” (I’m Hispanic and Ash is white).

I asked Jen & Miles to help me figure out what I did or said during the trip for Ash to make those accusations. Jen said the only thing she could think about was a story I told involving Native Americans in Acadia NP, and how I expressed disagreement with the colonizers who bounty hunted Native Americans. I was upset I was accused of being racist towards whites for a historical account. 

A few months before our wedding, my husband and I canceled our original plans seeing it was way out of our budget (he’s still in school working on his PhD). We found a small wedding package and went that route. We lost ~10k in deposits but ended up saving a lot more. The only caveat was we were only allowed 28 guests so we had to be extra picky with our guest list. We decided not to invite Jose & Ash given the issue we had and I wanted to feel accepted at my wedding. My husband decided he wouldn’t invite any of the guys in his friend group as to not make Jose & Ash feel isolated. So we didn’t invite any of them. 

A month before our wedding, Jose revealed to my husband how they felt about me. Jose stated I compared my adversity to Ashley’s and made Ashley’s adversities seem less than mine. He stated he didn’t like I was outspoken over BIPOC inequalities, and requested my husband shut me up when I got on the topic. Upon hearing how much they disapproved of me we were both relieved we didn’t invite them. 

We had our wedding and had a blast. But Jose & Ash didn’t let it go. The friend group started blocking us from social media. We received push back from everyone in the friend group, receiving disapproval for “breaking” the friend group & being unfair to Ash & Jose. Ash stated we canceled our original wedding plan bc of her and Jose. My husband explained to all of them that our reason was financial, but they didn’t accept that. Ash claims we were bad friends for not inviting them to our wedding and breaking the friend group. 

AITA?

EDIT: I read that it seems like details are missing. I had a character limit but can share more now. 

We canceled our first wedding plans 4 months before the date. We had to rush to find a plan B and found a micro wedding package in our budget so we booked it. Our plan B wedding was still scheduled for the same month so we had to communicate our new plans with everyone quickly. Our initial guest list was 85 and had to cut it down to 28, so we both had to make cuts off our list. Everyone was supportive, including many of my long-time friends, except for Ash & Jose. My husband did communicate with his friend group about our new wedding plans and told them the same thing we told everyone: our reasoning was financial. 

A couple things did happen in between that may help explain things further. Another member of the friend group, Chris, visited us before the wedding.
We left on good terms and he and his wife told us they understood our decision to cut back on the wedding considering we had just bought a house.
After the wedding, Jose & Ash told us that it was Chris who told them that we canceled our wedding because of them. Thats when my husband explained (again) that the reason was financial, but they didn’t accept that. My husband called Chris to clarify. Chris admitted that he did say that bc he was upset at Jose (over personal things bw them) and wanted to get back at him. Chris also admitted he spread the rumor. Chris apologized. My husband asked the group for space to think and a week later is when everyone started blocking us and accusing me of breaking the friendships and being unfair to A&J. We never heard back from Chris or his wife. Idk what happened in the week my husband asked for space and idk if Chris ever admitted that he spread the rumor, but I do know the group remained friends.

"AITA for not telling my boyfriend that his mom was having an affair? When I was 15-ish, my parents had a messy divorce and my mom and I had to pick up and move since my dad got the house and we lived in a not-great area. When we moved, my mom got an okay-paying office job and I had to transfer to a new school. I ended up befriending and eventually forming a relationship with one of my classmates, ""Peter"". Eventually, when I told my mom about him, she mentioned that she had a co-worker with the same last name as Peters, who had a son around my age. Lo and behold, Peter's mom and my mom were coworkers.   
I did eventually meet Peter's parents in person, and they were nice enough, but I clocked that their relationship with each other wasn't the most loving. None of my business though. I told my mom about the visit, and she was confused when I mentioned that Peter's parents were still married and living together. My mom didn't know Peter's mom super well, but she had been told that Peter's mom had been divorced for years and was currently in a serious relationship with someone else. That didn't automatically mean that Peter's mom was cheating on Peter's dad, but it gave us apt reason to be suspicious of her.   
I didn't tell Peter about this, because I didn't see a good reason to worry him over something that could be a simple miscommunication. My mom asked Peter's mom to clarify her home life and marriage status, to which she doubled down by saying that she's been divorced for years, is a single mother co-parenting with her ex, and that she's dating someone new. At this point, I don't think Peter's mom knew that her co-worker's kid was dating her kid so she felt no reason to cover her tracks. I confirmed with Peter that his parents have never been divorced and have always been in an exclusive relationship. We couldn't confirm it, but we knew she was having an affair. My mom wanted me to tell Peter about our findings, or at least get in contact with his dad, but I kept putting it off. I had just lost my dad and my childhood home to a messy divorce, and the last thing I wanted to do was potentially put my boyfriend through that.   
Turns out, neither of us had to intervene anyway because the truth came out within a few weeks. I'm not sure of the details, I just know that Peter's dad filed for divorce, citing infidelity. Peter came to me about this, and I guiltily admitted that I'd known about the affair for weeks now. He was devastated and angry that I didn't tell him sooner, and we got into the worst argument we had had in our entire relationship. We broke up shortly thereafter and didn't keep in contact.   
I understand that he had every right to be upset with me, but I don't know if I did anything wrong. Had I told Peter or his dad about the affair, they would've likely gotten divorced anyway. I was 15 and had no business in my boyfriends family drama at that point. I didn't feel comfortable potentially ruining my boyfriends home life over something I couldn't confirm. AITA?",0.03
"AITA for not going to sleep when my boyfriend wants me to? Me (f23) and my boyfriend (m25) have lived together for 4 years. He has work early in the morning which means he goes to bed between 8pm and 8:30pm. He’s had this schedule for the 4 years we’ve lived together and until recently I’ve went to bed with him at that time every night even if I didn’t want to. 

Since I don’t have work until later in the day I stay up late till like 12am or 1am. But him wanting me to lay down with him when he has to go to bed means I just have to sit on my phone in bed for hours until I’m tired enough to fall asleep. I can’t really do anything else in the room because he wakes up easy. Sometimes if was in the middle of doing something and it was time for him to go to bed he would ask me to hurry up or stop doing it. I would just go with him but it started getting upsetting when I would have my sister come to visit for a few weeks or try to make plans with friends and he would still ask me to go lay down with him.

A year ago we got into an argument about it because I was getting frustrated that my days have to end so early even though there’s still stuff I want to do. He says he falls asleep easier if I’m in bed with him. After the argument he wouldn’t really ask me to go to bed with him as much but would just do like a sad sigh if I said I was gonna stay up and do stuff.

 Now recently he’s been forcing himself to stay up if I say I’m going to stay up which just makes me feel guilty and then I just end up going to bed with him. He already only gets like 6 hours of sleep on work nights because of his work schedule so I feel bad.

We also recently moved into a new house that has the bathroom connected and facing the bedroom with no door so if the light is on in there it lights up the room. I’ve been brushing my teeth and doing my skincare in the dark since we moved in so I don’t wake him. A few weeks ago I needed the light on so I could tweeze my eyebrows really quickly because I had an event the next day and had forgotten to earlier in the day. He woke up like 20 seconds later and walked in and said “seriously” really frustrated. I got upset because of his reaction and that I can’t do things I want to in my own home. We got into an argument and he said he wasn’t even that mad until he realized that I was mad about it. He said it was ridiculous that I was mad about him reacting that way. We ended up putting curtains to resolve it.

 I feel bad that his schedule is so hard and he probably just wants to spend time with me but it’s getting annoying laying in bed for four hours before actually sleeping and not being able to do anything past 8pm. I’ve tried to just go to sleep earlier but it ends up making me a lot more tired during my workday if I wake up really early. 

I’m trying to understand how he feels but it’s getting frustrating. So AITA for not going to bed with him?

"WIBTAH if I tell my friend his breath stinks? I always adhere to the saying ""If you have nothing good to say, don't say anything at all"" but I feel like I really have to. 

I have this friend that I'm very close to. Personally, I think he has a decent hygiene cause he seem to like taking care of his physical appearance and  he even does skincare which isn't that common to men. I usually stick around to my main circle of friends as this guy is very much of a social butterfly and is all over the place so we rarely talk face to face but when we do, his breath smells pretty bad. I would move back a few inches away whenever he's talking infront of me or I'd pretend to be scratching my nose when infact I'm covering it. I thought maybe it was just one time thing, I mean people can forget right. But that doesn't seem to be the case specially early morning at school. His teeth isn't yellow or dirty at all so it confuses me how his breath stinks so much. I've forgotten to brush my teeth before I went to school once but it never stank that bad. I thought maybe it's a medical condition but he seems to be perfectly healthy. It sounds totally mean for me to point that out to him as he reacts negatively towards those kind of comments but I really want to cause what if someone else did and they're more hurtful about it?

"AITA for calling my friend a dumb blonde?  For context my Culture background is Chinese Korean so I’m the most stereotypical Asian you can get. I have this group of 4 friends whom I love and have been friends for a little over two years, one thing I have in common with them is that we share similar humour and love to joke around , but lately (for the past 4 months) I’ve been noticing many racist jokes targeted towards me. Now normally I laugh cause some of the jokes are funny and I’m not an overly sensitive person so whenever they say something like “get back to the shein factory” or “don’t eat my dog” I kinda just laugh it off and say “hahaha” or “okay!” And since I don’t like creating drama I just play along with them. But recently my friends and I were in a gc and we’re kinda just texting blah blah blah and my friend that day had ordered something off of shein (a retail company) and said to me “get back to work” and “are you sure you can even see when you work” now normally I would just say “haha” but this friend in particular has been saying a lot of things like this to the point where it’s not even funny and it’s just getting old so I said back to her “do you even know how to use a website since your a white blonde girl” now looking back i guess that was mean but that was the only stereotypically bad thing I’ve ever said about her.

"AITA for asking my mother not to work in the morning? I (15f) an probably autistic, everybody tells me that I should get diagnosed and I'm starting to see the syntomps, btw, I really  hate big changes:
My mother has always worked part time in the afternoon from Monday to Friday and I've been used to that since I was in 1th grade. my mother can be really controlling especially about homework, she thinks school is the most important thing ever and that I should never take a 7/10 (and even gets angry if I get a 8/10)
I always did my homework in the afternoon when she wasn't home and even counted time in my mind using her work. For example she goes to work at 3 pm so I always strat doing them at 3 and 20, she comes home at 7 and 30 so I should know that dinner should be ready by them.
I gotta say I an good at school, mostly cause she stresses me for everything, and I can make all my homework and studies for the next days in 2 hour max. At 5 in fact I always have a little snack of 20 minutes and if I still need to study I do it or if I don't I do something else (I even have sports)
My mother yesterday told me her biggest dream was to work from 8 to 12 and 30 because she hates working in the afternoon and I said ""joking"" I hope it doesn't happen cause I would go creazy.
She's still angry and it's been a day, I didn't mean it as If I don't want her to be happy but I just know that if she was at home at 3 and 30 pm I couldn't concentrate enough to do my homework.
And it's true, sometimes she doesn't go to work because she need to take us to the doctor or something and that day I'm less productive than the others. It is kinda cause my mother is toxic but also because I just can't mentally do something I always did without her if she's with me.

"AITA for telling my parents to give my siblings their blessing to change their names? Crazy title. Let me explain. My parents had my three siblings before me. I (17m) am the youngest by several years. By the time I was born my parents had gotten over the pressure from family to name us all family names and they gave me a name they loved and wanted to give a kid. My siblings all got family names, older ones really, and on top of me being younger by several years and disrupting the household, there was a lot of jealousy over the fact I didn't get a name other people considered to be a grandparent name, which all my siblings had.

The digs I get over the name from my siblings have been a lot. We're not close. They resent me. I think being born is something they could have forgiven me for but they really hate their names and resent the fact mine isn't as dated, and yes I know dated is a subjective thing but to them, to the people they went to school with and interacted with, their names were dated. But they keep the names because they know my parents chose them to make their families happy and they want to make our parents happy. So there's this tension around it. But I get the blame instead of our parents.

Pretty recently I learned my brother has been going by a different name with friends and co-workers but he keeps it from the family. He likes it more. He didn't like knowing I had learned it. He said I'd never understand. Which is true, our extended family always hated my name but I always liked it and so did our parents. My siblings never had that. I suspect my sisters might be doing the same. But I don't know for sure.

So I decided to talk to my parents. I told them we all knew they chose my name differently from my siblings names and actually liked mine vs tolerated the names they gave my siblings. I told them it hadn't helped our family dynamics at all and while I understood they were older when they had me and more secure, so felt more capable of doing what they wanted vs caving to family pressure, I thought they should be aware that it could help a lot if they give my siblings their blessing to change their names. They looked shocked and called me out for being so demanding about it. I told them they had their years of doing what their families wanted and they could help their three older kids by reassuring them that changing their names won't piss them off or make them disown them or something. My parents said I was interfering in something that really wasn't my place. And I shouldn't talk to them like I had.

"AITA for working overtime (again) I (30,f) have a stressful job as my department is understaffed for nearly 2 years, which leads to overtime. Overtime fluctuates, so I sometimes work 42 hours per week, sometimes over 55. I work from home most days.
My Fiancée „Paul“ (27,m) works part time as a developer and studies in parallel. He is quite easy-going with that. He works up to 5 hours per week and studies mostly 10 (20 in weeks when he does not work). 
As I earn a lot more we decided to split daily housework 80:20.  He mainly takes over cleaning the kitchen, floors as well as cooking on weekdays. He also shops for minor groceries. I will take over pet feeding on most days, doing grocery lists and buy food, minor cleaning tasks as well. Laundry and major cleaning tasks are done on weekend by both of us together. I will in return pay for nearly all of the rent, vacations, most groceries, pet stuff as well as high priced goods we both use. He pays for a small part of the rent, the car, gas as well as the few groceries he bring with him.

So here is where I might be the asshole. Paul has some exams this week and last week. He is very anxious about it as he does not that well due to nervousness. He asked if I could take over more tasks during his exam-time, so that he could learn more and is more relaxed (he does not work during exam time). I replied that I will help of course and that we can cook together on weekdays and I will try to clean more. So yesterday he had his second exam. I called him after and asked how it went and we talked if he would buy some items on his way home. I then said „I am looking forward to you getting home. I will work a little more“. I proceeded to work until he came home and shortly after my last call (10 minutes) joined him in the kitchen. I had done under a hour of overtime. 

He first did not talk much, and after I asked , he explained that he was very disappointed with me. I asked why, so Paul elaborated that he expected I would have cleaned the kitchen by now and began cooking. Due to his exam he had nothing to eat yet and was very hungry. I explained, that as he was not home yet, I decided to work a little longer as I said. I also thought we cook together like agreed. There was also some pizza from lunch left so that he could eat a quick snack. He said that one hour overtime is not a „little“ and that I do not support him at all like I promised. I disagreed & told him, that I did more minor cleaning last week, to which he disagreed. He explained that he felt not seen by me and that I always prioritise my work over him. I don’t think that this is true, as I do not work on weekends and always make plans for us to do something together, we have dinner every day and go to the gym.
The argument escalated and in the end we screamed at each other and burst into tears. I then proceded to cook the meal with him and cleaned the apartment for 3 hours. He tried to study and then took a walk. ",0.15

"AITA overstepping talking to a friend's ex. My friend is rather promiscuous.

about 4 months ago he let me know that his relationship had ended and they split amicably. When he told me we were at a party and I was preoccupied with something else at the time. I didn't really know how to respond, but we would be meeting up the next weekend, so I figured I would talk to him about it then and ask about the details and how it made him feel. Except... it never got to that.

That next weekend he said he would be arriving later, because something came in between. something to do with his girlfriend's family. I inquired what he meant by that, since he just broke up. That's when he told me that he had a new girlfriend. he had a ""rolling start"". it soon became clear that he was unfaithful. He admitted that there was indeed ""a little bit of cheating"" going on. He stated that he talked about it with his ex and he had her approval to continue with his new girl since there didn't seem to be any future in that relationship anymore and shortly after, they broke up.

Now to where I might be the asshole.

I sent this message to his ex: ""Hey, I heard \[friend's name\] cheated on you and wanted to know what impact this has had on you. how are you doing?"". This surprised her completely, because she didn't know about any of it. She forwarded my message to him and asked ""what's your reaction to this"". After which he kept ignoring her, but he completely blew up at me. Saying that this is overstepping and it had nothing to do with me. I called him out on his lie and that this is unethical. He got even madder and said that I didn't know anything about the situation and I should have talked to him before saying anything about it. He thinks he completely hid the cheating from his ex, and believes that he hasn't betrayed her because she didn't know anything about it. Therefore it is now my fault if she feels bad about it, because I am the one that (accidentally) aired his dirty laundry.

His ex on the other hand said that with this information the situation made a whole lot more sense. She already had a suspicion that he cheated but he would never admit and kept dodging questions. She thanked me for my honesty and said that this would definitely help get over him quicker. She then apologized because she didn't want this to become a strain on my friendship with him. Although by this point he had already blocked me and left the friend group chat. AITA?",0.76
"AITA For the Friendship blowup I (23M) was friends with a (23F) and (23NB). We were friends for a majority of college post grad for a year. There werent too many issues in college but now there have been a lot of issues
 me-| am trying to get into medical school, I am taking evening classes Im in $10k in cc debt. Due to this, haven't been able to hang out with those two, even though we live together. When 1 do have time, l'm too tired to hang out with them and just want to do things by myself or with GF
 _ack of communication for a year created tension. They stopped chatting with me unless there was an issue. 6 months into the lack of talking, I asked if there was anything wrong because noticed there has been tension, they both said no
 
5 months later I tell them i will be moving July 31st-August 3rd. The day I start moving, 23NB texts saying where are all of the utensils I say I packed them for the move, 23NB says 1 bought silverware too, where did that go? 1 responded I have no idea,1 am only grabbing the things that are mine. I send a text to the group a list that was supposed to be for me of the things that I got, but shared it to my roommates to alert them of the items that wlill be missing. They told me that should have alerted them about me moving taking the utensils. I apologized and said that I will alert them
 
2 days later I get a text from 23F asking if I took pie pans, I said yes. She said that she bought them last year. The issue is, I remembered my mom bought these pie pans for me a couple of years ago, but 23F insists that it's hers. Since they weren't on my list. I tell her that the ist isn't extensive. Then the 23NB says I remember the 23F roommate buy those, even though they were not there, they said that I should return the pie pans
 
I was tired, so I sent new ones and said I'm sorry. I want use to be friends, so I sent, new pie pans. I thought it was over but an hour later I get a text from 23NB that says OP we haven't spoken for a year, but we haven't been friends for a while. You would know this if you triec to talk about anything instead of buying something and thinking that fixes everything

I said that I tried to talk with a text explaining my situation and why I haven't been there and if they have a problem we could talk. Both said there was no problem. I then said 1 don't need to hang out with people frequently to still be friends. They said none of the things in the is anything wrong text the problem. I said they should have told me that there were issues when I asked. The 23NB said if you want to know, here you go

Talked about a time where a laughed with someone who was making Trans jokes. I said yes I did laugh but t wasn't a funny laugh it was a this is weird laugh so me and another person said they should stop. We all banned them from the house. I told the person that he should be mindful. 23NB said you didn't just meet X, you hang out with people who are transphobic and misogynistic and you don't even realize it",0.93
"AITA THIS ABOUT MY BOYFRIEND'S FEMALE FRIEND AND A FEW OTHER THINGS Hi, I am 19f and my bf is 20f. So there used to be this girl who kind of flirted with my boyfriend, and my boyfriend ignored it ( he did not flirt back, he would just try to be polite with her and send back laughing emojis or just something like that?)  saying it is nothing and he has no feelings for her and he even said that he told that girl that he has a gf to create boundaries..but me being me was really upset and angry about it, even came to the point of break up, but my bf said he didn't want me to leave so we continued our relationship. Due to my constant nagging (idk what to say) he started making minimal interactions with that girl and now they do not talk anymore (to my knowledge?) even though at a point the girl constantly asked my bf what the problem was....so my question is, am i the wrong one here? Like I kind of fought a lot with him about it and he constantly said he loved me and also before our relation he was quite determined to pursued me and did so for about an year ( i rejected him several times because i was mentally unwell and had other things on my plate)..?      

I must also inform you that maybe I guess I have insecure attachment style, because in the past when my bf didn't respond me for a day or two, I would just become dysfunctional.... he used to do that (still does that sometimes) because he isn't vocal with his emotions and kind of shuts out when he faces troubles....also at points I have been really desperate to contact my bf even when I should not have(we live with our families and relationships at our age is not allowed) which created big..really big trouble for him...He got so upset due to it that he started over exerting himself in the gym due to which he even got hernia, and this was all my fault, he says it isn't my fault and that he shouldn't have ignored me (we weren't talking because it was exam season but I still wanted to contact him because idk I was afraid and insecure) but ik it is my fault. I guess I am really very very afraid he might leave me someday and this fear even transforms into controlling behavior and also now I am very paranoid about every girl he talks to. Ik I should have a talk with him about this openly but it is exam season again and we cannot do that...but I hate myself everyday for causing him so much pain, how do I improve so I can create a healthy space for him?",0.25
"WIBTA for asking my roommate to replace the headphones his cat destroyed? My roommate has a cat that is a cable chewer. We try to keep her out of my room to prevent this, but she's young and fast. If the door is open just a little she will dash across the home to run in, and once she's in she's really hard to get out. If she's not hiding in a hard to reach corner, she's biting and scratching. It was hard enough to keep her out when I was physically 100% but I'm currently recovering from surgery and have to take it easy. She's currently on her third pair of earbuds/headphones destroyed. 

Would I be the asshole if I asked for him to pay for one set of replacements? The set I have in mind is around $20, which is vastly cheaper than any set she's destroyed this far (Sometimes I like to splurge a little on good audio) It's my fault she keeps getting in, but I'm so tired of replacing everything myself with nothing but apology memes from him when I tell him his cat bit through another cable.

"AITA for doing the chores? My Boyfriend (24) and I (23) are living together since nearly a year. In general we have some designated chores (he does the dishes and trash, I take care of the cats, groceries and mostly cooking) and often just have one or two big cleaning days a week where we do the major cleaning. 

I grew up in a very strict household where everything had to be polished at all times, whereas his family was always pretty relaxed. So sometimes I am not 100% satisfied with his work. When I try to tell him, he just goes with ""thats how I always done it"". At this point I just accepted it and try to make the things he doesnt do to my satisfaction again or correct it without saying anything. He is always pissed and feels like he does a bad job, which I deny, I just like having some stuff done 100% not just 75%. So sometimes, when I have the urge to clean or do some chores I just do them without asking him for help. Sure, I could wait with the chores but I sometimes cant settle down and relax with so much stuff flying around and dont want to wait for him to finish his round of LoL till we can clean. So I just do it myself. And I dont complain or anything. But then he actually gets mad with me for cleaning. Not because I am interupting or bothering him. Just because I dont ask him for help. He says he is feeling useless and as if he is not doing enough at home when I am doing the chores alone. On the other hand he is not getting up and helping me when he sees me running around. He just comes and complains when I am almost done. I dont want any help, he doesnt see the point in cleaning because it is clean in his eyes and not every chore has to be done by two people. But he feels like he has to help me and gets mad when I dont direct him to do so. Btw its the same drama when I take out the trash because it gets smelly, which normally would be his designated chore. 

Now, am I the Asshole for doing the chores without my boyfriends help?",0.48
"AITA for not forwarding my friend’s mail  My friend and her partner are moving temporarily to another state and then planning to return. They asked me if they could use my address so they can maintain residency here and not change their licenses. I said yes, thinking they meant just for the DMV and for their W-2s maybe at work. But then without asking they set up mail forwarding to my address. I told them not to, and they said it was necessary in order to maintain residency (I don't think that is correct). I keep getting mail forwarded here, like bills. And then they ask me to mail it to them. So they want me to be the mail forwarding service when they could have just put their actual current mailing address. I am not telling them everything that is mailed anymore, because I don’t have time to keep sending mail. And it’s not like you can’t look up your credit card bills online? The frustrating thing is there was no real conversation about this and on top of that they show zero appreciation. They just act like they're entitled to me doing this. Is this crossing a line?

"AITA for revealing my brother’s ex’s narcissistic tendencies to her new boyfriend? My (f 34) brother „Zain“ (m 32) has been briefly married to Amber (f 33). They met and married during COVID and separated and divorced shortly after. This woman has made my brother‘s life a living hell and has displayed numerous narcissistic traits not only in their relationship, but as well in her daily conduct with friends and strangers.
Examples:
- Amber reveiled to our prarents (without being prompted) and for no apparent reason that we both drink alcohol. Which has caused trouble within his family as they are practicing muslims. It is important to highlight that by then the relationship has been going quite fine. 
- Amber asked Zain to take off his expensive looking watch before entering a seamstress shop.  She is receiving beneficial prices, as she made the seamstress believe that she‘s in financial trouble (not the case!). She easily earns double if not more of the seamstress‘ salary. This is only one example how she uses peoples kindness for her benefit.
- When Zain decided to leave her, she spread lies among his friends and even coworkers. (Luckily this didn’t cost him his job). As well she caused him legal troubles (not only divorce proceedings!) for which he had to get a lawyer and pay a fortune. She also implicated our parents that live in another country and tried to make them believe that Zain was psychologically unstable which has caused them immense worries. Our dad has heart problems and should therefore avoid extreme stress, which Amber knows of. 

Now, we come to my actual AITA issue. I recently learned that a good friend of mine, Laura, knows Amber’s new boyfriend, Salim. He’s 4-5 years younger than her and described by Laura as ‘innocent.’ Laura didn’t know about the abuse that occurred during my brother’s marriage, so after some reflection, I decided to share the whole story with her. She was shocked and plans to figure out how to speak to Salim and reveal the past abuse to him.

Should I have refrained from revealing Amber’s toxic behavior to Laura and avoided meddling in someone else’s relationship?

Additionally, I’m aware that by doing this, I’ve potentially exposed myself and my brother to Amber’s attention again, which could lead to another round of issues. While I can’t predict how she might cause further harm, she has repeatedly proven to be very creative and determined in these matters.

I never said anything but the tattoo involves getting the time our son was born at in it on a stop watch. If she gets him to do it my problem is every time I see it all I will think about is them sleeping together while this is a very personal thing in our relationship.

"AITA for stealing my brother's car Am I (42M) the asshole for ""stealing"" my (30M) brother's car?

Last year, we both put half down on a used Honda (deep, midnight blue, with two scratches on the hood, shaped like lopsided 3-quarter-hearts). We live together, with our Mother, she has her own car( Mini. Beautiful red color. No dents.) She needs it for work.  So it made sense for us to get our own rides, (my bother recently got a job) and I just broke up with my long time girlfriend, who had been driving me.

Anyways, I had a busy schedule yesterday, I went to my club, left BEFORE 12, went into the city, purchased a book, and came home to find my brother standing in the driveway. Apparently, he had ""needed"" the car, a need he had not informed me of, and I had ""stolen"" it. I asked why he didn't call me, if he had needed it so badly, but he just got defensive.

"AITA if I don’t share my discount on rent with my roommate? I recently graduated and am planning to move in with a friend from college because we both got jobs in the same city. We were touring a few places and settled on one we both liked and agreed to go 50/50 on rent since it was a 2 bed 2 bath apartment with both rooms being the same size. Near the end of the tour we were checking out the outdoor area and a small grease fire started from one of the grills. I quickly grabbed a nearby fire extinguisher and took out the fire. The apartment manager thanked me and said she’d get back to me about a potential discount on rent. I heard back yesterday and she said we’d get $100 off each month for our 12 month lease. It was $2400 a month for the entire until, now discounted to $2300 a month. I was thinking the discount would be applied entirely to my portion (I pay $1100, he pays $1200) since I was the one who took out the fire. My roommate thinks it should still be 50/50 (we each pay $1150). He is refusing to sign the lease and pay the deposit until I agree but I think he’s bluffing since his job is starting in two weeks and it’s going to be a lot of work to find another roommate and another place (I was the one who found all the places and set up the tours).

AITA for putting a stop to my mom’s gossip?  My mom was having major financial hardship after my dad died. She blew through all of the money for things like cruises and travel. She tried down sizing and sold her home only not to realize the price of renting in a place that she always wanted to live and found herself evicted and facing homelessness. I was stupid enough to let her move in thinking she would be grateful. She acts like my husband and I are bad teenagers and whatever. My husband works rotating 3rd shift for the utilities company. So his sleep pattern is different. He has his on bedroom that’s sound proof and light proof.  It’s larger than what my mom has and she has to share the bathroom room with our kids while both my husband room and my room have attached bathroom. These is also a half bath on the main floor. My mom wants my husband’s room or my room and I tried explaining that because of our schedules we sleep separately.  We moved the boys around for her to share a bedroom but it doesn’t seem good enough for her. Now she has told family members my husband is on drugs because of his sleeping habits. “He does nothing but sleep all day” my sister called me concerned about it.  The gossiping about my husband pissed me off that I told my mom she needs to go move in with my sister since she likes to talk shit about us. My sister acts like it was ok for my mom to talk about my husband and question if he’s “on drugs” it was a valid point to make. It like no he sometimes works long ass hours from midnight to 2 am and he’s fucking exhausted. We told my mom she has to move out now and she acts like she understands better and she will watch what she says. I told my sister to come get mom and my sister is angry because she has a much smaller apartment and mom will have to get rid of a lot of her junk to move in with her.

"AITA if I don’t tell my boyfriend I’ve been the other woman before? I 24F and my boyfriend 27M, have been together a few months. For context: We’re at the point where we’re saying I love you, and I believe whole heartedly he’s the one. I’ve been through a lot of rocky relationships and with him it feels so easy, even when we have disagreements. The whole cheesy, when you know you know, I understand it now. 

Two years ago, I drunkenly slept with a married man. At this point he had been married years and I was the 6th or 7th ‘other woman’. It made me absolutely sick to my stomach. Ive never ever cheated or even had thoughts to, even in my worst toxic relationships. I know I could never do that to someone. However I was at a low point in that period of time, I was drinking everyday, hating myself and struggling with depression. It felt good to be wanted at all, even by someone I actually despised. That guy and his wife ended up getting divorced. And it ate away at me so I cut him off. No matter my mental state at the time, I will forever be unable to forgive myself for even being part of causing someone so much pain whether she had chose to stay after so many times of it happening prior (which is how I tried to excuse it at the time). 

That brings me to now. I love my boyfriend with my whole heart, I wanted to tell him sooner but I’ve been so terrified every time I go to bring it up. But I feel like I owe him the honesty, while at the same time worry that telling him will ruin things for us; even though I know in my heart I’d never cheat on him or involve myself in those behaviors again. I’ve got advice from friends and family going both ways, tell him, don’t tell him. He has been cheated on many times in the past so I’m scared it will make him think I’ll cheat on him even though I know for a solid fact I would never ever do that. Part of me feels like it’s better, to protect him from that moment in my past, knowing I’ll never make him feel that way. But the other part of me feels like he’d feel betrayed it if I didn’t share it. 

Do I tell him? Do I take it to my grave? Do I tell him now, do I tell him years down the line when he truly has seen my actions speak for themselves. I don’t know, please tell me. I want to do the right thing. How do I go about telling him, if/when I do?",0.32

Her followup question was how it went away, and I told her I had surgery on it. Her mood changed, and she started asking a lot of ""Why"" questions.

"AITA for refusing to drive my stepkids and their friends to their summer activities? I (40m) have two stepkids. My stepson is 14 and my stepdaughter is 12. I married their mom when they were 4 and 6 years old. Their parents divorced had been divorced 3 years by then. My wife's ex doesn't like me. He didn't want the divorce to stay. He tried many times to get her back. He also tried to sue for custody of my stepkids and leave the state after we got married. It's been a challenge with him. My wife and her ex have spent more time in court than I ever realized possible over custody disputes. 

Over time, with their dad's very negative attitude toward me, my stepkids started having the negative attitude toward me too. My wife in the beginning was good about stepping in and not making me the bad guy. Then she faltered. Then she would tell me to leave it to her because it would make her ex's anger worse if the kids were telling him I was parenting them.

It was an added challenge when we had two kids together who are now 6 and 4. It's messy and not healthy. So we have been in family therapy and marriage therapy because I don't feel like my wife does enough to help bring peace to the household. She'll make plans with one or both of her kids and then ask me to do it but not tell them. It pisses them off. But then she'll tell me to be careful that her ex doesn't see me with her kids other times or he'll be in their ears more and spewing more negativity.

I make time for all four kids 1:1 but my stepkids hate it and make their feelings about me clear. They also made it clear they want their parents back together and repeat many awful things their father says about me.

Marriage therapy has been a make or break thing for the last 2 months. My wife is intervening far less than before. My biggest issue is mean comments made toward our kids together. I'm a grown man so while not pleasant, I can handle it. But the kids? They don't deserve it. And the disrespect and hurtful comments have increased a lot in the last 4 or so months.

Last Thursday my wife had made plans but had also agreed with some other parents to take my stepkids and their friends to their activities. I was already supposed to have my afternoon with our two kids. But then she wanted me to do it since her ex wouldn't (court order specifies they ask each other first before non-parents). My stepkids heard her ask me and protested and said some more hurtful things and so I told my wife no. She got mad and told me I couldn't let our kids down. My stepkids yelled they weren't my kids. I told my wife that's the answer to that. I went with my bio kids as planned and when we had therapy Monday she brought it up and said I was an ass and had shown I don't care about her kids. We argued about it again yesterday and I told her it's not that I don't care, but I'm not willing to deal with the disrespect when even she can't respect me enough to step in anymore. She told me I had proven I couldn't be trusted to be there. That I was a bad husband and father.

When I received the position paper from the company I immediately prepared my response per item in an excel file and arrange all corresponding attachment on google drive. I sent it to him at once. He was not able to finish our response so we ask for extension which was granted by the court. I know he was so busy so I dared not followed up but waited for him so we can discuss my response. We were not able to meet to discuss. Then a day before the submission I followed up. He start messaging me at around 1am of the day we are supposed to submit. I soon found out that he did not open the file I sent and have not checked the attachments. I was panicking already. At around 9am I asked if he can send me the draft. He sent. We are to send it 2pm so I can no longer change anything. He arrange to send me the actual docs around 2pm at NLRC. I had no chance to edit wrong infos anymore since it already deadline.

"WIBTA if confronting my daughter and friends for ogling Olympic divers? Daughter (16F) is on her school's swim team. It's a small school so they are not super competitive but they try hard and have fun, I'm for it.

Our place is sort of the go-to hangout so she and a bunch of her friends/teammates were piled up here last week watching the Olympics, especially swimming and diving. They appreciate the sports but especially seemed to be enjoying gawking at the boys. I did overhear some lamenting that the male swimmers all wear jammers now but ""Thank God the divers are still in little speedos."" I heard that more than once. Lots of giggling.

Yesterday I was straightening up the rec room where our big TV is (where they had been watching) and ran across an open spiral notebook. I glanced at it (didn't know whose it was) and saw that the girls had been ranking the male divers. But not on their dives. They had lists where they were pretty much ranking their body parts. Cutest face. Best pecs. Best abs. Smallest swimsuit. Cutest belly button. Best butt. Best bulge. Biggest bulge (apparently bulges warrant two categories). And on and on.

I was really disappointed in my daughter, blatantly objectifying the guys, when I know that as a young woman that is something that they deal with themselves.

I told my wife about it expecting her to be equally as horrified, but she literally laughed it off. In fact she said ""Are you kidding? I'd give that Tom Daley a bath in the sink like a baby"" which I thought was an incredibly gross thing for a middle aged woman to say.

I had planned on really confronting my daughter about this behavior and reading her the riot act, but now I'm torn. If she and her friends are saying this about strangers, how are they behaving around the boys on her school's swimming and diving teams?

I talked with one over zoom, she asked questions and she said she is unsure when she’d be moving so she’ll let me know once she knows. This was July 14th. 


July 29th I haven’t heard anything from her since. I text her asking what day she’d be arriving here. She texts me back and says she’s “planning to arrive late on Tuesday Aug 6th”. 


Friday August 2nd she asks if it’s okay for her partner to stay for few days because he’s helping with the drive and move. She adds that she’s sorry she forgot to ask this earlier. I text her back: “Yeah that’s fine, when is he flying back? (Edit)”. No response. 

Saturday August 3rd still no response. So I text her: “Hi xxx, since I didn't hear back from you... it is fine if he is helping you with the move but just wanted to let you know that he can't stay more than 2 nights.” No response. 

Sunday. Nothing. 

Monday. Nothing. 

Tuesday August 6th. Until 4pm, nothing.
At this point I am annoyed. I decided to text her: “Hi xxx, I think I have waited long enough. Since you did not respond to any of my messages, I am assuming you are not coming to my place but just wanted to let you know that I decided not to rent my place to you anymore.” 

One hour later she says: 

“As you know the past few days I've been making a huge life move by packing up all my things, saying goodbye to friends and family, and am currently driving across the country. This is why I forgot to reply to a text message in a few days. 

This is incredibly cruel to use your power in this way. I'm starting a new chapter of my life in this PhD program and now have no home. I hope the rest of the community in this program is not so cold and callous.” 


I respond: 
“Seriously? xxx, you had days to respond to me and let me know. (Edit) You have not communicated anything with me other than you were planning to arrive late today which I wasn't even sure if that was actually happening because that was before you gave me last minute notice of your boyfriend coming as well. (Edit)

Like you said, I know you are starting a new chapter in life and packing things and moving etc. but guess what, I have done that too and texting to let people know of my whereabouts was not that hard. 
Also like you said, I am cold and callous but you should know that you need to learn how to communicate with people. 
You said ""your power"" but I did not claim that power. Please know that that power only became a power because you left me uninformed. 
Also next time instead of responding back the way you did, maybe simply explain what happened and try to negotiate. I was left with no answer from you for days and it was not only unprofessional, but also disrespectful of me and my time. (Edit)” ",0.25
"AITA for using a credit card for groceries that is owned by my grandma who has dementia? I hate that I’m writing this.

I was raised by predominantly my wonderful grandma due to my mums mental health difficulties and dad being absent. We have had the closest and best bond my whole life. My nan has had a rapid decline in the last few month and suspected dementia, she now requires carers daily and it’s a very sad situation. I miss her. My grandma gave her whole life to raise me and my mum, everything she had! 

I am f25 my mum is 45 and grandma 77. 

My mum has BPD and her struggles have lead to not being good with money. Shes been in debt and often relies on my nan to pay her way, car, Botox, rent. I don’t think bad of my mum for her struggles but she has often asked me for money and relies heavily on others to get by due to reckless spending in the past. 

3 years ago my nan took me to the bank to get a credit card, she owns the account but the card is in my name. This was an agreement she insisted on I could get any groceries or travel with. She wanted to give me this support while I was graduating and looking for work. 


I have worked since I was 16 and while at university and saved a decent amount. This year I spent some time abroad and was out of work due to health issues so I used a massive chunk. I’ve always wanted to be able to stand on my own two feet after seeing my mums ways. 

My mum in the last few months has now got control of all my nans bank accounts. Shes found out about me having “a credit card owned by grandma” and my purchases. She has told my nan who is quite confused that I am stealing from her. She’s really angry at me and has sent me various text messages eluding to my dishonesty and her shock. 

I feel so guilty? I would say in the whole 2 years I’ve spent less than £370 on the card. It’s always been for groceries, travel or sometimes the post office.

"AITA for telling my friend that her boyfriend is gay   My friend (28F) her boyfriend “Tim” (29M) is always making jokes about balls, getting in bathtubs with men, being obsessed with men. It’s gone far past the “average” level of joking for a straight man. It’s very, very apparent that he’s oftentimes thinking about other men… that’s all he jokes about. Tim is very flamboyant (and I am not trying to play into the “gay men” stereotype here but like…). Anyway, I didn’t say anything… I figured I’d let my friend and Tim figure out what their sexual preferences are and it’s kind of my business. 

Well, a few days ago, my friend came to me very upset and said that Tim has really lost interest in being with her physically and said she doesn’t feel wanted. She said that on their last vacation (with friends) all hid did was pay attention to his guy friends. He wanted to swim with them, drink with them, hang with them. Not her. 

She also drops the bombshell on me that a while back Tim was at the pool with his guy friends and they all whipped out their meat and started “helicoptering” to each other. 

Um… wut. 

Now don’t get me wrong, if Tim is not straight… that’s Tim’s business. But, maybe don’t drag my friend around while you’re trying to figure that out.

Anyway, I told my friend that I think… Tim likes peen. She was defensive… “No, he doesn’t! He was just in a frat and all frat guys act kinda gay sometimes. It’s normal!”

I was like, “Girl, most straight men don’t helicopter to each other. Most straight men don’t NOT wanna have intimate relations with their girlfriends. Most straight men don’t spend 90% of their voice talking about other men and making jokes about loving balls…” 

She got super upset with me and very defensive “ 
You think my boyfriend doesn’t love me and can never love me!”

I told her, no, “I think he loves you, like a friend.”

Anyway, she was pissed. Now, she won’t respond to my texts. AITA? 

I feel like if she didn’t want my honest opinion she shouldn’t have brought it up. She’s the one that was venting to me & I am not going to lie to her like “Everything’s okay with your relationship! That’s totally normal!” when it isn’t. Maybe I could’ve been more tactful but idk. I feel like she’s in denial and is taking it out on me.",0.67
"AITAH for wanting equal financial treatment from my parents? My parents came into some $ a few years back, nothing extreme. Gave my brother and I both $80k to help with bills. Then, when my brother got divorced, my parents helped him by buying the house he and his ex lived in (he doesn't pay a mortgage, house is in his and my parents' names).

He now wants to sell his/their house to build a new (smaller) one on some property my family owns. Realtor wants to list it for $450k. Today, my mom said ""...and I told your brother that if the house sells, I'm keeping about $200k - the bulk of which will go to you."" I'm thinking ""Great!"". Then today, however, she casually brought up the numbers and said only about $100k to me if it sells.

I said ""so he might get $350k (hypothetically) to build a new house?"" My mom says ""well no not all of it, but he does want a pole barn as well on the property, but we told him he can't do all the top-of-the-line new house stuff"".

My wife and I aren't rich by any means. We have 3 kids and debt. My parents would absolutely help us if we ever needed assistance or emergency funds. I don't usually ask for anything from them. We have a great relationship. But am I the asshole to want to go back to her and nicely say that my brother might now be getting over $250k more than me? 

I know this sounds like a selfish/first-world problem or whatever you call it. But I don't think it's technically fair and am curious how to approach it.

TLDR: my parents might be giving my brother a lot of extra cash to buy a house he doesn't necessarily need and giving me less than half.",0.85

"AITA for almost crying because of my gym teacher?

BUT NOOO. He brought me inside the gym and asked why i had my phone, i had no time to make an excuse so i stupidly said “i was just texting my mom” and brushed it off, BUT THEN, he said “show me” i was like okay- so when he saw i lied he was so upset and kept being mean to me abt it.

"AITA for calling my dad out after he screwed over my husband? Throwaway acc just in case.

For background info, my dad (51m) and I (25f) have a strained relationship. He ended up going to jail, losing custody of me and vanished for 2 years. Since then, he’s been in and out of my life.

In 2017 he turned his life around, married his 3rd wife, held a regular job, saw a therapist, and acted like a decent human. He never apologized for what he did but he seemed to be turning a new leaf so I thought our relationship would level out.

His 3rd wife passed away in 2020. When she passed, I had to drive across the country to be with my dad and my husband happily joined me because he wanted to be there for my dad. Despite having no obligation, my husband came along and was really a rock for my dad. My dad moved to be closer to us after this and my husband still provided lots of support for him.

In 2023, he gets remarried. My dad and new wife have come to my husband twice to get amazing deals on new cars since my husband is a manager at a dealership. Both times, they had my husband jumping through hoops for at least a month. I get that there is a lot of back and forth when buying something so expensive, but they took it to the next level with asking for changes.

Come July, we fall on hard times which my dad knew. July 1st my dad texted my husband again saying he wanted another car. My dad went back and forth over 9 different cars, contacting husband about 100 times during the month, on and off the clock. Then, my dad decided he wanted a special edition car that is very hard to find. My husband reworked it all AGAIN based on having this car shipped in from across the country. On Wednesday, my husband let my dad know it will be a process since the vehicle has to be shipped and my dad said there was no rush, they just wanted the car by the end of the year.

Come Friday, my husband hadn't heard from my dad at all. He reached out to touch base and my dad sends a text saying, ""Well we didn't hear from you right away on Wednesday so we went and bought one elsewhere."" Now, they are entitled to buy where they please. I just think it was a dick move.

What I’m really upset about was they knew we were struggling financially and even though my husband wouldn’t have made much profit, he’d have gotten an extra bonus since it was a special edition. They knew my husband was losing time to sell to other people and still took up so much of his time. Then they bought this car elsewhere, didn't tell my husband so he wasted an extra 3 days trying to get a car here that my dad wasn't even going to purchase, and didn’t even thank him.

I became fed up with my dad after all he’s done and texted him I was disappointed he would do that to my husband after everything he’s done for them and not even say thanks. My dad was pissed and went off on me.

Everyone I talked to agrees what my dad did was wrong and that I was right to stand up for my husband. But I can't help but feel like I might have overreacted. AITA?",0.02
"AITAH for wanting a kid free wedding day? My (F24) boyfriend (M25) and I have been together for 2.5 years by now.

"AITA for making plans for this weekend? AITA for making plans for my goddaughters birthday on a day she is staying with us, without consulting her parents specifically?

I (M36) and my wife (F46) have a F13/14 year old goddaughter. 
This Friday she (F13, turning 14 on Sunday) is staying overnight with us, with one of her friends (F14), and my wife’s daughter (F16) from a previous relationship. They are very good friends and we often have this group of 3 for sleepovers in school holidays etc.

We planned it with Goddaughters parents (both very close friends to me and my wife) over a month ago. We arranged that we would collect the girls Friday afternoon, have the sleepover and then meet up as a group for dinner on Saturday night for her birthday. No specific time was said. 

We booked to take the group to an event they all really want to go to (Goddaughter especially)). The event is a family activity, once a year. Last year we attended as a big group and it was universally enjoyed. 
The event has a “finale” which starts at 3.30pm, meaning we wouldn’t likely be home until around 5. Our thinking was then 1/1.5 hour for the group to have a quick shower and change in preparation for dinner. 

Today, in our extended friends/family group chat, it was said that the birthday dinner is booked at 5.30, at a restaurant 35/45 mins away from us. 
When we normally eat out, even on weekends, table is normally booked for 6.30/6.45. 

I asked goddaughter which she’d rather do, if we went to the place she’d picked for food, we’d have to leave the event before the big finale. Her response was “we can eat somewhere else, I want to see the big finale”. 
I messaged my friend (goddaughter’s dad) to convey this. 

We end up speaking on the phone and he says because we didn’t discuss the fact we are attending the event, and that they decide what the schedule is and not Goddaughter, I am in the wrong and I should have talked to them specifically about such plans, I shouldn’t be making these types of plans with her as she is a child.

My view is that we had talked about the overarching plan which was the sleepover and next day and then dinner.
I said we don’t normally do dinner that early, and he replied that it had to be due to some family members attending had to leave early, and the place Goddaugter chose was busy, 5.30 was the only option. 

I said that I believe it was Goddaughers choice. She is turning 14, it’s her birthday weekend, the event is part of her birthday present from us, she should be able to choose what her priority is. He disagreed and stated the booking is made, he expects us to be there with Goddaugher.  

Current plan, with goddaughers begrudging acceptance is that we will go to the event but leave early to satisfy her parents.  She is visibility unhappy about this and doesn’t understand why her parents won’t simply let her choose somewhere else to eat at a more “normal” time so she can do both.  


They have not had to pay any deposit on the restaurant booking. I have pre-paid tickets to the event.

"AITA for not paying my brother back straight away or is he overreacting? Throw away account.

for context: I've attended therapy sessions where I discovered my brother is the reason for some of my issues. When he was younger he attended anger management classes which didn't help that much. Mom has said to me in the past that she is at a loss of how to control him/get his behaviour in line.

2 days ago my (M early 20s') brother (mid 20's) went and brought a present for our mom. I found it online and we decided to get it. The plan was for me to go & buy it then have him transfer money, but something came up last minute so l couldn't and I asked him to. I was in a rush to get ready to go out and was waiting to hear what he got (there is a few different models at different prices). He sent me a picture of one, I said “that's good"" at 5pm. The reason I didn't send money then was bc A. didn't know his bank details & B. was unsure if he was going to get anything else. The next day at  10 when I was in class I asked for how much I owed and his details & he replied straight away. I replied at midday saying I'll send it through when l'm not at uni (Monday is my busiest day & had back to back classes all day). He asked when I said ""uh like 4"" to which he asked why I couldn't do it then. I explained how I was in class and I couldn't, which he got very angry about.

I then went to an event where I had to have my phone turned off. It ended up running late (around 6 when I thought it would be 4-4:30), and when I turned my phone on I had 10+ messages which started with please but then got more angry and 4 missed calls across 2 apps.

I paid him the money ASAP (6pm), when I was out of the event and said why I wasn't on my phone/not replying. That night I went to moms and told her what happened & turned out my brother had already complained to her so she didn't want to hear what I had to say. Later that night I turned my data on just as I was about to sleep (no wifi), and saw a group chat with mom and brother where brother was bitching about me and telling mom off for being on my side and messaging me privately (she wasn't). There were also a few missed call & the chat ended with mom saying that she doesn't care and will talk about it later on a different day (not her bday).

Today while I'm at the library I texted my brother trying to explain what happened and how I wasn't ignoring him. He got extremely mad and accused me of lying about not being at the event like I said I was, & then it turned into a massive fight. We have dinner tonight for mom’s bday and I'm really nervous that another fight will break out.

"AITA for not locking a locker in the locker room at a gym?  I (25f) went to the gym to go for a quick swim with my fiancee (30m). We went into the locker rooms to change and meet on the other side. I always leave my clothes in the locker without bothering to lock it since it’s not valuable and I don’t really care if anyone took my clothes. 

I’ve seen other people at the gym do it so I didn’t think it was a big deal to just leave it unlocked. I only locked my locker when I bring my wallet or something valuable. When we got back I noticed that my locker was accidentally locked probably by someone who noticed my clothes were in there and decided to use a different locker. I went to get it unlocked from a staff and  it was a woman who had keys in her pocket. 

She gave me a huge attitude when I asked her to walk two feet over to unlock my locker. She kept making different angry sounds while walking over to my locker. I thought this was really weird because it didn’t seem like a big deal. I went to rant about it with my fiancée who was on her side. 

He said she shouldn’t have to unlock my locker because I chose to not lock it like I’m supposed to. I told him people make mistakes and that doesn’t mean she needs to be rude about taking a key out of her pocket and unlocking a door two feet from her. AITA for ranting to my fiancée about this situation and not locking my locker? Is it normal to lock a locker in a locker room if you don’t care about the stuff in it? 

Edit: the lock on the locker is attached and you input a code. So if you ever forget your code you ask a staff to unlock it with a key. If my clothes were ever gone I wouldn’t care tbh because I wear clothes I don’t care about to the gym.

AITA for not locking my locker in a locker room at the gym because I don’t care about the clothes I left in there? ",0.78
"AITA For getting better grades then my friends and blaming it on their lack of effort? Ever since I was young I've always been academically successful. Even all the way back in year 6 (for all the Americans this is around ages 10-11) my teachers has told me that they believe that I will go far in life. This carried on into secondary school (ages 11-16) where I consistently achieved the high grades and eventually the highest grade possible.

I've always been proud about my accomplishments and of course due to having such high grades I've always had to work very hard for the good grades I get. However, every single time we get test results, or school reports I am instantly bereded by my friends for having better grades than them. This also includes my twin sister. They always without fail become angry towards me.

I don't want to sound egotistical but I do work harder than my friends and my sister. Neither do as much work and revision as I do. I do have proof of this you can believe me or not but every time I say that I'm revising or doing school work they're so quick to call me a neek (the American equivalent would be nerd I guess). They belittle me for working hard as its 'just school'.

Yet in spite of this, they are so quick to literally bully me when I get higher grades. It got to a point where I stopped working as hard and purposefully started creating lower quality work just to get their comments to stop. I now instead of feeling proud about my high grades, it feels like a burden as I know it will just spark an argument.

Also I'd like to point out that they are the ones that ask me about my grades, therefore its like an extra stab to the heart when they get angry as they are the ones to ask.

All of this combined did result in me having an argument with both my friend and my sister, saying that it is not my fault that i work hard for my grades and that they don't. I also said that maybe if they cared more and put in effort they actually do well. Both stormed out of the argument.

My friend thinks im the asshole because she believes that i don't work hard for my grades and that i get them easily, and that i always gloat about it.

I do think that i could've worded it better, or not have started the argument at all but i couldn't handle the constant hate from people that should be closest to me.

Therefore, AITA for starting an argument with my friends and blaming them for their own bad grades?",0.09
"AITA for letting my daughter stay overnight at my in-laws first?  My parents have a history of being jealous. Upon meeting my mother-in-law, my mom told her in reference to future grandchildren, “I don’t share. You already have grandchildren.” When my daughter was born my mom was the one who watched her while I worked. In fact, for all of her life, my parents have seen her twice as much as my in-laws but they refuse to believe this.

Last grandparents day I was 8 months pregnant, we had a lot going on and we didn't celebrate the day with anyone. Later that week, my mom interrogated my 3 year old daughter about what she had done over the weekend and my daughter mentioned her other grandparents, even though she had actually seen them two weeks prior and not on grandparents day. But my mother believed this and confronted me, accusing me of spending the day with my husband's family and ignoring them. A fight ensued after which she profusely apologized and explained that she has many health issues, is worried about dying and just wants to spend as much time with her granddaughter as possible. I understood this and accepted her apology, I apologized for not acknowledging grandparents day, and I thought that was the end of it.

Fast forward to this year, both sets of grandparents have always been excited to  have my eldest over for a sleepover. I never had any actual plans for that until recently when we needed to take my youngest to a hospital a few hours away overnight for some testing. My husband and I both chose for our eldest to stay with his parents. I knew how my mother would react and I didn’t want to tell her but decided that I should in case some sort of emergency arose. I prefaced it by saying, “please don’t be mad” and let her know the situation. Of course she was upset asking “why? You know I’ve always wanted her to sleep over here first!” There was no concern for my youngest and all that she would have to undergo. It was all about my mother and her feelings. For a week my parents didn’t talk to me. I decided to reach out at that point and ask if we could “just move on” and the immediate answer was “no.” My mother said I was always choosing my husband's parents over my own, and that I intentionally chose my in-law out of spite. None of this is true. The argument escalated and she hung up on me. A cousin tried to mediate and told me that my mother thinks I should be the one to apologize. She cried on the phone to him about how she is sickly and misses her grandchildren and brought up last grandparents day and how she felt so disrespected that they were not acknowledged and we spent it with my husband’s family - even though she had apologized for falsely accusing me! 

My husband has always been aware of how much more time they get to spend with the children and being accused of the opposite is maddening to him. So AITA for letting my daughter stay overnight at her other grandparent’s house? Should I reach out again to move on?",0.08
"AITA for laughing at my friend's face in the middle of a serious talk? Me (F21) and my ""friend"" (F22) have been friends since our first year of college, about three years now. We bonded over similar experiences, like being cheated on by our exes, and I thought she was my best friend. However, things changed when she started dating a lot of guys to fill the void while I focused on healing. The issue arose when she would come to me upset about these guys using her. I suggested she take time for herself to heal, but she took it badly and accused me of rubbing her mistakes in her face.



Half a year later, I found my current boyfriend. I wasn’t seeking a relationship; it just happened, and I was lucky. My friend reacted strangely, confronting me and saying she couldn't trust me because everyone around her was dating, and she felt like she was the one so actively looking for it yet it never came to her. I was hurt by this, as I thought she would be happy for me.



We started drifting apart, and then she met a guy and quickly began dating him. I hoped this would bring us closer, but it didn’t. She shared troubling behaviors, like stalking her ex and accepting a half-smoked cigarette from a stranger, which I called her out on. She didn’t take it well. When I asked if she was okay after hearing her argue with her boyfriend, she said she felt pressured to prove her relationship was good.



Our relationship further deteriorated when her cat died. She was upset and canceled a planned night out, saying she'd talk to us later, which we totally understood and respected. When I came home, I was busy packing for a trip and missed her text. She banged on my door, accusing me of being angry at her and yelling. I explained I hadn’t seen her message, and she later apologized. I asked her not to talk to me like that again and said I needed some space, to which she said I could've had more compassion as she was going through a hard time.



A few weeks ago, we decided to talk things out because she ignored me and made me uncomfortable at a dinner. During our conversation, she blamed me for not being able to mourn her cat properly, claiming my request for space made her constantly think about me and feel bad. I laughed at this, which upset her, but I apologized and asked for an explanation. She reiterated her point, and I found it ridiculous.

"AITA… best friends edition  My best friend(v) of over a year started talking to this really bad guy, like really bad. She didn’t tell me about him before she really fell for him so my advice was going one ear out the other. She took offense to me trying to get her out of the relationship when at the end of the day she deserves WAY better like the dude she’s w is bare minimum… maybe ever worse. She has been thru a lot and I can tell she’s hooked on any type of messed up love he’s trying to give her. She knows I don’t like him and he knows I don’t like him. She Invited my girlfriend and best friend (R) out to go to a haunted house, but she didn’t invite me, no one thought to ask if I wanted to go. It was like the whole friend group minus me. Anyways it’s obvious that she didn’t invite me because her boyfriend doesn’t like me and they knew if anything went down I would be the first to go off on him. So she js didn’t invite me. I was in a really low place at the time and I called her earlier that day before there were any plans at all telling her how bored and lonely I was, yet still she didn’t invite me. I blocked her because i needed space, but she wasn’t even blocked for long I unblocked her and I texted her asking how she was doing. Because I wanna be there for her in case anything happens, she hasn’t answered me and it’s been over a month.

"AITA for telling my husband that I don't want him to do chores?  My husband recently sold his company to a  bigger one on its field and we've got a hell of a lot of money for it. It's still hard to comprehend how much it is going to change our lives. I'm extremely proud of him.

We're in the period of discussing our future and we also looking for a new home for our family of 3. We've found an incredible house that we're looking forward to visit. It's a very big one.

As were looking at the pictures he jokingly said that it'd be a nightmare to clean.
The thing is that he loves doing chores in our current house while listening to his favorite podcast. 

I told him that it would be crazy to clean this big house by ourselves when we could afford a cleaning service very comfortably. He looked a bit upset so I asked him If he actually want to spend his whole day cleaning a big house like that and he said ""No, you're right.""

"AITA for ‘blindsiding’ my roommates after moving out? I 23F share a flat with Sara 24F and Vera 24F. Rent in our city is very expensive and all of us can only affording living here by renting a 3bed flat as we couldn’t by ourselves or in a 2 bed flat. 

Me and Vera were single when we moved in last year and Sara had a boyfriend Jake 26M.  Jake is clean, quiet and pays part of our utilities as he comes over most nights. 

Vera has recently started dating Oli 23M who is a friend of Jake and Sara’s. Oli has made a few weird comments about me- he pestered me about my weight and told me he could bench me and also asked me some weird sexual questions. When I flagged this to Vera, (I’ve never met Oli) she said he’s just trying to be friends. Sara and Jake said it was just his sense of humour.

Last week, me and Vera had a big fight after I overheard Vera and Oli in the shower together. We have one bathroom in the house, and my bedroom shared a wall, so I heard them having sex. They also didn’t clean the shower afterwards, and Sara stayed at her parents that week, so I ended up cleaning the shower.

I brought up this issue to Sara, who isn’t confrontational and said now that I’ve brought it up to Vera she knows how I feel and won’t do it again- but she didn’t at all find it as weird as I did. Since then I have avoided Oli/Vera and kept to myself.

I am not really friends with Vera anymore, and Sara remains neutral which favours Vera so I was thinking of moving out. We had all signed on for the next year as our contract renews in September, before I met Oli, and my estate agency said I couldn’t get out unless the contract had been violated. 

I just live in that house now, I’m on awkward terms with the other two, so I read the contract and one of the clauses says only declared tenants can stay for extended periods of time, so I reported that Vera has her boyfriend over, and proved it as the utilities went up in the time I said.

This got me out the contract, however the landlord is evicting Sara and Vera because of this. They said I blindsided them and they will struggle to find a place by the end of this month. My parents live 1.5 hours away so I am moving in with them, but the other two are from a different city so can’t do the same. 

I didn’t intend for them to get evicted, but after the fight over the shower I realised I couldn’t live with them as any issue we have, Vera won’t listen and Sara will stay neutral.",0.78
"AITA for telling my co-worker I didn't expect her to be a fan or her favorite artist? I (M27) work with a woman (F, late 20s) who is the smartest person I know. She’s incredibly intelligent—fluent in four languages, earned her PhD before turning 30, and so on. We are work friends, not close outside of work. 

A couple of weeks ago, she was out of work for like a week and returned last monday. It came up in casual conversation that she had taken a week of PTO to travel to another country to see her favorite artist, who is on a world tour but not performing in our country. This surprised me because I didn’t know she was a fan of this singer, as most of the fanbase seems to be teenage girls. I told her something like, “I didn’t expect you to be a fan of her.” When she asked why, I responded, “I don’t know, you’re so intelligent; it’s not the type of music I’d expect someone as smart as you to listen to.”

She gave me an odd look and seemed offended by my comment.

"AITA for giving my friend an offensive nickname? So my friend is an amateur NSFW game designer. He has already started one game that is in a playable demo state. It is a backrooms porn game where the monsters are pornogrgraph. It isn't fully finished but he has gotten bored and wants to move onto another game.

I am cool with him making these kind of games but his current idea is a but problematic. It is a zombie game kinda like project zomboid, but all the zombies are sexy women. The ""plot"" is basically that a zombie virus got released that kills all the men and turns women into sexy zombies. The surviors are immune to the virus. Yes, he plans on the zombies being fuck able.

We were at my pool swimming when he brought it up. I told him that it might be a bad idea, and that it is kinda just necrophila. He said other games are worse and it is fine. In response I called him Corpse Fucker, or CF for short. I sometimes call him CF in public and if anyone were to ask what it means I would say it stands for Coding Friend.

"AITA for not offering my bridesmaid dress to someone else? I (28f) used to hang out with Jill 27f but when she started dating Jack 31m no one could hang out with Jill without Jack. I said it wasn't ok for him to be in control& she said it's bc he loves her. She must've told him bc when I saw him he said I was jealous that my bf wasn't that romantic. After dating a month, Jack proposed. I told her I thought it was very fast since he was her 1st bf. She said I was jealous. 2 days later she asks me to be her MAID OF HONOR!!! I was shocked. Strangely i said yes. I hate wedding showers, but I agreed to plan one since I was the MOH. After the party multiple people said it was awesome. Jill said I didn't put enough effort into it, but I shrugged it off as her being stressed. She wanted help with our dresses, I told her about the ones a friend had and she got ALMOST THE EXACT DRESS! The only difference is these are shin length not knee. I asked if the MOH could have a different length, she said she didn't want her MOH looking like a slut so I had to buy a new dress. 3 weeks before the wedding she calls & says I haven't been supportive of her & Jack so she doesn't want me in the wedding. Even tho I didn't really care about the wedding this made me angry and I finally lost it on the bridezilla. ""Are you kidding me?! I've done everything you've asked & ignored Jack watching my every move. you've known the whole time I thought things were going too fast, why would you wait until NOW to tell me you don't think I'm supportive?"" & I walked out. 2 days later Jill apologizes & asks me to be a BM, not the MOH since she had already told another BM she could be. Not thinking I said ok. Friday I show up for the rehearsal. We rehearse the ceremony (took 3 hours). Partway into dinner I had a seizure. The restaurant calls 911 & Jill's cousin calls my brother. Apparently Jack is upset & Jill is yelling at the waitstaff for moving her tables to make room for the medics. My brother shows up & the medics say I can go with him. He tells Jill I may not make the wedding b/c it can take a day or 2 to recover from a seizure. Jill yelled at my brother & told him I had to be there for at least her pictures. He said ""ummm, yeh, that's a hard no!"". Later I had another seizure, fell out of bed and hit the nightstand. My boyfriend took me to the ER since I was bleeding. SaturdayJill calls me to find out where I am. My boyfriend answers & says Im at the ER. Jill screamed at him about ruining her wedding so he hung up on her. Sunday morning I read my texts & vm even tho my boyfriend said I shouldn't. There were lots from Jill & Jack saying I ruined their day by faking a seizure & lying about going to the ER. Shewanted me to send her my discharge papers to prove I didn't leave before the wedding! A couple people checked in to see if I was ok & others said I was a jerk for not finding a replacement.

"AITA for getting angry and telling my friend ""being Muslim doesn't make you special."" (Fisrt off if you came here to bash Muslim people, kindly take a long walk off a short pier 🥰)

I [22f(she/they)] have a friend, lets call her Jessica [21f]. For some context she is Muslim both of her parents are of German ancestry, she is also cis and straght. I am an agnostic,  she/they lesbian, my dad is latin American and my mom is Scottish/indigenous north amarican. We both live in a north amarican country. First of all I know what I said was not ideal and regardless of the context it wasn't my best moment. My irritation with this friend started during the world cup when is was hosted in Qatar. I expressed my dislike of the government because of it's poor civil right record. She accused me of being islamophobic for disliking the government. I felt this was stupid but I don't like when friends argue especially when I'm involved lol. She tends to lable things as islamophobic which is irritating because there is actual islamophobia out there. Yesterday she told me she understood racism because some people think she's Arabic when they first see her hijab. Now I definitely agree that she can briefly be on the receiving end of a bit of racism. However she is literally the whitest person ever. I'm talking, blond hair, and blue eyes. She constantly talks about being German. She has the luxury of just laughing off those comments knowing that they really don't know what they're taking about. Meanwhile my family members are being deported, or told to go back home in a place they're ancestors lived. I snapped and told her ""being muslim doesn't make you special."" She burst into tears and hasn't talked to me. I feel bad but also angry. I've been debating apologizing. I need help! Please! Am I the asshole? ",0.14
"AITAH for telling my boyfriend he wasn’t there for me and it took his friend to help me? The other day, me, my boyfriend and 2 others of his friends, whom are a couple, went out together. We ended up in this after-hour, sketchy club. I was standing behind my boyfriend, holding hands with him while he was in front chatting with other people when a guy approached me. As usual, I told him that I have a boyfriend and wasn’t interested in talking but he was still persistent, making me really uncomfortable. I decided to get my boyfriend’s help and pulled his arm to get his attention. But I was surprised that as I pulled his hand, he slightly shook my hand off. I didn’t have time to react with anything else then I heard his friend asking me if I was okay and pulled me aside. I was surprised by what my boyfriend did, considering that he had been always protective of me whenever we were out in clubs, knowing that I’m not familiar with the environment and that I’m small and an easy target. As I kept thinking about it, I got more and more upset as I couldn’t understand his action, especially in this shady club. So later when we went outside the club and there were only the two of us, I told him “You wasn’t there for me. There was a guy harassing me and your friend had to come and help me.” That clearly really upset him and he started asking me what were I taking about and what guy. When I explained the situation he told me I probably didn’t do enough to notify him then because he didn’t even know about it and that I probably secretly liked the attention and were entertaining the guy until it became out of my control. I knew right there and then that these words are major red flag but let’s ignore this issue here. He also told me that I was being disrespectful by bring his friend in like that, basically comparing the two of them. He said that it was nothing for me to praise his friend about because they are friends and he would absolutely do the same to the friend’s girlfriend if she needs help and it just something they supposed to do for each other/each other’s girlfriends. He said I was wrong for undermining him and made his friend out to be this hero saving the day. Later, when he saw the friend’s girlfriend dealing with 3 guys talking to her while her boyfriend was on the phone, he loudly told me that he would want a girlfriend like that, someone that could handle men. I was upset by this and later brought it up while we were sitting down for a serious conversation and he told me that he only did that to show me how me comparing him with his friend feel like. The fact that I was obviously upset by his comment made me think that I might be wrong for saying that about his friend? So AITAH for telling my boyfriend he was there for me when a guy was harassing me and it took his friend to help me?

tl;dr My boyfriend didn’t help me when a guy was harassing me in the club and I told him he wasn’t there for me and his friend had to help me. Now he’s upset about that saying that I didn’t respect him. AITAH for saying that?",0.19
"WIBTA for getting married in secret, and hiding from everyone, including closest friends and family, for a year? I’m having a tough time with this and could really use some advice. Long-time lurker, first-time poster here.

I (26F) have been dating my boyfriend (27M) for four years. We met in college and have been together ever since. He’s amazing, and we’ve built a life together with a house and three dogs. We’re super happy, but recently, we’ve hit some financial bumps. He suggested we get legally married now to save on taxes and get better insurance, and then have our real wedding later. We’d still do a formal proposal and have the big wedding we’ve always planned.

The thing is, I’ve always dreamed of my wedding. I’ve had a Pinterest board for years and a wedding date picked out since I was 12. Because of some past issues (I’m in therapy for this), having a special wedding feels really important to me. I don’t want a small ceremony followed by a vow renewal; I want one big, meaningful celebration.

I’ve been thinking about keeping the legal marriage totally secret—no friends or family knowing, just a witness who doesn’t know us personally and is sworn to secrecy. It would be a simple, no-frills legal step, and then we’d have the real wedding on our anniversary. 

I know a few friends who did courthouse weddings, but it wasn’t what I wanted for myself. It worked for them, but I’m hoping for something more traditional and special. I’m worried that if people knew we were legally married, it would take away from the excitement and significance of our real wedding. 

Would I be the bad guy for doing this in secret? I really want to marry him and have my dream wedding, and I’m feeling torn. Any advice would be appreciated.",0.5
"AITA for calling my friend an asshole after he gave me a gift card? I, 16F, and my best friend John, 17M have been friends for about a year. For some context, we met at church and have been best friends since. A few months ago when I started planning my Sweet 16, I asked him to help me with some ideas. I had wanted to get people dressed up really fancy and came up with games and a spaghetti bar for the party. When I asked him for some ideas he said, ""those are the stupidest ideas I've ever heard of."" I thought he was joking, so I kept pitching ideas. But then he said ""No, I'm being serious. These ideas are stupid and I'm not going to come if you do these."" We got in a huge argument over it.

About a month later I had my party, and John spent the whole time complaining. He made us all sit in a circle and talk about his relationship problems. He also insisted I ""shut up"" because he was being vulnerable. I would have totally listened if he didn't stop my entire birthday to talk about himself. But no, we can't have a private conversation, it has to be at my party which I spent weeks planning, for John to just come in and say my ideas were stupid.

At first I excused his petty behavior, because I did enjoy hanging out with him. But then he made fun of my boyfriend at the time, and then laughed at me when we broke up. He would send me pictures of him and make fun of me because things didn't work out. He's white, and would scream the n-word out of my car window. He made fun of gay people in front of my gay friend, knowing that he was gay. Just a whole bunch of immature crap that I couldn't stand. 

But the last straw happened a few weeks ago. He had gotten me a gift card to my favorite coffee place and apologized for being rude recently, and I really appreciated it because money was tight for me. When I went to buy some coffee, the barista said that the gift card had no money on it. As it turns out, John had been given the gift card for his birthday, spent it, and then gave it to me knowing it had no money on it. (I found out the backstory because he told a mutual friend.) I immediately called him and explained the situation. I told him about all the things I looked over and ignored because I wanted to stay friends.

"AITA for supporting my partner in not giving his kids and ex money  My (54F) partner (55M) have been together 4 years. His twins (24M) live full time with mom. Since 2020 my partner has offered to pay for drivers ed, post secondary,  car insurance (so son could drive to better paying job), connected  with trade for apprenticeship, etc.
Instead, 2 years ago, son quit job to relax for summer. We advised taking a leave instead or lining up another job first. He didn't. Since then he's done a few retail stints but quit them all. He's broke. His mom and twin are on government assistance.
Now, despite being served 3 years ago with a notice to vacate (they didn't and it went to tribunal) they're finally being evicted.
Now His ex is asking for money and telling him she and kids will be homeless. Instead he has offered to have kids come and live in his home (*which he doesn't live in, just his mother, their grandmother does). The ex says no, they don't want to, just give her money.
His ex says no one can work bc of mental health. Partner (and i) feel it's a pretty toxic environment (his ex has made some poor life choices and over shares and borrows from the boys etc.) Boys could live rent free, have food and shelter and focus on mental health living in my partners home. 

Note: I get along great with boys, they're really nice kids. 
Partner usually saw them 1x/week for dinner etc until Jan 2024 when they suddenly stopped returning calls and messages. We don't know why.
I am sure partner could have done more for them growning up (he admits he was Disney dad) so I can only go on what I've seen since 2020.

So AITA supporting him? Even if his kids end up homeless? They have a place they can go, they just don't want to leave their mom (*which I understand) but partner paid child support until they were 23 (5 years more than court ordered) so they'd have extra money.

"AITA for using my boyfriend’s special soap? So I (31F) stay at my boyfriend's (37M) place pretty often for long stretches of time. No real rules, just basic ones like respect the space, don't waste electricity/water, etc... and I also use the guest bathroom and have some of my stuff in there like toothbrush, makeup, you get the idea. Well of course when I use the bathroom I wash my hands and I have been using his liquid hand soap that's in a cool Disney soap dispenser that makes a Mickey foam pattern when you dispense it. Well it's running low and today he noticed and got really mad that I've been using it, apparently it's special soap he got at the theme parks and he doesn't even use it. Apparently that's why he keeps it in the guest bathroom because it's special and not meant to be used everyday, it's more for display. I was pretty confused as I have never had special soap and I just assumed the bottle next to the sink labeled liquid hand soap was what I should have been using. He got angry, raised his voice and said I should be using the bar soap available (sometimes I do, but dove isn't my favorite). He also seemed confused as he says having special things for display like display soap, display towels, and display dishes is very normal. He is from a wealthier family so maybe that is the norm for him? I apologized and offered to buy a refill of liquid foaming hand soap and I was sorry I didn't know it was special, he never said anything about it in the months I've been here he also argues that I should have asked if it was okay, but it has never occurred to me to ask permission to use soap as I've never had to do that before in my life. I just saw a bottle of hand soap next to the sink and I thought it was regular soap. He's still pretty mad, he even hid the bottle from me and said I can't use it anymore. If anyone is wondering, I have seen these exact bottles go for brand new on eBay for like $15-$20, it's a Disney 50th anniversary item and although it's a neat bottle design, I wouldn't say it looks like it's obviously special or rare. But am I the asshole for not asking if it's okay to use the soap?

"AITA for requesting the helicopter parents to leave?  I (F 46) got a call from a local community gym that my orientation class to the gym was canceled but they could fit me into one today with the youth class (13 & up). I said sure. I have three kids 19 & early twenties & and bunch of brothers, so no prob. What I didn’t expect is all the teenage boys with their parents hovering around us! The gym is busy busy too so the parents are getting in  the way of the other gym goers. 

I have no problem with the young guys watching me trying out the machines because hey, they’re doing it too….but I’m feeling pretty self-conscious by the minute with the dads & moms hanging around & watching. So I made a request to the instructor if we could only have the participants there & humbled myself by saying I was self-conscious & struggling with feeling comfortable there. I tried to put it in a way that no one else was embarrassed or uncomfortable. The instructor responded by looking like a deer in the headlights. Two parents were okay with it & said oops, sorry we’ll go (something like that), but one mom was pissed & shot me a dirty look & one dad responded by working out aggressively on the machines around us the whole time (why didn’t he orientate his own kid then??). 

What was interesting to note is how the teenage boys were like young boys with their parents there & how they acted like young men after their parents left. They were talking & flexing then, but pretty much mute when their parents were around. 

I don’t understand helicopter parenting at all, if that is what it was. I believe in giving a reasonable amount of space for kids to grow up & become responsible. I’m going down the rabbit hole now ….AITA for having shooed the parents off?? The instructor was very friendly with me afterwards so he didn’t seem perturbed at all. ",0.77
"AITA for snapping at my grandparents for interrupting me whenever I speak? I am being told I need to have more patience with my grandma (75) and my grandpa (77) but I’m not going to let them walk all over me just because they’re old. Old people don’t get to throw away their manners because they’re old I don’t see how thats fair. I feel I can stand up to them when they say outrageous things or are continually rude/have no manners because it seems no one else does. I understand that they are my grandparents and I should cherish them but I don’t think that means they get to treat me poorly. I thought I was setting boundaries when I told them to stop interrupting me. I think I said “oh my god stop interrupting me I haven’t been able to get a word out all day and I’m sick of it. I’ve started my sentence 4 times now and it’s rude.” Was that too harsh? 
Edit: I understand I could’ve said that much differently but my grandparents have been unbelievably awful to my mother for no reason her entire life, my grandpa is my gmas 3rd husband and have been married 2 years longer than my mom has been (30yrs) but treat my moms half sister as the golden child and as if her children are my grandparents only grandchildren. I didn’t know my grandparents growing up and that was their choice. They are continually awful and take advantage of my mom while catering to her half sisters every need. In fact earlier this day we had to look at rugs for my half sister because apparently a 40 something woman can’t shop for her own rugs or do her own landscaping or childcare because my grandparents do all of these things for her but continue to lie to my mom and treat her like shit so I have very minimal patience with them because they are terrible to my mom but not my aunt?

"AITA for telling my best friend I'm uncomfortable with her talking to my ex?  Me (14F) and my best friend (14F) haven't known each other long, only about a year, but we act like we've been friends since birth. I spend at least 2 days to a week sleeping over at her house, going and exploring on our bikes, and just messing around.

Recently, we both entered relationships with two best friends (14M, 14M), all four of us would hang out, and we would all facetime together. This went on for 4 months before my best friend left her boyfriend. (As of now, I am still with mine and we are happily celebrating 5 months today.)

In my relationship, I mentioned to my boyfriend that I was close with one of my ex boyfriends. We had broken up almost 2 years ago and had worked things out. He respected this and I offered to let them meet, which he accepted. Now, they're like best friends.

I also mentioned this to my best friend, as her (now ex) boyfriend is on my exes football team. She started acting all flustered, which I thought was weird. I told her about how he's extremely fit, working out in his spare time, he's on a football, basketball, and wrestling team. She asked to see a photo, so I showed her. She then told me words I never thought I'd hear from my best friend; ""I love strong guys, and he's really fine..but I would NEVER do that to you, it breaks my moral code.""

Moral code my ass, the next day, she asked me to text him to ask if he could talk to her while she was at cheer practice (they practice football and cheer on the same days). I thought nothing of it, so I texted him asking. No biggie, but here's what pissed me off; she started texting him on instagram. Again, not a big deal. Until she calls me while I'm at work to tell me she's been talking to him for about 4 hours and he's so 'easy to talk to'.

I told her this made me uncomfortable how close she was getting with him, to which she responded and said she only talked to him because she felt bad leaving him on delivered/read because he was so nice. I told her it's okay to talk to him, but the amount of time and how fast she's growing close with him made me very uncomfortable with everything. She then said she promises to not talk to him, and leave him alone. I thanked her and thought everything was fine until she started acting all dry, replying with K, typing in all lowercase when she usually types in all caps, and just overall short replies to whatever I say. I know she's mad at me, and probably not leaving him alone. AITA?",0.75
"AITA for not voting? I’m gonna try to explain my life views super simply. I live in a fabricated world because I’m happy in my little world.

"AITA for forgiving my(23M) GF(25F), but still bringing it up months later? I also posted this in r/relationship advice, but barely got any advice so posting here… My gf (25F) never lets me talk about my (23M) emotions without blaming me for them. How can I fix this to make our relationship better?

For context — about 5 months ago, my GF emotionally cheated on me with her best friends brother. She was ignoring me for about 1 week straight and come to find out through a friend, and later through her, she was trying to figure out our relationship by asking him out on dates and asking for advice about what to do from her best friends parents. It took a lot on her part for me to forgive her as I did not want to start over on a relationship I have had for 3 years and I truly love her and do not want to start over again.

It is still taking me some time to get over this situation as not only did they emotionally cheat on me, but told some deep secrets regarding our relationship to their close friends which got back to me. Whenever I show a hint of sadness regarding something related to anything wrong they do (regarding the emotional cheating, secret telling, etc) they get stressed out and question why I am upset about something that happened months ago or simply say that they do not care. This has caused me to bottle up a lot of emotions and now I’m just questioning whether or not I’m being unreasonable for being upset about a situation I technically already forgave them for, it’s just hard to truly get over the situation. I am just wondering —how I can get past this to make my relationship better?",0.17
"AITA for wanting my gf to ask what's wrong?  I grew up with a father that tattooed the idea into my brain that men shouldn't cry, show emotion, vent etc. And I had a very rough childhood and to this day don't really have a very stable life. And I don't feel comfortable with venting or sharing my problems with people, and I don't for that reason. They few times I did open up with ex girlfriends it never ended well and turned into me getting yelled at and shit on making me feel worse and less comfortable venting. I want to be able to talk to my current girlfriend and vent to her but I want to know she actually cares before opening up, but every time I try to drop hints I'm not feeling well or I'm overwhelmed she doesn't really seem to care. She asks ""what's wrong? "" but when I have gone to her in the past that I wasn't feeling well it just feels like she says the same thing, ""I'm sorry, I hope you feel better"". It feels like she's only doing it because she feels obligated rather than actually caring. If she's upet I try to find out why and do my absolute best to listen to everything she has to say and help cheer her up in any way, without prying information out of her and respecting her boundaries. But when it comes to my issues it's just I'm sorry I hope you feel better.im not going to truly tell her about how I feel unless I feel like she cares and it putting the same effort that I do. AITA?

"AITA for calling a girl fat? NOTE: I am autistic, and I also have ADHD on top of that, and so in turn I react differently to some things, I also have heavy interest in vehicles (like many autistic people do) and my interest is tanks.

So, I go to school and I'm already having a rough day, (I woke up late and had to rush out the door to catch the bus) and when I get to the stop I talk to this girl who lives near me and is always at said stop, and I don't like her in a romantic way, but I like her as a friend, she lets me ramble on about my nerdy interests and all other things that are on my mind etc etc, and when it comes to lunch, I go out and talk to her, (she often sits in a large group of other girls quite close to where I normally hang out with my friends) and the day prior, I had explained this prototype modern tank design I've been working on, (I really like engineering and I started working on it last year) and when I walk up to her to chat, her friend (who is slightly round) pipes up and says ""Hey it's WWII kid!"" Now I am not a fan of nicknames and have minor outbursts at times, but what struck me deep, is that I at one point in time had a neo-nazi phase (I am incredibly disgusted in myself and I never tell anyone about it because I fear it will hurt my reputation) and I disliked her comment but I didn't let much boil over, but what I did do was pipe up and say to her: ""Oh well how about I call you fat kid?"" (I am aware about how girls get body dysmorphia and I am going to apologize to her tommorow if I get the chance) but as soon as I said that, everyone went silent and turned to me before asking me to leave, I complied angrily but didn't make any rude remarks afterwards, I can tell it's likely I did the asshole move and that I myself am likely the asshole, but I just felt I needed to voice it somewhere other than discord for once

"AITA for texting my employers very late in the evening? Long story short, I work part time at Chipotle in my hometown and have been working there for a few months. 

Stores not doing great, numbers are down, so they’ve been cutting hours. Last week, I was surprised to see that I had 0 hours for the upcoming week. 

I talked to the manager on duty, who then told me he would change the schedule, showed me a draft of the new schedule in which I had some hours, and I agreed. 

I didn’t get a good look at the schedule, but as it came to the start of the week, i texted the manager asking for a picture of the schedule. He replied quickly, sending me a photo of the old schedule with 0 hours for me, and told me to contact the General Manager. I was confused, as this guy was the one who gave me the new hours, but either way I texted the GM. This was around 10AM. No response from the GM, and now I was very anxious as I was supposedly supposed to work the next day. 

I sent another text at 1:30AM, asking the general manager very politely if they had seen my previous message, and no response. 

Today, I woke up to a text from the original manager I was talking with, that says (copy&pasted) 

“Unfortunately you have zero hours this week. You’re going to have to stop texting managers late at night about the schedule. Will let you know if anything changes.”

I was taken aback, mainly because I take pride in my jobs and don’t want to offend anyone, but that text tells me that not only were my GM and this manager talking about me, but the GM continued to ghost me and complained about my late night texts. 

AITA for just wanting to know my schedule? 


Follow up: Is it an age gap thing or maybe just lack of professional experience? If one of my friends, family, coworkers or managers messaged me late at night with a work related question and I woke up the next morning to it, I wouldn’t be offended and ever consider that as a “wake up and answer my text now” thing.

I am 28 years old and living in Jersey. My best friend is getting married in 2026. We have been best friends for approaching 20 years. We have a female friend group of 5, all best friends. I am one of the 4 bridesmaids 

The expectation from the bridesmaids is to buy our own dresses €100 + accessories, pay for the hen doo €350, spending money for hen do €150-200, second hen do, €400, spending money for second hen do €400, stay over at wedding, €300, spending money at wedding €2-300, post wedding party the day after wedding €150, wedding present unsure as do not know what I am going to get yet. 

On the higher end that is about €1800 (without gift). The issue is not that I can’t afford it, however that is pocket change for me. This will probably also prevent me going on a holiday with my long term partner next year due to the financial impact as I wouldn’t even spend that much on a holiday with my partner.

All the weddings I have been to in the past have been small and lowkey so I don’t know if this is normal and if this is a reasonable ask or not?

It was like a water park to them and it was hot. Then we went to the school cafeteria for lunch and then we went to the student union hall where they played in the recovery room. They had a blast.

Two students approached me and said ""hey man, it's not cool that you're bringing your kids on our campus."" I said ""my tax dollars pays for this campus so yes, they can come here and play. What are they doing that's so offensive?""

They said that they were students abd my kids and their friends weren't. I said, again, how is it messing your day by having a group of 7,8,9 and 10yo boys playing foosball or eating fries?

"AITA for not including a friend on a girl's trip when she has gone previously? 4 years ago I moved to a state that is close to the beach. Every year, my 3 BFFs have driven or flown in from my home state about 17 hours away for a girl's trip to the beach. It's great to get away from our crazy schedules and reconnect, just us girls. Because we live so far away, we don't get to chat like we used to, so I really love getting the time to spend with them to catch up on all the gossip and laughs. 

Last year, one of the friends was a complete bitch the entire time, tried to pick fights, talked shit about one of us to the others when one wasn't in the room, and basically made the entire time miserable. She was on her phone nonstop, stalking people on social media and talking shit about them. We didn't care and didn't want to hear it. We even called her out on her crap, but that just made things worse. We were able to make light of things by having ""water time,"" which was the 3 of us would get in the water so we wouldn't have to listen to her, as she refused to get in the water. It was our time of peace and time to be like, what the actual fuck? We're not high schoolers. GenX here. So really, what the actual fuck? 

Every place we went to eat or have drinks, she was focused on asking the wait staff who they thought was the youngest and got even more bitchy when they didn't say her (she’s actually the oldest & looks it).

Since that trip, we’ve all drifted away from our friendships with her. In the last year, any contact I've had with her has been my doing. Both my inlaws passed away within 3 months of each other, and she made no attempt to reach out to see me while I was back and didn't even come to the funerals. I can understand if people can't make it, but for supposedly being my bestie, right?

When I went back a third time several months later, I met with the other 2 friends but decided not to invite her and not to say anything that we got together. Somehow she found out because she posted passive aggressive crap on Facebook that HAD to be directed towards us. That's what she does. It's so dam ridiculous!

Recently we planned this year’s girl's trip and didn’t include her in the plans. We all agreed that our relationships with her have been estranged and felt we didn't want a repeat of the last trip. We are keeping it hushed because none of us wants to hurt her feelings and we know she will act like a 12 year old, throw a fit, calling/texting people we know to let them know what shitty friends we are for not including her. I do feel bad because she is a friend and a part of me feels she's going through some type of age/mid life crisis and that I should be there for her. The other part of me wants to just be up front with her and tell her how ridiculous her actions are and that she needs to grow the fuck up. I know it wouldn't matter and just can't with her relentless bitchiness anymore. I just want to have a stress free, fun filled trip.

"AITA for asking my bf to prioritise my birthday over his work that he loves after he forgot the last one For context, we both travel for work, we’re away at work for a bit more than half the year in total, in separate chunks. We go to a lot of different places around the world, most of them very beautiful. We don’t see each other during that time. For my first birthday in our relationship, he gave me a card, which was sweet. Also, he absolutely loves work.

Before my last birthday, the second one since we’ve started dating, I was pretty upset about spending it without anyone close to me, at work. I mentioned that many times, explicitly told him I would need some cheering up from him during that time because I was going to feel down. He forgot my birthday on the day, and he also didn’t give me anything to open the day of.

He apologised and said, he didn’t forget my birthday (=he knows what the date of my birthday is), he just wasn’t aware of the date that day. He said that he thought it would be much nicer to do something nice when we would see each other in person instead of giving me a gift to open on the exact day on my own, and said he would do something nice to make it up to me that he forgot.

When we saw each other in person again, he gave me some birthday gifts. We never celebrated though, and the “doing something nice” didn’t happen. I brought it up again a few weeks later, and told him that I was sad that he never did take me out on a nice date or a little surprise. I explained to him a few times that my birthday is important to me, and in order to feel loved and appreciated, I really wanted something nice for the next one, which is a big one, and he promised.

Now, the big birthday is still a while away, and he is scheduled to be at work then. I asked him if he’d consider asking work to reschedule. He said he’d resent it if he missed it because of my birthday, because he is scheduled to go to a different place he has never been before that is quite beautiful. He said that I know it’s his dream job, he loves working in it and still gets excited about it. He said that his birthday isn’t important to him and that he wouldn’t mind if I wasn’t there and just celebrated a week later instead. He said he doesn’t understand why it’s important to me.

I got upset and told him I feel like he loves work more than me, he promised to do it differently next time and is now going back on that promise, and I think that on these two days a year (birthday and anniversary), I should be the priority and not work. ",0.72
"AITA for not giving my step sister my great grandparents house Very long story short my great grandparents died about 20 years ago. The house had to be torn down to the studs and rebuilt for biohard reasons.

For a while I (24f) was living with my mother (49f) in my late grandmother's house with her boyfriend (50m) (now husband) and his son (23m). But as tension rose between me and her husband (let's call him bob) and his son (let's call him connor) I decided to move out and get my own apartment. I was tired of being disrespected and made out to be the villian, because his son was ""the perfect angel."" I would still come to visit my mother often, but I would leave once either of them got home. 

Work finally started on the ""project house"" Basically anything that could be done without a specialist, we did. Me, Bob, Connor, and my mom worked on this house for 5 years. 

There was a lot of debate regarding who would get the house, either me or Connor. They decided I would get it because I was living by myself and connor was refusing to pay rent (which was in a contract he signed with my mom and bob) and a few other reasons, like it's my great grandparents parents house.

I have been living in my mini dream house (think tiny 2 bedroom cottage, about 900sqft) for about 4 months now. My step sister (26f) (let's call her ava) suddenly comes back into the picture because she will date a guy for a few months then cheat on him and lives with the guy she cheated on him with. (7 or 8 times now) Her child is about 5 and has been bounced around with her. (Baby daddy is stable and wants the kid but she won't let him)

Recently she started calling her father (Bob) and asking to move in with him, he said no, there's no room for her and a child, let alone her horses. (She cares more about her horses than her child)

Fast forward a week and she calls again asking if ""Sunday is OK for him to come pick up the trailer"" He asks her where she thinks a huge horse trailer would go, and she said ""behind op's house"" he says ""why don't you ask op if you can put it behind her house."" She goes quiet and says ""can you ask her, she'll say no to me"" like damn, you just answered your own question. So bob ends up laughing and saying ""well I think she hates me more than you, so good luck on that""

Another week goes by and she throws another fit this time demanding the house. Because ""why should op get to live in a nice, 2 bedroom house when she doesn't have any kids or even a boyfriend."" Now her mom (bobs ex) is taking avas side and yelling at bob to give ava the house. 

Bob ends up getting into a fight with my mom about it because ""it really doesn't seem fair."" 

Mind you I am the only child who has had to work for everything, the house is the only thing I ever got ""handed"" to me, and I helped pay for most of it because it was what I wanted. They get whatever they want when they want. Except the house.

So aita for putting my foot down and telling my step sister she can not kick me out of ""my house""

Edit: the deed is in my mother and bobs name, there is no rental agreement, but a written ""rent to own"" document. It's not signed off by a lawyer or on legal paper, just a spreadsheet saying if op pays x amount per month then in x months the equity loan will be payed off. At that point I can buy it from them.

"WIBTA for asking my boyfriend to not meet one on one with his girl friend?  WIBTA for asking my boyyfriend to not meet one on one with his girl friend?  

So my boyfriend has his girl friend from school. Recently she broke up with her boyfriend and wants to meet with my bf more often. They met before the break up once, alone. My bf says it was in the bar, but I'm not sure if it was the only place they have been in. I had issue with him for meeting with her after her break up, because he told me that that day he couldn't meet up with me (even tho we had a really important topic to discuss) but as soon as she called he was ready to go. I tried to talk about it with him, he said that he sees her rarely and also I probably wouldn't want to meet up after 7 pm. I told him that he assumed that I wouldn't want to meet up and the talk about it practically eneded at that, he changed the subject. They met like two time over this summer, she wants to meet more now. 

So here's the thing, would I be the asshole if I asked him to not meet with her one on one, but in the group? I feel kinda anxious when they meet alone, she seems like the kind of gril that dosen't have any female friends because ""girls are such a dramatic people"", at least that's what I have observed, I don't know her too well. I felt ok when I knew that them meeting up wasn't on a regular basis, but if they do want to meet more often, I would feel better if they met in the group of people, not alone. 
I know he has the right to meet with her and I won't forbid him from seeing her at all, I just want them to not meet alone.

"WIBTA for throwing out some old underwear? ETA2: I have decided not to do this and we will have a chat when he comes home tonight. I really appreciate the people who have explained this to me and been kind/patient. It really does much more for helping me than the people who immediately jump to calling me horrible things for asking a simple ‘would this be bad’ question.

My husband is very into his personal hygiene and buys a lot of underwear, as he likes to change it throughout the day if he ‘feels sweaty down there’. We share laundry duty and I have never noticed any issues with his personal cleanliness, and his underwear is never stained or otherwise gross.

The thing is, quite a few pairs of his boxers are showing their age now with big holes in the legs, various loose threads/elastics, and so on. I’ve asked multiple times why he keeps them and his reasoning is ‘they still cover the important bits’. I appreciate that reasoning, but honestly he has such a large amount of underwear already that these would hardly be missed. We both came from less affluent backgrounds growing up so I definitely do understand the desire to hold onto things until they’re completely unusable, but we are financially comfortable these days and he has plenty of much nicer underwear.

I’m thinking of throwing the tired stuff out, and buying him new underwear to compensate if more is needed. I really don’t think he’s got a specific emotional attachment to his tattered boxer shorts of all thing, but I also don’t know if I’m being presumptive by saying that (I’m autistic so I’m not sure if what I’m contemplating is a massive faux pas). So, would I be TA for throwing these out?


ETA: We do throw out each other’s fully broken things and it’s never caused a problem. Also, when I say tattered, I mean REALLY worn out. It’s not just a couple little moth holes, I think it’s actively impeding their ability to be worn easily.

We live with my parents and other siblings in a decent home, and my parents aren't *rich* rich, but they've never struggled financially.

I work a full time job and am saving to move out soon, because let's be honest, living with people sucks ass. I'm very lucky to be in the position I am in where I can save, and even though I don't have to pay rent (I have offered), I do try to help out where I can.

Now to the story: my sister has a shift that finishes at 8:30pm on a Thursday. Not that late but after dark. Normally my dad would go pick her up from these kinds of shifts, but on this night, he and my mum were at a concert and were unable to. My other sister (F20) with a driver's license is working late and can't pick her up either. 

My sister who needs a lift is still a learner and can't drive without a supervisor for another month or so, not that we have a car she could use anyway.

That leaves me. I work during the day so am technically free in the evenings, but I really avoid doing anything after work on a weeknight. I have an extremely limited social battery, and mild but chronic pain that is at its worst at night. I am always exhausted after working all day, and need to be well rested for the next early morning, but knowing I rarely get a good night's sleep, I have to go to bed pretty early. Usually around 8-8:30pm.

Because of this, and the fact its been a bit of a bad week pain-wise, I said that I would not be picking my sister up from work. If it were a Friday or Saturday night, I'd have said yes as I can sleep in the next morning, but I really don't want to be sacrificing my well-being when I need to be at work the next morning.

This means my sister will have to catch the bus home by herself. Now, this is something I'd done dozens of times at her age, and we live in a very safe area in a safe country, so it's about as safe as being out, alone after dark can be. There'll always be some risk to being outside alone after dark though, and I think my sister is a little scared. It would be her first time.

My parents aren't mad at me, but my sister is annoyed that she has to catch the bus by herself after dark.

"AITA Ex bf wants me to sign papers to refinance mortage so he can take 17000 out. 

So i 38f recently left my ex Josh after 12 years of financial and mental abuse.
We own a house together and while i've moved into my mothers house with our 3 kids, he has stayed in our house.
Im trying to get off the mortage and give it all to him so i can later on buy again, and just be free from him.
The problem is, he contacted me and said i need to sign papers so he can get the equity out of the house to buy him a car. ""I took his car"" even though its mine but he wouldnt transfer it over to me.

He has a gambling problem and its getting worse, all the money he has gambled in the weeks ive been gone, he could have brought a second hand car buy now.
I dont want him to gamble the mortage and eventually make our names blacklisted.
So i said i will not sign. And let me get off the mortage first then he can do whatever he likes.
This has caused him to become angry and call me all sorts of names that i had to block him.
He then messaged me through fb and told me its my fault he just gambled 1500 back pay to win a car and im dead to him.
I have blocked him also on fb now.
Am i the asshole?

I could be the asshole as i did take my car that was under his name ""control"" reasons and i wont let him take equity out.",0.08
"AITA for going into my sisters room without permission? Very curious if im the asshole. 

So my (19/f) family doesnt have a lot of money. We dont have many dishes. We only have three bowls and most if the time two of them are rotting in my sister (20/f, lets call her Sarah) room cause she cant just throw her food away. 

Well yesterday i needes to cook for everyone but i didnt had any bowl. While passing Sarahs room i saw something.  A bowl i was looking for for months. She put pennies into it. Wasnt the firt time, she also took our only beaker to use as a vase.  
So i took it. Put the pennies on the counter and started cooking. 

Today Sarah came back and asked where her bowl is. I said she cant just steal or little dishes we have and she got mad. She screamed and told me various of insults like im double-wide. 
Now i get the silent treatment.

Yes, i know you schouldnt enter someones room without permission but i was annoyed. I needed it and it wasnt like she never goes into my room without permission to do much worse. Few weeks ago she wanted to rip apart my graduation dress as an example so i dont see how im the bad guy. 

So am i the asshole? If yes, i hope someone can help me get Sarahs perspective.

"AITA for telling my friend’s friend I’m not responsible for the softwares I got him?  My friend’s friend, Jack, knew that I can buy pirated softwares online and asked if I could get something for him. I don’t use pirated stuff personally but since he asked I tried my best to look it up for him. He ended up getting a software bundle that would be over $650 a year from the official site, and he paid me $1 for it. It was $3 but his friend split the money with him. 

4 months later Jack sent me a screenshot saying that his softwares had received a ban from the official site and said he’s gonna lose access soon, and asked if I could send him a new download link. I offered to buy him an official subscription for 15% of the original price or getting him another pirated version for $8. He simply read my messages and never replied. He had asked me about other softwares before, and has left me on seen as well. 

2 weeks after that, he sent me another message saying that the softwares worked again but he accidentally uninstalled all of them and asked me to send a new download link since the old one stopped working. He told me that he can send me another $1 if I need it. I was so confused because how was I supposed to have a new download link for him 4 months after the purchase? 

I told him I was busy and stopped replying. He texted again saying that it’ll work if I just send the zip files. I didn’t reply, and the next day he texted again saying that “lmk when you send it”. The way that he’s offering just $1 for me to do everything for him made me uncomfortable. He also sounded like I was obligated to send him the files. I told him I was doing him a favor and I’m not a technician. That I’m not responsible for any issues with his softwares, and that the best I can do is to give him a new download link for $8. That for me to download it for him and send it to him, I’m basically gonna download like 10GB of content on my computer, waiting for it to slowly upload to Google drive and type in his email to send it to him and it’s gonna take more than 30 minutes of my time. He left me on seen again. I was frustrated because I’ve been replying to all of his messages thoughtfully and he constantly left me on seen, until he made another request of me. In rage I blocked him. 

Now Jack is telling our friends how big of an asshole I am and how that I just raised the price when he needed help after the purchase, and that I won’t do something as simple as sending him zip files. A friend of mine didn’t pick sides but thinks I shouldn’t have blocked him because they can’t invite the both of us to events together anymore and is making them awkward. AITA? ",0.56
"WIBTA calling my ex partner a fat pig? So I have 2 sons to the same father, a 25 year history of on again off again, 1000 fresh starts to give my sons a better life. It took me way too long to leave but I have now. (A multi levelled situation with lots of things to factor in)
He use to be buff and has street cred. Alot of ""respect"" on the street but none from his sons despite all the excuse I use to make for him.
Since I left him, for all the right reasons he has got so over weight (and that wouldn't matter to me in the slightest if he did right by us, my love had always been unconditional) and I feel so bad for him. He seems so broken. But he done this to himself.
Out of frustration with his lack of accountability or responsibility for where he is at and the fact that he is a father regardless of his choices to let me do it on my own but still expect sex before he hands over a penny to help with things like school camp or whatever. While the cost of living rises, I am caring for and getting a diagnosis for our oldest son who has late onset of muscular dystrophy, so I can't work as much as I need to any more to not ask for a cent from him. Etc etc I called him up, just to tell him he is a fat pig and if he stopped eating so much and maybe put some food on our table he might actually feel better about himself and not repulse me any more.
I don't know what got into me, I just flipped.
I don't know how he gets the respect he does when no real man would put us through half the shit he has.
But I still feel like an asshole, if dhs were more on to things when he was a kid, he'd been taken off his parents without a doubt. That breaks my heart. But far out, I know we don't need him. But I just have so much anger towards him but feel like that was out of line kicking him while he is down.

"AITA for asking my (16f) dad (55m) to minimize his presence when my friends come over? I have friends coming over to my house today, and I'm worried that my dad's presence will ruin the scene. First of all, despite being in his 50s, he uses slang all the time. He says stuff like ""low key"" or ""it's giving"", etc., stuff that teens like to say. It's honestly quite embarrassing when he says it, because he isn't the cool type of person, and he often uses them in the wrong context. I've asked him to stop using teen slang before, especially in public, but he still thinks that he's cool and stylish when he does it. Sometimes, he would say something in slang, and then people laugh at him because he's not a teen or young adult, and what he says doesn't make much sense. 

Also, he makes a lot of noise in the bathroom. There's only one bathroom in the house. He makes grunting noises when he uses the bathroom, and when he does a number 2 the sound is quite loud. He sometimes hums or whistles in the bathroom, and about half the time he doesn't lock the bathroom door. Since he has a lot of waste products, it often doesn't all get flushed down, and there's usually some of his waste left around, and it's disgusting to see it. My mom has talked to him about this countless times, asking him to flush once or twice in between, but he doesn't seem to listen to her. Furthermore he leaves the door wide open after coming out of the bathroom, and the bad odor permeates the air in the hallway. I can't imagine how my friends would react when they witness this.

I explained my concerns to my dad earlier, and my mom agreed with me that his behavior is unacceptable for someone in his age and position. I asked if he could minimize his presence when my friends come over, such as by not talking to us and using the bathroom in the neighborhood clubhouse. I said that it would be really embarrassing if he uses slang around teens that he doesn't fully understand what it means, or when others smell his waste products (or even worse see it). Then he got really mad at me and said that as my father, he has no obligation to minimize his presence around my friends. He said that I am too sensitive and judgmental, and called me ungrateful. I tried to explain my concerns and potential concerns of my friends, but he still didn't seem to listen or care.",0.6
"AITA for uninviting my fiancés sister and his brothers spouse to our wedding?? I’ve been with my fiancé for 3.5 years now. 
For a little bit of a back story to understand my uninviting here you go: 
His sister has never made an effort to form a relationship with me. She doesn’t reach out to me. Doesn’t text me or call. Doesn’t include me in plans. Doesn’t include me in conversations at family events, however she has no issue having a relationship with their (my fiancé and his sister) brothers spouse. I mean the sister will text and call the spouse. Make plans with the spouse. Talk to spouse the entire time at family events etc. 
over the 3.5 years I have made numerous attempts to show I’d like a relationship. I’ve asked to have a games night with them. I’ve planned activities to do with the sister and her kids. I’ve even given her my number after the engagement so she could contact me and chat more and she wouldn’t even do that…
I played nice and included them both (sister and brothers spouse) in my bridal
Shower to which they didn’t care to take any pictures with me. Let alone have a conversation. When I attempted to introduce the brothers spouse as my sister in law the sister came and corrected me saying the souse is only a friend. Like what? Okay then. Not a friend in my opinion as they never made an effort to form a relationship. Me and my fiancé found out we are expecting our first child and I am 11 weeks along. Him and I announced to the family (his parents and his sister, her husband and their kids) that we are expecting. His sister however has not once asked to see an ultrasound. She hasn’t asked how I’ve been doing. Hasn’t asked how things are going along.. 
So now, I’m fed up with it. So fed up that I do not want the brothers spouse or my fiancés sister to attend our special day. Why should they? Like honestly.. and don’t say it’s because it’s my fiancé sister. Who gives a fuck? Me and my fiancé are one unit. You support us as a unit and shoe that you do or you can kick grass. That’s how I feel anyways. 
I feel they are not entitled to since there’s no effort in creating a relationship.

"AITA for spending my money  Ok so I (17m) recently bought a Vr headset  for 370 dollars my parents (both 50) were originally against this idea however I managed to convince them and they said once I saved up the money I could. Let it be know I already had the money for it they just wanted me to save more. I said ok and when I saved it up I bought it. The headset arrived this afternoon and when my parents asked me what it was I told them and they flipped out saying I’m irresponsible and how it is disrespectful to them and all the things they do for me. I am very lucky and my parents pay for my gym and phone bills and also let me use there cars as they say I don’t need one. I am very grateful of this and whenever they lend me there car if it’s low I fill it up and all that. They seem to think that me spending my money is a bad thing and brought up all the others things I bought with my money such as skis, a surfboard, a fishing rod and now this however I have been working since I was 12 so I really don’t see the issue in spending my money as long as I’m still somewhat saving. Anyway we had a massive argument and when I said they don’t treat me like I’m 17 they are now saying I can pay for my phone bill and gym membership. When I said ok I would pay for my phone but I would no longer be going to the gym as I could not afford to pay for the membership as I still go to school they got mad saying they were right and how I spend to much money.

"AITA - Wife doesn't communicate, I get frustrated?  AITA - So today, my wife takes my son to a Dr's appointment, it's early doors and we're currently house sitting for her father. We only have one car and our youngest likes to sleep, so I decided to stay back, understanding that once the appointment was finished my wife would return home as where were staying is miles away from anything. This is what was discussed.

However, what actually happens is, after the appointment, she gives me the outcome I say that's awesome great news, shall we go as a family to a nearby restaurant for breakfast, answer is yes. Awesome, I'll get ready, meet you there. 

10 minutes later, I get a call - ""Hey, my cousin just messaged me and asked if I want to go round, I messaged her last night to say I was in town in the morning so could go see her, she's just had a baby, do you mind if I go?"" 

To which I respond, that the water has been cut off, and I need to poo and shower, I thought we were going for breakfast? And how come you never mentioned you were trying to arrange to see your cousin?  If I'd have known you wanted to make plans, I'd have just got up and gone with you? Rather than be stuck here. 

In the end, I knew that saying I had a bit of an issue with it would be an issue. So I just agreed and hung up the phone, clearly frustrated, but feeling like I could not say no. 

Regardless she goes to see her cousin. However, does not see the problem with her lack of communication. Turns up a few hours later, nothing to say, no care in the world. 

I go home to poo, shower and cycle, pretty annoyed tbh, return back and still no acknowledgement that she failed to communicate. I asked her what  her response would have been if I'd said no, come get me first and she openly admits that she would not have accepted a no. 

The reality is, and I have expressed this many times. My wife on multiple occasions, will say one thing and do something completely different without updating or letting me know what the deal is. She admits her communication is awful, claims to work on it, but just doesn't. I just find it disrespectful. 

Is it really that hard to let me know she was making plans with her cousin? Therefore allowing me the option to not be stuck in a small village with nothing and no running water and a small child.

"WIBTA for uninviting our toddler niece from our wedding party’s trip to the lake? Day after the wedding, we have brunch reservations for family and wedding party and then rented party boats for those interested in joining us for a few hours of the day at the lake. 

We will have big floats and mat for floating relaxing snacking and drinking. 

We told the in-laws about the plan so they know. But we haven’t sent out “official invites” to let everyone know. 

 

After SO and I talked we decided it should only be adults. We have a few pre-teens and SO wanted it to be more “adult only” so we can relax. Avoiding being around loud kids splashing and yelling and fighting with each other. 

But we are worried about the youngest < 2yo niece. Who is we are the god-parents for, and spend time with a TON. She is entering toddler phase, and before she was an AMAZING baby who NEVER cried. We would have no problem with her being there even as a baby… but now she’s a toddler…. Thus she needs to be constantly watch, is fidgety, and gets cranky/yelling on occasion. Understandable - she’s a toddler now!

…but we feel like it would be best if grandma (who hates the lake) baby sits her. 

The issue is that SIL assumes her daughter is going and is asking “do I need to bring her lifejacket or not?”

We are a little afraid of the conversation where we “uninvited her” and how it will be received. It’s not that we don’t love her… it’s not that she’s a “shitty toddler”. She’s just a toddler, may not wanna be there for 4 hours, may get cranky and will take up 100% of the parents time not allowing them to relax. 

(To be real: yes TBH hearing a cranky toddler or having to help watch will make it harder to relax)

We know the SIL may take offense and be a little hurt by it. But would we be the assholes?

Technically we never said “yes she’s invited” but we also didn’t clarify “adults only” when we  briefly informed them of the rough plan. ",0.93
"AITA for not looking after my sisters dog so she can go to a wedding? So basically my sister needs me to look after her dog in a few weeks, she asked me a while back before I went into a new job and I said that I can’t guarantee anything yet but I’ll see what I can do. 

I work every other weekend and live away from home where I grew up where all my family and friends are apart from my sister who lives fairly close by to where I do. 

Fast forward to today I’ve found out I’m not working the Saturday she asked me to look after her dog but it’s the only free weekend for me to go back home in over 2 months and i need to collect a suitcase and some other things from there whilst I’m back before I go on holiday with my partner a couple weekends after.

Now on her end she’s a bridesmaid at a wedding and has enquired to kennels but as her dog hasn’t had the kennel cough vaccine (£250) they won’t have him. She doesn’t seem to know anybody else either to look after him.

She asked me to look after him from 4pm-7pm Saturday but if I leave after that I’ll get home for around 10/11pm unpack sleep have part of Sunday then have to set off in the evening again to get back.

"AITA for Demanding my Husband Come Home Early from the Casino? One of my husband's only hobbies is playing poker. We recently moved back in with both our parents for my graduate school research opportunities (we have a room at both homes, and they live about 10 mins from each other). Where we used to live, he would play poker every Saturday night. This never bothered me, but I noticed sometimes he would leave what I thought was excessively early (5pm) and come back as late as 9am. He would sleep the entire next day. While this annoyed me, as I felt our time together was considerably shorted by him sleeping in the next day, leaving me with all the household responsibilities (we have 4 dogs), I tried to be easy going about it, only giving him trouble if I wanted to have dinner with him before he left or if I had something planned on Sunday. He always obliged but I couldn't help but think he would leave as early as possible if given the choice. He has a dedicated bank roll that he plays with, and we currently keep our finances totally separate as we have since we were dating. I should also mention that he is responsible with money, always contributing to his savings, HSAs, stocks, etc. I am a graduate student and live off loans, and he managed to pay all our bills while i've been in school. It is worth mentioning though that he LOVES shopping, and there is usually at least one amazon package at the door every day. I kept him off my Amazon prime account for a while but when we moved he asked for the password, and he's been ordering a lot since, sending things to my parents' house so his parents' wouldn't see how many packages he is getting. He also plans to not look for a new job for a few months as he wants to take a break since moving. I don't really blame him, and to me, as long as he's not in the red or has credit card debt, I don't really have a say as to how he spends his money. But now that we have moved back, he and I have spent every day together. Without telling me, he accepted an offer from a nearby casino for 5 days comped room. He told me a couple days before he left that he booked this and that he was planning to be gone M-F. AITA for being super annoyed about this?? I think it's just excessive for anyone to be gone that long, whether unemployed or not.

The next morning, things got worse at home with the dogs, and I told him ""I think you better come home now."" He agreed without protest. I feel bad but at the same time, I feel like what he was doing was excessive, and I think the responsibilities alone were too much for me while I have the pressure of studying for Step 2 and getting my research deliverables completed.

"AITAH for getting in an argument with my bf for not speaking English around me? 
My bf is having company over for the next two days. I am American, and they are from a Slavic country. 
I asked him that when I’m around if they can speak English. I am trying to learn his language on my own but me makes no effort to help me learn it. I just find it polite as I would like ti be included and know what is said.
I talked to him about this multiple times. I’m not saying everything needs to be said in English, but at least some. 
Yesterday his friend was speaking a bit of English, but this morning that all went out the window. They started chatting in their tongue when I was around them, and I had no idea what they were talking about.

"AITA for not accompanying my niece to kids' playgrounds? I (23M) am currently visiting my sister (34F) alongside a few of my other siblings. We visit every few months and stay at her place for a week or two to catch up and spend some time with her daughter (2F).

They often go to places catering to kids, think Chuck E Cheese & playgrounds, for my niece to play in. I've only gone on a few of these trips to know they're not for me. I don't like to be in places with lots of screaming kids running around, so when they go I tend to stay home. If they go to any other place with my niece I'm completely fine accompanying them.

My sister is very visibly upset that I'm not sacrificing and willing to go to these places for my niece since my niece asks if I'm going with them every time, and she thinks I'm disregarding her feelings. She always unpromptedly (in the middle of random conversations) says that I'm hurting her by not going.

At first, I gave in to the pressure and went, but took my laptop and noise-canceling headphones and sat working (freelance) in the parents' waiting area after playing with my niece for a few minutes. I later learned that this also upset her, because I wasn't there fully even though I played and talked to my niece all the way there and back, before and after she was done playing. 

She's the type of person to not communicate directly. She either makes snarky remarks or talks about me behind my back to people I trust who tell me what she said. In addition, she previously 'punished' me (5 months ago, still ongoing) by not sending me photos & videos of my niece anymore because my replies to her videos weren't as 'expressive' (few emojis, etc...) or were a few days late because I get busy and can't respond to every detail in +25 videos each a minute and a half long.

Today, I said no and my other sibling (31F) has told me that I need to go with them this time because she's leaving & going home in 2 days, and wants me to spend time with her. I said I couldn't handle being in kids' places because they're too noisy and chaotic for me, and she said I could go work in a nearby cafè, but I'd rather save myself the money & stay home working because I would be completely by myself at the cafè until they were done and we'd head home immediately.

I don't tell them to change destinations. Whenever they say we're heading to X, and X is a playground for kids, I simply say I'm not going. But now they're all upset with me, especially my niece's mom. Am I the asshole?

Additional context: I've been suspecting for a long time that I'm somewhere on the spectrum, partially due to overstimulation and many other symptoms. I haven't mentioned this above because I'm not officially diagnosed yet, only went to one therapist and they said they're about 60% sure I'm autistic. Despite that, and even if I was autistic, I don't think telling her would change anything because she thinks mental illnesses are due to being far away from god, and would not believe the diagnosis because her idea of autism is the non-verbal kind.",0.05

I was out last night visiting some relatives and we saw a dog there which they had named Charlie. I took a photo and a video of the dog. Today I sat down to speak to my grandfather and showed him the dog we saw last night, saying that it was named Charlie. He said (keep in mind this conversation is in another language): 'How could you name a dog Charlie?' And I responded: 'What were they meant to name him then? (Grandfather's name)?'

Then he got super mad saying that I compared him to a dog, and started shouting and insulting me, then told me to leave the room.

I have never seen him so mad before and my grandma came to my room and started scolding me saying that anyone would be offended by this, etc and she hasn't scolded me before so I'm thinking maybe I crossed the line, even if it was by accident.

Now I'm not sure if I was in the wrong, I didn't mean to offend him at all, I just responded because I was a little surprised by him saying that a dog can't be named Charlie and by default said what were they meant to name him and used his name as an example. It easily could've been my name or anyone else's name. I just used his name because he was the one that I was responding to.

Any feedback would be appreciated.",0.28
"WIBTA If I object to my brother's partner taking his last name? So my brother has confided in my that he's getting close to proposing to his gf of 8 years. I don't like her at all (for a multitude of reasons), but my brother loves her and that's all that matters, so when it comes to that stuff I keep my mouth shut. 

The issue is, we share a first name. If she changes her last name to ours, we will literally have the same first and last names. The thought of having someone look me up professionally and possibly finding her terrifies me because of how embarrassing she can be. I've always really loved my name as well, and absolutely hate the idea of having to share it with her.

"AITA for crying when my husband bought me a birthday cake,  I F(43) am celebrating my birthday today. My kids and husband M(39) stayed home to have lunch and celebrate. We have been married for almost 20 years and is safe to say he knows well what I like and don't like. 

While preparing breakfast, my husband went to get coffee and returned home with a small cake to sing Happy Birthday. When he pulled out the cake from the package, it was a chocolate German cake, his favorite, from a local pastry shop he had been craving to try for months. He also pulls out a small container with a slice of cheesecake, my favorite. He proudly announced he bought the cake as it was the only one available, and that he wanted to buy a whole cheesecake but they only had portions. So he thought it best to buy the entire one and bring me the slice since is the one I liked. 

  
Don't get me wrong, I appreciate the gesture, the cake is for everyone to eat, but my face probably changed and he started asking me if I didn't like it. I told him I loved it as best I could, but couldn't help my eyes getting watery and tears streaming down after that. He started making faces and getting annoyed. I told him in front of my kids 15 and 12, that I didn't want him to feel like I was being ungrateful, however, I couldn't help to feel bad as it was his favorite cake and pastry shop, not something I liked. And not because I didn't like the flavor of the cake, is just the lack of thought behind the action. I think I wouldn't have felt as bad or reacted that way if he hadn't bought the cheesecake slice to confirm that is in fact what I like and he knows it.

"AITA for calling my uncle a POS after he sold my dead dads truck?  sold my dead dad’s truck?
My dad passed away a short while ago. He had his little truck that he loved- nothing flashy just a 2007 Chevy Colorado. He never really cared about or bought new cars so when he bought this almost new, it was a big deal. He took great care of it and only drove it 130,000 miles.

When he passed, my mother was feeling stressed out from all the bills coming in and considered selling the truck but I told her not to- as we would need it to haul and move things and it's something that belongs in the family. She agreed and said that she would just give it to me for being such a big help with things.

However, after the move, she informed that her brother offered her $1500 for the truck and she didn't have any use for it. I told her that she could probably get at least 5k but he promised he would keep it and if she ever needed to use it, she could have it.

I wasn't worried about her giving it to me, as I already have 2 vehicles. I just didn't want to see it go.

She sells it and couple months pass and my mom visits my uncle and the truck isn't there. He told her that he fixed a bunch of stuff on it and ended up selling it for 4K. But probably broke even after parts and labor.

Which is a damn lie because my dad had that truck in pristine condition. I texted him and told him that's a shitty thing to do. ",0.96

I don't stay at people's houses at all. I just don't like sharing a living space with basically random people. I've met my wife's sister before, but not her husband, or their kid. 

I requested that we stay in a hotel, which my wife shut down because ""It would be a good experience to stay somewhere else besides a hotel"" and I tried again, requesting we just slept at the hotel and spent the day at their house, and still no. She also wouldn't let me stay in a hotel by myself and just visit during the day because it supposedly looks weird and she might need help (which is why I recommended we stay in a hotel together, but she said no). My final shot was just saying she should just go to the party by herself and I'd just stay home with the kids. Also no.

I do know Spanish fluently since I was raised speaking it at home, but English is still my first language. I began working this retail job and my manager and coworker's keep directing customers they cannot communicate with to me. I never listed that I speak Spanish on my resume, they just assumed. I helped a few customers out here and there but my job is not to be a translator. Since English is my first language it is easier for me to speak English. I do not mind translating occasionally but basically they are handing off all the Hispanic customers to me when some of them can speak English they just choose not to. I told my manager I did not like that I was the only one who gets more work because most of our customers are Hispanic. She told me I am the only one who can speak Spanish and it is my job to accommodate the customers. I told her I am getting more of the work in comparison to my coworkers because they push all of their customers to me since most of our clientele are Hispanic.

"AITA for being in a friends wedding who I don't really like  So I've been friends with a girl for years and it's the typical \*I'm her best friend but she's not mine\*, relationship. I don't go out of my way to talk to her or hang out often, and I know it sounds mean but the fact of the matter is she just isn't someone I want to prioritize. I don't give her false hope that she's my best friend but she still misinterprets my feelings towards her. When we're in person I'm usually fine, but I dread answering her messages and never reach out to her first. I'm not sure why I feel this way but here's what I've come up with.

- our morals are very different. this isn't usually something that concerns me if i enjoy the person outside of their political/religious beliefs, but i causes me to judge her character quite often. she's a good person overall, i just don't think we mesh. 

- she belittles me a lot but she doesn't mean it in a harmful way. she is one to ""shhhh"" and tell me to calm down when I'm just being myself. she doesn't seem to actually enjoy what i have to offer.

- I feel like im always putting on an act around her. i am a different version of myself. i also always have to yes her to death because she doesn't like being questioned. 

- there's built up resentment. Ive been feeling this way for years now and haven't said much, so it's eating me alive and making me more frustrated by the day

We've had a discussion about it one time maybe two years ago but she seemed to ignore everything I said and made me apologize for being honest. She called me out for not putting as much effort into the friendship as she wants me to and I kindly told her that she's my friend but making her a priority just isn't realistic on my end. I tried to be honest because i think she also doesn't deserve a friend who isn't all in for her, but she made me feel bad about it and we just kind of forgot it happened and it went back to normal. She still calls us best friends and everything but she doesn't give me a hard time about not matching her energy anymore which is nice.

Ok ok now to the important part. She's getting married in a few months and it's a destination wedding. I'll be spending a good 600+ dollars to attend. Not only am I a bridesmaid but she wants me to make a speech. In the moment I couldn't say no so i got myself into this pickle. I have love for her and don't want to hurt her feelings by not going/telling her how I feel, but i also feel immense amounts of guilt about being in her wedding when I'm being so (unintentionally) fake towards her.

AITA????

ps. im open to advice on what i should do please!! i don't think i can tell her i cant afford it because her mom offered to pay for my flight/stay because i'm her best friend. I also don't want to be so brutal and straight up be like i don't like you. I am thinking i'm just going to go because i will enjoy myself once i'm there i'm sure, and then i can slowly try to distance myself after (she's planning on moving out of the state), but that just feels so terrible and fake of me.

"AITA Missing my baby’s 1st scan Hi there.

About 2 weeks ago, on a visit to a hospital, my wife was offered a repeat visit to do the first viability pregnancy scan. The date offered was 9th of August which we agreed on. 5 minutes after leaving the doctors office I remembered that  few months prior I had booked a ticket to a music festival that happens on the same day.
I told me wife about it and suggested we should go back and re-book, however, she refused, saying its not a big deal, and because it’s the earliest possible appointment she doesn’t want to lose it.
I asked if she was sure about going alone and she said not to worry.

Prior to the hospital visit, we were discussing booking a private scan around the same time, plus one more in later stages of pregnancy as well, so to my mind at the time it wasn’t a big deal either - just an extra (peace of mind )scan.

Fast forward to today, and my wife is in tears saying that „I choose to go to this festival instead of hearing my first baby’s heartbeat”

Am I the asshole for deciding to stick with my plan and attending this festival?

"AITA for giving my mom the cold shoulder even when she seems stressed?  I (19F) live with my parents and siblings. My mom used to work until 5 years ago where she started this business requiring her to stay at home. Recently she has been really into this. And i mean to a point where we will be in a car ride and she'll be on her phone. 
It didn't really bug me but it wasn't until this week were she would completely ignore me and everyone. So imagine this,coming to your mom wanting to talk to her but she's on her laptop and gives 1 word responses. My older sister called her out in a joking manner to which she responded with ""Just because you are free doenst mean I am"". That's when I realised I needed to return back these actions. Ik sounds rlly petty but I was hurt and mentally drained from having to leave her room realising my mom was no longer available at any times.
So when I did ignore her she realised it because I was the one who used to constantly come to her room. I was sick so she did show some attention like asking if I'm OK but I was giving the cold responses. Later she told me she's sorry and when i asked why she said idk why but ik ur mad at me.
I just said I'm not mad because I didn't have the heart to say it's ok. Anyways then I overheard her on the ohone talking about how she has been stressed these few days because apparently her business isn't going all OK. I feel so bad now that maybe she's ignoring me because shes stressed. My sister told me how our mom said to her she doenst need us anymore and that we used to ignore her so that's why now she's fixated on this business.

"AITA for calling my boyfriend and his sister stupid.  To preface this, I like my boyfriend’s sister, we get along well and I’ve been with my boyfriend for 5 years. 

My boyfriend is about to be on the market for a new car, his car is 10 years old and starting to have some costly issues. I just paid $3000 to get it out of the shop. This got us on the topic of getting a new car. His sister mentioned she’s paying $605 a month on a 7 year loan term… (the car outright is 24k) i thought to myself that’s a terrible decision on her part but I didn’t say what I was thinking to her. 

This is where my boyfriend says I’m the asshole. Today while my boyfriend and I were discussing the car situation. I told him if he can’t comfortably afford a 5 year loan term or less he cannot afford the car he wants.

The car he wants is around 45k. He was thinking he was going to take out a 7 yr loan on it so he could afford the payments. I told him flat out that was a REALLY stupid idea. 

I tried to explain to him why a 7 year loan term is a really bad idea, especially on a used car. I explained that the interest rates are much higher on long term loans because they’re deemed high risk. I used his sister’s loan as an example. 

I told him your sister is going to spend 50k on a 24k car because she took out a 7 yr loan with high interest. I said that’s an insanely stupid decision. It’s not my place to tell her I think she made a dumb decision but I told him between the two of us, it wasn’t very smart. So I’m not letting him make the same dumb decision. 

He got mad at me and said “so you’re calling me and my sister stupid” I said I don’t think your sister is a stupid person but I do think she made a stupid financial decision. I’d think you’re stupid for wanting to do the same thing.

"AITA - Are we the assholes for dropping out? My cousin (M) is getting married in September (about 37 days away). Last summer my wife and I both accepted invites to be in the wedding party on our respective sides. Since then we got pregnant and had a baby 3 weeks ago.

This is our first child and we didn’t know what to expect. We have been trying to figure out how to manage a baby and both of us being in this wedding at an official capacity. 

My wife decided it was best to drop out as a maid of honor instead of asking for exceptions for a 12 hour day of wedding activities. Also note that this is a “no children allowed wedding” which I am fine with. She said she would still come but just to the reception for a couple hours so she would not need to be away for long.

Since my wife sent the text to inform the bride to be she would like to drop out and ALL of the reasons why, she has been berated with rude and mean texts saying it is disrespectful and rude to do this. 

In my opinion I personally don’t see the issue but then again I’m not a huge wedding guy.

My ex decided to move across the city because he didn’t like his landlord. He told me the other day that we need to find a halfway point to meet for drop off and I said “I didn’t agree to that.” He said “it’s non-negotiable.” 

I am irritated that he didn’t discuss this with me before moving and he just expected me to do a lot of extra driving. I don’t like driving- his new location involves driving through a large metro area which makes me nervous and I have an old car.

Her school and dance studio (she has dance 3 days a week) are less than 2 miles from my house. And all her friends are in this side of town. 

Our divorce agreement doesn’t mention transportation because we are so amicable and we lived so close that it didn’t matter (he used to live about 6 mins away now it will be at least 40mins and def more during rush hour or inclement weather). 

Also, he is a musician part time and I often take her on his days when he gets a gig and he typically doesn’t reciprocate (meaning he doesn’t trade days). And my family helps a lot too, but they don’t want to drive that far either (his family is all out of state so they don’t help).

Now he’s asking me about the venue to tell his brother. I told him that I was upset that he went along with that idea knowing how excited I was about our own wedding.

"AITA for being ungrateful for my million dollar education I am a pretty mediocre person. I’m 26 and have an office job that I am just okay at & I am slowly trying to save for a home. 

That should be fine, but compared to my parents and siblings I am a big disappointment. My parents are first-gen immigrants & successful professionals who have done well in their fields but are not insanely wealthy. My 3 siblings all have very impressive careers.

My parents invested heavily in our education & I wish they hadn’t done that for me, as ungrateful as it sounds. I went to expensive private schools in NYC from preschool through high school, and it wasn’t good for me.

I could never excel among the peers I had— most kids around me were either extremely smart, or extremely wealthy, and I didn’t fit in to either group. My family always said to just compete with everyone through hard work, but I had peers who regularly did 16 hour days & worked or studied through the weekends. I tried to keep up but I couldn’t, and sometimes I would get burned out and depressed.

I had a few good friends but always felt insecure. I was just kind of shy, unremarkable and boring & therefore often excluded from socializing with the more competitive or glamorous kids. I didn’t leave with some kind of spectacular network.

With all the help I had, I was able to go to a good college & eventually prestigious first job. But my work lagged behind my peers and my company let me know there wasn’t a future for me there. 

So finally I accepted it & just got a “normal” job at a large company. I’ve accepted that I’m not on a path to a super high-paying job so I’ve decided to leave NYC for a more affordable city.

When I told my parents, it caused a huge fight: they yelled at me for not prioritizing living near family, “giving up on my dreams” and wasting all the opportunities they tried to give me.

It really struck a nerve because I have felt sick about that for years. I was given opportunities most people will never have & that less privileged people can only dream of and it was totally wasted on me. It just made feel like a disappointment.

But for once I snapped and yelled at them back. I said I never asked them to do that & I wish they hadn’t wasted their money. I said my dream was to someday have my own home, yard, family, dog and some free time and they could have just sent me to public school and bought me a house if they really wanted my dreams to come true because all my education did for me was show me how unspecial I am and make me exhausted and depressed.

Now my parents & siblings have all called me ungrateful and aren’t speaking to me. 

After 16 years of private school & 4 years of university, my parents spent literally over a million dollars on my education. I know I’m not entitled to a single dollar of their money but I hate that they wasted it & it will take a very long time for me to afford a home, and I will never live a life as nice as the one I grew up with, so I can’t help wishing things had been different.",0.17

"AITA for confronting my friend about saying 'good kid' whenever one of our friends leaves (while they are still in earshot) ?  So, this has been bothering me for a while, and I'm not sure if I'm overreacting. I (25M) have a close group of friends, and we hang out pretty often. One of my friends, let's call him Kyle (26M), has this habit of saying ""good kid"" every time one of our friends leaves the group or heads home. The thing is, he says it loud enough that the person who is leaving can still hear him.



At first, I thought it was just a quirk of his, but it started to feel condescending. We're all in our mid-twenties, and being called ""kid"" feels a bit patronizing. It almost seems like Kyle is making fun of the person leaving, like he's trying to get the last word in or assert some kind of superiority. I've noticed that our other friends, like Ethan (25M), seem a bit uncomfortable when he does it, too.



So, the other day, I decided to bring it up with Kyle in private. I told him that I find it a bit weird and maybe even disrespectful that he calls us ""good kids"" when we leave. I suggested that he might want to stop doing it, especially since we're all adults here. Kyle seemed surprised and a little defensive, saying it's just a harmless phrase and that he didn't mean anything by it. He said I was being too sensitive and that I should just let it go.

Penelope seemed to be having a hard time and went back inside. Not wanting to intrude, I stayed outside. 
At this point, I started to really feel the effects of the acid. I became unresponsive and wasn't aware of what was happening around me.
What I didn't realize was that a lot of drama unfolded while I was in this state. Apparently, Penelope came back outside and saw the group dynamic had shifted. The combination of Marcus’s negativity, the intensity of the trip, and some personal issues she was dealing with triggered a bad trip for her.
Penelope called her family which made Jay nervous, and she concerned that Penelope’s family might call the police.
This led to a fight between Jay and Penelope. Jay became worried about the authorities. Penelope, on the other hand, felt offended that Jay would assume her family would call the police.
Meanwhile, Marcus and PT’s relationship issues seemed to escalate. Marcus kept picking fights with PT, accusing him of not paying enough attention to her. At one point, Marcus had a panic attack in the bathroom.
I also cuddled with Jay and accidentally told her I was in love with her.
I later learned that Penelope was crying and she felt like everyone treats her differently.
The rest of the trip was tense, though I was unaware of it at the time. Penelope continued to have a bad trip, talking about feeling like she'd lost a part of herself. Marcus and PT’s arguing continued on and off, with Marcus at one point accusing PT of taking my side in a conflict I didn't even know was happening.
After the trip, I felt terrible that Penelope had such a bad experience, and that Marcus and PT’s relationship issues were exacerbated during the trip. But I also feel like I didn't do anything wrong intentionally. I feel guilty for being so unresponsive and unaware of the conflicts happening around me. Marcus now said she hates me and thinks I was faking my high.

"AITA for not knowing who my kids dad is? I (24 f) had just graduated and started my career. I was living on my own and I was having fun drinking and going on dates all the time with men that almost always ended in a one night stand, but i wasn’t looking for anything serious.

One weekend i stayed with a guy H (30 m) we had dinner, talked and mostly.. ya know. i went home and back to work. That next weekend a guy (26 yo, J) invited me to go out, We had some fun and he admitted that he had not pulled out.

Long story short, I woke up one night from a dream where i had a baby and in the misty fog i looked over and saw J.. took a test and.. positive. Regardless, i told both of them that i was pregnant.

J was very optimistic and assured me that he would rather be there even if it turned out to not be his, and H said “he came in you, there’s your answer” and never reached out again. I figured if he doesn’t want to find out that’s on him and not me. I had my baby the next year and a month after she was born H reached out and asked if it was J’s baby. I told him that i didn’t know yet and he didn’t respond.

2 months after her birth, we finally did a test and you guessed it.. J was not the dad. I was relieved to know the answer but also upset that her Dad was the guy who hadn’t been there.

I knew i needed to tell him but i decided to let it sit for a month, as i was single taking care of a newborn baby while returning to work at 5 weeks PP. I decided that he knew of the possibility and if he wanted to know he would reach out again. I needed a plan to make more money and to move closer to family for support which meant i would need to move a state away. I got a job that doubled my salary and close enough to my mom’s house that we could live with her and get some help.

After 3 months i felt ready to reach out to H because i couldn’t bear the thought of it being my fault that she never got to meet her dad. I looked him up on Facebook and there it was, a profile pic of him proposing to his new gf. I was so torn.. do i not tell him or do i storm into the middle of the engagement and potentially ruin it.

i reached out and told him the news. He was surprisingly excited, We talked and had a plan and i thought our lives were fixed.. until His finance threatened to call off the wedding because it was too much for her to bear. He then texted me saying he wanted to sign his rights over to save his marriage, and i was devastated. 

A few weeks later they changed their minds and came to visit, That was the first and the last time. She is now 1 and has met her dad once, and we have not received any financial help. They call me to blame me for moving her too far away (6 hour drive) and that im to blame for his lack of effort. His new wife also told me that she was going to tell my daughter that i was an awful mother because i slept around and had no clue who her dad was, and then hid her from him. AITA?",0.9
"AITA for confirming then cancelling my attendance for my friend's party, and then calling them a gaslighter? So my best friend Marisa (29F) was planning a belated birthday party for my (28 f) friend Theo (26 M), and this was an out-of-town party at a camping site. She sent out the invites two months in advance because she needed to book the space and tents ASAP, but said there was an option to drive in for the day, no reservation needed. I didn't really want to participate in the camping, but I agreed to come in for the day. I don't drive, but two of our mutual friends had vehicles and also said yes to just coming for the day, so I figured I would coordinate with one of them closer to the date. 

A couple of weeks before the party, I found out my father wanted to celebrate his birthday on the same date (it was actually the weekend of his birthday, whereas for Theo, it was over a month after). My family birthdays are typically planned no earlier than 2 weeks ahead, so there was no way of knowing two months prior. Another notable thing: there are some health issues in my family. I have a cousin who is terminally ill with cancer, and my dad himself has chronic health issues, so obviously I am prioritizing my family at any given moment; and Marisa is aware of everything that has been going on. 

So I wrote in our group chat that I could no longer make it, apologized, and briefly explained why. On top of that, the two friends who drove also canceled for their own personal reasons, so even if my family party was not an issue, I would have no way of getting there. Marisa kept probing me and asking why I cannot come, when I had already explained, so I elaborated in more detail. Then she went on a rant saying how it really sucks when people cancel, and how she made this party two months in advance...etc...I was becoming really frustrated because I felt she was acting really unempathetically to my family's situation and only thinking of herself. (Also, since I was not camping, my attendance or lack of had no effect on the reservation or money spent  for booking). 

I told her that I can sympathize that it sucks when people cancel on your parties, and that it even happened to me. In fact, I reminded her she missed my actual birthday because she booked a trip the same day. I told her that I felt it was unfair that she is exploding on me when she more or less did almost the same thing to me, and I was cool with it at the time, and that it's not fair that she holds herself to a different standard than others. She then said that it was totally unfair of me to bring up a year-old example that was ""entirely different"", and that I always overreact. I basically told her that by shutting me down and telling me I am overreacting, this is a form of gaslighting and invalidating my feelings. AITA for: canceling and bringing up a year-old event?

"AITA for disapproving of my wife's running partner? I (35M) have been married to my wife, Mira (39F) for 8 years now. I’ve known Mira for literally my entire life; we grew up just a few houses apart from each other.



My wife is a runner, and lately, she’s been running with her 36f friend and colleague. I’ve come to learn that Mira has been discussing our marriage with her colleague, and her colleague seems to be trying to turn my wife against me. For example, my wife has never had a problem with the few times every now and then where I walk up behind her and slide my hands under her shirt to massage her back. But now, I can’t really do that anymore, because Mira has learned that that’s “wrong”. Sometimes I do lose my temper and yell – I threw quite a few tantrums in the early days of our marriage – but I’ve been working on my ability to manage my frustration and I’ve been a calm, pleasant man for quite a while now. That doesn’t seem to matter anymore, either. 



In general, my wife’s friend seems to pick and choose little “imperfections” in our marriage, and she blows them out of proportion and labels me the bad guy in every situation. For this reason, I’ve been at odds with Mira about her running partner, to say the very least. AITA for feeling like we're losing a good thing?",0.86
"AITA if I (22f) pretend to buy my “gf” (23f) an engagement ring? 
So, this situation is super weird but I’d really appreciate some help. My bf (24m) wants to propose to me and we want to search for ring designs I might like. So exciting! The problem is that we are currently in a ldr and in different parts of the country. We are both in grad school and can only visit each other one weekend a month, not on weekdays when jewellery stores will be open. So, we cannot both simply go to a jewelry store together and ask about what might fit our budget etc. Either he goes alone or I go alone (we just want a rough idea of what can be gotten for our budget of $2k.. we don’t want to order the ring yet.. when it gets to that point, we will go together). 

But for now, it would be more useful if I go to the jewelry store since I’m the one who will be primarily designing the ring which I’ll wear forever. Here is the issue.. it looks really weird for me to go to the jeweler and design my own engagement ring.. it will make me look pathetic and my bf look like uncaring. So, I am wondering if I should go with my bff and pretend the ring is for her? She would be my “gf” and soon to be “fiancee.” We have basically the same ring size. 

I’m worried that I might be the AH since this plan seems unethical. My bff and I are both straight women and also suck at lying. We would be going to a small family owned jewelry store so the owners might make small talk and genuinely want to get to know us but we would be lying about everything. I would be interested in commissioning them if they’re in my budget, so I’m not exactly wasting their time.. but it still feels icky. 

Is this an unethical thing to do? AITA?

If so, do you have better ideas on how I should go about this? I’m really bad at lying on the spot, so I need a very believable explanation of why I’m at the jewelry store and be able to answer questions if they ask. Idk about telling the truth since I’m worried it sounds embarrassing and makes me and my bf look bad. Or do you disagree and think the truth is fine to tell if the jeweler asks who I’m shopping for?

"AITA for telling my husband no to getting lunch in the middle of the work day with my husband’s brother & in laws before he leaves for his final year of college?  In the last few hours, I (F 28) found out that my husband (M 30) made tentative lunch plans with his family and brother without asking me about my schedule.

We are leaving for a wedding this weekend and returning home on Sunday. The plan (I thought) was to stop by my in laws house on the drive back and say goodbye to my husband’s brother before he leaves for his senior year of college a few days later on Thursday.

We both work mostly remote jobs, and I have general working hours from 9-5ish or 10-6ish. The only time I am able to comfortably leave my desk is to go to my workout class for 1-1.5  hours right before the start of my day. 

My FIL texted my husband and said my BIL was depressed that he couldn’t see my husband before leaving, even though we were going to stop by to say goodbye on Sunday. My FIL told him that he realizes my husband is busy, but to try to accommodate. This upset me for a couple of reasons:

1) I got the impression that my FIL doesn’t care about my job schedule, and he doesn’t feel like it’s hard to accommodate such a request when in reality, meetings are generally scheduled more than a week out. And even if it’s not a meeting heavy day or week, there is still work to do (especially in my field of public health where it’s very research and writing focused). It seems like he only prioritized my husband’s schedule and I would just tag along/agree with everything. 

2) We see my husband’s family at least 1-2 times a month, and they live 30 minutes from us. Anything more than that I feel like I would get anxious, as I’m naturally more of an introvert and need time at home to reset my social battery, whether it’s family or friends. So for them to act like it’s nothing to stop by the day after a wedding to come say goodbye on a Sunday instead of Thursday rubs me the wrong way.

I’m pretty upset about the lack of communication from my husband’s side. He went ahead and tentatively said let’s meet for lunch next Thursday right before his brother drives off to college, then caught me up with the plans. And now he’s annoyed at me because I can’t step out for lunch with his family during the work day, which round trip would be at least 3-4 hours. It hurts me a lot because I always make sure to communicate with him before proposing or committing to plans with anyone. AITA? ",0.11
"WIBTA if I remove a bridesmaid?  One of my close friends (Ashley, 28f) has been going through it the past few years. She is in a large amount of debt, has lost a lot of friends and has serious issues with drinking. 

Besides this I love her and have really been there for her… I’ve lent money, time, energy you name it. I genuinely just want to see her get back on her feet. 

In saying that - our lives have taken different directions in the past few years. I have a steady career, am engaged, bought a house with my fiance and settling down. 

In no means do I feel “better than”, but the energy between Ashley and I has been awkward at times and there have been a few instances she’s gotten angry at me when I’ve had moderate success. (Eg I bought a new car and she was really annoyed when she found out in passing conversation)

Recently, I’ve asked 6 friends to be in my bridal party. Ashley came over, got drunk, broke some items from the bridesmaid proposal box and then left it at my house. She had dramas happening with her family during the weekend when the girls had a sleepover and I honestly felt really deflated. She spent a lot of time also talking about how she can’t afford to contribute anything. I have offered to pay for everything but she won’t even be able to pay for transport or her portion of accomodation ($150 for the weekend) for my hens. 

I understand she has stuff shes working on, but I feel that for once, I just want the focus to be on me. For the past years I have been loyal to a fault and honestly, I was hurt she couldn’t return the same excitement. 

My fiance thinks I should politely ask Ashley to step down and attend as a guest, we’re worried she may get drunk the morning of the wedding or potentially be a liability. 

I feel very torn because I love her and want to include her. If I ask her this, it may also ruin our friendship or spiral her mental health. 

I’ve tried really hard to be understanding of her situation but to be honest, for once I want to be selfish and protect my peace. 

Would I be the asshole if I ask her to step down? :/

"AITA for my bf not being happy My ex boyfriend (24) and I (23) of 8 years had been together since we were 15 and 16. We were each other’s firsts in everything but a kiss. After 4 years, I had went through a lot with the loss of a family member and during that time, I obviously was not thinking about having sex. My boyfriend had felt a slight way about it and had began to look at girls online. I let it slide because I understood he was not being satisfied at the moment. A few months later we ended up moving in together. Being that my life had changed in a lot that past year I still was not 100% myself. However, we had begun to have sex again. He had always been the one out of the two of us to have the higher sex drive. However as we got older, I found myself becoming annoyed at his high appetite as nothing we did could ever not be turned inappropriate by him. Anytime we had sex he always had something to complain or feel insecure about. It was always that “I didn't look into it” or he could sense that the vibe was off. I would always reassure him that I enjoyed our sex. Every few months he would come to me and express that he was “not happy with me and our sex because we weren't doing it enough”. Mind you we were having sex 5 to 6 times a week. He had insisted that I was too young to not be  wanting to have more sex and that he wished I was my 16 year old self again (I was 21 by this time). Therefore there was something wrong with me he believed. For many years I forced myself to have more sex with him, I also visited numerous doctors to have my hormones checked, birth control dose lowered, tried toys and so much more. No matter how much I forced myself whether it was seven times a week or multiple times a day he was never satisfied. Recently I had become fed up and expressed to him that I could no longer force myself, and that I felt that he may have a slight dependency on sex. When I said this, he immediately became enraged and said that he doesn’t have a problem and that sex is how he “expresses his love” and that’s why he wants it so much. He also said he felt like there wasn’t a connection on my side that he could feel to which I told him “it’s hard to feel that connection when I am constantly being lectured about sex and criticized for your standard not being met”. He then broke up with me expressing that he wants to be happy with somebody who can fulfill him in that way. I still think that he has a problem being that he believes his love language or way of expressing his love is through sex. Also, that no matter how many times we did it was never enough for him. He also expressed that he is not willing to compromise when it comes to sex and has a set standard for how it needs to be.

"AITA For calling my son “prince” and treating him like one? 
I (28F) have been married to my husband (36M) for five years now. He has a 16-year-old son from a previous marriage, and ever since I met him, I’ve seen him as my own. We share the same wavy hair and light brown eyes, and honestly, people often mistake me for his older sister or even his biological mother because we look so much alike.

Growing up, my mom always called me ""Princess."" It made me feel special and loved, so naturally, I started calling my stepson ""Prince"" because I wanted him to feel just as cherished. To me, he’s the cutest boy ever, and I’m always showering him with kisses and affection because I want him to know how much he’s loved. His biological mother passed away a few years ago, and I just want him to feel supported and cared for.

I have a well-paying job, which allows me to spoil him a bit. I’ve bought him pre-workout supplements because he’s really into fitness, nice fragrances because he enjoys smelling good, and Pokémon booster boxes because he’s a huge fan. I also planned a special birthday party for him that he really enjoyed.

I brought him to my office once, and several of my co-workers assumed he was my younger brother. When I mentioned he was my son, they were surprised and said I seemed too young to have a teenage son. I clarified that he’s my stepson, but it was clear they were taken aback.

Lately, my husband has been making comments about how “Prince” is getting spoiled. He questions why I’m so generous with gifts and jokes about how much I dote on him. It’s starting to really annoy me, and I can’t help but think there’s a hint of jealousy in his remarks. He even acts like I’m doing something wrong by showing my son affection.

I defending myself by reminding him that I’m allowed to spoil and love my son however much I want. I’ve always wanted a child, and I’m overjoyed to have him in my life. I want him to know he’s loved and valued, regardless of whether we share blood. My husband’s comments seem more about his own insecurities than about any real issues with what I’m doing.

"AITA for telling my friend I didn’t care that her cat died? I feel really guilty about this but still very angry, used and hurt so am conflicted about whether AITA in this situation. Prior to this incident I was 99% sure I was NTA in the overall situation. 

So about 4 months ago I (25) sent my longtime friend (25) some money to buy something , she apparently couldn’t because it didn’t work but instead of sending back the money she spent it herself. 
Normally I lend this friend money or rather give without expecting anything back and help her out often, this is only one way and she has never once helped me.  This time it was for a favour for me and when she couldn’t but the thing in her country and asked her to please send it back as that month I was struggling. It got to the point where I had no food in the house, she knew and she was posting on instagram nights out and was telling me was broke and hadn’t been paid. 
Thankfully my partner helped me out that month and has been really supportive throughout this. 

Since then my friend who before this I had spoken to almost every moment of the day has ghosted me only to crop up with excuses acting as if nothing happened until I mention her owing me then she’ll disappear for another month or so and claim busyness or something of the sort and promise to pay me back soon/comeback soon. This was until recently where i said I couldn’t pretend everything was normal until we talked about it and she just ghosted me for over a month without a response. My last text to her being “you always disappear the second i mention it”. I was feeling hurt and stupid but I decided to just move on with the occasional moment of ranting. 

Then today, she finally reached out to say that she would pay me back but hadn’t been able to because her cat had been sick and had just “crossed the rainbow bridge” this morning. 
Initially I had really mixed feelings because I absolutely adore this cat and have looked after him from a distance as my own, paying for all vet bills etc. then was very suspicious because in the last four months she hasn’t mentioned once or posted anything about him being sick and she’s overly active on social media (cat has his own account talking lvl). I checked and he was sick starting yesterday and passed today and she used his passing as an excuse over money that I only had only wanted back as a principal. 
Feeling really used I told her I didn’t give a sht that her cat had died and that didn’t make her any better of a person and she was a user who could stay wherever the fuck she’d been. 

I meant half of it, I feel used and like a massive idiot and in that moment i felt like the cat had no relevance to the situation but i feel like in my hurt i said it in the worst way possible but while guilty meant it in my hurt. AITA?",0.51

Some time went by and they became increasingly frustrated with their son. (my husband) They came to me multiple times complaining about him. They started intruding and walking into our room, and coming into the room when we weren’t there unannounced. This obviously struck a cord with me, me personally I like my privacy, PLEASE just ask to walk in. They had walked into our room while both of us were working and saw a styrofoam cup, a wrapper from some kind of candy bar and a empty 10 pc nugget container on my nightstand from the double i pulled the night before, too tired to remember or care to throw it out. They have expressed multiple times how They do not want food in the rooms unless it’s taken out, ok cool, I would’ve done it when i came home. They also had a problem with us putting clothes waiting to be folded on the couch in the room… ok… 
They had a long long conversation with us about how we are losing the room (that we pay for) and we have the week to get it together. (told to us on monday the 5th) Well they changed their minds and decided to move everything downstairs on thursday, while i was at work.

That definitely affirmed my decision and desire to leave. when I walked i i told everyone in the house that i saw hello, but i didn’t tell them my plans to leave.

"WIBTA Subleaser pays for new couch… In summary, I subleased my school apartment for the summer. The girl has a cat. She moved out yesterday, and upon inspection my couch is covered in yellow piss stains and smells of cat urine.

I have two cats, they have peed on my carpet at home, and once on my bed. I know how impossible it is to get the smell of cat urine out of anything- and this couch is very stuffed and fluffy so likely the pee has soaked deep into it. A steamer or carpet cleaner would not do much.

Is it fair, or okay, for me to ask her to pay for it? It’s gross, it’s smelly, I don’t want to sit on it or nap on it, and I know my own cats will keep peeing on it if it already smells like urine and another cats urine at that. 

It was $80 of FB Marketplace, and a brand new one (same thing) is $150. Having her pay that $80 would go a long way.

"AITA if I let my boyfriend choose between me or his friend? Hi, my boyfriend (22M) and I (22F) have been together for 7 years. We were highschool sweethearts. By college, we took on different courses in different universities. He went on to study becoming an officer while my studies focused on healthcare. He met Jade (23F) because of a military training at school. They shared the same classes once our last year in college rolled around. 


We never had problems for the first three years of college, our problems started when we went LDR for 4th year. I had my internship in a hospital 6 hours away from our hometown. 


At first, she would hang out with his friend group which was never an issue to begin with. But when the said friend group had a falling out, he and Jade stuck together. 


Before the drama with the friend group, they had a camping trip. There were 6 of them, 4 girls and 2 boys, where 4 of them were a couple and he and Jade were the only ones without partners. They brought 3 tents with them and he and Jade had to share one tent. 


Weeks later when I went home, he told me about it casually and I just got quiet because I didn't know what to say. Hearing my silence, he retracted his statements and said that it was just a prank. But i felt it in my gut that he was lying, so I pushed him to tell me truth and admitted it later on. We had a fight and it seemed that after that I could no longer trust them together.


He also would say that during him hanging out in cafes he and Jade would be at the same cafe studying. They also did a project at Jade's apartment and spent the night there. He asked for my permission at that time and I just said yes. 


When I got home permanently, I got a message from his friend's GF asking me if I was free to talk about my BF. So I got on a call with his friend and GF and shared their worries about Jade and BF's friendship. They sent me a picture of them 2 cuddling at my BF's apartment which was posted on Jade's tiktok. I just couldn't speak when the I received the picture all I know was that I had to talk to him.


The next day, I confronted him about the picture and told me that they only did that to feign off Jade's abusive ex who was constantly harassing and stalking her and thats why he had trips to Jade's apartment to scare off Jade's ex. Jade also apologized and talked to me in person. 

The picture and incidents haunted me for nights and has sent me to a depressive state. Still I continued to support him because he was also depressed about the rumors circulating and the college's scrutiny as he was a student leader. 

I asked him to cut her off because I just couldn't deal with the doubts and anxiety any longer knowing that she is still in his life but he just can't just cut her off bc she helped him with his finances, school, and depression when I was not present.

Myself (20F) and my twin brother (20M) both live at home with our parents due to me studying full time to become a nurse and my brother studying full time to become an electrician. i have 3 cats Aurora (3F desexed d/s) Luna (3F d/s ) and Puss (1F d/s) and my mum has a cat Vita (2F d/s) and my Sister has a cat snowball (1F NOT d/s) i have Snowball known since birth, she was my friends cats baby & my sister adopted her at 9 months old. My sister was informed that if she wanted to live at home she would have to have her cat in her room exclusively except for 3 hours later in the day 7:30pm-10:30pm, Snowball this whole time has been agressive towards my brother and i. by this i mean, hissing and growling when she can see us, swiping at our faces when we are trying to take her back to my sisters room, blocking off doors and such. this behaviour could partially be ignored by just not going near her, we have a completely open floor plan, from the front door to the back,so i was going to the toilet and i left the door open as i do,and Snowball followed me into the bathroom and was rubbing herself up against my legs and purring, she jumped up to the sink abd was looking at the water, so i let her as she likes water. after about 1 min i decided it was enough time and ushered her gently off the sink. she jumped down, turned around and hissed at me, she does this often so i walk out of the bathroom and close the door behind me. Then Snowball turns around and launches at my feet and begins to scream & growl. i immediately backed up and she then followed me and i was backed against the bathroom door which is in a small hallway, snowball was blocking the only exit out of that area, she then stands up onto her back legs and begins to swipe at me more. i try to reach for her scruff so i can immobilise her temporarily to move her out of the corner. she then continues to attack me, jumping at me and swiping scratching the shit out of my hands and arms. Once i finally get out from the hallway area i go to my sister and tell her i am going to put her away because she is being very agressive and it’s not right for me to be scared to walk in my own home due to a cat, My sister then loses it saying i’m a narsassist, a selfish bitch and just a terrible person for wanting to lock her cat away for more time, while i was at work she decided to put my cats away at 3pm and cover the bird cages so that her cat could come out, i told her that as long as she lets me know i don’t mind her coming out early some days but she just does it behind my back, i no longer want to associate with her and i’ve been told i’m acting like a bitch about it, and me insisting that she gets the cat desexed makes me an awful person, am i the asshole?",0.82
"AITA for telling my daughter she can't wear a backless dress to her cousin's wedding? My niece is getting married at the end of the month, and I (divorced dad, 46) am taking my daughter (20) as my wedding date. It's a destination wedding on the beach in Jamaica, so the dress code is a bit non-standard, or at least not clearly defined.

My daughter wants to wear a black backless dress that's a little on the skimpy side. I told her it ""might not be appropriate"" but stopped short of telling her she can't wear it. What does everyone think? Am I the asshole?",0.1
"AITA for asking my 40 euros from Splitwise after 6 years? When I was a student I used to use Splitwise a lot to handle shared bills. After all those years I still owed some people money, and some people owed me money. The amounts were not that big and no rush to get it back either way. 
Recently I received an e-mail that a friend logged a refund on Splitwise which I didn’t receive on my bank account. 
I contacted that friend about the situation and she said she just deleted her Splitwise account without looking at what she owed anoybody “because it’s so long ago, it doesn’t count anymore”. 
She owed me around €40 which I asked her to refund me. But she refuses and asks if I’m serious about asking it after 6 years. 
I told her that I didn’t buy her food for her not to refund me and that there was no rush, but I don’t think there is an expiration date on Splitwise refunding. What did you guys think?",0.9
"AITA for asking my aunt to let me know in advance when she's coming over to my place? for context: the place is to me and my aunt's and her brother's name, so shared apartment but they each have their own place, i'm the only one left living here.

yesterday my aunt took me home from her place to mine, after returning from a several hour car trip. my place has a community pool and she felt like taking a swim. i wasn't feeling like it because i desperately needed rest and alone time, but i didn't say anything. when we arrived, i asked her if she could please let me know in advance if she would be coming to my place again. she never actually does, she either calls me when she's already on the way here (10 minutes in advance) or when she's downstairs and rings the entryphone. this makes me very anxious as i am not expecting any visits, and when people visit i like to have the place tidy, and to be presentable (no matter how close i am to that person).

i just asked her to please maybe text me the day before, or just in the morning. this is when she got real mad at me, saying i was making her feel bad about taking a swim (i never mentioned the pool...) and coming here, and that this was her house too and she could come and go as she pleased and she didn't have to let me know whatsoever. i told her she could ofc come and go as she pleased, but i'm living here and i'd like to know if i'm gonna have people coming up to the space i'm living in, you know? and she got even angrier, started raising her voice while i stayed there silent during the whole angry rant, told me i made her feel guilty and bad about coming, that she didn't have to let me know anything, that she helps me a lot (and weaponizing a lot of things she does that i never ask for but i ofc appreciate) but the worst thing is, i told her it's fine, don't do it, but it makes me feel anxious, and she verbatim said ""well texting you makes ME anxious""...

i went to my room crying while she went on to rant at me, saying i was selfish and immature and whatever. she also said she's ""very busy"" and has no time to text me (but she texts the neighbour as soon as she changes plans or to let her know she's going to be late by 2 nanoseconds when they hang out even if she's driving) which made me feel very small. she also said ""i'm living here due to current circumstances"" as if i haven't lived here since i was a baby.

i don't think i asked for much. i'm autistic so maybe i'm missing something. is it rude to tell a close family member to let you know if they're coming over? i do it for her, if i come over to her house, even when nobody's gonna be there, i send a text. i just asked her to do the same, but apparently that's horrible? i genuinely cannot understand and i'm quite heartbroken about this.",0.83
"AITA for getting angry after I caught my friends deliberately lying to me? I(22F) is studying in 3rd year college. I'm friends with these people, A(22M) V(20M) and   B(22F). Our college sends us for training at this center in third year in groups of four so naturally all four is were a part of one group. We are supposed to have different shifts to attend here at this training center. 

So what happened was today we were sitting and talking when I randomly checked the attendance logbook of our group and found out that A and V had done a night shift. Now I don't have a problem with them doing it, but what made me angry was that they both lied to me on my face. I got angry but decided not to start an argument in my state of rage. I walked of and came back to sort things out 2 hours later. A claims and said that they did not have a good reason to lie but did so because they think I'm insecure about them having shifts in the centre, and that I am an asshole for getting angry on such a petty thing. 

To be honest I'm never insecure it, infact i believe that we all should help one another to grow together as a group. They wouldn't even tell me what made them feel that way, but only that I am a asshole for getting angry and walking away at that point.

So AITA?",0.94
"AITA for hiring movers  My dad is 75 and told me we were moving a bunch of heavy furniture and a fridge of his on saturday. I'm good and able bodied and technically so is he.

"AITA for telling my husband he couldn't buy another $300 reptile after losing a different one he bought 5 weeks ago?  My husband (42m) and I (40f) were butting heads for about 6 months because he wanted to buy a snake and I did not want one in the house at all.  I finally broke down and said if he got one I wanted nothing to do with it and that it had to be in the basement. He ended up spending about $800 on all the stuff for the snake (snake was $250 bucks alone) and the snake escaped the enclosure within 24 hours of getting it. This was 5 weeks ago and we still haven't found it. 

So now he has decided he wants to get some sort of exotic lizard that will be around $250-$350 plus he is going to need a few more accessories for it. He also said that it will outgrow the current enclosure (that was for the snake) within the year and that he will need to purchase a bigger one in the future. I started expressing my annoyance at how expensive this is getting and asked if he could get something smaller and not as expensive. He then started ranting about how I pay $200 a month for a gym membership and that I can do that but won't let him get a reptile. 

I don't think a gym membership and a reptile are even on the same level. My gym membership is for my health - an investment that will pay for itself over time.  I go to the gym 5-6 days a week so it's not like I'm paying for it and not using it. It is a crossfit type of gym with instructor led classes. I've lost 28 lbs since January and finally am feeling better about my body. To me this reptile is something he WANTS not NEEDS. It would be like me spending $1k on a new pair of shoes or something. 

So AITA for not letting him spend another couple hundred of dollars on a second reptile when I spend $200 a month on my gym membership? ",0.22
"WIBTA for refusing to watch my sisters toddler while she gives birth I (32 F) don't have children of my own. My sister (39 F), lets call her Sarah, is about to have her 3rd child. 

Little bit of background before we get into it - all of Sarahs children have different fathers. Baby 1, the father was baby trapped and is no longer in the picture, that child is now 15. Baby 2, Sarah made a deal with a random man on the internet to get her pregnant and sign away his parental rights, that child is now 2. Baby 3 is the product of a one night stand with a married man. Sarah has always wanted a family but never settled down as she prefers to 'play the field' so to speak.. 

Our parent has given Sarah over 100k in the last decade as she chronically lives outside of her means financially even though she has steady employment and makes a very good wage.

When baby 2 was born I took Sarah to the hospital a few cities over and took care of her first born child all while working full time. Sarah was in the hospital for about a week. 

When I lost my job 2 months ago Sarah announced to the family (my parent and other siblings) that since I no longer have a job I would be watching her 2 year old while she gives birth. Sarah didn't ask me to watch her child nor did I offer. Sarah then texted me a few days ago asking if I was prepared to watch her youngest still as she is due this month - of course I said yes, she's family. But then Sarah implied that I was incapable of babysitting her toddler at my own house as I don't have any food and I wouldn't be able to bath the child. I was taken aback by this. I don't currently have snack food for a 2 year old in my house but my city does have grocery stores.. and my house that I worked very hard to purchase on my own without a payout from my parent, is equipped with a fully functional bathroom. 

I am extremely upset by the entitlement of Sarah. So much so that I suggested she have another family member babysit for her - she ignored this suggestion. I feel as though her love for her family is dependent on what she is receiving from them and I'm afraid if I refuse to cater to her needs that she will start another family feud.",0.2
"WIBTA for not allowing my daughter around my in-laws dogs? I am 7 months pregnant (so excited!) and the other day my husband and I were having dinner with his parents. During this, my mother in-law mentioned she’d be happy to watch our daughter once I go back to work. Right now the plan is to do that around the 3 month mark. We thanked them but didn’t give any solid answer.

Now, the hang up is their dogs. They have a 3 year old mastiff, a 6 year old boxer, and a 7 year old mix of literally everything. All of them are large dogs and not trained whatsoever. One of them knows sit and that’s it. The mastiff also has some severe agression issues. There have been times he has attempted to attack our dog for simply walking too close. It’s caused us to drop bringing our dog around. 

So, I’m extremely nervous to bring my daughter. My husband feels the same but is willing to do a controlled meet like how we’ll introduce the baby to all other dogs, just with more caution. I honestly don’t even want to attempt. I don’t think I’m even comfortable with her trying to watch the baby, control 3 unruly dogs, and potentially stop an attack. The mastiff has never shown any signs of aggression towards people and actually is very sweet with people. However, I also know dogs can flip when there’s a baby.

"AITA for asking my fiancé to shorten a certain choreographed dance at our reception? 
So it is tradition in my soon to be wife’s family to do a choreographed dance with the women on her mom’s side at the bride’s wedding. I guess it started when my finance’s mom got married and her sisters surprised her with a choreographed dance at the reception and a new song and dance moves are added for each wedding when a woman on their side gets married (the bride now participates too). 

The dance was performed for me without my fiancé’s addition that they haven’t added yet. Of course it’s very cute and I think it’s enjoyable and of course it’s not them doing it I have a problem with, but as I was giving them attention I started to think “how long is this thing?”… it is 13 minutes. And that was without my finances addition. I was polite and I told her I thought it was great, but I think it should be shortened a bit. She agreed, but it is now 10 minutes and I still feel that is too long. I suggested that it should be no more than 7 minutes.

This caused a bit of an argument but not a fight. I just told her that I think people (including myself) are going to be eager to get the night started and want to be out on the dance floor themselves and start mingling. I just feel like if the roles were reversed and it was me asking for this dance with the men she would agree that 10 minutes is way too long. 

I really have been polite to her about this and I haven’t been pushy. She has worked very hard planning this wedding and that’s why I feel like I should let it go, but I am also thinking about our guests and I want them to enjoy their time as much as possible.

TLDR: My fiancé has a choreographed dance with the women in her family at the reception and I feel that is too long and it should be shortened to seven minutes.

Edit: I talked to my fiancé and I guess her mom and her agreed that it should be about 5 minutes anyways. When they started doing it years ago this kind of thing wasn’t cliché and they feel it’s a bit played out now. ",0.43
"WIBTA if I lied to my grandfather/boss?  Edit: Made the choice to talk to him. Leave a comment if you want. But issue is concluded 

Ok, so for the past 10 years, I've worked at a family business. My grandfather owns the store, my grandmother does accounting, and I work there during the summer and holidays from school. 

It's obviously nice to have guaranteed work, especially since it's really hard to get a job, especially a job that you can just go back to at any time. However I'm not dumb, and I can see the business is slowly winding down. We used to average around $700-$800 a day, but now the average is a lot closer to $300. In September my grandfather is turning 84 and my grandmother is turning 80. It's really feeling like it's time to wind down the business. 

However, my grandfather has got this idea in his head. Basically a customer asked if he sold this certain American product (We live in Canada) and since then he's been hell bent on bringing in a whole line of them. It's been incredibly stressful for me because he's appointed me as the leader in conversation around these products, sending me to the bank and having me call and collect information and deal with arranging for the brokers. He wants everything done immediately and is very disappointed with my performance so far.

We made a deal with a guy in New Jersey, but it fell through when he wanted $6000 in shipping and handling, not even the products. This was when I finally got to learn how much it was going to cost to get everything over here. I thought we were only getting the one item, but for a whole line it'll be like $10,000. 

So now he wants me to find another salesman to make a cheaper deal with. Someone who's closer to the border. I know he's a grown man and can make whatever business decisions he wants, but I don't see us turning a profit on this merchandise for many years. And partially I want to protect my inheritance. $10,000 USD is enough to put me through school for a year without working.

WIBTA if I lied and told him there's no one nearby to make the deal with? There is a closer option, but he doesn't really understand technology so I doubt he'd ever find out. I'm leaving for school in two weeks and I don't want to put up with more stress and leave some deal half finished. 

--------------

Edit: I took y'all's decision and talked to him. It didn't go great, he just scoffed at me and said I didn't know anything and should just leave it all to him, and refused to talk any further. 

At least I got out of this that I don't actually care about the money, I was blinding myself with that really. I'm scared that I don't have the same relationship that I used to with him. My whole family has been talking about money and retirement, so I was thinking it was all about that. I'm not capable of doing this work for him and that's what's making me anxious. A multi-thousand dollar international deal is out of my wheelhouse. I'll put my foot down about that at least. I'm done talking to all these big influential people on his behalf. 

A lot have been saying to quit, but to me that's elder abuse, no one else is willing to help him. At least when I'm here, he can rest for a while and actually take a lunch break. When I'm gone he just works all day straight by himself, so I don't feel like I'll ever quit. ",0.97
"AITA for making my fiance feel like less of a man. I 19(F) have been dating my fiance, 18(M) for 3 years and a couple of months, we plan on getting married in 2025 in fall, our anniversary is in Christmas but we obviously can't do it then. Our relationship has always been great, every couple has their arguments but it never anything not standard, like do the dishes or just asking him to help me clean up while he's gaming. 
We love with his parents so there is not a day where I don't see him and a day where we aren't close and I know for sure he's not cheating because hes with me 24/7. 

Lately though whenever I try to engage in intimacy, it doesn't work. He can't get it up and that's okay I understand sometimes it doesn't work out and I always tell him we can try next time. But it's happened 6 times already and this morning too and I don't understand why. I suggested that I give him some head and that seemed to work, he finished 7 times. My concern now is that the day after it did not work, I get it I drained him. One of my friends I had talked to about it made the joke that he was probably gay as head was the only thing that got him to react, I never told him any of that as I figured he'd be hurt. I tried again at night and I actually ended up crying cause I couldn't understand. I asked him if he even found me attractive and he said yes, I asked if at all there was someone else he said no without hesitation. He was firm on it. I let it go but I still cried and asked him not to touch me until further notice. 

The issue is that today, he seemed ready to go and so was I, when we tried though, it went soft while he was in me, and I cried like a dramatic baby. I should've been more calm but I couldn't. I did not understand I did not like what was happening, the tears would not stop and he did try to comfort me but i told him he needs to figure out his issue first then he can touch me, I told him i feel like less of a woman cause i cant get him to react or be pleased. I'm moody and unsatisfied and I just want to be close so he needs to fix his issue. 
He said my words hurt him and made him feel like he wasn't doing enough or that it was his fault his body wasn't cooperating and I made him feel like less of a man for not being able to please, I told him that wasn't my intention I just wanted him to understand how it makes me feel. He said I'm insecure, I have been since I asked if he was cheating, he said I need to work on my issues too, then he'll fix his. 

I do not think I'm the asshole as I did not project any insecurities I was just feeling confused and helpless as to why my partner didn't feel excited to be intimate with me we've always had a good sex life. I just wanted to know what changed and I never lashes out at him for it just broke down. ",0.82
"AITA for leaving my friend at a festival  I (27 F) went to a festival with my good friend of 14 years (28 F). Everything was good and we were having fun. She picked me up that night and I had warned her that I couldn’t stay too late because I had to wake up early the next day cause I had plans with my family. She kinda dismissed me but I didn’t think too much of it. When the time came, she didn’t wanna leave anymore, telling me whether I leave now or later, that I wouldn’t change anything in life, that if I was too tired, I could just sleep tomorrow. To which I asked if I could get my stuff from her car so I could go home and she she could stay there and enjoy herself but she wouldn’t let me. She actually kept saying to sacrifice myself for her. So I had no choice than to wait until she was ready to leave. The drive back home was completely silent. I ended up texting her a couple of days after to explain how I felt. She never answered.

A week later, I texted her again to see if she was still down to go another festival that we had already gotten the tickets for. That was my mistake. I realize I shouldn’t have texted her before fixing what had happened at that first festival.  She said she was still down to go.

Basically the same thing happened again, but this time I left. 
The whole night felt already weird: we were not really talking to each other. The vibes were off. I was not enjoying myself. 
Again I warned her that I was planning on staying until the end cause I didn’t wanna be stuck in the metro with the whole crowd. When I decided to leave, she snapped and basically guilt tripped me into staying, saying stuff like : you have no reason to leave, I worked out today and I played tennis and I’m still here even though I’m tired, you can sleep tomorrow and me in working, you’re not puking or dying, how dare you think it’s okay for you to leave? If I did that to one of my friend I would never be able to sleep at night, you’re juste waiting your money and your ticket, we have different values and principles, etc. 
After that speech I was even more sure that I wanted to leave, so I left and she stayed.

The day after, she texts me to tell me how she feels but not once in her text did she say “I feel”, it was just “you did this” “you did that”
It was really accusatory more than sharing how she felt. She ended that text saying she didn’t wanna be friends anymore.

"AITA for not refusing to mow my meadow? I recently received a demand from a neighbor of mine, asking me to mow my meadow I have in my back and front yard of my home in the suburb I live in. My issue with this being that my meadow is home to many local wildlife and pollinators. Trimming it has forced out all of the songbirds, frogs, voles, crows, squirrels, groundhogs, snakes, bees, rabbits, and skunks that live in my area. At first, I refused to comply, but after receiving a phone call from both my mother and aunt informing me the entire neighborhood was up in arms about it, I gave in and mowed the meadow. 

This appeared to stop the complaints for a time, and during that period I allowed my meadow to grow back in full force, more beautiful and bountiful than ever. The voles returned, all was well. But then the complaints started up again.

Once again, I started getting shit for my meadow, and while I was gone away on vacation my mom got a call from my aunt who said my neighbor had called to complain about my yard once more. So my mom called a yard service to have them mow my yard. I noticed they had done so the morning after I got home from my trip, so I called my mom and that's when she told me everything that had been happening while I was gone. So I told her I'd get to the bottom of things.

I called my aunt and my aunt tried to stonewall me and refuse to say who it was that had complained. In a moment of complete frustration, I lost my shit and screamed until I lost some of my voice. Then, she admitted no neighbor had ever called or complained, and that SHE had been the one to file the complaint to the town—driven by her personal preference for shorter grass.

I yelled ""that's what I fucking thought,"" and hung up on her and called my mom back and told her what had happened, and everything about my aunt's deceitful lies. I then proceeded to change my locks, so we'll just see how my aunt feels about that.

I now know my aunt is trying to turn everyone in my life against me due to long grass.

My aunt does not like not getting her way or being confronted for her behavior. Also, I should mention that she happens to be my employer, and I'm now concerned that she questions my judgment so much after this matter that she may fire me in retaliation. 

AITA for not wanting to mow my meadow, or is my aunt/neighbors for not allowing me to supply a wildlife habitat for many creatures? Was yelling at my aunt until I lost some of my voice wrong? Or am I in the right to defend my rights and my meadow? Please let me know.",0.67
"AITA for expecting my parents to help me get back on my feet Ok so not exactly as the title says but I (21f) am currently living at home with my parents and my sister for the summer. I dropped out of college in the spring because I didn’t have a passion and had changed my major too many times. I’m taking 2-3 years to figure my life out. Well my parents already don’t love that. They wanted me to have the traditional experience even though it was seriously not working for me and led to some mental health issues I’m still working out a bit. Well I’ve been home since May and have worked since June up until last week. My job was seasonal and also my dad is my boss. I didn’t have a second job lined up when it ended but I do now. Me not having a job lined up was also a huge issue. All summer while I’ve been living at home I haven’t paid rent and have been a great employee for my dad. My sister was home as well from school and we were all together as a family. Now my sister is getting ready to leave they want to know my plan. Well my plan is to work and move out in oct/nov. I don’t want to live with them forever but I’m trying to save up right now and I had debt to pay off with the money from my summer job. 

That’s the backstory:

My parents drew up a contract for me to continue to live with them through Oct/nov. 
basically I have to pay $512 a month to live with them (rent, phone, groceries, etc.) and adhere to strict rules. No friends over, no going to a friends without permission, no leaving unless they know where I’m going, no sleepovers at someone else’s unless it’s cleared well in advance, 9pm curfew, 11pm bedtime. No sleeping in past 7:30am. AND volunteer 6 hrs a week to “find myself and help people” (it’s not really relevant but no one in my family volunteers other than me and I have about 150 hrs of volunteer work in many different areas). 

So I blew up at that and said there’s no way in hell I’m paying $512 a month to live as a 15 year old when I’m 2 months away from being 22. And we got into a huge fight. I just wanted a little help and support to figure out where I’m going with my life. Now they are saying I’m ungrateful and unkind and other parents would just throw their kids on the street and I should consider myself lucky. So AITA? Am I being ungrateful?

"AITA for accidentally ruining my ex-boyfriends life? me and my ex dating for literally about a week. he took it very fast, i was mostly on text speaking that school hadn't started yet. he was very sexual. i wasn't comfortable with it because my past relationships were also very sexual and involved me getting used very badly. but i was lonely and depressed, so i went along with it even though i didn't want to. as our relationship went on, he would share the dreams he would have with me in the mornings, i was fine with it even though most of the dreams were sexual. my breaking point was one morning where he messaged me saying that one of his dreams were about me breastfeeding him and babying him. i wasn't comfortable with this. a bit after, he asked me for n\*des. i was on the verge of tears and that was really my last straw. this was the day after i told him that i was used in a past relationship and was also groomed. i wanted to die. the next day i broke up with him. it went fine. about less than a week later, school started. long story short a guy that i had liked for a long time asked me to homecoming and then later on to be my boyfriend. (we are still dating now!) i told him, and friends. i felt bad but i couldn't keep it in. my friends told people and sooner or later everybody knew. he was getting bullied like hell. people would yell ""gogogaga"" at him. i still kept in contact with him a bit after we broke up before i fully blocked him on everything. i blocked him after he said he saw me in a school assembly and got h@rd so uh yeah no blocked. even during a false alarm sh00ting, he was accused because his girlfriend or him weren't at school that day. rumors spread that he got his girlfriend pregnant, and that he had a sketchbook of girls in the school naked.  i feel horrible. i blocked him on everything after he broke up. but when he got a new phone i was the first person he texted. my boyfriend ended up texting him and they almost fought. idk i still feel bad, my boyfriend doesn't want me talking to him which is reasonable and i don't think i want to talk to him. but i feel bad. i know he was already struggling with depression, and i feel like i made it so much worse. school is starting soon and i'm so afraid that i'm going to have to talk to him or something. this sucks.",0.88
"AITA For using a ""kids teaching technique"" on my wife My wife (36F) and I (38M) have been married for 12 years and have 3 kids (10, 8, & 5).  None of our kids have phones yet, so about 6 months ago we had a talk with all 3 of them to talk about what they should do if they ever get lost, in danger, need help, etc.  One of the things we talked about was them knowing both mine and my wife's phone numbers.  I even made some flashcards with our numbers in addition to their grandparent's numbers so that they could memorize them.  We kind of turned it into a game to help them learn and it worked great.

During that time, it came up that my wife doesn't know my phone number by heart.  In fact, she doesn't have any phone numbers memorized anymore.  I told her that she should at least have mine and someone else's (like her mom) memorized in case she can't use her phone and she needs to get a hold of someone.  She told me I was overreacting and that it isn't a big deal.  She then asked if I have her number memorized and I railed it off to her without hesitation.  Along with my mom's, dad's, and my younger brother's.  

Well, a couple weeks ago, she was at a work event about an hour from where we live.  She somehow managed to lock her purse in her car.  Her purse had her car keys and her phone inside.  So, she had no way to get home and no way to call me.  Thankfully, a coworker of hers was willing to drive her home.  But then we had to pile all 3 kids into the car and drive an hour to get her car and then drive back home.  

Of course, one thing that came up during that drive was that my wife had no way to contact me because she doesn't know my number.  If she had my number memorized, I could have brought her keys to her and saved her coworker the inconvenience.  She got very defensive about it which I'm sure was because of embarrassment.  But I used the situation as an example and told her that if it was an emergency instead, then it would be a much bigger problem.  She eventually agreed that she would try to memorize some phone numbers.

Naturally, since we already had flashcards at home for this very reason, I figured it would be a good way to help her learn.  I got the kids involved as well just to reinforce that memorization for them.  Problem was that my wife couldn't memorize the numbers.  My kids knew them all by heart, even the 5-year-old.  My wife got frustrated and embarrassed.

She said she would just write numbers on a piece of paper and put it in her purse.  I had to remind her that idea would do absolutely no good if she locked her purse in the car again or lost it.  She got upset with me and told me that no one memorizes numbers anymore and that even if it was an emergency, she would figure something out.

I told her that's not good enough for me.  I told her I don't care how frustrating or embarrassing it is for her, but she needs to memorize at least my number and someone else's.  She told me I am being a big jerk about this and making it into a huge deal when it doesn't need to be.  ",0.33
"AITA for watching tv without my girlfriend? A bit of background we’d be together 5 months today but we got a rough start and have not talked since this happened. Not even a week after I (32m) asked her (32f) to be my gf, she got a call from her mom that she had been diagnosed with cancer. She lived in another state so my gf took off to take care of her for 3 months. I went to her place every other day to feed her cats. Since she’s been back I can’t seem to do anything right. 

Here’s what happened. We’ve been watching Breaking Bad. She’s already seen it and I’m a first time watcher. I’ve been sneaking episodes when I go home and she found out. I tried denying it at first, but admitted I was busted and kind of tried laughing it off. She didn’t talk to me, so I said I feel tension, I’m sorry I can’t be perfect, and asked if I should leave for the night. She said “yes” so I left. I texted her later that night, said I was sorry about earlier, and good night. She had her phone on DND so she was probably already asleep. She texted me good morning. I texted her good morning back. And it’s been 6 days I haven’t heard from her since. AITA here?? I think she’s overreacting ",0.85
"AITA for telling my daughter why we’re getting divorced? I (M51) caught my wife (F48) having an affair with her coworker 3 years ago.  Obviously it devastated me, and I was dubious that we could save our marriage. But we still loved each other and I felt like I had to at least try for the sake of our daughter (17 now 14 then). Our daughter doesn’t know about the affair.

It’s been very hard, but with counseling and a lot of soul searching me and my wife have made a lot of progress. I won’t lie and say we’re deliriously happy, but our marriage is stable. Or so I thought.

I had several requirements for our reconciliation. One of them was absolutely no contact with this man ever again. Because they were coworkers that meant her changing jobs. She works at a bank, and was able to transfer to another branch that was still close to home. I was conflicted about this, because they both still worked for the same company and could possibly cross paths again. But I (foolishly) conceded that it would be ok as long as she avoided any possible contact with him and if she did run into him unavoidably that she wouldn’t talk too him other than to say leave me alone and inform me IMMEDIATELY.

As it happens I have an acquaintance that works at this new branch. I privately told this person about me and my wife’s situation and to be on the lookout for her ex affair partner. My wife didn’t know my friend knew about her affair or that they were kind of watching. Please understand I wasn’t telling this person to spy on my wife just to tell me if this man came into the bank and interacted with my wife in any way.

You can probably guess what happens next. My friend reported that my wife’s ex came in not once but twice in one day and talked with my wife both times. AND SHE NEVER TOLD ME. They didn’t talk long and it was out in the waiting area not private or anything but still. So my wife has broken several conditions of our reconciliation and I have decided divorce is my only option. When I confronted her she denied it at first but then confessed but that they were both innocent conversations “only for a minute” and she didn’t tell me because she didn’t want to upset me. Such bullshit.

So I’m initiating divorce, but I’m kind of the victim here imo. And I don’t want my daughter to think I’m breaking up our family because I’m being selfish or something. I don’t want to lie to my daughter about why her parents are divorcing. I know it will damage her relationship with her mother but that’s kind of her own fault, right?

 AITA if I tell my daughter that we’re divorcing because her mother had an affair and then lied by omission about seeing her ex affair partner?",0.38
"AITA - For talking to someone else in the midst of leaving an abusive relationship I am fully ready to be called an asshole here but I need some clarity. I was in a VERY abusive marriage/relationship for 7-8 years. Reddit will not let me say what kind of abuse but just imagine the worst of the worst here. I lived in his home state & was very isolated. When I did try to make friends he would find a way to ruin it for me. I am not sure if that part was on purpose but we would almost certainly get into huge blow out fights that would lead to me cancelling my plans. After enough canceled plans, ppl stop hitting you up. 



This last year things got worse. His stress was magnified by work which in turn would get taken out on me. I was by no means an angel either. I talk back, can be very sassy, & always stood up for myself. I am stubborn & voice my opinion when I am not happy. Honestly when I am not happy it is written all over my face & my moods will reflect this as well. I can be a difficult person to deal with & I know that. He knew that before we got married as well. 



  I protected him to the ends of the earth. I suffered in silence for years & did not tell anyone what was going on. Being very far away across the country helped me hide this secret for a long time. 



One of the times I was abused I fled back to my home state for a week. During that time period I told my friends kind of what had happened but left out details to protect him bc I knew I would just end up going back. Long story short, we got into an argument while I was out there & he called my friend & said some really foul shit. I was use to this, but him saying that to my friend broke my heart. It lifted the spell I was under & allowed me to become honest about everything that had been going on with my friends and family. I decided I was going to leave him.

 

Over the course of the next couple of months I kept coming back to my home state & planning my departure. During this time I started chatting with someone. It then turned a bit more flirtatious & I kept it up. It was nice getting this attention and for the first time in a long time, someone was nice to me. It was hard to let that go after being so affection starved. My ex thought we were going to work it out, but I honestly had no intention to. He ended up finding out about me talking to this other guy & shit hit the fan and I ended up having to leave everything behind (my home, my belongings etc) & flee back to my home state. Now he is telling everyone that I cheated on him & thats why we broke up, but in fact that is not true. I left him because I was tired of the abuse. I was tired of being constantly scared and the life being drained from my eyes but I will say I do feel guilty. I feel guilty I did that before fully leaving him, even though I had mentally left I had not officially left him.

"AITA for causing one of my best friends to kick me out of their home in a foreign country and no longer want to speak to me? So a quick prelude, I have several mental issues including ADHD and I tend to be both forgetful or neglect to do something.

So quick backstory. I made a friend online a few years ago (I shall refer to them as X) and we got along really well. After some time, I started visiting semi frequently. We live in two different countries but it is only 2 hours away via plane so it's not a big deal.

This time when I arrived, the house was hermit levels of untidy, and I did my best while X was busy with a project.

The first point of contention was that when it came to going out and doing things, I would always end up leaving it to X to plan out. This was obviously problematic as it caused them unnecessary stress while I did nothing, but it was one of those things i was doing without realising.

To be fair on X, I was told several times about this. The same applies to me not being proactive with keeping their place clean or getting groceries and having to be told to do it. Now most of these problems are probably linked to my ADHD but I admit myself that it isn't at all an excuse.

Now to the incident in question. Eventually everything I previously mentioned came to a head. I had volunteered to fly out to X and look after their home  and pets while they were at an event. I do admit in hindsight that i did the bare minimum instead of being more proactive and going the extra mile like I said I would do.

They came home and then got annoyed at me, which is more than fair. But as the next two days progressed, X locked themself in their room and refused to come out, only speaking to me via text. That is when I started talking to a mutual friend (let's call them Y) explaining the situation. 

After 2 days, I woke up, did the usual morning chores, but then recieved a message telling me to grab my shit and get out, no chance to talk things out, I had to leave there and then in a foreign country with not much money and nowhere to go. 

Of course I left as the last thing I'd want to do is cause a close friend to be uncomfortable in their own home. That's when I reached out to Y again, this time explaining the development. I don't know what Y said, bit this enraged X even more with claims that I was smack talking. X then proceeded to block me on all platforms.

I did eventually make it home after 48 hours, having to sleep in one of the worst airports in Europe and generally being exhausted and smelling like death when I got home.

I'll be the first to admit that I did make mistakes. but I'm unsure If the reaction to what I did wrong was really warranted in relation to everything. 

tl;dr

Upset a friend by making several mistakes that piled up, got left wandering the streets of a foreign country trying to find a way home.

edit: I did vacuum, load and unload the diswasher, clean up after myself, feed and water the animals, walk the dog and do general house chores etc. What I didn't do was major things I promised I would do like clean out the bird cages which seemingly had not been cleaned for years like I promised and spent a lot of my time just watching TV.

edit 2: I want to clear up that I did not mess up the house myself, when I arrived it was in a terrible state, dirty dishes all over the kitchen which I cleared up, months old food in the fridge that I threw away. I did my best attempt at cleaning up the house but there was only so much I was in my own capacity to do.",0.48

There has been some strain however with her going through my phone and seeing i’ve been with a girl.. for context i am mid 20s F and i bought my own house but yes she still pays my phone bill and yes she is religious.

"AITA For Not Changing My Last Name AITA for refusing to change my name to my new husband's name?

I (35F) was previously married to my now ex-husband (36M), we'll call him Stan. Stan and I were married for 6 years until we divorced on good terms 5 years ago. We do not have any kids together and everything was split 50/50 as we had similar assets. We also still keep in contact and meet once a month for dinner or coffee. 

When we got married, I took Stan's last name, as my maiden name was difficult for others to spell and pronounce. His, on the other hand, was simple, think ""Hall"" for example. 

3 years ago I met my now fiancee (37M) who we'll call Todd. Todd also has a somewhat difficult last name to spell and pronounce. When I met him, I told him if we get married I am keeping my last name. He seemed to have no problem with this. We got engaged a year ago and have been planning the wedding since.

3 days ago, as we were talking about the wedding, he brought up changing my last name to his. I reminded him of what I said at the beginning of our relationship and that I wasn't comfortable changing my last name as I enjoy having a simple last name and that his would cause confusion. He got mad at me and told me I am being unreasonable. He says that I have no kids so it wouldn't be confusing for them and that it just ties me to my past with Stan and not to him.

We argued about it and he told both of our families and our mutual friends. My family understands why I don't want to change my name but also says it is disrespectful to him to not change. His family is on his side and our friends are torn.

"AITA for trying to work in a gentleman’s club as a bartender? 
I ( 23) female am a recent college grad and have a current job as a server. I work at a small restaurant, and slow season is very quickly approaching. I’ve been at this restaurant for 5 months and I want to stay there for awhile but need more income. One of my work friends also works at a gentleman’s club in the city and said there was an opening as a bartender/bottle service girl at the club. I have been very intrigued as I would have a better chance as I am friends with this girl and she could put in a good word. Plus, I could work at it after my day shifts at my current job. I live with my parents and my mom is the type of person who likes to have my location and goes crazy if she doesn’t. I told them about the opportunity and they got extremely upset and disheveled that there is a “seedy” crowd that are in these clubs and I’d be putting myself in harms way. I was supposed to simply go check out the club yesterday because I had never even been into a gentleman’s club but my mom had an emotional breakdown and begged me not to. I very angrily agreed.

I left, and I’m back home now and my mom has apologized but I still feel really frustrated that I couldn’t even go see what it was like. My sister thinks its not a big deal that it’s a gentleman’s club and there are dancers around (my mom doesn’t agree w that), she just thinks the neighborhood it’s in is unsafe and the things that happen in these places would put me in harms way.

"AITA For not changing my wedding for one of my friends I (24F) will be getting married to my fiancé (25M) on October 20. Both of us are Catholic and want to get married in the Church. My mom is baptized, but only goes to Church on Easter and Christmas. My dad chooses not to be affiliated with any organized religion. Because of this, my parents decided to let me and my siblings select our own beliefs and get baptized if we wanted to. I went to Catholic school for 7th grade through college (it was my choice because of my experiences at the other schools in my area), and decided to believe in what I was taught there. I was baptized when I turned 20.

The Catholic faith is very important to both my fiancé and I, and when we got engaged we both agreed that we would have our ceremony in our local church where we go to Mass, with the reception in a park. We are friends with people of different religions, and one of them is Buddhist. She lives in the same city as us, about 15 minutes away. We mailed out our invitations 12 days ago, and my Buddhist friend just responded 2 days ago. She said no, so I reached out over text to say “I’ll miss you at the wedding! Sad you can’t make it.” She then told me she wanted to come, but couldn’t because the religious aspect made her uncomfortable. She then said that if we changed our wedding to be non religious, she would come. I told her that I was sorry, but would not be changing my wedding to suit the preferences of one guest. I then suggested she skip the ceremony and come to the reception for food and dancing.

"AITA for screaming at my dad because he invited a stranger without my knowledge  Hi just for background info Im 15M and Spanish so sorry for any grammar mistakes. And later on it becomes important to say that I’m not really social and suck at conversations and social situations. So I’m really awkward and introverted and basically stick to a few good friends.

Basically my dad has an old college chat where all his old college classmates are in. (Like 100 ppl). One day one of these classmates asked if anybody could take their kid Jason (fake name for obvs reasons) 16M (who was travelling in Spain and bring him to our house to stay for a week). Mind you he did not consult me about it and invited Jason to stay with us without my knowledge. 

Here comes the part where I think he went wrong. He expected me to show Jason around and hang out with him. (We had never met before and I have no background info to rely on) However he expected me to become buddy buddy with him since all my siblings are over 18 years old when all I wanted to do here was just go to the beach and chill Tf out. So once he told me this I got really pissed and screamed at my dad for forcing me to be his tour guide especially since he knew I was really introverted and also because he went behind my mom’s back to do this and she disagreed with this (my mom cooks and cleans and would have to do it for him too). Another Thing is that Jason only has me to rely on since the other people he could talk to (my cousins) will probably stick to speaking Spanish which Jason doesn’t know. And I told him all this.

But in retrospect was it too much? Should I apologise?

Edit: (I will be apologising to him for screaming and see how it was brash and irrational. But the way things are going to go I’ll probably have to do as my dad says. But I will be nice and welcoming to Jason as this was none of his fault)",0.51

I’m upset because my dad is thinking about purchasing a new car and I told him if he wanted to test drive it I wanted to go with him (because I enjoy doing those type of things AND this would probably be the car I would drive since my parents don’t want me driving our other car). Well during their all day date they went and test drove it and came home talking about “How amazing it was” and etc etc. I was kinda annoyed and when I’m annoyed I kinda shut down so I didn’t say anything and my mom got upset at me and was like “You can’t expect you father and I not to do stuff together by ourselves” (just to add this WAS NOT the only thing they did on their all day date) and like yeah I get that but I told you I wanted to do something and was looking forward to it… I don’t know I just felt upset but my parents are acting like i’m being dramatic and overreacting so I am wondering if I am being a asshole?

"AITA For telling my sister stop being obsessed with Asians and Asian Culture? My little sister now (18 F) became obsessed with a group called SHINee around 2019, introduced to them by an Asian friend. Since then, her fascination with Asian culture has only grown. It started with posters on her walls, and her laptop and phone wallpapers featuring the group. Eventually, she expanded her interests to include anime ( which i also watch) , which led to her developing a deep appreciation for Japanese culture. She’s now very into Asian food and is studying the Japanese and Korean language. Additionally, she’s learning Vietnamese because she has been in a relationship with a Vietnamese boyfriend for the past three years.

I’m concerned because it feels like she’s becoming overly focused on Asian culture, to the point of neglecting our own culture. For example, when our family discussed taking a trip for her 20th birthday, she asked to go to Thailand instead of our usual destinations like Chicago or New York. Over the years, she’s become increasingly absorbed in different Asian cultures, and I even walked in on her watching boys’ love dramas during her junior year of high school. I worry that this obsession is becoming unhealthy, and I wonder if I’m wrong to feel this way. I want to add on and say she does respect our culture and never talk down on it but she just doesn’t show as much into as she does in asians culture.

So about a month ago, I told my sister that I thought she was obsessed with Asian culture. Since then, she hasn’t spoken to me, and the situation has escalated to the point where she has moved in with her boyfriend. I didn’t think what I said was wrong—I was just trying to express my concerns—but now it feels like it’s driven a wedge between us. I would always make little jokes saying it but i actually sat down and told her that time.",0.86
"AITA for acting this way towards my friends? TL;DR: AITA for trying to get them to play something else by either distancing myself or ignoring those that play the game?

So my long time friends and I mostly chat and interact by playing video games, and for the last year or so they have been playing a specific game basically exclusively. At first, I would join them and play but as time went on it became more and more frustrating to play so I just stopped playing entirely. At first I thought it would just be a phase and it wouldn’t be an issue but now it has been a year later and that’s still the only game they play and nothing else. Thats basically all they talk about too. I’ve voiced to them that I really dislike it (I told them I don’t see how they can enjoy it so much) and that there has to be something else to play together. 

I’m so frustrated with the whole situation that I’ve thought of ways I could try and show them how much it’s bothering me. I’ve thought of either distancing myself for a while to see if they catch on, or joining the voice chat and mostly interacting with those that don’t play the game. I just really miss playing with my friends, but I know the ways I’m thinking of approaching the whole thing seem like I am being manipulative or greedy.

"AITA for being considered negative by a friend and disagreeing with that? So I get this DM from a friend in a hobby I'm in out of the blue. We have a lot of stuff in common as well including geography, shared life experiences, etc. He's stating to me this is a message to tell me to stop being a dick (his words) in a group chat, that he's tired of hearing non-stop (his words) complaints about every new item coming out in this hobby. Then he emphatically states the only time I was ever excited about something was something I got last year which was only tangentially related to the hobby. Then he tries to soften it by saying he's not trying to devalue my thoughts/feelings about the hobby but that my complaints completely overwhelm any praise or supporting comments I make in the hobby.  
  
Now, I'm going through a rough patch, which everyone in the chat knows, so feeling pretty angry, I basically respond by pulling up almost two dozen instances in the group chat, links to the exact messages, of just the past month alone where I was unequivocally positive about a development or new product in the hobby, including new arrivals I just got. I capped it off by stating I'm just giving my honest opinions on things just like everything else but it's not all negative or even half negative. Rather than state he was in error, he just waves it away as whatever I'm going through in this rough patch and asks about the newest developments in that rough patch, which I just give an update and then never respond again. Going through the chat, I try to look at what would be construed as negative. It almost always consisted of just my honest opinions of ""It looks interesting though I don't think \[X\] would work too well/could be easily broken/not work/not accurate"", ""Hopefully they change this in the future"", ""That costs way too much for what it offers (like paying $500 for a commonly found sports team hat)"", etc. And at least to me, there's a 60/40 positive/negative ratio of my comments and it's nothing different from anyone else's opinions being broadcasted in the group chat. And the last comment I had made before this DM was ""I wish they'd add \[Y\] feature to this item, because then it'd be perfect"", and the one before was ""I can't wait to receive my \[T\]"". Now I also found reminders in that chat history that this friend has also told us all to stop it with a running gag he didn't like, which was not directed towards him or anyone but we acquiesced anyways, even though other running gags that I was annoyed with I just let slide each time. Then we also had to stop talking about \[Z\] because it went against his beliefs and stop bringing up certain foods that only he doesn't eat. So I'm worried I'm potentially overreacting to just the usual demands. Basically I just stopped participating in the group chat because I felt singled out and wrongfully accused. He's also stopped talking to me and interacting with my other social media accounts. Was I too strong-handed in defending myself and is everything I said all really so negative?",0.08
"AITA For Not Making It To My Boyfriend's Niece's First Birthday Party I (21, female) have been with my boyfriend (21, male) for just over a year. He is an amazing guy and very kind. He would never purposely hurt somebody (especially somebody he loves) nor would I. Since we’ve been together I've also gotten close with his family including his brother (Dave) and his wife (Faith). We all get along great and we love spending time with them when we can. 

Dave and Faith also have a daughter who is turning one in mid September. However, they decided to have the party the first weekend in August. I already knew that weekend was rough for me, which I told them, but promised I would do my best to make it.

That weekend there is a massive, three-day country concert just outside our hometown. It not only brings thousands of people in but also causes everyone to go FERAL. My family owns and operates a local business that DEPENDS on us during busy weekends. I tried to request the day off of work but my only option was the morning shift (6 AM-3PM) so I could get off at a decent time. The party started at 1 PM but even though I was going to be late I would still make some of it.But, to make it worse, two weeks before the party they changed the location from their house (two minutes away) to Faith’s parent's house (two hours away). The earliest we would get there would be 5 PM, after it ended.

I insisted that my boyfriend go without me so at least one of us would make it. I begged him multiple times but he refused and even volunteered to work a shift at his job until 3 PM as well. Immediately after work we left, thinking we could still make it. However, twenty minutes into our drive my boyfriend called to ask his dad, who was at the party. His dad said that the majority of people had already left or were leaving soon including himself. This is when we agreed that we would not make it and to turn around.

We both felt horrible about missing the party but we knew we could make it up to them by spending time with them on her actual birthday. But, since the party (a week ago) they have blocked me on everything and won't answer my boyfriend's texts or calls. Realizing how mad they were we asked to go out to dinner but they only replied via text ""we aren't available"" and nothing else. We know that they are not very forgiving people (they haven't spoken to their mom and stepdad in six months because of a disagreement over a carseat) but cutting us out of their lives isn't going to make things better and not giving us a chance to explain ourselves seems immature and petty. I understand why they're mad but I still think we should be given a chance to redeem ourselves. After all, if it was a different weekend we would have made it; if it was at a later time we would have made it; or if they would have kept the original location we would have made it. I obviously feel horrible and I'm sure if the roles were reversed I would be mad too but was the situation really dire enough that you're willing to lose your brother and friends? So AITA?",0.05
"WIBTA if I didn't tell my siblings about our grandmother's unclaimed property? So as the title suggests, I was on unclaimed property, and I was putting in different family names.

The trouble is I need her SSN and a copy of her Death certificate but I don't have either.

"AITA My girlfriend is often mean when upset with me. I vent to friends when this happens, and now they think i should break up with her. I told her this during a fight, and now she doesn’t want to be around my friends. AITAH for sharing this and being annoyed that she avoids my friends now? My girlfriend gets pissed at me quite often and berates me/doesn’t talk to me/rages at me when she’s very upset.

I do not react to this well, i get extremely upset when she treats me like this. (I know that I am not providing any context about the things I do to be a shitty boyfriend or her valid reasons for being pissed at me.)

Often during times that she is upset with me like this, I will call friends and tell them about how I am feeling and provide a significant amount of context  (i believe from both sides)

Many of my friends and family have told me that I should break up with her due to this being a toxic relationship. One time during a dispute I told her that my friends and family think this. 

She now feels uncomfortable with the prospect of hanging out with any of my friends. I am bummed, because I want her to meet my friends and I think they would be more likely to like her if they met her outside of the context that they know about her

"AITA for not Comforting My Cousin? I need a reality check because my coworkers are on my side and my mom is adamant I'm in the wrong.  

I am prefacing this by saying my cat is okay.  She was assessed, given fluids, and it doesn't seem like there will be lasting effects for which I am so grateful. 

I go on vacation every year.  During this time I pay my cousin, to check in on my cat.  Cousin lives within very close walking distance.  

I left earlier than my household this year as they had an event, came back, and then joined me.  Before I left I confirmed that my cat was in my room, set out multiple bowls of food and water and completely changed her litter box.  

I left on Saturday around 11am and returned around 5pm on Tuesday.  I asked Cousin to check in on my cat and give her fresh water.  Normally Cousin sends pictures or videos as my cat is quite friendly.  This time I didn't get any communication until Tuesday morning saying she hadn't seen my cat but there was evidence she was about.  I thought it off but gave my cousin the benefit of the doubt.  

Got home to find food bowls full and no evidence of my cat having used her box.  I started panicking and searching the house because she's 15.  I finally found her shut in the living room.  As best as I can figure, she was accidentally shut in when my household left around 5pm on Saturday.  I ensured my cat got the care she needed before updating anyone.  Her health and well being was/is my top priority.  I can understand how she got accidentally shut in the living room as she normally doesn't go in there.

What I am not understanding of is why Cousin, who has been watching my cat for years, didn't report the oddness of not seeing her until the day I was coming home.  Given that there wasn't evidence ""my cat was about"" I'm inclined to believe she never came by and lied about it.  I am extremely angry and stuck to curt but not rude texts with Cousin.  She called my mom crying that I'm mad at her and my mom called to chew me out about not reassuring my cousin and absolving her of guilt.  

When I showed up to work on Wednesday I was a mess and couldn't stop crying, mostly because I hadn't slept to keep checking on my cat.  I work in the pet care industry so my coworkers were also upset by this and my boss took pity on me and sent me home.  I am angry that my cousin didn't properly check on my cat, which would have spared her days of going without food and water.  I am also angry with my mother for insisting I'm in the wrong and that my cousin is the real victim in all this.  

As much as I am relieved that my cat is going to be okay, I am very angry she suffered at all.  But my head feels twisted with my mom insisting I'm in the wrong.  I'm hoping for neutral, third party viewpoints on whether I'm justified or it was just a series of accidents.  Am I'm being unreasonable because I, and my coworkers, have a professional level of care as the expectation?

"AITA for Staying with my Mother? I (14m) have just recently had an 8th Grade Promotion and my school does a tradition for 8th Grade Families, 7th & 6th Grade Students, and teachers will all line up on the walls and clap for the 8th Graders as they walk out the middle school. By the end of it, my mom (36f) took me home because it was Friday and that was the day I went home with her. when we got home about an hour later we left to get my stuff from my dad's (43m). He had texted me ""Did you forget you have a father!?!?"" and when I got there I got the stuff that I had packed and I went to find him and when I did he scolded me and called me a lot of nasty shit and said I only loved my mother. 

I left and I told my mom what had happened and she was shocked but said for the sake of peace let's not say anything. 30 minutes later he texted my mom and me in our group chat and he called her and me a lot of really nasty shit. for example, he called my mother a ""Trailer Park Whore"" he called me a piece of shit and he tried to act tough and said don't fuck with me and stuff like that. By the end of it, he told me ""You don't deserve me never talk or call me Again"" and so I did.

 only 4 days later he texted me but this time I snapped back, he was mad because he had plans after my promotion to do stuff with me without telling my mom or me, and while we were sitting down DURING the promotion he got up wanting to get a picture with me but I signaled to stay seated cause everyone would have noticed him get up to do so. Anyway, he tried to pick me up but I refused. He was yelling outside my apartment for me to come out, my mom called the police but they couldn't do anything, eventually, he left after I yelled at him, he had told me though sounding desperate that he'd drop everything and we could talk about it without my mom, I think you know what I did.

Suddenly after that my phone stopped working and my streaming services stopped working, he had canceled all of them. My mom ended up getting me a new phone and paid for my streaming services thankfully. about a week ago he emailed me saying ""Kenel (for the sake of the story this is my name) remember me and stand your ground to your mom and come home"" and my response was ""I will stand my ground and not return to a racist like you"" and I blocked his Gmail. I did tell him though we can see each other if you establish a meeting place with me, you, & MOM. 

the next day my mom got a text and we told him we would be bringing my stepdad (38m) but he said No only the 3 of us. So we called him and as soon as he picked up my starting statement was ""HEY FUCKER NICKS GONNA BE THERE WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT"" My mom and stepdad didn't like that but they understood my anger, after that, it all went to shit and my dad was being a dick to my stepdad and my stepdad was mad too. after that, nothing happened.

My family takes issue with her living situation. They know about us but I have not formally introduced them to my family due to the uniqueness of the situation. Her estranged husband also knows about our relationship. 

Last night, while texting my girlfriend, she was telling me a story about her estranged husbands brother. In it, she referred to him as her brother in-law. 

Legally I recognize that this is still the case as they have not begun the divorce process, but I told her it bothered me that she calls him that. I asked that she refrain from using the term ""in-law"", as it maintains the association she has with her marriage to her estranged husband. 

She got very upset, saying it unreasonable for me to be upset about it. That the brother is still her kids' uncle and that she's not going to disassociate from him. The argument was escalating to swearing and so we decided to cut the conversation there and sleep on it.

Later on, Maria (lil sister) texted me saying we should do something, and go out to celebrate, i declined and expressed myself but she pushed on and said to go to the mall.

"AITA? I think parenting style is not ok. I’m (41) a mum to 2 children (5 and 3) married to H/their dad (46) for 15 years, together for 20.

H constantly raises his voice to the kids. I came from a household where people only raises their voice when someone is in trouble. H came from a household where no one was listening unless someone was talking at a level I’d say is shouting.

H treats every single ‘issue’ as an escalation…shouting, threatening to take something away, always a consequence. Also, it’s like his ears don’t work unless kids are talking in loud volume (no hearing issues). He is often play-play-play and everyone’s giggling and laughing and he’ll flick the switch into “be quiet” “stop doing xyz” (often pre-bed) and of course shouting.

Me on the other hand will resolve an issue by  asking child to tell me what they did wrong, what was the right thing to do, what they might do differently and apologies to the aggrieved. His job is physically demanding, mine mentally. I find myself always making excuses for him but then I don’t exactly find parenting kids easy this way. But I am trying to build good humans, with emotional regulation.

I find myself on edge, feeling like I have 3 kids. Even when I ask him to let me resolve an issue with them, he’s jumping in over the top of me (to shout) which I feel undermines my ‘authority’ and effectiveness. Just bathed and showered the kids, we come down all peaceful and he yells at them for shouting in the bath (id say they were kids having fun…I didn’t yell once…just talking / guiding them at  worst).

I see it rubbing off on the kids - loud voices, not listening unless being shouted at, violence toward each other (sibling stuff) but just a general ‘angry’ vibe a lot of the time. When I have them 1:1 they are just not like that.

I’ve shared amazing podcasts and articles from child psychologists I’ve learnt from, I’ve threatened divorce. No change, ever. If divorce actually does happen, I’m aware the children will have a whole nother set of challenges. I too will have a whole nother set of stresses. I no longer want to even have a conversation with him (about anything) because I find his communication style disgusting.

"AITA: Multiple people commented on my drinking, so I stopped, and now they are annoyed at me? A few people in my (32M) life have made the odd comment, here-and-there, sometimes in jest, that I drink a lot. I usually laugh it off, taking it as a joke or whatever. Then, two weeks ago, my spouse said to me, quite directly, after I got home from a boozy Saturday afternoon picnic in the park with a friend where we had mimosas and snacks, reading and writing poetry, that ""You seem to be drinking a lot lately.""

So, this coming from my spouse made it click in my head, and since then, I haven't touched a single drop of alcohol. Okay, it's only been two weeks, but it isn't hard, or a struggle. I'm not ""trying"" to not drink alcohol: I simply stopped. But now, since then, those same people are acting annoyed at me for NOT drinking when we're hanging out together. ""Why aren't you drinking?"" ""But we're all having some wine"" ""What's the problem?"" etc. And my spouse especially is acting like I'm in some way insulting them or spiting them for saying something.

When we spoke about it this morning, they said asked me ""How long are you going to keep this up?"" and I replied ""Until you apologise"" which made them angry and they started speaking in a really agitated tone and raised voice. ""I'm not going to apologise for my opinion."" they said, which I agree with. I'm not avoiding drinking to spite them: I am avoiding drinking until they realise that it isn't true that I have a drinking problem.

They are all acting like I'm being spiteful or something, which I don't think I am. In response to a concern that I drink a lot, I stopped drinking. If that concern disappears, then I will (be able to) start drinking again...

Isn't this reasonable? or AITA?

\*Edit: When my spouse asked how long I will be doing this for, and I replied ""Until you apologise""- Those are the words I used, but it wasn't really what I meant. What I meant was ""Until you no longer think I drink too much."" It just came out wrong. ",0.58
"AITA for telling my husband that his mother lied?  Ok, so background first. Me (30f) and my sister, lets call her Milla (33) are not close. We dont hate each other and always catch up on birthdays, weddings and similar family events but we are very different and are not friends. She stopped approving my choices a long time ago and I hers, but we help each other when in need and I know i can always count on her. 

My husband Tom (42m) never liked Milla, they clash occasionally because Milla is (by her own words) a feminist and my husband is more traditional. They had a big fight last year when my husbands sister (SIL in future) made a comment how my sister should be paying more attention on her husband instead on her appearance ( my sister is beautiful and does take a lot of pride in always looking well put together) to which my sister said ""Did that attitude was helpful when your husband f***ed waitress from *name of the bar* few months ago?"" All hell broke lose, my husband defended his sister, my sisters husband defended my sister, and they basically had a fist fight. 

Few days ago it was my sons birthday, so everyone was there including my MIL and FIL. I had a headache so I was upstairs while everyone was in backyard. At one point i hear my MIL and my husband fighting inside, and my husband storms in our room and says that MIL said to him that my and his sister again had a fight and that my sister called my SIL a whore, said that she is ugly and fat and then storm out. 

At this point, Im sick of everyone involved, but I know that Milla didn't said that, she believes that if an insult cant be used against a man too, than is misogynistic and she wouldn't say that. I said that to my husband and that is just not the type of language my sister uses. He said that his mother was there and heard everything and I said that than his mother lied. 
He called me an a-hole and said that I dont even like my sister and that I get along better with his mother anyway, so how can I call her a liar? I didn't budge and neither did he. 

He spoke with his mother and sister over the phone and now I am made to be this huge jerk. So am I?

"AITA for resenting my Pilot Husband for drinking, spending and partying while I’m home taking care of the household? I (42F) am a mother to a 4-year-old son and currently work up to 50 hours a week as a college teacher. My husband (41M) has been away in Thailand for a month doing pilot training for a major airline. While I fully support his career goals, the situation has started to take a toll on me.

During this time, my husband has been going out drinking most nights, saying he needs to let off steam after a hard day. I don’t really mind that he’s enjoying his experience, but he has gone over our agreed budget while he was away. When I tried to express how this might feel disrespectful and unfair, especially since I’m at home working full time, taking care of our son, and managing the household, he dismissed my concerns. He justified his spending by saying that his income benefits the family. While that’s true, my income is still close to 40% of our total income, so it’s not like I’m not contributing significantly too. We also owe over $500k on our home loan, so every dollar counts.

The final straw was when he asked if he could join the airline’s club membership to make his time away easier. I said no because I’ve been sticking to our agreed budget strictly. I take my lunches to work every day and can’t do any socialising as I simply just don’t have the time. I’d love to have something like that to make my life easier, but I don’t have that option right now.

What makes it even harder is that when he’s home, I still have to do all the school runs, extracurricular activities, groceries, etc., because his car license has been suspended for 3 months. I feel like I’m shouldering the majority of the responsibilities, and he doesn’t seem to see that.

What hurts the most is that when I tried to explain how unvalued and unheard I feel, he brushed it off, saying I’m just upset because he’s having fun and I’m not. He doesn’t seem to understand that I’m the one at home, keeping our family together and making personal sacrifices so that he can live his dream job.

AITA for feeling resentful and saying no to the club membership, even though it might make his life easier?

EDIT: His license was not suspended for drinking. He does not have a drinking problem and a couple of beers after training does not equate to being drunk. He is very present with our Son, and does help out at home when not flying, however the majority of the housework is complete when he arrives so there is no need for him to do much.",0.33
"AITA for telling my fiancé he needs to put more money into the house I (24F) have been with my partner (28M) for 2 years now and we have a 1 year old together. I am a stay at home mum but work 1-2 days a week with my fiancé and he works 6 days a week at a small family business that his mum owns. 
On top of his work he is also getting money from the government as he is also on disability, we got into an argument not about money but he brought money into it saying that I haven’t paid for any bills in months. With our bills we go half’s in them we pay rent, electricity and internet. Now I have never missed a payment when it comes to rent with everything else on the other hand I can admit I have but that is because he gets the bills for them and it doesn’t matter how many times I tell him to lmk when they come in he never does. 
On top of that he doesn’t pay for groceries or absolutely anything to do with our son I do it all myself and I also have bills on the side that I pay for like my phone bill ect. After he yelled at me saying I paid for nothing I then sat there an told him exactly what I pay for, he knows how little money I have and when I work that 1-2 days I’m only getting paid $150 a day but he is always flaunting about how much money he has in his account as he has been able to “save”. He has never paid for either myself or my son birthday or Christmas presents where gift giving is my love language, after this argument I have refused to do any grocery shopping (just what I need for my son) he has then since complained that there is no food in the house why haven’t I done shopping and I simply said to him “I’m done paying for everything I haven’t brought anything nice for myself is over a year so for now on I’m not doing shopping you can do it I’ll get what we need for our son and that’s it” and since then has been mad at me.

"AITA For asking my sister-in-law to tell her child not to open the closet's door? Long-time lurker, first-time poster. Not a native speaker, so forgive any errors, and I'm still literally shaking.

So, My brother and her pregnant wife and her child (12M) from another relationship came for lunch to my mother's house. I live with her. After lunch her child went to my brother's room to play games in the phone. While there, I heard the noise of the closet door and I went to ask him to stop doing that. Then, I told my SIL the same, to please ask him not to do it.

I guess it was wrong, because first she said it wasn't on purpose. I exclaimed that it can't be ""not on purpose"". But she started crying and saying that she wasn't coming again and that she wanted to leave. I told her that I didn't meant that. I just wanted him to stop gossiping around (it wasn't the first time, he has a habit of touching things around and gossiping what's in the bookshelf there, once even telling us we should trash some things).

Now they left without a word, mom is half crying and not talking to me and I feel like trash and shaking because I just wanted a kid to stop gossiping inside a closet that's not his. 

AITA?


Edit: just to clarify some things I read. I meant snooping, not gossiping, not a native speaker, sorry.
I was raised to understand that this behaviour is not to be tolerated, so I reacted under the assumption that he should be taught the same.

About the bookshelf incident, he wasn't looking at books, there are some papers and other things there too, and he took a lighter.

I don't think he steals, as someone said. But he is sometimes disrespectful/rude in his answers, even to his own mom.

I have clothes there too, in another closet that doesn't make the same sound (it was like a ""clic""), long dresses that can only be hang there without being folded, and one was for a family wedding last month and expensive. I don't want it damaged.

I don't know my brother's side. They left in a rush. Everything took like 3 minutes. He talked with my mother, but I don't know more.

Mom agrees he's ill-mannered, but wants to keep the peace, and that maybe I was a bit harsh.

I saw some assumptions about their marriage. I don't know, they seem fine, it's all I can say. They've been together five years, married for one, so I guess everything it's ok and my brother doesn't look miserable. Not that I know them very well, we were introduced four months before the wedding.

I offered mom to move out (it's a multigenerational home, yes), she doesn't want me to, but I might do anyway, I don't want to be the reason she can't spend time with my brother or the baby. I might struggle a bit (I have a small disability) but it may be the best option.",0.05
"AITA for telling my father he's no longer allowed to cook for my kids? My (30F) father (60s) shops like a doomsday prepper. Whenever he gets groceries, he buys enough to feed a family of 5. He's also the type to buy food he doesn't plan on eating anytime soon, ""just in case"" he craves it.

This has always been a problem. When I was younger, my sister and I spent more time at our mom's place, and weren't there often enough to eat much. Nowadays, he lives alone, so even less of what he buys is eaten. 

The result has always been the same: a lot of the food he buys ends up either spoiled or sitting in a freezer until the end of time. We've never eaten anything that's rotten or moldy, but my dad has always refused to listen when I tell him this is bad for his health.

My family went to his place for dinner about a week ago. I arrived earlier to help my father out, as he planned on making burgers. My husband would come later with our kids (5M and 2F).

I had offered to buy some burgers when we decided on them, but my father had said he had some at his place. I didn't think about what that could mean until I saw him pull a box of burgers and some cheese from the very bottom of the freezer. 

As both had clearly been there a while, I checked the expiration dates. The cheese expired in February (I know dairy products can last longer frozen, but still). The burgers expired in March 2021.

I asked my father if he actually planned on cooking that food. He said yes, as both were frozen and ""still fine"" to eat.

I told him I didn't care how edible he thought the food was, the meat was older than my daughter. We could think about something else to make or I could have my husband pick up some burgers on his way to my dad's place, but I didn't want my kids eating that.

My father got offended. He started going on about how the food was safe and how a dozen nutritionists (AKA some guys his girlfriend found on TikTok) had said so. He said he couldn't believe I didn't trust him.

He continued talking about how dramatic I was being for a while. I was very upset at the way he responded. Finally, I said: ""My kids aren't eating that, and I don't want you cooking for them again. Either (husband's name) buys the burgers or we're not staying for dinner.""

My husband ended up buying the burgers. We ate them peacefully and no one fought in front of the kids.

The next day, my father told me he was upset by what I'd said. He said he felt offended that I'd ""accuse him of putting his grandchildren in danger"" like that. I told him that wasn't my intention, I just didn't want to feed my kids 3 year old meat, and he refused to listen to me.

My dad's still insisting I'm being dramatic. My husband is completely on my side, but thinks forbidding my father from cooking for our children might have been a little too much.

"AITA for deadnaming my friend? So I (F,15) have a friend (16) whom ive known for about six years now. We recently got in touch again after having lost contact because I moved away. He is trans, ftm. I know that he is because he has introduced himself to as a boy to all of my friends I've introduced him to and refers to himself with masculine words and pronouns. He's even talked about the struggles of being trans in a family in which those kinds of things are viewed as something bad. However, he has not yet come out to me. And I don't know why. I have plenty other trans friends and I respect their pronouns and identities, so I would hope it's not that he thinks I'm transphobic. My other theory is that maybe since we've known each other for so long he thinks it would be awkward if he suddenly came out to me? I've thought about asking him about it myself, but I feel like it's not something I can force him to tell me. In the meantime I use feminine pronouns and his deadname for him, (I'm using his chosen pronouns here out of respect) until he tells me something, and while I try my best to use non-gendered words when referring to him, (we talk spanish, which has no gender neutral pronouns) I still feel bad for misgendering and deadnaming him. So AITA?

EDIT: I feel like I should mention this before having more people call me transphobic. Last year the friend in question was talking about about a mutual friend of ours, who is also trans, about how difficult it is to be trans in a household that doesn't respect trans people. I was with them at the moment, though not taking part in the conversation because I'm not trans and I didn't think I could say anything valuable at the time. When they were done talking, my friend told me that he'd tell me what that all was about some day, which I assumed meant he would tell me officially hes trans once he was ready to have that conversation. That's why I don't use masculine pronouns with him irl, I'm waiting for him to be ready to tell me because I feel like thats important to him. ",0.92

"AITA For Wanting Commission From My Dad I have another full time professional career, but have paid thousands of dollars (ongoing training & licenses) to also become a real estate agent on the side because my dad wants my mom (also got her license just for this) & I to sell houses he builds (he's had bad experiences with pretty much all his previous realtors). His house building business went under during the 2008 crash so he's been doing other jobs for the past decade+, but wanted to get back into the building business because it's what he loves, and he's great at it, especially the designing part, he has a great way of building a house so that every part of it is functional and flows well, he truly makes a beautiful and cost-effective product. We've already built and sold 1 house (he found the lot for that one on his own), so he asked me to find more lots to build on. I believe I've currently paid more out towards my real estate license than I've earned in commission (split half with my broker then half of that half with my mom), so I was happy to run an MLS search (only available to dues paying real estate agents) and found multiple lots and offered to go out and look at them with him and the rest of my family, vocalizing that I want to earn some more commission. Instead, he goes out to the lots himself and negotiates to buy a few that are in a really good location. He didn't even tell me he was going to do this until an hour before meeting with the seller, at which point he called me asking me to do a county auditor search to find what information I could about previous transfers and values of the lots, which I did and sent him the information within the hour so he could have the information he needed for the negotiation. I asked how much commission I'll be getting on the lot sale, and he said he'll pay me for the sale of the house (which I'd split with my broker and mom), but not on the sale of the empty lot he's going to build on. I feel like if anyone else did this to me, I'd never want to speak with them again, much less do business with them and promote their product. My parents would mock my grandpa for being selfish and saying things like ""If you can't screw over family, who can you screw over?"" and say he's so immoral for how he treats family, and now I feel the same way about them. My dad acts like I'm just being greedy because he negotiated directly with the seller and I'll be selling the end product anyway, but I can't help feeling like I've been taken advantage of.

"AITA for giving my wedding dress to my future daughter-in-law instead of my stepdaughter? I 42F got married 24 years ago. I decided that if I had a daughter, I would pass the dress and accessories on to her. I chose a simple, elegant dress, rather than what was fashionable at the time, because I wanted something timeless that people could wear for generations to come. I had my son “Mark” now 22M a year after, and his father passed away when he was young. I raised Mark as a single mom for several years. I decided that when Mark married, I would give my dress and accessories to his wife.

When I was 33, I met “Rob” now 52M. I fell in love with him and we quickly married. He became a great father figure for Mark, and I was so excited to have a stepdaughter, “Molly” now 24F. My relationship with Molly had a rocky beginning. I’ve been patient and gentle with her. I’ve offered to take her shopping or get her nails done. I asked Rob about her favorite foods and made sure to cook those. She made it clear that she didn’t see me as her real mom.

Years passed, and I never changed the way I treated Molly. My door was always open for her, but she never changed the way she thought about me. She called me a trophy wife to my face. If I ever threw a charity event, she would remark “Wow, you’re so generous with dad’s money.” While she didn’t say anything explicitly, I could tell she looked down on me for not having a college degree.

A couple years ago, I made a final offering to Molly. I brought her into my closet and showed her the dress and accessories and told her I would love for her to wear them at her wedding. Some alterations would have to be done (I am 5’9 and a size 4, while Molly is 5’4 and a size 8), but we could make it work. Molly scoffed and said I had archaic values and that the dress was trashy, and walked out. That really hurt because she knew what that dress meant to me and she didn’t care. After that, I stopped making as much of an effort to build a relationship with her.

Two months ago, Mark proposed to his college sweetheart “Lucy,” with whom I have a great relationship. When Lucy mentioned dress shopping, I showed her my dress. Lucy tried it on and it fit like a glove. She fell in love with it, and I told her the dress, shoes, and accessories were hers. She was so happy she literally cried.

However, a couple days ago, Molly reached out to me out of the blue to ask if the dress was still available. I told her I had given it to Lucy. She asked if I could get it back from Lucy, since I offered it to her first, and I told her 1) she said she didn’t want it, 2) it fits Lucy perfectly, and 3) Lucy is the only one getting married within the foreseeable future.

Now Molly is saying I’m favoring Lucy over her because she’s conforming to traditional standards of femininity (getting married and being thin). That’s absolute baloney, but it got me thinking that if the roles were reversed and Lucy was the one asking for the dress after initially turning it down, would I give it to her? Is Molly right that I’m favoring Lucy? AITA?",0.33
"AITA for telling the truth about how the bride looks? I F(24) dabble in photography quite often as for a career I design clothing and model it to save costs. So when my brother Jake M(21) asked me to photograph his wedding, I of course agreed. My brothers wife, Chelsea(22) is a very kind woman, however her stylistic choices can sometimes be a bit wild. I do not judge at all because I know innovation is part of self expression.

  
Chelsea showed me her wedding makeup, and she had these vibrant green contacts on. They looked extremely reptilian on her due to it not matching her undertone. When she showed me the picture, I told her she looked lovely, but that the contacts weren't the best. She seemed a bit offended, and told me she just wanted to look ""exotic like you"". I offered to find her some more natural contacts but she wouldn't relent.

On her wedding day, as I took pictures, the contacts looked even worse, like a neon green light up sign. When Jake was free for a moment, I showed him a few pictures. He called Chelsea over, and she seemed to be happy with the pictures, while Jake seemed a bit iffy. Chelsea asked what I thought, and I told her she looked stunning, but I then asked if she'd like me to edit the contrast a bit in the pictures.

"AITA for causing an argument between my parents about my daughter's birthday party? Recently, due to some extraneous circumstances, my husband, daughter, and I have had to move in with my parents. My parents insist that they are happy to be able to help us out, and we're welcome to stay as long as we need.

In a couple of weeks my daughter is having a birthday, so I've been discussing party plans with my parents. My dad was insistent that he did not want a bunch of people at the house. He recommended hosting the party at a local park. But it's been about 100 degrees lately, so that's a no go. And there aren't really any indoor venues nearby that don't cost too much.

I asked my dad if he would be OK with us having the party at the house if we only invited grandparents and great- grandparents, and he was totally fine with that. My daughter is turning 2, so it's not like she'll know the difference.

I thought we were good to go, until my mom wanted to talk the other day while my dad was out. She insisted that if we didn't invite the whole extended family, all the aunts and uncles and cousins, that people would get their feelings hurt and it would cause drama. I told her that we would prefer a small party in the house to a large party outside, and my mom said that she would just go ahead and invite the whole family to the house because it's her house too. I said, ""OK, that's on you then."" And the conversation ended.

The other day i was driving our car and he was with me. He needed to get medicine for his anxiety and i had to get some groceries.

On the way to the pharmacy he was his usual self, telling me what to so by the second. By the time we reached the grocery shop, i had had enough. He wanted me to park a certain way and i told him the way im parking was not an issue. He insisted that he was right because it would let me turn the car out easily.

I was about done with this but wasnt ready to let him hit me so i looked him in the eye and yelled ""can i say sorry, or is that also not acceptable for a child to say to his parent?"" He got quiet and told me to get out of the car so he can park it how he wanted.

I obliged and he did what he wanted. We didnt speak to each other in the shop. On the way back he, as usual, had to tell me every move i had to make and i was quiet.

I told him that he is acting like his father, my grandfather, and that my dad himself never liked that part of grandpas personality.

"AITA for getting frustrated everytime my gf leaves for a certain amount of time during our call It happens so frequently since she always has lived alone. We could be speaking and in the middle of something. We’re long distance. We used to be short distance long ago. But there’s times where her roommate comes home and she’s like “gimme a sec babe, [inset name] is here.” And I could understand wanting to properly greet her for a bit. But it usually takes 10-15 mins. So she just leaves me on mute. I feel like it kills my vibe and I’m frustrated. It’s evident in my tone when she comes back and I don’t try to hide it. We could be in the middle of listening to music, playing a game, or what not and this happens. But it’s not just with the greeting. Her roommate is also one of her best friends and tells her everything. She’ll go into her whole day and sometimes it’s multiple times we get interrupted for a 10-15 mins during a call. I start losing my enthusiasm. I just wanna hurry up and wrap up. 

I mentioned this problem to her today, but she’s already knew I found this frustrated. I find that I constantly have to argue about my feelings on certain things with her. But that’s for another day. So I stopped being confrontational because in the time we dated, our arguments never go anywhere. If anything, they lead to more issues. 

That being said, she thinks I’m being unreasonable. She thinks that she wasn’t gone for that long. I even started to count, so I know how long it is. But she still think 10 minutes isn’t a long time and I need to be more patient. 

Her roommate has unlimited access to her. Definitely more access than me due to location. And everytime she’s around, things get dropped almost. Like I’ve gotten used to being on hold. But am I being unreasonable? If I am, I’ll deal with it and try to get over this. I suggested we just end the call if we were already having a long one but she thinks that’s dramatic. I feel like I’m left waiting so I rather just end it and she could call me back. But she doesn’t even want to do that.

He started talking all sorts of shit to me about how my girlfriend is a gold digger about her ring even though I’m the one who wants to upgrade it. Kevin is throwing out the insults like simp and women hating for no reason at all since he wasn’t even part of the conversation.

I told him “I guess it’s great that you live with the only woman who can ever love you and that’s your mom.” All the sudden some of my friends think that was a low blow to Kevin but it’s ok for him to trash women. I told everyone to piss off and left. I don’t think what I said is out of line and people like Kevin need to be called out. Everyone acts like I went too low while he called my girlfriend who works her ass off a gold digger. Am I living in the twilight zone or what is going on?",0.03
"AITA for not including my mother in my gender reveal  I need to know AITA in this situation or if I am the victim.
To start this off I am 21 and 21 weeks pregnant, we just found out we are having a baby girl at our gender reveal. I’ll give a bit of back story so it helps, my bio mum and mother in law don’t exactly like each other my partner and I are aware of this and we just ask they be civil if they have to see each other, which makes things pretty awkward. I don’t have the best relationship with my bio mum as is, which is hard but it’s how it is unfortunately. So the day before my gender reveal I was talking to my mum as she was unable to be here for the day due to being sick, while talking she asked why she’s never been invited to stay over with my partner and I, (we live with my in laws due to how expensive everything is) I stated she isn’t allowed over due to my mum and mother in law don’t get along and I never want to make my mother in law feel uncomfortable in her own home. This lead to my mum getting the cranky pants and hanging up on me. The day of the gender reveal just as everything is getting started and all guests are arriving I got a phone call from my grandfather (mums dad) yelling at me and saying how I need to sort all this out because it’s not fair on my mum that she can’t come over and see my baby when I have her, when I stated as my grandfather doesn’t live far I’ll take my baby there for her to see. This lead to me giving my phone to my dad for the day as I didn’t want the drama that I felt was coming. I made the call after the way my grandfather had spoken to me rudely and going off at not only me but my siblings that I wasn’t going to include my mum over FaceTime as I was hurt everything was happening on the day we were celebrating my baby and finding out the gender when it could have been handled a different day. I later sent my mum the video of the reveal so she could see that my baby was in fact a girl. Within half hour I had my stepdad call and abuse me for breaking my mother and that she is beside herself and it’s all my fault and that I should have my act together. This made me a balling mess as that day was meant to be a happy one and I just felt like it was ruined by part of my biological family. So what I am asking AITA for not including my mother over FaceTime for my gender reveal or would others have done the same?

"AITA for crashing into a biker who was on the wrong side of the street? I am an electric scooter rider, so this incident happens on the bike lane. The red arrow shows my path. I saw a green arrow of the traffic light turned on and so I sped up at 15mph to the other side of the rode to turn left. I was too focused on making the light and failed to see an old man riding the bike who was biking towards me in the opposite direction, and crashed into him. I couldn’t even press the break even if I wanted to because I was too close to him to press the break without me flying off the scooter. I flew off the scooter any way, onto gravels off to the side of the bike lane while the old man fell down on the bike lane.

I scraped my knees and hands with the impact with the gravel. I bled a lot, and after sitting down for a while I got up to see how the man is doing. I saw two cars stopped by to help the old man. Who kept yelling something, I didn’t pay attention. He seems fine, no bleeding, light scratches. 

I asked the man how he is and he didn’t reply. The people who helped the old man told me he is fine but gave me the vibe that it’s my fault, and the old man ignored me and didn’t apologize. I could have been more mindful with keeping my eyes on the surroundings more, but it didn’t change the fact that the man was on the wrong side of the road. There are bike lanes on both side of the road with plenty traffic lights to cross every 30 - 50 meters. 

I can’t even bring myself to apologize and just left. It felt unfair. 

But I still want others perspective on this incident. What else am I missing?",0.8
"AITA for flaking on a friend who’s been rude to me? Hi, I (19M) have been having a bit of trouble with my friend (19M). He’s been bugging me that I haven’t been hanging out with him one on one enough recently, and he’s right, I haven’t been doing so. We have hung out in group settings a decent amount of times this summer, and have had some good conversations, but practically every time I talk to him, he spends the first 20 minutes or so of interacting making fun of me. I play it off and don’t really engage but it has been really bothering me. The few times I’ve tried to bring it up, he says I’ve been a bad friend for not spending time with him one on one, and claims I don’t take accountability for my actions and am bad at communicating. I have a very low social battery and have been working a good amount this summer, so I like to spend most of the days I’m free alone. I’ve told him this and said that if we plan a week in advance, it would be easier to hang. He doesn’t respect that I have a low social battery and makes fun of me for it. He also doesn’t ever try and make plans at the beginning of the week. I know he has been having some mental health problems recently, and I feel really bad, but it’s just extremely difficult for me to talk to him when we do hang out, and I don’t really want to spend time with him if he’s going to make fun of me. Additionally, I’ve made it known that I am not comfortable hanging out with him when all he does is use drugs, and would prefer to hangout with him when he’s sober, and he agreed to do so. However, every single time we hang out and he agrees to not use drugs, he ends up doing them anyway. He says I’m bad at responding but whenever we come up with a day we’re both free, he doesn’t to reach out to me further and says I have to reach out to him to set it up. I also have made it known to him that I don’t like hanging out later in the day, but when we have come up with an exact time, he tells me a couple hours before he had a change of plans and can only hang in the evening. He was saying and doing all this stuff before I started spending less time with him, and as I reduced the amount of time we hung out together, the frequency of him making fun of me and getting upset at me has increased. He makes me feel guilty because he talks about all the mental issues he’s been dealing with, when we finally do have a real conversation, but I just really don’t want to hang out with him, and know he has a good support group and friends who do spend time with him.

"AITA for buying size XXXL clothes for my size 8 daughter? My (45F) daughter (16F) is quite slim and wears a size 8. However, she is insecure of her weight and thinks she’s larger than she actually is. She recently became a huge fan of Japanese fashion styles, but we can never find those types of clothing in western stores. So I decided to go online and order some clothes from Japanese websites.

However, all the websites I went on used a different sizing system, and my daughter’s measurements would actually be considered a size XXXL. When she first received them, she said she loved those clothes and was extremely thankful.

Unfortunately, found out the clothes were actually a size XXXL. My daughter was furious with me, saying that I was body shaming her even though she was normal weight. She claimed I was triggering her body dysmorphia and said I was trying to call her fat because she’s larger than a size 00. I feel bad, but the only clothes I could find in her correct size AND her preferred style were labelled as XXXL.

"AITA neighbor using our fence? Story: 
We were not home for a few hours. Our neighbors were having a birthday party. Our fence is on our property by 2 feet. Meaning we have 2 feet of grass on the outside perimeter of our fence. 
Our neighbors are constantly yelling at us about staying on our property.  Well today they decided to hang party decorations on our fence. 
So my question is. Am I the asshole for wanting to go tear it down because they didn't ask. Or even attempt to ask us to use our fence ? We have cameras and none of our cameras show them coming over to even attempt to ask. 


I did not ruin a little kids birthday but I really wanted to because they are very rude people and are constantly telling us to stay on our property. They are loud, disruptive and they bang on our fence many of times. They also allow they're special needs son to wander on our property and put his fingers in our fence.

"AITA for not helping my neighbor stain the fence? Back ground info: My wife and I built a house In a small neighborhood. Our neighbor on one side built a fence, so we did not pay for that section of fence, but we built the rest. This neighbor has made it very clear that this is THEIR fence. On more than one occasion brings up how they paid for it. Their dogs are outside ALL day and if we even open our door to let our dogs outside their dogs start barking and tearing at the fence (I go outside with my dogs everytime just to keep them from even attempting to go to that side)- their dogs do the same when I mow. This neighbor has said I need to not let my dogs antagonize their dogs so that their dogs will stop destroying their fence (never once do they say our fence it is always their fence). The neighbor contacts me one night talking about how they are staining and treating all of their fencing. I misread part of the text- I thought they asked to stain my gate so it would match, but the meant to say they want to stain and treat the fence facing my yard. When I said no to wanting my gate stained I got a long text back with the sentence “I can’t stain MY fence?” In it multiple times. I corrected myself and said they are more than welcome to ask for a day to have access treat/stain the fence. After all of this they have now asked for helping staining this side- and I said that they have made it very clear that it is their fence and if they want it stained then they can do it themselves.

"AITA for quitting 20 minutes before shift? So let's back up to 8 months ago when I first started. I am a great worker, never late, always asking for things to do when we're slow. I ask my manager every few weeks for feedback or constructive critism. Always get told she has no notes. The only frustrating thing at this point is last minute schedules. As in scheduled is released on Sunday for the very next day. Frequently I would get off work on Sunday and not know my shift for the next day. Eventually things settle and I am working the same shifts every week. In April I requested a day off for July. Requested it more than 90 days in advance. I never hear any thing back so I assume it's approved because she'd tell me if it wasn't right? We'll schedules are released Sundays, so I get my schedule and see I'm scheduled for the next Sunday, the day I requested off. I'm appalled. She's had 90 days to get it covered or tell me it's not approved but doesn't? How is that fair. I bring it up and she tells me it's my responsibility to get the shift covered or get a write up for not coming in. Fine. I try to get it covered but am unable to but I also can't skip my plans out side of work. So I skip work and get a write up. I go to check my schedule that night for the next day and the app isn't working so I just assume my schedule is the same as always because to me, a good manager would warn me if my schedules going to be different. Next day I get a call 2 hours before when I thought I had to be there asking me where the hell am I. I try to explain the app wasn't working the night before and she snaps at me that I'm selfish and clearly I'm not there because my schedule isn't what I want. And I am appalled. I have never been late for a shift and only called out the one time for a day I requested off months in advance. I go in and am getting nasty looks from my manager and my coworker all day. No one will talk to me either. I keep trying to ask questions about work related things and am being ignored. No one will even listen to my side of the story. So the next morning I'm laying in bed really not wanting to deal anymore and get an offer letter from a job I'd  interviewed at recently. And I emailed my now previous manager 20 minutes before I was supposed to start that I resigned effective immediately. Am I the asshole here? I feel like I wasn't treated very fairly in the end.

"AITA Left nephews bday party early My 7M nephew had a bday party at a kids water park hotel place. Place was packed with children and families. My original plan was in and out as quick as possible because I am not good with super loud environments and dozens of hectic kids at every corner. I showed up for 20 mins, give my gifts and say hello to everyone. Then I leave and say goodbye. Nephew himself was at the waterpark bit when I was leaving so I didn’t bother. Well he came back 10 mins later for cake cutting and started acting sad. He was told I left and sat in a chair looking down and sad. Maybe 2-3 minutes he was by himself pouting until my mom went over and explained why I had to leave (she made an excuse and justified it). Tbh I didn’t think I’d meant that much to him.

"AITA for not giving away my junior prom dress  I (18f) just graduated high school. 

My B F (20m) went to senior prom with me and is cool with me keeping that gown. 

His family is poor and has a lot of financial struggles, but I try to be as supportive as I can. 

I have another designer gown from junior prom (his sister 16f who will be a junior this year remembers it because she was there when we took prom photos) and always said how much she loved that dress. 

Anyway even though I obviously didn't plan to wear it again I wanted to keep it as a keepsake. He wants me to give his little sister the prom dress (for free), I told him they have gowns on sale start of school year and he says he wants her to ""experience a designer gown."" And it can't just be loaned she's significantly shorter than me and would require major alterations (even if we were similar size he does expect it to be a gift and not a loan), that's why he wants me to give it for free because just doing the alterations would stretch them thin financially but he wants it to be special for her. Plus alot of accidents can happen at prom and it can get ruined. 

I'm touched how much he looks out for her, but I really wanted to keep this. He says I'm being selfish and should give it to her because I ""won't wear it anyway it'll just sit in my closet"" and was insanely pushy about it now he won't speak to me.

Like the title says my girlfriend is a big fan of tattoos and I’m perfectly okay with that she has gotten plenty of ones I wasn’t a huge fan of but it’s her body.

She’s also talked about getting his signature tattooed on her and that bothers me equally as much considering I wouldn’t even be okay with her getting my name tattooed on her let alone a person she’s never met in person. She’s also consistently talked about how hot he is and is constantly watching thirst traps of him online. Which I understand everyone has a celebrity crush but going as far as to put his name and face on your body permanently is too far and is making me consider ending the relationship if she goes through with it.

At that point I was furious and shouted abuse down the down (well across the vehicle) about how out of order it was and how they were free loaders and if they didn’t put the money in the account they wouldn’t be getting into my work event, admittedly I was really angry and not particularly kind, but they did go out of their way to make sure I was wound up, yet when I got wound up seemed to think I was a *expletive* now my partner was off with me the whole way home after being fine with me, well Sleeping mostly,  (maybe just infront of clients in hindsight) anyway I drilled him  and he said it as bang out of order what I said ok the phone about them all… erm maybe don’t try you’re hardest to wind me up then slag me when I get wound up!?!

For context, my grandma has a terrible dental hygiene, he doesn’t wash his teeth, I mean, his dentures, because his hygiene was so bad his original got teeth got rotten and fell off, plus he’s always smoking and drinking, which makes things worse because his breath smells like hell.

She is pissed that i didnt put our daughter in front. 

I was under the impression she didn't want any kids since i asked her multiple times since it's important to me. We plan to marry after 3 years of relationship and I've always wanted kids, she on the other hand no. She says it ruins womens bodies, chances of death and kids are a hell to raise etc. i respect that. I love her enough to change my opinion on having kids.  It was a culmination of this argument plus the fact the daughter is imaginary , AND the fact that my mother is still an important factor in my life that i did this ranking.

Im sure i would when i have the daughter just like i wouldn't have ranked my girlfriend in front of my mother 3 years ago when we hadnt met and i had never been in a relationship.

"AITA for being frustrated by a monthly allowance  My husband’s a SAHD. I work a very full time job from home. Our child is 10, in school 5 days/week during the school year and camp 3 days/week during summer. We split lots of responsibilities like cooking, cleaning, driving to/from school. 

We agreed (our therapist suggested)on $500/month he could spend on cannabis bc when we didn’t have an allotment he’d sometimes spend $1200/month on it. He’s recently significantly cut back on using, but still puts $500 into his savings each month. Now he’s using it for things like music equipment, expensive hoodies, and has plans for other things he wants to buy. I don’t spend $$ on anything outside of essentials. I even cut my own hair, do my own nails, and live a very minimalistic lifestyle. I recently told him it bothers me that he has all this spending $$ and I have none, while clearly the workloads are not divided evenly, and our savings decreasing. We bought a house a few months ago and our mortgage is higher than any rent we’ve ever paid. I suggested maybe we stop the allotment and agree that anything over $100, or whatever amount we agree on, is discussed before purchasing. He’s bothered that him cutting back on cannabis is now “held against” him and he’s no longer allowed to have the $$ he had for cannabis. It’s not about him not having fun, it’s about our savings going down, me working my ass off and not spending anything on myself, and doing way more work for it. I definitely understand my timing for bringing this up wasn’t great. I told him it came from going through finances, seeing his purchases, our savings going down, and a trip we promised our daughter for her bday in Dec.

"AITA for putting my mom's wedding dress in storage after my brother's fiance tried to wear it? My (32F) mom (60F) is still alive. She has no opinion on the matter as she's in hospice dying from lung cancer but it rubs me the wrong way. My brother (41M) and his fiance (39F) just got engaged a month ago. I liked her so I was very happy for them initially. My brother's lovely bride even asked if I wanted to be a bridesmaid and took me dress shopping for the prettiest peach dress. (My brother and I both look great in peach). They elected to have 4 flower girls (my daughter and nieces). All good things. 

But this wouldn't be an AITA post if things stayed happy so here's what's going on. My future sister in law asked my little sister (29F) for my mother's wedding dress. And she ended up calling me to let me know what was going on. My parents weren't married until I was in the 1st grade and I still remember that dress. So it feels sacred to blood family. I asked my sister if she was going to give it to our big bros wife and she agreed with me that it was weird as hell. 

I had some things to store away that I didn't necessarily wanna get rid of as I'd need them for my yard and little sis just downsized homes and needed to declutter. We went half on a storage and hid the dress in there as well. We pretended the dress had been lost when lil sis moved. Now my brother's bride is in search of a new dress and she doesn't look like it but she's bigger than my mom by a couple of sizes and probably would have altered the dress and ruined it. 

Word got to my older sis (43F) that my little sis lost the dress. We three-way called and we let her know what we did. She feels like my brother and his new wife need to save money because they already have children and things are expensive nowadays. I told her getting Mom's dress altered would cost just as much and revealed my bros fiance's dress size. Older sis accused me of body shaming and not giving my brother's fiance a chance and told me she was family too. I was stating facts though. She'd have to change it to fit.

"AITA for making my mom cry after she called me a monster for 5 years? I, 16F, have not had an easy relationship with my mother. My father and I have had an okay relationship, but he always supports my mother, no matter what. Me and my mother very close until I turned 11 and I went to secondary school. In the beginning, we both had minor disagreements which we slept off, yet as the years progressed the relationship just worsened. And then all of a sudden, arguments started ending with my mother crying to my father and saying how horrible I was and that she didn't know how she raised such a monster, as I sobbed alone in my room.

However, around when I was 14 years old, all of a sudden something just clicked in me. I just stopped caring. If my mother would try to argue with me, I just shut her down immediately and went to my room to text my friends. if somehow she successfully annoyed me to the point where we were arguing, I would just say a few harsh words, purely to end the argument and then dismiss myself to my room. Me and my mother eventually stopped talking; apart from discussing how each of our days went and what was for dinner.

Recently though, I was on my period when all of a sudden, my mother started nagging me again on how I was addicted to my tablet, and how I was on the wrong path. Despite having heard this a thousand times, I just felt all of the rage that I had suppressed just unlock- and I swear to god I blew up on her. My mind was cloudy and I honestly didn't fully register the words I said to hear- but what I knew was they were very harsh. I told her it wasn't my fault that I turned out like this and that if she wanted me to be different she should go and adopt someone, but that probably wouldn't work out well as she already failed to raise a proper child according to her. I said that she was trying to make my life suck, and I felt sorry for her as she had such a horrible child. She promptly started to cry, and as I realised what I said I started to apologize but she just shoved me away and told me to get the hell out.

Now the reason I'm thinking I may be the A-hole is because I feel so so guilty right now. I sometimes hear my mom crying and I just feel like I should apologise, but whenever i think about doing that a flashback of what shes said to me comes back and I just decide not to. All of my friends are telling me not to apologise, but my father confronted me and told me that I was an A-hole for saying that because my mom was just trying to tell me what's best for me. 

Now I am just confused about what to do, as even though I think I wasn't at fault, I realise this could put our entire relationship into jeopardy and I don't want to lose my mom- but I also really don't want to lose this fight. So AITA?

"AITA for not allowing my adopted son to choose the movie on family movie night? I (45M) have four sons: three biological (17M, 15M, 12M) and one adopted (13M). We adopted Jake, our youngest, when he was 3 years old. He came from a really difficult background, and we’ve always tried to give him as much love and support as possible. But if I’m being honest, it hasn’t been easy.

Jake has always been more of a challenge compared to my other boys. He’s extremely sensitive and gets upset over the smallest things. Due to the trauma he experienced early on, Jake is mentally and emotionally more like an 8- or 9-year-old, even though he’s 13. This isn’t because of any special needs; it’s just the result of what he’s been through. When he was younger, he struggled a lot in school, to the point where he was eventually expelled from his primary school for behavioural issues. It was a really tough time for our family. We ended up enrolling him in a SEMH (Social, Emotional, and Mental Health) school, which costs around £70k per year. While the school has helped him somewhat, Jake still causes a lot of problems. The school often calls us because Jake’s had a meltdown or couldn’t handle something, and it’s clear he needs a lot more attention than our other kids.

At home, Jake’s neediness can be overwhelming. He’s constantly seeking reassurance and gets upset if things don’t go exactly his way. My wife has always been very patient with him, maybe too patient, in my opinion. She tends to cater to his needs a lot more than the other boys, and I can see it’s starting to wear on them. I can tell they’re starting to feel like Jake gets special treatment.

Earlier today, during our usual Saturday family movie night, this issue came to a head. We always vote on the movie to keep things fair. The older boys and I wanted to watch the first Avengers movie. When we voted, Jake was the only one who wanted to watch Spider-Verse instead. Jake loves Spider-Verse, and we’ve watched it several times before.

Seeing how upset Jake was getting, my wife suggested that we just watch Spider-Verse to avoid a meltdown. She felt it wasn’t worth the fight and wanted to keep the peace, especially considering how sensitive Jake is. But I felt like it wasn’t fair to the other boys who had won the vote fairly. I said no, we’re sticking to the movie that won the vote. Jake, predictably, got really upset, stormed off to his room, and refused to come back downstairs.

After the movie, my wife and I had a huge argument. She said I was being too ""harsh"" and that I don’t understand how difficult things are for Jake because of his past. She thinks I should have just let him have his way to avoid the conflict, but I’m tired of walking on eggshells and constantly giving in to Jake at the expense of the other boys.  I don’t think it’s right to let Jake dictate everything just because he’s more sensitive.

AITA for not letting my adopted son choose the movie on family movie night, even though it upset him and led to a huge argument with my wife? ",0.6

The song started and I realized I knew none of the lyrics and I felt embarrassed, sad, all of that.

"AITA for telling my friend it’s her fault she’s broke I (23F) have been best friends with my friend Samantha (23F) since high school. We both completed our undergrad and have degrees. while, I went on to complete my masters. She stayed home. For the last three years she's lived with her parents hasn't paid any bills, except her car and phone bill. She never used her undergrad degree in. She refuses to get a 9-to-5. She's been fired from two jobs in the last couple months and relies on YouTube (which she does not make any monetary gain from yet) and doing nails for income. However, she constantly complains to me that she has no money and can't do the things she wants because she can't afford. After she couldn't spend $300 fora girls trip. I told her she needs to get a job and that she's irresponsible and that's why she has no money.  Now she's mad at me and says she doesn't have any issues with money and I need to mind my business. 

I am pretty successful and I'm able to travel and buy all the things I want because I work really hard even while in school. My masters degree is for a good profession that will make me a decent amount of money. I don't wanna be stuck with friends who are unambitious when I am on this path. Am I the asshole for telling her she has no money and she needs to work harder ? I'm just trying to be a good friend because she hangs out with a lot of people who also don't have jobs which makes her think it's OK",0.54
"AITA for continuing to talk with his wife? Background.

We work at the same firm. She is 27, I am 50+. Over the past year we've become sort of work-partners, talking openly about basically anything. No lines are crossed.

She has had an online/texting affair with an older men earlier in her marriage. He found out by going through her phone, she ended it, and that was it. That was 5 years ago.

When she told me about it, I told her it would be best to avoid any confusion by telling her husband she and I are talking, as besides talking at work we also text.

She _did_ tell her husband and he expressed his doubts about the idea but basically tolerated it.

From my side, I have introduced myself to him on Facebook Messenger. Told him a bit about myself, my background (divorced, her kids no longer having contact with me). It wasn't buddy-buddy of course but he was polite.

Last weekend she called me, drunk. She had gone out with a girlfriend, they drank in a bar, got into an argument, and her friend left her there. She asked me to come pick her up. I did. Dropped her off at home.

Next day I woke up to a Facebook message from him accusing me of making his wife drink, getting her drunk, and to never approach her again or he will get the police involved. I know he would never try to forbid _her_ to talk to me but this he seems comfortable with.

She;s been quite nervous and we text less but still text, and at work we talk about the whole situation. 

Unless she would tell me to cut contact, I have no thoughts of stopping this. I feel it's her choice, not his. And I believe men and women can be friends. Also, 5 years after the fact I think it is time for him to move on and have some faith in her.

**TLDR** I talk and text with a younger, married woman at work. No lines crossed. A year in, he has told me to stop talking with me after I picked her up, at her request, and dropped her off drunk at her place. Unless she tells me to stop, I want to keep on having contact with her.",0.8
"AITA for telling my brother he is being a brat right now? I use to share a room with my brother because we live in a two bedroom apartment. We have our own separate beds, though. I'm 16, he's 17. 

I asked my mom if I can put pictures on the wall of all my celebrity crushes and she said yes. So I put up pictures while my brother was sleeping because I knew he wouldn't be happy.

He wakes up and is super mad. He tells my mom to tell me to take the pictures down and she says no. Thank god.

He has been throwing a tantrum and saying he refuses to sleep in our room anymore. He even got a blow up matresss and sleeps in the floor in the living room. 

The problem is I have problems sleeping alone and he knows it. I've been having trouble sleeping but he does not care. He is throwing a fit over the male celebrities. It's really annoying. 

I've asked him to move back in but he refuses. He says he'll sleep in the living room for the next year until he leaves for college. He's literally living in the living room, which is embarassing to my mom and embarassing to me when I bring in guests. I said he was being a brat and throwing a tauntrum over some hot men.

"AITA for not helping when a unannounced relative shows up at house?  In the past  of months my bro has just showed up at my house.  I moved closer about 2 yrs ago. At first I thought it sweet, because we haven't been close, then I realized it was usually because he needed help with something on his car, my husband was ok with helping him out. Now he feels like he can just show up on any weekend. He wants to be entertained, talks alot (& I mean ALOT) about subjects which only interest him. Never asks about me. Last night at 10:30 pm my husband got a text that he was coming down. 10:30 at night. Because he wants to talk about a trip he is taking with rest of brothers and my husband.  Now I was really really hoping that my husband could finish a project he's in the middle of this weekend but now with a visitor it isn't gonna happen.  Let alone having to clean up after him, cook him dinner ( & no he's not gonna take us out or help prepare anything) After being here for several hours he strolled inside and asked me how it was going. I told him, I had no idea he was coming. And as his SISTER he needs to give me some notice. He got all surprised and upset. Any plans we had for the day got shoved aside. I refused to cook and told hubby that if he okd this ""visit"" he could look after him. He was suppose to spend the night but left because I didn't want him sleeping in our daughter's room(away at school) but offered the spare bedroom with queen size bed. But he doesn't like that bed.

"AITA for giving my younger brother a broken nose? I (13F) recently moved house, it’s just my mom and younger brother (9M) whilst unpacking in my room he kept annoying me and threw scrunched up tape from moving boxes at me and they kept sticking to my hair .I kept telling him to stop but he wouldn’t and I slammed my door on him. He told mom but somehow I got in trouble. 

At dinner he was making music noises with his mouth full of water .spitting the water onto my plate. Mom told me to leave him alone because she said he’s growing and is probably stressed about moving. I took my food to my room which I do a lot of. Then he came in my room telling me he wanted to play but he threw a ball of tape at me and it landed on my plate on my spaghetti. I threw the plate at him and hit him in the face he started crying and mom shouted at me. His nose started to bleed lol I guess I’m stronger than I thought. 

She took him to the hospital and I stayed home unpacking my stuff. Apparently his nose broke.

"AITA for telling my boyfriend I don’t like his parents because they dicked me over? For background, my dad and my boyfriends dad were partners in a business with another friend.

My dad has a lot of issues, alcoholism, anger issues, etc. So I am not defending him here, I know he messed up. But essentially he tried to get the friend, who had cancer, to live his share of the company to just him.

From what I understand, he was hoping to get my bf's dad out of the company. The opposite ended up happening when my bf's dad found out. He ended up buying him out of the company completely, and it has since been really successful.

They aren't very close because of this. But luckily my bf's family doesn't hold it against me.

But our family has struggled a lot. Our dad giving up the business was a big mistake because it ended up making a lot of money. He has a hard time keeping a job and has not worked since. My mom hasn't worked either (she has always been a sahm), so money has been extremely tight, even though we use to be wealthy.

But yeah, my bf and I ended up having a conversation about this. He wanted me to spend the evening with his family and I declined.

He asked if I had an issue with his family, and I explained (for the first time) that I feel really resentful.

I didn't even know this until recently, I wasn't hiding it. I explained that I didn't like his parents. My dad was an alcoholic, he had mental health issues. Instead of helping their ""friend"" and future daughter-in-law they bought him out the business and ruined my life, as well. I had to get loans to go to school while my bf's parents paid for his.

My bf said my life wasn't ruined, that we would pay back my loans, and most people have to take out loans. But he said he didn't understand how I could defend my dad. He said ""Your dad tried to screw us over. My dad had to do what he had to do because he was going behind his back and trying to take over a business he didn't even run or put effort into."" 

I said both can be true. They both screwed each other and I'm the one paying the price. But I said it's hard to pretend to be cool with his parents when they stabbed my dad in the back like vultures. But yeah, he was offended that I would talk about his dad like that because he really loves his dad. So I come to reddit, AITA here? Or making valid points?",0.84
"AITA for not being ""patient"" with my partner during his grief? We've always had communication problems, just from different places and with different communication ideals. He tends to forget about issues easily, whereas I prefer to talk them out. He tends to escalate conflict to a point where he's saying mean things to me during discussions, that turn into arguments and lengthy problems. For this reason and others, we haven't been intimate in a while. (years)

When his dad passed a few years ago, things got worse for a while. We got through it and improved our communication in some ways, but in other ways now it seems worse - arguments often lead to insults from him, name-calling etc. I've been trying to make my boundaries around this kind of thing clear and consistent. His mom passed just a couple months ago. I was really close with her as well, and we have been grieving together. We were good for the first few weeks, however, after this time I found he had set up a camera in the bedroom to record me while I was changing. I found it and he swore it was the first time but I felt so hurt and violated.

Since then I've been struggling. I didn't want to leave him because of it, but I wanted him to feel remorse about it and work through it with me to get to the bottom of our communication and intimacy problems. I've been trying to be there for him through his grief, while trying to deal with this huge violation and the way I feel about him and our relationship right now. Meanwhile our communication has gotten even worse, and we have arguments often if not daily. Whenever I try to maintain my boundaries for speaking to me with respect or not calling me names, he says I'm not patient with his grief and I'm not understanding what he's going through.

I understand that people in grief can be distant and suffering and it must be horrible losing both his parents in a span of years. But I feel that I've been there for him for the most part, and it's really hard for me when I feel he betrayed me so recently. It hurts for him to throw it in my face every time we have a disagreement, that I am not being patient enough or understanding of his grief and suffering. So, am I the asshole?",0.09

Whether he can afford it or not, I don't like it either way.

"AITA for telling my MIL she can’t move into my kids’ bedroom?  My husband and I took in his kid sister (preteen) for the summer and agreed to take her to school in the area when it starts. The plan was for his mom to come down in a few months but she recently got laid off from her job. She has sent a grocery delivery and some beauty products for her child while we have her but there has been no monetary support being as we’re family so shouldn’t expect that. We’ve hinted at money being tight but his mom said she’s stretched thin monetarily also. 

We currently live with my mom and I am 8 months pregnant with our third child. We are all on the lease together but have been short on rent lately. Anyhow, I was apprehensive about taking this on becoming an issue considering we only have so much space, considering my mom’s feelings about this, and his mom/sister are really messy and have big personalities - but my husband wanted to help since she has no childcare options other than a lady who she did use but started getting weird feelings about her. My husband said it would also be good to have his mom around to help with the new baby but his mom has alluded to being too busy once she gets here to help out too much being as she will need to work a lot.

After a couple of issues that came up but have been resolved, a lot of runaround from his mom with her intention of when she is coming out to join us to handle her childcare responsibilities, and of course the final straw of simply being on different pages about sleeping arrangements and general expectations (for example- his mom needing to get a storage was an issue because she was expecting a place for all her stuff when our space is already limited)- my husband and I have hinted to her that it’s best she don’t move out here, that plans changed. She didn’t know when she could pick up his sister though due to money problems so we said it’s fine for her to stay as long as she needs just to pick her up before school needs to starts. 

His mom asked me to ask my mom about her housing her pets because she wanted to take us up on the offer to move in with us and I suggested she talk to my mom herself. I told her there are too many expectations with space and I have no problem helping out but I am busy and stressed with my kids, her kid, and my pregnancy. 

Apparently she talked to my mom who said she would move out and let his mom take over the lease as long as she paid money, or that she could rent out our kids’ bedroom. I told his mom as well as my mom that I’m not comfortable with them taking my kids’ bedroom being as we have a new baby on the way and that the ground rules are that they’d have to sleep on the couch/in the living room. His mom got angry with me saying she’s done so much for me and that she’d rather be in a homeless shelter than sleeping on my couch. There was drama about that and she told me I’m being unreasonable. Husband says he can see where both of us are coming from. AITA for telling MIL I don’t want her taking over my kids’ room? ",0.47
"AITA for calling my husband “douchey” over baby names My husband and I are expecting our second baby boy soon. My husband is the first boy of the first boy….you get the picture. His family passes down the dad's first or middle name to the first born son, which we did for our first along with using my dad's name for the middle name. Tears were shed figuring out our first’s name since my husband almost wasn't willing to include my dad's name who passed away several years ago. 

So today I broached the conversation of names with him for our next baby. I mentioned that I would ask least like my maiden name to be the middle name to which he responded that he didn't want us to be the ""crazy hyphenated family."" I immediately thought this response was stupid, especially considering 1) my maiden name is a common name for a boy and 2) we aren't hyphenating our last names, it would just be a middle name. 

I let him know that I didn’t like that response and was making my case for why it was lame of him (paraphrasing here). At one point, in an attempt to summarize what I was thinking I point out to him that he shot down my maiden name as a viable option because we would be the ""crazy hyphenated family"" and it came across as ""being kind of douchey"" to me. He immediately called me disrespectful for saying that and wanted to halt the conversation all together because he interprets that as me calling him a douche. This only annoyed me more because we have a pattern where anytime I am frustrated with him he has zero tolerance for it and it turns into a conversation all about how I don’t realize how I come across or I should have said it another way instead of addressing the issue I was bringing up in the first place. 

To be fair I do need to do better in how share what upsets me, and other times he really can't handle even the slightest sound of frustration in my voice without it being deemed ""disrespectful."" I digress, but he is now angry at me for later pointing out that both my dad (who would be close to 80 years old if he was still alive) and my brother both had their mom's maiden names as their middle name. So if my grandparents generation and my dads generation which are really the equivalent of his great-grandparents and grandparents generations could handle having their wives maiden names used as a middle name, and he can't... he's coming off as domineering or I can't even think of the right word to describe it (hence why I said douchey the first time we discussed it). I also said, “I didn't realize we were like that.” 

When I pointed that out, he told me that I was ""tearing him down"" and we couldn't continue the conversation like that. I now hate it when he does this because it feels like I'm not allowed to have any feelings he doesn't like around him or that I have to be absolutely perfect in how I share it for a conversation to ever occur about sensitive issues. I feel completely unheard too. ",0.25
"AITA for not paying the person who returned my cat My cat did not return home one day during heavy rain, I posted in a Facebook group the next morning asking if anyone had seen him. That night I got a message from a neighbor informing me he had taken my cat in and was taking good care of him, I didn't get the message until the next day because it had gone to spam. The guy seemed really nice and eventually we met outside and he returned my cat, about 10 minutes later he messaged me asking for $60 for the food, litter and box he had bought while he had my cat. I am broke and living alone and $60 is too much for that stuff and way so I kindly declined and explained why, he then got very upset and told me he should have neglected my cat and said I should not own a cat I can not afford. I will give him the benefit of the doubt and say my cat did vomit, pee and poop when the guy took him to get scanned for a chip. My cat does not do well im car rides.

"AITA for trying to initiate sex for multiple nights in a row with my boyfriend? I (23F) currently live with my boyfriend (32M). We have a lovely apartment in a great area and an adorable dog together. Life doesn’t seem like it could be any better than it is. However we have one (major to me) issue in our relationship. I have a MUCH higher sex drive at night than he does. 

If it were up to me we would have sex or some sort of intimate act before bed almost every night. But he is the type that wants to have sex in the middle of the day. Which I can understand, however I am insanely insecure about my body and would rather the lights be off for me to fully enjoy sex. Without the “fear” of how he might perceive my body. 

He has never once made a negative comment about my body in fact he says he loves it. I just don’t. Because of that I find it hard to enjoy sex if I’m thinking of my body. Therefore before bed sex/intimacy is my FAVORITE. Plus both of us prefer to sleep with very little clothing so how could I not go feral for him. 

I try to initiate sex by rubbing his back, sliding my hand down his torso, kissing his neck, sucking on his ear, rubbing up against him, and will even go as far as trying to go down on him, but whenever I try he seems annoyed that I’m trying. I am a very sexual woman, however it is hard for me to orgasm and often need the aid of a toy to pleasure me, which he has mentioned makes him feel less then. I’ve told him over and over again that me getting to the finish line is not my goal of sex. The reason I like sex is because of how close we feel together and how there’s no one else in the world I have that type of connection with. Not because of the orgasm (though they definitely are amazing). 

When we do have sex, it’s usually because he initiates, but sometimes the reason why I want to initiate to make him feel like I want him (and selfishly I want to). I just want to know if I’m trying too hard for a man who doesn’t want me or if I’m looking into it too much?

I, 39M, am married to my wife, 26F for 2 years. I do the majority of the housework even though I work and my wife doesn’t.

I really do love her, and I'm in the process of proposing now. She wants to get married, and I want that too.

I know she's the person I'm meant to be with. I really think we're soulmates and we were meant to find each other, and she says that all the time.

I know if we broke up I wouldn't date again. I don't say that because I'm pressuring her to be in a relationship, I just genuinely don't feel like it will happen, but she is of course fine to leave me anyway.

We only have one problem. When we met I didn't want kids because I was forced into looking after my sister. I love her more than anything, but I couldn't see myself doing that. My gf was unsure but leaning towards no.

But over the years, I've changed my mind. I love kids, I find them so silly and I realized it would be a privilege to have a kid of my own. I don't know what flipped, but I tried to picture my life without kids and it made me sad. It was just like I realized one day that the desire was there.

I had a conversation with my gf about it to see where she was at. This time she was certain she didn't want kids. She said she's gotten more sure of that idea over the years, she just feels like kids are too much effort and she doesn't feel mentally equipped to handle it. She said she just wants to have fun, and this isn't something she can compromise on, but she loves me more than anything.

I told her that I'd still propose and I'd give up on having kids. I should I'd have her and that's what would really matter. She asked if I was sure and I said yes and she was like ""ok thank god."" 

The issue is I texted my friends all of this later. I told them about the conversations and the outcome. I told them that I'd give up on kids, but I mentioned that I was scared, really scared, that I would regret it. I said I wish I could see the future and know that I won't. But it's scary, the unknown. My friends reassured me but were also concerned that we were divided on this topic.

"AITA for why my husband left  My husband left today and blamed me for why he left. He claims I am the reason he lost custody of his daughter (12 yrs old) yet he didn’t lose custody. He voluntarily agreed to let her move back in with her mom. He chose to let her move back with her mom due to the fact she claims shes so unhappy and miserable here in our house due to the rules we have and we control and monitor her internet. We limited her social media and what she could do. Mom lets her do whatever she wants and play and get on whatever sites she chooses. Mom has never set structure in her life and we have tried to provide structure for the daughter. The daughter absolutely hates it and blames me for the downfall of her mom and dad’s marriage and says I am too involved in her life.

Mom has manipulated and made the daughter just hate her dad and myself and our youngest daughter(6).

"AITA for lashing out at my friends after they went back on their word? Truncated for word limit.

I've been rooming with my friends for a few years. It knew they wanted to live on their own as they're engaged. But in this economy, I can't afford to live on my own. (I make 14/hr [post-tax] and live in a city.) I didn't want to live with them forever. But they were letting me stay with them until I could afford to live on my own. I have anxiety and was worried that they'd kick me out. (I felt like one was trying to push me out.) Every time I worried, they assured me they'd never do such a thing; and one was angry I was accusing them of being untrustworthy. 

Recently, they said they’d be moving to a different apartment and I wasn't allowed to join them. After they told me, I had a panic attack. I told them to leave me alone and that we would discuss things when I was more emotionally regulated. They didn’t listen at first but eventually they gave me some space. 

Later, I was looking at apartments and I asked them about driving. For context, I don't have a driver's license or a car because I can't afford one. I assumed they would take me grocery shopping since they changed our agreement (I admit this was bad). They said it was my responsibility to do so and that I should've gotten a drivers license already. I agree, but my timeline was rapidly changed. My plan was to get a drivers license when I could afford a car.

I lashed out at them saying that they were terrible friends who didn't care about me. They said that I should look into Borderline because their therapist diagnosed me with it. (We’ve never met.) They also said that me lashing out at them like this was a behavior pattern of mine and that my behavior was abusive.

Why won't I move back in with my parents? My father is emotionally, psychologically, verbally, and mentally abusive and this gave me CPTSD. 

They said I was abusive because I would threaten them to get them to get what I wanted. Ex: me telling them that I was thinking about moving back in with my abusive father.

They said that unless I apologized and changed my behavior/attitude immediately, they would end our friendship forever. And even then, it was no guarantee we could stay friends. Being alone is my worst fear and they know this. This sent me into an anxiety attack/depressive episode and I apologized about everything to not lose my friends. 

Details: We’ve been having problems for a while. With one, I stopped bringing up issues because they would say I was insulting/accusing them. They would blame my PTSD for my behavior and I’d end up apologizing (with my initial problem never being addressed.) With the other, they won't tell me any of their problems. I tried to get them to tell me many times. The only problem I knew about was them not being emotionally available to help me with my CPTSD (which is valid). So if I had an anxiety attack, I would cry under my cover and into my pillow so they wouldn't feel like they had to help me.

"AITA for refusing to take my 15months daughter to my dad? Hey,

So my family has issues with my marriage apparently because my sister hates my wife. This hatred caused too many issues to me, and I was not a dumb man to listen to my parents and divorce my wife cuz my sister hates her guts lol. One time, my sister couldn't control herself, and she threw the gifts my wife brought right into her face, saying she's worth more than a simple gift!!!! Ever since then, things have been tense between me and my family, cuz they'd always keep asking me to divorce my wife if I want our family to not be taken apart by this snake!!1! (we are a family of four, me and my sister, and my parents).

I never listened to them, and frankly my wife hasn't been in touch with them ever since the . Every attempt we made ended up being useless, as it would circle back to this almighty sister.

Anyways, my family is now out of the country cuz they went with my sister so she can study abroad! (shes a 32yo grown woman)

While theyre abroad, my wife gave birth to their very first grandchild... I made attempts at first by video calls to let them see their granddaughter, but every time I call I get the same things said (we will never be able to see her!! ur wife plan succeeded congrats!!) 

I ignored that, and now 15months after, my dad comes back home for work. Last night he texts me he's home, and he wants me to bring him my daughter to see her at 12pm. I told him it's unreasonable to 1) ask out of the blue, 2) i didn't even hear anything about you coming back when I was literally talking to you yesterday, 3) I can't drive 30+ mins in the middle of the heat (52c at the time) with my daughter. So instead I told him to come over, sends him the address and that hes more than welcome to see her. 

He says ok, but then few mins after he calls me back saying no i need her here in this hotel im in, we have fun kids activities, so i will come to ur address and you will bring her in the car so I can take her to the hotel. I respectfully tell him that's unreasonable, and it's better to come instead. He then flips off and says no fkn way im coming to ur house, u either bring her, or ill come to u at 2pm for lunch. Im like ok come for lunch sure??? 

Naive me didn't know what would happen, so me and my wife get lunch ready. He texts me then saying hes at X restaurant, and that I should come with my daughter there... I told him sorry, that can't happen. I can come alone and see you since I haven't seen you in a while. So I go alone, and he then starts a video call with my mom and sister saying I came alone and that im preventing him from seeing my daughter????

AITA here?? wtd could I have done differently? i even offered him i could bring her in the evening he said he's leaving the city at 5pm",0.05
"AITA for how I handled my brother’s girlfriend’s comments about my boyfriend? 

I (22F) recently introduced my boyfriend (23M) to my family for the first time. My brother (19M) and his girlfriend (21F) were there as well. For some context, my brother is 6'5"", his girlfriend is 6'2"", and my boyfriend is 5'9"".

When my brother first saw my boyfriend, he looked at me with a surprised expression and said, “I didn’t know you liked younger men.” I was taken aback and immediately corrected him, saying that my boyfriend is actually older than both of us. My brother looked a little embarrassed and apologized, saying he genuinely thought my boyfriend was 18 or something.

That could have been the end of it, but then his girlfriend decided to chime in, making things worse. She started by teasing my boyfriend about his height, saying things like, “Aw, it’s so cute how you’re shorter than me and [brother’s name],” and then escalated to calling him ""quite pitiful."" She even joked, “It’s like you’re a little kid standing next to him. How does that even work?”

My brother, seeing that things were getting uncomfortable, told her to shut up, but she just rolled her eyes and said, “Yes, sir,” in a sarcastic tone. After that, she didn’t even bother paying attention to us and spent the rest of the dinner clinging to my brother, barely engaging with anyone else.

The rest of the dinner was fine, but the damage had already been done. My boyfriend was polite throughout, but later, when we were alone, he admitted he felt humiliated and was upset that my brother’s girlfriend would be so rude.

After the dinner, my brother made her apologize, but it was clear she didn’t mean it and was only doing it because he made her.

I’m really mad at both my brother and his girlfriend. While my brother did apologize, the whole situation has left a bad taste in my mouth, and I haven’t spoken to either of them since. My brother insists I’m overreacting and that it was all just a joke.

"AITA for telling my spouse I wanted go home? My spouse and I were invited to a nephews bday pool party on a 101°F day. Their parties are the drunk, karaoke, LOUD all nighter type which I don’t mind cause I have fun just watching them act like dorks (I was not drinking). I had not been feeling well that whole week and part of the week before so I asked if we can go in separate cars just in case I started feeling sick I can go home and they can stay and spend time with their kids and grandkid, the answer was a flat out no. We got there, we ate and I was still feeling sick, the spouse was mad cause I stopped socializing due to my pain. I keep to myself when I don’t feel well cause I get snappy and I didn’t want to be disrespectful to them, plus I was paying attention to my body and the pain cause I had to report it to my oncologist, I was diagnosed with stage 3 lymphoma 5 months ago and completed the first round of treatment 1 1/2 months ago. The treatment will stay in my system for about 9 mo. to 1 yr. so I will have pain, nausea, vertigo, sleepiness, tired and lethargic surprise moments and on top of that a week ago they found another mass behind my sternum, might be thymoma so uuum yea yaaay for me 🙄🙄 OK back to my fun story 😏 9:15pm came around and asked to go home, can you guess what he said? Yuuup! NOOO!! Did I mention we got there at 5:55pm 🤔🤔 9:50pm went to the bathroom hoping to throw up well I didn’t 🙄 spouse was upset cause I was keeping to myself, he started ignoring me yaaay how fun 🤩 NOT 😶 10:05pm went back to the restroom, still no 🤮 I decided to stay inside where I was not 🫠 10:20pm drunk spouse, spouses kids, niece and part of the family came in saying we, me nd spouse, were leaving, I was surprised spouse was leaving that early, we usually leave between 1 -2:30AM!!😳😳. On the drive home stopped at a gas station cause I felt like🤮🤮🤮 NOTHING! Dang it!!! Spouse didn’t even ask if I was ok or if I needed anything, I was ignored the whole drive home, I cried and felt bad. We’re now home, spouse is in the living room and I’m in the room in pain. Am I the Ahole for wanting to leave early?

Just want to make things a little more clear:
I wasn’t asking for permission to take my car, I was making sure I didn’t end up spending money that would be needed for bills, rent, groceries since we are on a tight budget and my car is a gas guzzler.

Why did we go to the party? I needed to get out of the house, it’s not healthy being cooped up 24/7 plus it sucks big time.i needed to pac physically interact with other humans besides my husband and my dogs

Yes, my spouse can be a jerk at times just like I can be a big jerk too. No, my spouse is not physically, mentally or verbaly abusive. Maybe what I don’t consider abusive some of you do and I’m not realizing it. The question I’m being asked are making me question a lot of things and helping me on what to talk to him about.

My treatment was not chemo, it was an endovenous therapy that made me sick for 1-3 days sometimes a whole week and yes my spouse would go and stay with me the whole 6 hrs, we would watch movies on my lap top or he would watch them by himself while I slept.

I hope I’m not confusing you all, I’m honestly trying to figure things out.

"AITA for selling my car that was a gift from my mum? Recently I have been upset from the reactions of my family, especially my mum, when I had planned to sell my car and did so against my mum's wishes. 

For some context, I (20 F) and my partner (20 M) got together a year and a half ago and have since been living together with his family. My partner and I had grown into loving cars since I met him and it's something we can both bond over the same interest. 

We are currently strained financially but we are managing things to the best of our abilities. Sometimes I have to help out my partner more with money which leaves me with less to spend myself, and I'm not getting paid a lot. My family likes to make comments about my finances and situations I get myself into but I just take it usually. 

I wanted to sell my car that I have been fully paying for this whole year. The car was a gift from my mum and she gave it to me once I had gotten my license and she had upgraded to a nice 2020 car. My mum had that car for over 10 years, I know it's sentimental to her and more than just a car. However, I wanted to upgrade my car and in order to do that, I needed to sell my car to get the car I'm looking at getting. I wouldn't have been able to achieve this without selling the car for cash for a deposit. I also didn't think I would be able to afford to pay for two cars so I thought it was best to sell it. 

I had gone to tell my mum what my plans were and that I wanted to get a car that I really want, but my mum stormed off on me. Which she never does because I usually always play it safe and never done anything to be in my mum's bad books. We never fight, but this triggered her more than I've ever seen her. She then started harassing me over text about how ""I shouldn't have ever given you that car"", ""give me the keys I won't let you sell her"" and ""if you go through with this I'm disowning you"". 

She was saying that the car was still hers even though legally it was mine. She said how my partner is a bad influence and so is his family, which is not true because this was my idea alone. My partner doesn't egg on bad ideas, he only supports whatever I want to do, which isn't something my family does. I feel that my mum is hypocritical since she had gotten a loan for her new car. And then she says that my partner is bad for getting a loan on his? They are both the same price of cars they both have. I feel she thinks since she is older it's okay but since he's young, he can't do it too. 

Since I had sold my car, my family has been giving me shit and my sister said ""once you get the car back, you get the family back"" after some thoughtful messages she had sent me. She agrues that it was the family's car and that my mum paid for the car even though that was 10+ years ago. She also said I deserved to be disowned. At this point I don't think I will take back the car, but I also think that the treatment I got from my family is unfair. I just want some outside, non-biased opinions, AITA?",0.81
"AITA Am I being ungrateful?  (I’ve never written one of these before)
I just turned 15 and my sister turned 13 a week before, and she had gotten a $50 from my mum to go online shopping from anywhere and we’re going to Sydney in October for the SIX musical. For my birthday yesterday we went to a play which cost $35 dollars each person, when for her it is $65 or more (I cannot tell the exact price as my mum booked it) we went to an all you can eat buffet which cost about $170 for all five of us including my sister. 

When I asked my mum if I was getting money too she said that she just spent $370 dollars on me, however, I was only one person, the rest of the money was used for others too (I did not choose the buffet, my mum chose it because it would be easier because we only had 20 minutes to eat so we couldn’t wait for orders) my mum’s argument was “I spent a lot of money on you, you don’t need the money, you already have some” money I worked for. My argument was that my sisters play cost way more and that she also has to pay for accommodation and food there too she said that I was also going to that play and I was staying there but didn’t like it when I said that she went to the play and buffet too but my mum didn’t want to hear a bar of it.
I tried telling my friend about it and my siblings (4 of them) and my mum were calling me ungrateful because I wanted $50. Now I did get money from my dad and grandma $200 all together, and it may seem that I am ungrateful because I have that money to use but my sister had also gotten money off my grandma who isn’t even her grandma. 

My mum used the argument that I have money I could spend, it’s one of her like bank accounts because we haven’t gotten my own yet so I’m not in control of my money and when I want to use my money that I worked for, she says it’s useless and not to buy stuff because I wasting my money but also tells me it’s my money to do whatever I want then disregards when I want to use it on like clothes or something (stuff she complains I don’t buy) 

I need to know if I’m being ungrateful, it’s a minor convenience but until someone actually listens to me on this and tells me if I am or not then it’s going to be a random guilt feelings forever. (I have adhd {not saying that’s what adhd is but I’m just saying that’s what mine is like.🙀🙀) 

Edit- my mum has always favourited my sister over my other siblings (there are 6 of us combined) I’m not just adding this to make myself sound better. I’m adding because people have asked. (I also did not straight up ask for the money, my sister was boasting about it and I asked if I could get some too, because me and my sister have always gotten the same gifts and shared everything, even now we are sharing a room.)

"AITA for calling my parents by their first names after they didn’t punish my brother for a hurtful comment? I’m 17M, and I was adopted by my parents, Peter and Jayne, when I was 4 years old. They’ve always been open about my adoption, and I’ve never felt like they treated me any differently because of it. They have two other kids, my siblings, who are 12M and 9F. We’ve always been a close family, and I’ve always considered Peter and Jayne to be my real parents.

But last week, I had an argument with my 12 year old brother. I can’t even remember what started it, but in the middle of it, he suddenly said, “Mum and Dad aren’t even your real parents.” Hearing that from him hurt more than I can explain. I’ve always seen him as my little brother, and I never imagined he’d say something so cruel.

Afterward, I went to Peter and Jayne, expecting them to be as upset as I was. But instead of grounding him or making him apologise, they just said he didn’t mean it and probably didn’t realise how hurtful it was. They pretty much brushed it off, and that made me feel like my feelings weren’t important.

Since then, I’ve been calling them by their first names instead of “Mum” and “Dad.” I know it’s getting on their nerves because they’ve asked me to stop, but I’ve refused. I told them I’ll stop when they either punish my brother or at least make him apologise for what he said. If he’s going to say they aren’t my real parents, then why should I call them Mum and Dad?

Now they’re upset with me, saying I’m being petty and that I’m overreacting. My dad has even started calling me “Princess” because he says I’m acting like one. I know he’s trying to make me feel bad or embarrassed, but honestly, it just makes me feel worse. From where I stand, it feels like they didn’t take what my brother said seriously enough, and that’s why I’m doing this. I don’t want to feel like I’m making a big deal out of nothing, but at the same time, I can’t just let this go without some sort of consequence. What my brother said really hurt me, and I need them to understand that.

"WIBTA if I asked my coworker to pay for my brand new laptop they broke accidentally? I work in a very small camp store. I'm the only worker, but this store's attached to another dept, so I'm only a few steps away from other coworkers. They do a totally different job, and the only time they're in this store is for toilet breaks

I work 13+ hour shifts and am dealing bad health, hospitalized and out of work for a month. With that, management has said I can basically do ""whatever I want"" if nobody's in the store -- if everything's taken care of, they allow me to do schoolwork, game... if I'm able to work at any moment, it's fair game.

As such, I sometimes bring my personal laptop in. I usually use it for emails/light gaming, but rarely actual ""work"" work too

The ""desk"" I was given isn't really a desk, but a part of the countertop used by customers. It's not ideal. I only have it there while using it, never unattended

Long story short, one of my coworkers went to go through the ""gate"" half of the counter. This gate is unsupported and ~50lbs. The company is legally supposed to have a mechanical support on it, but it's never been installed despite it being brought up multiple times (even by a safety inspector)

Unfortunately, if you push the gate too hard like they did, it can do a full 180° turn, folding into the rest of the table space that we use for everything work related... and is also where I was sitting typing an email

Thankfully, the slab was heroically stopped by my brand new laptop ai bought last week. The chassis of the top half stopped it from landing on my hands on the keyboard, or I would've broken/seriously hurt my hands.

My laptop got absolutely obliterated. Coworker felt awful immediately. It was clearly a total accident. I was really choked up but I tried to reassure him that it was all good, and that I'd check if it was under warranty. I just wanted to figure it out with the least amount of cost to anyone. Shit happens!

Unfortunately, nada. The only maybe-option won't work since it'd take months, and I needed a laptop for my school program (next month) AND because I will need serious surgery in the very near future, so I wanted something I could use in the hospital.

The coworker later said if I can't find a way to get it covered, they can pay ""half of the cost of repair or replacement or whatever."" It is better than 0, but if the roles were switched I know I'd pay it in full

It cost $950 CAD after tax. I know it's not negligible. My coworker isn't hurting for cash, but I get nobody wants a random 1k bill

I'm also upset with my employer. I easily could've been seriously injured while just doing my job.

I want to reiterate that the area I was using wasn't ""dangerous."" There is no ok reason for the table to fall that way

---

WIBTA if just talk with them and lay it all out clearly + ask them to pay the full 950? Show them the receipt with the exact amount. And then say whatever they're willing to pay, I'll accept -- but that the difference is money I'm losing for something they know isn't my fault. I'd be open to partial payments",0.97

This time I expect it will be longer, and everyone will be drinking (besides my dad). My parents just got in town yesterday and what I witnessed from my father was pure misery, worse than before. I haven't visited them in about 7 months and I swear my dad has gotten worse. He was complaining about everything; the flight sucked, the elevators in the hotel took too long, the view from the hotel window looked better online, etc. He is just always miserable and negative, and trying to moderate that at a dinner for a few hours will actually destroy my mental I think. I am not sure if I'm being dramatic, my mom says I'm not his keeper and how he acts doesn't reflect me.

My sister is a very outgoing, sociable person and loves family events. She was still a teenager when our mother died of cancer and back then it made all of us step together to get through it.

"AITA for choosing expensive vacation w gf over cheaper one w friends despite considering breaking up? 
I, M21, recently started planning a vacation and found space at an amazing resort that I’ve been wanting to visit for a long time. I invited a few close friends (5) to join me because I thought it would be a fun group trip. However, when they saw the expenses, they said it was way out of their budget. They suggested going somewhere cheaper, but I’ve been wanting to visit this specific resort for months now and don’t really want to compromise.

"AITA regarding this Japan trip with my friend I'm F18 and my friend is F17, we have wanted to go to Japan sometime this December or January next year. However, our parents are concerned about our safety and wants someone else to come with us. We have then had some conversations between ourselves, likewise with our parents having conversations with each other. Some suggestions were like inviting my friend's little brother M15 and/or my cousin M18.

However, the problem arised recently when my friend mentioned her mum is coming. It also turned out that she has been begging her mum to come with us and that she didn't really want to go without her mum. My issue is, every single place we have been to, our parents were always with us. Additionally, if her mum comes, her brother would most likely be coming as well, which pretty much makes a family vacation for her and me being a plus one when this was proposed as a trip between us only. 

Her reasons for wanting her mum to come are:

* her dad does not want her to go if there isn't an adult with us and that I'm not adult enough **\[main reason\]**
* it takes the stress off of handling hotel keys, luggage transportation, random documentation that's required to enter the country
* she doesn't think she's responsible enough to navigate around a foreign country
* always better to have an adult around just in case an emergency happens
* her mum tagging along with us makes her feel safer (includes coming to e.g. Tokyo DisneyLand, etc)
* her mum is paying for the trip so she should just spend a little bit more and come with us
* she wants to share new experiences with them (including her little brother)

Since her mum was coming and potentially her brother, she suggested for me to invite my mum and cousin to make it fair, but my mum doesn't know if she even wants to go and it might be awkward for my cousin. I initially just said my cousin could just come with us, but she said she did not feel comfortable being with a stranger, which is fair, but I don't feel comfortable having an adult there either. Moreover, she could always befriend my cousin, I cannot possibly befriend her mum plus, that would be weird. 

I just don't think having her mum there would be fun and it's my first time going to Japan so I want to have  a good experience. However, her response was that her first time at Japan wasn't fun because of her aunt. Additionally, she said that it is going to be fun with or without her mum, and that having her mum there would be more fun. 

In response to that, I said her wanting her mum to come is just for her own benefits like why would her mum also take over my responsibilities. I understand she enjoys being in her family's presence, but she's with them 24/7. So, AITA for wanting to travel somewhere without parents for once and have the freedom to do whatever?

"AITA for letting the dog poop in the neighbor’s yard? We’re currently dog sitting for our in-laws (3 y/o Frenchie) and just moved into a new neighborhood. While my husband was working on the garage, I took the dog for a walk.

I’ve never owned a dog before and rarely took this dog on walks before this occasion. The dog will stop to smell the grass and pee every so often on the walk and I try to steer him away from other people’s property.

The dog stopped on the lawn of somebody down the street and decides to poop on the lawn. This is the first time the dog has ever pooped for me. Immediately, I notice a boy (around 10 y/o) watching. As I go to get the poo bag to clean up, the boy comes out of the house saying “can you please leave” to which I respond “I’m trying” as I’m picking up the dogs poop. 

Then the dad or grandpa is staring out the same window yelling at me saying “take your dog to your own house so he can shit on your lawn, not on my own”. I didn’t say anything back, but in my head I’m thinking “I can’t control where this dog shits”. 

I go back to our house and tell my husband what happened to see if I did anything wrong. He said that the neighbor is an asshole and I shouldn’t let it bother me. I still feel like there was something I did wrong for the neighbor to come at me like that the very first time I take the dog for a poop.

Context - My son (8M) is a quiet person, he doesn't like to make a show of things and likes to keep things to himself. This made it hard for him to make friends but i didn't want to force him to have any but when he was 6 he asked if he could join a small art group they were forming at his school, which i did, and he went on to make friends with 3 other kids who were exactly like him and since then and i keep in contact with all the parents to arrange gatherings or days out and they are the only friends he ever talked about or mentioned to me.

So, to throw my sons 8th birthday party i contacted the parents of my sons friends and checked if they could come. (They said yes)

I asked my son if he wanted anyone else to come and he said no, so i sent out the invites with my son to give to his friends at school and thought nothing of it, But when i went to pick up my son some lady who i have never seen before comes up to me, she asked me if it was my sons birthday and why her son wasn't invited. I was really confused at the time so i asked my kiddo if it was one of his friends to which he said no. I was then even more confused and asked why she wants a invite to which she says my son was promising her son a place and his party and that she had already made plans for the time the party was happening.

I then thought this must be some sort of joke and told her to make new plans and that her son will not be invited if he isn't a friend of my son. She started saying something but by then i really couldn't be asked, so i got in my car and left as i had more important things to do.

The next day when i went to drop my son off at a music lesson and i saw her there. She gave me dirty looks and when i walked past she called me a asshole.

So reddit, AITA?

  
EDIT 1:

I should add going through the comments that it was wrong to give a treatbag and invite in a school without offering everyone one, but i didnt think much of it because thats how i sent invites last time and no issues happened. However thank you for your insight everyone!",0.54
"AITA for refusing to give up my table in a coffee shop for a woman who supposedly was recovering from back surgery? On Saturday mornings I study at a café. It is always crowded (coffee shop noise helps me focus), so I show up at opening time (8am), order some food and a drink, and stay for 2-3 hours. The layout is mostly 2 person tables that can be pushed together, with some larger tables as well as counter seating. Even though I go on my own, I always sit at a 2 person table, as the counters are uncomfortable for me and they do not have much space. I also like sitting against the wall so that people walking by can’t see my computer screen.

Yesterday at \~9am, I was doing work at a table when a random woman sat across from me. This ticked me off because I don’t like my personal space being invaded, and I would have appreciated it if she had asked me before sitting down, but I ignored it. I was near the counter that day, so she might have just been waiting for her food. As I looked up, I noticed she was talking to another woman in the line to order (we’ll call the first woman Beatrice and the second woman Suzy). Suzy was saying how they might have to take their food to go because no tables were available. Beatrice didn’t address me directly, but she gestured to me, as if planning to take over my table. This ticked me off more because it was like I was an object that could be moved, but I knew when the time came I would ask them not to sit at my table.

Sure enough, Suzy got the order in and brought her number to my table. She then asked if I wouldn’t mind moving to the counters so that her friend could sit here, saying her friend had recently had back surgery and the counters would be too uncomfortable for her. I told her no–the counters are uncomfortable for me too, and there would not be enough space for all of my books and notebooks. She called me rude and inconsiderate and said I shouldn’t even be there because I wasn’t eating anything. I said I had bought breakfast and a drink, not that it was their business, and that they could take things to go. Eventually, one of the workers came over and asked if they were bothering me. I said they were, and Beatrice and Suzy were asked to leave.

When I got home, I recounted the story to my roommate. I thought she would be as horrified as I was by their behavior, but she was hesitant to take a side. She said their behavior was rude and entitled, but at the same time I was taking up a table at a notoriously busy cafe for a long time and I could have moved. Later, my sister likened it to not giving up a seat to a disabled person on public transit. This I don’t agree with because transportation is a NEED for a lot of people, and these people didn’t NEED to sit down at this café. Also, maybe this is asshole-y of me, but I think a lot of people say they have back issues or some other mild condition just to get things they want. Both my sister and my roommate said it was a “they had to BE there” kind of situation for them to decide, so I’m wondering if any of you can decide if I’m TA without having been there?",0.33
"AITA for refusing to go to the movies with my friends after her mom was too controlling? I (17F) asked my two other girl friends if we could go to the movies and dress up like some of the characters (this required face paint.) We made the plans, but the day before, one of my friends, (we'll call her Jessica) said her mom wouldn't allow us to wear face paint because ""the authorities need to know what we look like in case something bad happened,"" but she said we could still go. I've been over to her house and her mom treats me like a child, she won't let us do anything without her being there. I told them I decided not to go because she kinda ruined the fun. They then just bashed me calling me ""toxic"" and a ""bad friend"" but I just didn't want to go if we couldn't wear face paint. I've been wanting to do this since I was little, and since it was the last movie of the series, it was my last chance to do it. We got over it and are still close friends, but AITA?",0.82
"AITA for wanting my fiancé to ask about my feelings more? This morning my fiancé and I got into a little quarl. I'm just finishing up my Matleave, and he wants to go away for my birthday in October. He was getting annoyed because I wasn't interested in picking a place immediately so he could book. I go back to work in two weeks after being off a year and a half with my baby. I told him - no offence, but my mind isn't quite there so I have no interest of even thinking about it right now. I've been quite emotional leading upto my back to work day. I expressed that, and he's like, WELL WHY DONT YOU TELL ME THESE THINGS, I'm no mind reader!!!!!
This, is true. However, he never once seems to think about things like this. He always expects me to come to him with my feelings, and sometimes I just wish it could be him saying ""hey babe. I know you're going back to work soon, how are you feeling about that?"" That's just an example. Instead, his priorities lie on the news, politics, and stuff that basically consumes him that shouldn't. I just wish he'd have a little more thought on my feelings rather than me always needing to go to him. I've expressed to him if he came to me asking how I feel about certain things, it would show me he cares. Instead he's rather mute until something like this comes up. AITA or perhaps too sensitive for feelings this way?",0.97
"AITA for calling out my sister for spending her money on a luxury vacation instead of helping our brother with cancer? I, (17F), have a sister, (22F) who I'll call ""Lily"". Me and Lily have always had somewhat of a tense relationship.

We have a brother, (16M), who I'll call ""Mike"", who has been battling leukemia for the past year. Mike was diagnosed at 15, thankfully the hospital he's in is free of charge, however it has been emotionally distressing for him, my parents and me. He is currently in another country, because the hospital he's in is in our home country, since we cannot afford the hospitals in the country we currently live in. The hospital relies mainly on donations, and we often worry that the hospital will run out of money since it is located in an unsafe country. I have attempted to start a charity to ease their concerns, however it did not get far.

My older sister, Lily, recently acquired a good job and has been very finically n fortunate. I've asked her multiple times if she could help our parents with everyday bills, or help donate to my charity, and she always crafts an excuse. I understand she does not owe us anything, but she still asks our parents for money even tho she is self sufficient, and our parents never deny her anything. She's pretty much a gold digger.

She recently announced she is going on a trip to Europe and will be gone for 2 months, She's expressed how excited she is about staying in fancy hotels, and enjoying private tours. I'm honestly really happy for her. However, it hurts me a lot to see her not care about our brother, she doesn't even bother to call him and check up on him. I know it’s her money, and she’s worked hard for it, but I couldn’t shake the thought that she could be using some of that money to support our parents with things like groceries, transportation, or other daily expenses, or help with my charity.	

She visited us for the first time in months, (only to announce her Europe trip), I brought it up and asked Lily if she would consider making her trip a bit smaller to with our family’s needs, or help support the hospital. Lily reacted strongly, saying she’s worked hard and deserves to enjoy her money however she pleases. She told me that it’s not fair for me to guilt trip her, and she felt that her past gestures, like sending a thoughtful gift (which she's never done), should be enough.	

The conversation escalated, with me accusing her of being selfish and insensitive. Lily said I was being unreasonable and that I had no right to judge how she spends her money. The fight ended with Lily leaving and heading back early. My parents shamed me, stating that its none of my business how Lily spends her money, even tho they are clearly struggling and Mike is worried about the hospital. Now, they are saying that I should apologize to Lily for making her feel bad about her vacation. AITA for calling out my sister for spending her money on a luxury vacation instead of helping our brother with cancer?

"AITA for getting my neighbor in trouble? So I have this neighbor and her kid who has repeatedly stole from my garden and I have tole her to stop. Then she sent her 5 year old to do it. We got the ring outdoor camera’s with voice over and the kid continued to do it and I have told the neighbor “poor single mom line” and still take things like tomatoes and corn. 

One day the kid really damaged the corn and that’s when I got made and took all my videos to the police station. They was nice and I told them about the trespassing, then he said they are stealing also. Then we get to damage of crop and property. 

I told them how it’s been going on for months and months and they was like “I wish you come sooner” 

A few days later the mother gets arrested and comes crying that I need to stop the charges because she already has a “record” and it wasn’t that big of a deal and I need to get over myself. I told her what the police said and I said “I have you on audio and video recording right now and you need to leave my property”

I told my mom about it and she said that was the meanest thing I could have done with the woman and she might go to jail and her kid to the system where he will be trafficked. My mom acts like that’s all on my soul now. 

I don’t feel that guilty about it because I asked her and her kid for MONTHS to stop stealing from my garden and coming on my property and they didn’t stop. ",0.04
"AITA / who is more at fault?  My wife and I are on vacation a few states away from home, the night before we are supposed to head home she took my wallet and vape out of my dirty clothes pockets and set them on the counter( at home she doesn't do this and has made it very clear she doesn't check pockets and I have mad multiple wallets washed) I had my vape with me in bed that night but didn't see my wallet, we packed up in the morning and both did a quick look around before we left, we didn't realize until we were a state away when we pulled over for gas that the wallet was missing, I called and the hotel said they have my wallet but didn't say where they found it. It doesn't really matter who's at fault we just enjoy giving each other shit, I say it's her fault cause even if I forgot to see if I had my wallet when we left it would still be in the truck in the dirty clothes and not a state over and she says if my vape made it so should my wallet.

"AITA for defending my sister against our controlling father? My sister (F23) and I (M29) live together. Our father (M60), used to live here as well, but left years ago to live with his affair of years. At the time, our mother lived here as well, but has since passed. That affair was a huge blow on everyone and to this day, we still resent him for it. Truth be told, he always made sure to pay for everything in here(My mother was a sahm). He said that he knows what he did was bad and after our mother passed, promised to provide for both of us until we can afford to leave the house, which we are grateful.

About the affair, i remember clearly that he was with that same person as early as 2008. I remember him taking me to the mall and meeting a ""friend"" from work by ""chance"". There were other instances where he openly talked to her by my side. Moreover, he's been a cop for more than 30 years (we're not in USA), so his stress level has always been high. He loves shouting, demanding things and gets real angry whenever it doesn't go his way.

Now for what happened. My sister had her birthday yesterday. At first, she planned to go watch movies with some friends and return late at night. However, it rained a lot here in the city, so she decided to cancel it (this happened between the late night of friday and early morning of saturday). Saturday morning, our father called to wish my sister a happy birthday, and during the call, my sister apparently said that the outing was cancelled(she woke up with him calling and she has adhd, so thinking on her part was still slow).

Cut to an hour later, our father sent her a message saying that he was coming. My sister tried to tell him not to come, he started to get angry, and my sister decided to shut her mouth. She was thinking of calling her friends here to celebrate, and as they live far and was raining, they were supposed to sleep here, which would be difficult with our father present(when he comes he sleeps here). So, he came, brought a cake, candles and snacks, which no one ate. My sister said that she cried all day yesterday because she couldn't do what she wanted for birthday. This morning, he woke up already pissed and we had a argument. I defended my sister, said she had a rough week and wanted to celebrate her birthday with friends. My father said it's his right to celebrate his daughter's birthday and that he doesn't need to warn us that he's coming to his own house. During the discussion, he said that my sister never told him that she would call friends, and that he wouldn't have come if it were the case. I told him that he never gave her the chance to, and when she tried to tell him, he was already on his way. He began shouting, saying that we're ungrateful, can't read our minds, he's always in the wrong and we see him as the ""enemy"". He then took his things and left. So here i am, the cake is still whole in the fridge and my sister is yet to leave her bedroom. The gesture was sweet by his part, but in the end, put my sister in a awful situation. AITA?",0.18
"AITA For expecting my sister to pay for my door knob she messed up. So me and my sister got into a situation where she was holding onto my door so I couldn’t lock it. And now my door will only open if you pull it a specific way. And now I’m getting woke up by knocking because people think my door is locked when it isn’t. So I told her “ You messed up my door, you should pay for it. I’m not expecting payment right now, I know you have no cash right now, so you can pay me later “.

 Because she already owes me for watching my niece while she was at work all summer. And she agreed to pay me later. I was really looking forward to that money because I haven’t been able to work because of health issues. But now because I said that she should add whatever the doorknob cost to what she pays me, she says I’m the asshole and won’t be paying me anything, not even whatever she was gonna pay me for babysitting.

"AITA for wanting my husband to be okay with me wearing what makes me feel confident in myself/body? My husband(27m) thinks that I(27f) want to wear what he would consider ‘risqué’ outfits(fits with more skin showing or that other people would stare at me in) because I want the attention and validation from other people. I’ve explained to him that I don’t care about what others think bc I’m wearing it bc it makes me feel good and I think it looks cute on me. I also feel like him trying to dictate what I wear so he doesn’t feel uncomfortable for others looking at me sexually is apart of the problem with society sexualizing women and he just doesn’t see that. Says stuff like  ‘You feel like you’re going to feel better about yourself and like you can change society by going out in risqué outfits at the risk of your husband’s peace.’ I just feel like I’m not dressing how I want for other people, I’m doing it because I struggle with not feeling woman enough. I don’t have boobs, like at all. Every time I go get sized they tell me that I don’t even fit into at 32a. I’ve struggled with feeling like I look like a confused teenage boy all my life and one of the only times I don’t feel like that is when I dress up and wear more feminine outfits that show more skin. I did compromise with him by saying I would be willing to run outfits he might find ‘risqué’ by him first and only wear them on dates with him until he feels more confident in himself and our relationship. But I expressed that would like to be able to not feel controlled about my body forever. All he is worried/focused on is that I just want to wear the outfits so people will stare at me and I will feel better from that, not from what I’m explaining to him how I feel.

"AITA for shouting at my terminally ill brother? My older brother, Noel (M30) is in every single sense asides from biological my (M16) father. I love the bones off of him, we've always been close, closer than anyone else.

I've been living with Noely for the past ten years, he's the one who's provided everything for me, made sure i went to school even though I skived a lot and had horrible attendance lol, we've always been able to speak about anything.

Not too long ago, my noel started getting out of breath, being tired constantly ; just pale and anaemic. He brushed it off as just being from the stress but eventually his girlfriend, Lia (f30) made him go see a doctor and it turned out he was actually very ill and it was terminal. It's been rough since then, he's been losing his independence and hes like a shell of himself. He used to be funny, energetic, he riled people up and made everything seem fun. Noel had to quit his job as a roadie and now he sits all day at home and rots away.

It's awful to see my charismatic, loud brother turn into a pensioner, and recently I've tried to get him to participate in his hobbies, even invited his friends over and had them bring a ton of alcohol, play the guitar etc. He's totally given up on himself, he has maybe like 3 years left and he's choosing to spend it all rotting away, watching eastenders. Lia and I've tried to goad him to do something and he was just flat out being totally miserable and I lost it I guess. I just yelled at him that he's already acting like some corpse and that being a mardy arse won't prolong his life.

It's upset Noely, he looked quite hurt because of it and now he won't let me apologise, he's gone as far as calling me a ungrateful bold rossi, but Lia said that my outburst is understandable and that we need to be able to get to him in some way at least, however she did say I could've done it with more tact.",0.97
"AITA for constantly being annoyed and exhausted by my boyfriend  we are long distance. 
he has never dated anyone.
we do not want to separate.

i (F) and my boyfriend (M) (jonas) have been dating since october of 2023. we do not live together

this story starts in march. we have never really argued before 

i have an important trip and he's arguing with me constantly for no real reason and getting really mean and it's stressing me out (i have a severe anxiety disorder that he is aware of) he apologized to me while i was flying and when i landed i accepted his apology and when i got home a few days later. i called him and we worked it out and it's been fine since july

mid july i had another trip but it was personal and i needed to visit family for a few weeks. i was obviously upset and stressed due to the fact i was the only person there to support during a family emergency for weeks and he's jealous and just mad and constantly arguing with me again over dumb stuff because i'm overwhelmed 

i'm good at communicating when i am overwhelmed and stressed and i haven't gone nonverbal in 1 1/2 years and it happened 4 times. in one week. because of him. 

after almost 2 1/2 weeks i finally get home and i'm pissed because of the amount of energy and stressed that he was causing and he blamed it on his amount of jealousy because i was at the ""beach"" (the incident that happened was in a beach-adjacent town.)

he takes almost until august to apologize and i had been irritable with my family, friends and him & he would say outlandish shit and i'd make a comment and he'd get REALLY offended and get mean over text.

he apologized the day before my family vacation and it was very genuine. my next trip had no service

i had to walk up almost two miles as i was uncomfortable driving here and instead walked. jonas was ok with limited talking until august 8th, where he begs me to keep talking to him and i almost spend two hours doing so and he got really mean when i had to go and i was overwhelmed and couldn't sleep after that

i got home the next day and couldn't talk much as i was helping unload

he was okay with this and didn't seem too upset but he was just... reallt rude for the rest of last night??? way rude??? and very short and i had a kinda attitude after arguing with him and someone else throughout the day and we argued until 4am.

this morning he was arguing with me again and i got so overwhelmed with a continuous stream pitiful texts from him i went non verbal for 40 minutes and my sister had to help me (i do not need support usually)

i give him the excuse of not dating anyone before and my past relationships with distructive people.

stuff has been worse than this but km scared of it happening again and i'm always so exhausted talking to him because it takes so much of my energy to talk to him and i wish it was easier. he isn't boring but my friends have called him immature and intense

this story was way shortened for the text limit (og. 8000+) and if further clarification is needed i will provide it. thank you",0.37
"WIBTA for moving into a bigger room in my apartment?  I (19f) am about to start my second year of university. Last year, I lived with both of my parents and commuted in, which whislt difficult, has allowed me to save some money to rent a place for the next year with two of my friends. In the apartment we've rented, due to me being extremely sick at the time, I wasn't able to view it before we moved in like my friends did. They assured me that all rooms were of a liveable size etc.

 All three bedrooms in the flat are of different sizes with the smallest (my room) only being able to fit a bed and that's about it. The room is literally so small that in order to put a fitted sheet on the mattress I had to move the mattress out the bedroom so that I could turn it on its side properly. The room also has a couple cupboards on the walls for storage space, however they are very high up and because of my height (I'm super short), I am unable to reach and use them. Both my friends have rooms that are at least triple the size of mine with two chests of drawers etc each. So, they have kindly let me use the lounge, which has a small wardrobe, as storage space. However, this wardrobe is very small and for stuff like underwear, I've had to invest in another (tiny) set of drawers to fit them. But obviously since the original agreement was that the lounge isn't my room, I'd need to put the drawers in my bedroom but there's literally no space for them. Neither of my friends have moved in yet, but with me slowly having to store all my stuff in the lounge instead of my room, I'm starting to realize that life would be a lot easier if I just moved permanently into the lounge given my lack of private and storage space. 

I told one of my friends about doing this temporarily whilst I figure out how to lay everything out in an accessible way for me, which she was fine with, but I'm just worried about the future when inevitably nothing fits and I end up rammed into a tiny uncomfortable space. However, obviously if I were to move into the lounge permanently, this would mean the sofas etc would become part of my room and we'd end up losing our communal space, which I know they love about the flat. At the moment I pay £20 (about $35) less rent per month than my friends, but if I were to get the lounge, which is a much bigger space and more equal to their room sizes I'd be prepared to pay more. I feel like I'm being an AH because we have already paid the first month's rent and I don't want to sacrifice on their space, but also my room just feels too small? idk",0.07
"AITA for using the common area more than my roommate? My roommate and I have been sharing a 2b/2b since March. We were friends for a while before this.

90% of the things in the common/living room area are mine. I brought the rug, coffee table, tv stand, lamp, blankets, bar stools, fan, couch, bookshelf, decorations and some other etc things. The only thing that is hers in that common area is the tv. 

I tend to fall asleep on the couch a lot. I have fibromyalgia and warned her about this and told her never to work around me and try to be quiet if I do, just go about business how you usually do. I sit on the couch much more than her and offer to trade places when she sits on the floor but doesn’t want to. I’ve asked multiple times if the living situation was okay because she didn’t seem very enticed to use the common area. She said everything is fine. 

I was on a work trip for 4 days, got home to everything on the kitchen counter and island being rearranged which I didn’t care too much about but was a little confused. I moved two things back because one of them was my charger I use daily and second was my Lego flowers that she put on top of the stove. 

She sends me a text message upset (even though she saw me the day before and same day she sent the text and didn't say anything in person) about other things out of my control but was more saying that the common area doesn’t feel like hers. That I’m always doing something out there or using the couch and that she has to walk on eggshells around me, when I’ve specifically told her not to. She also said that when she puts things out there I criticize them (which isn’t the truth) or tell her not to do it. I’d be happy for her to contribute to the living area but she hasn’t. I also have to put a desk out in our living area for work because I gave her the larger room and she can fit a desk in hers. I can’t in mine. I asked her if that was okay, she said yes then yesterday changed her mind that it’s not okay and she’s telling me she wants me to rearrange my room so that it’ll fit but there is no possible way to do that. 

Her cat also comes in my room constantly. He tries to eat my cat’s food and use her litter box and she doesn’t find that an issue or do any disciplinary actions. I came home from my work trip (I’ve been working on remembering to shut my door while I’m home or gone with my cat and forgot this time) to a ton of things scattered around my room and knocked over. A week before that while I was at work, her cat knocked over two very expensive books I own and luckily they landed on their front and didn’t bend or have damage but I know it wasn’t my cat that did that. I can’t have the door shut at work because my cat’s food, water and litter box are in my room.

"AITA for asking my fiancé to get back the PlayStation VR he gave to his nephew without asking me? I've been with my fiancé for over 6 years, and his family and I have never really gotten along. There’s a lot of drama, drug use, and toxicity in his family, and it's been hard for me to connect with them. I come from a different background, which I think has contributed to the tension.

A few years ago, my fiancé's sister, ""M,"" had her mother, ""G,"" living with her, along with M's kids and their father. The house was chaotic, and I didn't enjoy being there. Eventually, G and her grandson, ""CJ,"" who has behavioral issues, moved in with G's brother. But after some time, they were asked to leave, and my fiancé suggested that CJ come live with us since G couldn't take him.

I’m not a child person, but I agreed because I felt bad for CJ, who didn’t ask for this situation. CJ lived with us for 9 months, and it was incredibly difficult. He had no sense of discipline, and I tried to instill some responsibilities, like chores, which he resisted. I did my best to care for him and even moved to a larger house to give him his own space. We bought him a bed, furniture, and I even gave him my PlayStation 4 for Christmas because the 3D printer I got him wasn’t a great fit.

During this time, G was receiving $800 a month to support CJ but didn’t contribute any of it to us. When I found out, I confronted her angrily and learned that she had intentionally kept this information from us. She agreed to start giving us the money, but shortly after, G took CJ for a weekend, which turned into him never coming back. G accused me of being mean to CJ, said I was abusive to my fiancé (which CJ had been telling her), and claimed I was only after money. This hurt deeply, as it wasn’t true, and it felt like losing a child. My fiancé’s relationship with his mother suffered greatly.

Recently, my fiancé and G started to repair their relationship. My fiancé asked if he could give CJ the PlayStation 4, which I initially didn’t want to do, but I agreed. However, I later found out that my fiancé also gave CJ my PlayStation VR without asking me, which was never part of the deal. I was furious and asked him to get it back. He admitted he was wrong not to ask but thought it was part of the PlayStation 4 package.

"AITA for refusing to reimburse my landlord for landscaping? The story:  I am renting a nicer house in a middle class neighborhood in the United States from a private landlord.  It has extensive landscaping.  I pay 3k a month.  The landlord is laid back and generally cool but always broke.

My contract says ""Tenant is responsible for reasonable upkeep and maintenance of landscaping, including lawn mowing and leaf raking, as applicable.""  I asked about that before signing and he said 'You don't have to trim the landscape, I know professionals who can do that.""  Unfortunately that wasn't in writing. 2.5 months after moving in, he texts saying that neighbors were complaining about the weeds in the landscape beds.

""I meant you didn't have to trim the bushes, but you do have to do the weeds,"" he ""clarified.""  I rolled my eyes but whatever; he promised that if I cleared the weeds he'd send in landscapers to put in new mulch so it wouldn't be a future issue. 

I spent a few hours knocking down everything with my battery powered weed whacker and hedge trimmers.  I got the landscaping beds looking better than the house next to me although worse than the one on the other side.  Then the landscapers came and they cleared everything entirely -  removing the old mulch, crabgrass etc., and digging up cracks between the driveway (which had never been sealed), and then adding new mulch.

Today he sent me the invoice for my ""share"" - $400 for all the bed removal, because I hadn't kept up on the weeds.  He now claims it was always my responsibility to maintain the landscaping in the exact same condition and since he had hired professional landscapers that evidently means I have to too (on a side note I kind of suspect he'd be getting a kickback based on how the landscaper is his friend and he never bids anything but I can't prove anything).  I pointed out that I was billed 8 hours of labor when I only lived in the place 2.5 months and during a drought where nothing grew and clearly the beds needed mulch to begin with.  I say it's not my responsibility to improve his house for him, especially since the contract only specifies I care for the grass and leaves which I am current on.

I've sent no money and haven't even read his last email.  My dad and brother both say he's crazy, however my wife thinks I should offer to meet at $200 since the weeds did get pretty bad.  Also that's just a small fraction of the landscaping since there's more beds in the back too.  So AITA?",0.03
"AITA for asking my parents not to use their gas stove while we visit?  My folks have an old gas range. It’s always smells stinky when they use it, especially the oven. With all the info that’s come out about the harmful effects of gas stoves, I’ve grown a bit paranoid about their particular stove because it does stink a little. I’ve asked them to get  carbon monoxide detectors. But, now that we have a baby, I’ve asked them to not use it altogether when we visit. AITA? Other gas stoves don’t smell as much as this one does.

"AITA for confronting my girlfriend about dirty Tupperware?  Hello,

       My girlfriend is very sweet to me and I love her so much. She always likes to take care of me and I love her for it. Last night she had baked cookies for a party that’s today and she put aside about 6 or 7 for me to take with me to work. When I went to see her she gave me the cookies in a plastic Tupperware container and I took them home. 
       When I got home and opened the tupperwear container there was fur on the inside and the container looked grease like it was not cleaned with soap and water I removed the cookies and there was more fur throughout the container. I’m not usually a picky person but one thing that just kinda grosses me out is hair or fur in or around my food or in or on plates and bowls. My girlfriend knows this as well.
        When I told her the container was like this she told me she had cleaned it. I said that next time please put them in a new ziplock bag or wash the container before using it. At this she began to cry and I felt horrible. She comes from a house that has cats and dogs so I understand fur around but I also come from a house with 5 dogs and have the habit of checking eating wear before using it and if there’s anything on it I simple just wash it.
        I’ve eaten everything my girlfriend has ever made for me but this isn’t the first time this has happened but I usually don’t say anything but I did this time. I feel bad and guilty for saying anything as it clearly hurt her feelings. Am I unreasonable? should I get over this diversion I have? Am I the asshole? ",0.08
"AITA for still wanting my friends to pay their portion for a boat trip? I’m For a special occasion, a group of friends decided to get together and rent a boat with a few weeks notice. “Jane” and her partner agreed to come and Jane agreed to drive the boat. Given our original agreement there would be three licenses boat drivers, but Jane was the most experienced. Since Jane was the most experienced and agreed to drive the trip was postponed a week. Jane later told someone she didn’t agree to this but another party heard the original agreement. The week of the boat trip Jane said she was going to miss part of the trip due to an opportunity. Jane had complained about the food and accommodations were made.

Jane’s partner “John” decided the day before he didn’t want to spend as much time on the boat but never said he wasn’t coming. The morning of trip Jane sent a vague text saying she wasn’t coming. Never heard from John about his plans. Jane and John are a couple and neither came. 

The next day when I was working on totals to be divided up and repaid. John rejected my request and is claiming he never agreed to go and suggested those who went should pay more to cover their costs. His reasoning is that they didn’t go. I disagreed because we weren’t given enough notice to find replacements and plus I don’t know everyone’s financial situation and stated that would be unfair to others. 

I communicated with John because we’ve been friends the longest. A couple of weeks before the trip all communication updates were shared via a social media event or via text message. Attempts to call John weren’t returned. 

AITA for thinking they should still pay their portion when they didn’t join?",0.29
"AITA for telling my friend her breakup was an inappropriate topic at my engagement party Me (M32) and my fiancé (F30) had an engagement party this summer.  The party was great and we had a good time with friends & family etc, however one thing really bugged both me and my fiancé.  

I have a friend, call her Madison (32), she was invited to the party and is someone I have been friends with for a long time, since junior high (about 11 years old for non US people).  On the day of the party she told us she broke up with her boyfriend, we consoled her and cared for her and tried to make sure she was ok whilst also organising the party.  We had 200 guests so there was a lot of food/drinks/organising to do. 

When Madison arrived to the party, the only topic she spoke about was breaking up with her boyfriend, the first thing she said to me and my fiancé was about breaking up and then asking a bunch of inappropriate questions (think sex related etc) about our personal relationship to try and compare against her failed one and telling us things about her breakup and no congratulations to us.  We of course wanted to enjoy the party so tried to console and then change conversations/lighten the mood etc, but that didn’t really work and essentially it was the only thing she spoke about all night to us and any of the 200 or so guests we had, she proceeded to get drunk and then talk in detail about her sex life to our friends.  Quite a few people commented on this to us and said she was quite overbearing.   

On the night, I didn’t bring it up with her and didn’t want to cause a scene and ruin the party and generally had a great night, however, this stuck in both mine and my fiancé’s mind and we didn’t like the fact she couldn’t just celebrate us and have a good night.   

So I spoke to Madison about it a week later and said that her talking about her breakup all night wasn’t very nice for us and brought the atmosphere down and that she could’ve just enjoyed the night instead, that it made us feel annoyed, that we didn’t like that you did that and please could you not do it in the future.  At the time of this conversation Madison agreed and apologised, but then some days later texted and said actually we were wrong for bringing it up and that she thinks it’s strange we were bothered by her being upset, that all her friends agree we are the weird ones, that she didn’t say anything inappropriate to anyone (which is not true, so I think she’s in denial about this part or embarrassed to admit it), that she was upset, we should just support her and that we are not good friends to her for even bringing it up.  

We now are at a stalemate as I don’t want to apologise and Madison has pretty much taken her apology back.  

So I want to know 1. AITA for being annoyed about Madison only talking about her breakup and intimate relationship details at mine and my fiancé’s engagement party? 

And 2. AITA for then bringing this up to her to ask that she not do that again/make her aware that we didn’t like what she did.

"AITA for displaying pictures of my parents together after their divorce? I (21F) just moved into a new apartment with my boyfriend over an hour away from both sets of our parents. This is our first home together that we are financially responsible for, and we are very happy to be here. While decorating the new space, I put up pictures of my family members on our bookshelves, and he did the same. 
My parents went through a very nasty divorce in 2021, involving infidelity and other ongoing issues prior to the settlement. They hate each other and refuse to work together when it comes to me and my two younger siblings. It is very hard to get anything done with these tensions, but that’s not the point of this post. When the divorce settlement began, my mother had hundreds of pictures that were accumulated over their 20 year long marriage of her and my father and his family, and she planned to throw them away entirely. I found sentimental value in those old photos and took them off of her hands.
When I put up some pictures around our apartment, including ones featuring my siblings and grandparents and such, I chose to frame two pictures of my parents together, one where they had just moved into their first house, and another one taken around 2004 when I was just a baby. I like the photos because my parents are very healthy and happy in them, which I haven’t seen since I was a child.
My father and his girlfriend came to visit me and my boyfriend yesterday. From what I could tell, the interactions I had between them were normal. However, my father called me today to tell me that I can’t display those photos of him and my mother. He said that if I respected him, I wouldn’t hold onto those pictures and keep them in our apartment. 
I admit that maybe I should have turned them away when they came in, but I didn’t think about them being there to begin with. I don’t see a problem with having the pictures up because they are both my parents that I love and as their daughter, I feel as if I am allowed to keep them up. At the end of the day, it is my apartment that I have financial responsibility over along with my boyfriend, and I don’t think it matters if I have them up or not because neither of my parents live there nor pay for any of it.
Everyone I’ve spoken to says I’m in the right with my decision to keep them up, but I worry that I am disrespecting my parents by displaying them, even though they don’t see them unless they visit. AITA?",0.02
"WIBTA for turning my son's bedroom into a guest room? My son is 19 turning and starting his sophomore year of college in a few weeks. His mom and I have been separated for almost his whole life and we previously had split custody. I married when he was 9 and had another son who is now 10. However, my ex-wife and I divorced in 2020. 

After the divorce I bought a new house that was very close to my eldest son's mom (15-minute walk). It's technically a 4-bedroom, so each of my sons have their own room and I use the smallest room as my office. When I bought the house, I put a lot of effort into making the boy's rooms personalized to them and I know they have both been really happy about their spaces. 

However, currently my eldest son's bedroom functions more like a guest room than his own personal space and I'm thinking of making the change official.

He doesn't really use the space to sleep in anymore. He's away at college for most the year and even when he's home he spends most of his nights at his mom's home. He already works for me during school breaks, and we do a lot together outside of work, so his preference is to spend time with his mom in the evenings. 

The room is now used more by other people, most of whom are woman/girls.

My girlfriend (been together about 14 months) has a 4-year-old daughter who has started sleeping over at my house with her mom on occasion and has been staying in my son’s room.

My 2 nieces (11 & 9) also sleep over at my house a lot. My sister's a single mom who works late/nights often and they stay with me when she has to work later than their bedtime.

My youngest sister also stays with me regularly as she now lives a few hours away and likes to come back to our city to see family and friends.

I've already had to move some things out of my son's room to keep it away from the girls, but he still has a lot of stuff in there. The room is also overtly masculine, which seems strange when the main occupants are not. 

My son has had no issue knowing all these people are using his room and I'm considering asking him if he wouldn't mind if I switched the room up. I want to redecorate and get a couple new beds. I also want the girls to keep some of their things in the room plus get some toys and games for them.

I'm worried if I ask my son if he would be okay with officially losing his room, he may see it as a rejection. He and I haven't always had a great relationship. I was in the military for the first few years of his life and struggled with drugs and my mental health when I got out. Our relationship seems good now, but I know it's still delicate because he can be very sensitive. I would assure him that he's still welcome to stay as much as he wants. WIBTA if I ask him? Or should I just keep letting the girls use the space as it is until he brings it up or gets a more permanent place of his own?",0.68

We mostly had a good time and as we where all leaving and saying goodby my cousins who where in the car honked the horn and it shocked me they kept doing it so I covered my ears and eventually walked away but was forced to come back by my mom who forcefully removed my fingers from my ears.

"WIBTA if i pushed someone beyond the point of caring about what they said and then was hurt by what was sai after they had reached the point that they no longer cared what the had to say to get me to stop ? my (F25) ex bf (28M) and i got into a fight a lil bit ago, we were arguing and i didnt like something they had done. because i dont let people treat me badly i started telling them it wasnt okay to do. they began to get defensive and before i could gather my wits an argument was n full swing. yelling, interrupting, not listening. you know, an argument. so i am aware my friend has this point he gets to, i think its from trauma, that he, from what he says, begins to feel deeply disrespected. during the argument he began trying to get away, and telling me to stop talking and looking visibly distressed and angry. this continued for about another 10 minutes then he got this intense look on his face, and began saying the meanest stuff he could think of to me while still telling me to shit the fuck up and to leave him the fuck alone, he began calling me a bitch ass whore, stupid fucking cunt, and a evil conniving slut. i was shocked. i mean i knew about this but id never experienced it. i still didntrelent though because i hadnt been heard or validated yet and thats whats importand here, not his comfort. its not my responsibility to know hes about to snap and get all wacko. he should walk away....well he tried but i didnt ever let him because i feel like im not gonna ever get the satisfaction of him finally seeing things my way. if he calms down away from me i feel like i didnt ever win the argument. so i never let him do that. and now hes said about the worst string of insults ive ever heard and it hurt my feelings. so, AITA or is my behavior warranted cuz i hehurt my feelings and wouldnt take accountability when i wanted him to?

"AITA for causing my brother to have a meltdown because I didn’t give him sushi? Did I fuck up? I’ve been visiting my family over the last week and it’s my last day here. So far it’s been a disaster. There’s a lot of roles and family dynamics which are unhealthy and I’m the eldest (29) and the only one who doesn’t live at home.

My sister (18) and I are parentified a lot and my mother spends most of her time elsewhere. Today I decided it would be a good idea to get the twins (13) to do some of their chores, but in a way which doesn’t involves them being micromanaged and utilising them having to improvise, I told them I trusted them to do it but be aware that we are in a time crunch because my mother gets angry if she arrives home and the house isn’t spotless. I was helping them during this but they were stalling on purpose and doing the bare minimum for 5 hours (the tasks could potentially take 20 minutes but everyone is different of course) my sister and I tried to explain patiently the urgency of the situation but my brother apparently was very rude to her and they ended up having a very heated argument. I tried to explain how my sister was reacting this way because a lot of responsibility falls on her unfairly and he wasn’t empathising with her. His argument was he thought it was clean enough so he doesn’t understand why she was yelling at him for no reason. 

My other brother understood and admitted he fucked up, saying he was stalling.

So, another argument broke out when I got sushi. I gave my sister some but decided the twins didn’t deserve any due to their lack of empathy for my sister which happens on a consistent basis to the point she’s burnt out. A huge argument and fight broke out. There was screaming, he called us bitches. There was a lot of chaos over the last few hours. 

The majority of the family say I shouldn’t feel guilty because they believe I’m being treated unfairly. I spent the last week catering and caring for my family, I specifically put attention to the brother who had this meltdown because I’m aware he’s been bullied and struggling lately. 

I’m afraid this triggered him, however he was also angry at me because he couldn’t use my gaming laptop just now, whilst simultaneously shit talking me to his friends on Snapchat. I understand he’s a kid and kids react. I feel guilty and like I messed up by ordering sushi…

"AITA for “ruining” me and my best friends trip to Japan due to heat exhaustion and health issues? My best friend (21M), “Ezra” has been planning his dream vacation to Japan for a while now. He finally booked it in June and after he told me about it, I(19F) decided to join him because I have the funds and he really wanted me to go too. Especially because the main event he was excited for is something we both bonded over in our initial friendship and still love to this day.

Finally, day of our flights we’re supposed to meet at an airport and fly together to Ōsaka but that doesn’t happen because my flights get delayed by over 24 hours. By the time I arrive in Japan I’ve missed a day and am so tired/overwhelmed that I basically go straight to bed, and I accidentally kept my best friend awake by snoring (which I never do, it was the flights affecting my sinuses). 

So the next day, we’re supposed to go to the main event we came here for and within two hours of traveling/walking in the very humid, very hot August weather, I get major heat exhaustion and throw up in a train station. I felt somewhat better after that but my heat exhaustion continued to ruin our day at the Event and made Ezra skip a few things he really wanted to do, which I told him he could anyways while I waited in an AC shop, but he refused because I was somewhat delirious and very lightheaded. 

Flash forward to the next two days and Ezra and I both take it pretty easy because we’re exhausted, only going out to the city in the evening which was more bearable heat-wise, but we got lost many times in the train systems, which was very overwhelming, and we both felt unwell from all the extensive walking and steps (mainly me, because I have joint issues). 

After all this, Ezra tells me he’s not enjoying himself because he’s too worried about me all the time and overwhelmed from quite a few other things, like the train systems, and I just feel so fucking awful. I shouldn’t have ever come. I knew I had a bit of heat intolerance but I have never experienced anything like this before. I have been doing my absolute best to push through it but it’s so hard.

"AITA for what I said about bf’s mom’s death? I wanted to get opinions on this conversation with my bf.

My bf's mom died during childbirth. She always had a lot of health problems and a ""weird body"" (as my bf's dad described) but she really wanted to be a mom and have her own child and she did that.

Her birthday happened, so we went to her gravesite and put up flowers and we talked a little bit about her.

We have talked about it multiple times, and I know he's really sad about what happened. But he surprised me when he said that we probably shouldn't even be here, that technically he was the worst thing to happen to her, maybe she doesn't even want him visiting her gravesite.

It took for back for sure. I said of course she would want that. She wanted a kid really bad, she'd probably be happy to know he was living a happy life.

He said oh please, she would be wishing she never gave birth to me for sure.

I was like... oh no. I mean my heart broke that he feels that way. So I said like of course she would be happy, she's a mom. My mom would die for me over and over again. Mom's love their kids and she decided to have a kid, she knew the complications.

He snoffed and said she didn't even know me. Your mom knows you, so yeah, she'd do anything for you. I'm just a horrible end to her life, and I don't want to hear that she would have wanted it like this when it's not true, you just want to make me feel better.

It felt like the conversation was over so I just said well, I'm really happy it ended like that. I'm really happy your here and not her.

"AITA for telling my dad I don’t want to sleep in a bunkbed I 30F am recently married to my husband 33M. I don’t live in the same state as my parents so we all travel to see each other a few times per year. Two weeks ago my dad called me and asked if he could come visit for a few days while my mom hosted some friends at their house. I told him I would be returning from work the same day as his arrival and would be very tired. He said no problem, he would get a hotel the first night and then would like to take my husband and I to the coast for a few days. 

My work schedule is a two week on, two week off rotation. When I’m gone to work I live in a dorm like community setting with bunkbeds. My job is demanding and stressful, and the commute home is long and tough. When I get home I usually just want to sleep and hang out with my husband for the first few days. I have learned the hard way that if I don’t give myself this down period I usually get sick. (I’ve had covid 5 times.) But going to the coast with my dad and husband seemed reasonably restful so I said yes. 

This morning he sends me the link to the Airbnb he has already booked and the second bedroom, where my husband and I are expected to sleep, is a set of bunkbeds. 

I called him and gently but directly told him I was not stoked on sleeping in a bunk bed. That I had been up at work for two weeks, was commuting home on the red eye, and was in need of restful sleep. He got defensive and said this was the only place he could find. I told him then I would have appreciated at least being asked if I was okay with sleeping in the bunkbed. He said that he was planning to sleep in the bunkbed so he didn’t understand why he needed to clear that with me. My dad is a big man. In no world was he planning to sleep in that bunkbed, and he knows that I won’t make him. 

Well come to find out the house is non refundable so we’re stuck with this arrangement. At 30 years old I’m tired of not being considered as an adult in decisions like this. At this point in my life I can’t just sleep anywhere and be fine. Not to mention I have missed my husband terribly and always sleep best when we sleep together.

"AITA for backseat driving my husband with a terrible driving record?  For context, he’s been driving since he was 17 (he is now 27). His first car was a write off due to an at fault accident while merging onto a highway. The next car was written off because he was following a large truck too closely in the winter and slid on ice and hit the truck. About ~6-7 years later in 2023 he totals MY car in an attempt to… exit. This past May, he was driving my new car and he rear ended someone. Again, following too closely. He will argue about these “following too closely” labels endlessly. He absolutely will not accept the fault as him following too closely, it’s always something else. The ice. The gravel on the road. It was an accident. You name it. He refuses to grasp that if he had provided himself with more distance in these moments, regardless of debris or weather on the road, he would have had adequate time to stop. He is so stubborn that I won’t bother arguing this with him because he will not move on his opinion and swears up and down they’re not his fault. 

Needless to say, he is not insured on my current vehicle because he is a liability. However, I do allow him to drive to the corner store because sometimes I don’t want to do it or I’m in the middle of something and it’s just easier. Today, I walked with our kids to a park in our neighbourhood, and he met us later with the car. We were all inside while he was driving to the corner store. He was speeding (doing 60 in a 50 km/hr zone) and I felt like he was following too closely to the car ahead of us. I said something like “don’t drive like your dad”, who is notoriously an aggressive driver. Not the nicest comparison, and he really was bothered by that. I backpedaled a bit and said it wasn’t that hard to drive less aggressive. I said no, you’re not speeding 50 over the limit like your dad, but you’re speeding and too close to the guy ahead of us. Just slow down. He had shut off at this point and had resorted to saying he just won’t drive anymore (as if you do, but okay). We paused there. 

Later, he came to apologize for his reaction. I apologized as well for upsetting him. I’m having a hard time delivering a genuine apology without adding “but you have an awful record and I always feel like you follow too close and I was having a physical reaction and I spoke up because I felt uncomfortable and all you had to do was slow down and say ‘I don’t think so but I’ll slow down because you asked’”. He’s insisting that I shouldn’t have said anything at all. When mentioning his history, he said there’s been many times that he’s been uncomfortable with me driving. Sure, I make mistakes and admit there are areas I can improve. I also have not had several crashes due to it, and right now I am telling you that I am uncomfortable with how you are driving. Does it not make sense to respect that?

"WIBTA to circumvent my husband and kibosh MILs ""plan""? Husband (42m) and I (39f) are experiencing a strained marriage, this issue aside. I want to avoid causing additional strain but cannot watch this trainwreck unfold in silence.

MIL is considering buying a cottage. This would be none of my business if it was going to be her property to finance, manage, and care for, but... That is not how this would play out.

She is not in great health. Still has a mortgage on her primary residence and is not able to maintain her house. It's in shambles, and she hoards. This responsibility falls on my husband and his ""two"" brothers.

We have a small child and very busy with our own lives and trying to maintain our own home, we are already overwhelmed. My husband is handy, we have unfinished projects at our house started over 2 years ago, and haven't been able to finish despite using vacation time. He also looks after his mom's house, and everyone's cars in the family including a couple friends (= 9 cars). He is constantly busy working on things, spreads himself too thin, it is too much.

Brother #1 also helps with MIL house but less so as my husband is the handy one. Brother #2 is no help whatsoever, unreliable, ultimately low contact and difficult to get ahold.

Which brings us to the cottage. MIL is sending listings and looking at properties to put a down payment. There has been no discussion what this would look like, who is responsible for looking after it, and what this would entail for everyone involved. The idea is that we'd all get to use this property and my husband is interested in this prospect. My alarm bells are going off, I cannot fathom entering into any arrangement of looking after a secondary property farless the possibility of any possible financial implications. Not to mention, husband's family is pretty spread out and the cottage locations she is looking at are furthest from our house - I would never want to commit to driving 3/+ hours in traffic just to arrive at a cottage and get to work maintaining the property. That is simply not relaxing to me.

MIL has not included me in any of the discussions about said cottage and is sending the property listings to my husband and his brothers to look at.

WIBTA to email her about my honest thoughts on this matter and should I include the brothers and my husband in this email? I'm having a hard time deciphering how serious she is, but this decision would implicate me personally and I don't want to sit back and watch this disaster happen while my husband goes along with it.",0.4
"AITA for not attending my sisters wedding because she didn’t invite my girlfriend? 
So, my sister and her soon to be husband are getting married next month. We've always had a decent relationship, but she’s never been very accepting of my girlfriend who I've been with for three years now. My girlfriend is kind and respectful, but my sister says she ""doesn't fit in"" with our family. Recently, I received my wedding invitation, and it was addressed only to me. When I asked my sister why my girlfriend wasn't invited, she said it's a ""family-only"" event and that she doesn’t feel comfortable having my girlfriend there. 

I told her that if my girlfriend isn’t welcome, then I won’t be attending either. My sister got upset and said that I'm being selfish and making her wedding about me. My parents are split—my mom thinks I should go to support my sister, while my dad says I should stand by my girlfriend. Now my whole family is involved, and it’s causing a lot of tension. My family is picking sides and it’s overall just tearing out entire family apart. AITA for refusing to go to the wedding?

"AITAH for snapping at my girlfriend for deleting her call log? Throwaway account because I don't want this traced to my main account.

I (31M) live in an African country. My  grandmother died and so for us that means a lot of ceremonies, planning, wakes and meetings. My girlfriend (31F) went to visit her parents out of town. She gets busy because our households hold a lot of work for ladies. 

We have not been talking as much as we used to since she went home but I chalked it up to her being home and meeting up with her friends who she hasn't spoken to in ages. Some odd things do happen like her abruptly ending phonecalls and being too busy to talk but I didn't think too much into it. 

I have been pretty involved in the funeral plans plus I have been staying with my parents to help cook and clean for them while they plan the funeral. On the day when it clocked two months of being together, my GF did not communicate with me at all all day. I was pretty sick and after the night wake that night, I needed to head back to my place for the night to sort some other things out. I slept pretty early. I woke up the following day sicker and throwing up so I stayed in bed as my phone charged in another room. 

When I finally got the strength to leave bed at around 2.00pm, I checked on my phone and found that my GF had texted me at 6.30pm the previous evening. She claimed that she had also called me that night at 7.00pm and I didn't pick up. I checked my call log and there was no missed call from her. 

I tried calling her but she refused to pick and said she was going somewhere plus that she would have just preferred to text. I said that I did not see her phone call and I shared my call log with her. She said she called me but she deleted her call log so ""too bad for me"". This statement really angered me because it came off as quite rude. I called her out on it and further asked to know why she deleted her call log. 

She said she had no reason why she did it and insisted that I had offended her by not picking her call. I insisted that she did not call and that it was suspicious that she cleared her call log. I also told her that I did not appreciate the rude statement and that she needs to respect me enough as an adult to speak to me more politely. 

She said that I had hurt her with my words, and that she was broken. I also feel bad because in addition to being offended about the statement, I lost my grams and I'm in a weird place about it, so that could also have contributed to my angered response. We are currently not speaking to each other.

Am I being irrational here? Is it normal for people to just clear their call logs for no reason? Am I the asshole for snapping at her?",0.07
"AITA for not conforming to my husband’s wishes about my appearance? My husband (m 42) and I (f 25) met 5 years ago. In december we are going to celebrate our 4 year anniversary. My appearance changed since we started dating in 2020 and I know that it bothers him, since he told me many times. In the last few years I got some tattoos, cut my hair and gained weight. The problem with the tattoos is that he doesn’t find tattoos aestheticly pleasing, not specifically in my case but in general. I knew that before I got them but I got them regardlessly. The thing with the hair is that he strongly prefers long hair in women. I shaved my head twice since we started dating and currently my hair is at chin-length with a undercut and sidecuts on both sides. The thing with me gaining weight is that he prefers skinny bodies. I once was quite skinny but gained a bit of weight. Nothing dramatic but it shows a bit. Every once in a while I ask him if he is still attracted to me and he always says that I work against his preferences and that it hurts my attractiveness towards him. He also told me that my behavior hurts him a bit. What he means is that I don’t take his preferences into consideration when making decisions about my appearance. The thing is I do actually. I take my own wishes and his wishes into consideration but often I make decisions that look like I don’t care about what he wants because I am obviously biased towards my own wishes and needs.

"AITA for crossing out the faces of my friends on a photo because they betrayed me? I(14F) hang out with a group of friends in my school.We call this our Gang and we are mainly from 2 classes - H and I. So I am from class I. The main issue here was this girl, let's call her Chloe. So Chloe and I have known each other for 2 years, and we've been through alot together.



Chloe and I have worked together on multiple group projects and when I won a competition last year, I was presented to go for a conference in the United States in 2024. I was allowed to bring one of my classmates with me. Naturally, since I was the closest with Chloe at the time, I chose her to come with me for the trip. 



Fast forward to July 2024, we were having this photo booth thing during lunch. So the kids from H class in the Gang were dismissed on time while the I kids were mheld back. Got down with my friend from I and Chloe started screaming at me, ""We have waited for seven minutes already! Where were you guys?!"" I was taken aback because I couldn't control when my class ended. However, it was not uncommon for Chloe to start screaming and shouting out of the blue, so I just dealt with it.



Then I saw this girl, let's call her Sophie. Sophie usualy edoes not hang out with the members of Gang so I asked, ""Why is sy taking pics with us?"" out of curiousity. Chloe started to yell at me again and say stuff like, ""Are you unhappy that Sophie is taking photos with us? Just cause she's not friends with you doesn't mean she's not friends with us!"" This was weird because taking photos is a small thing.



Then, I realised that two girls Jennifer and Anya were not here yet and they are part of Gang. So I said, ""Hey, let's wait for them."" Then, Chloe startyed screaming at me because she said she was tired of waiting and did not want to wait anymore. I said, "" Look, if you don't want to wait, you can take the photo by yourself."" Then she yelled (in front of literally everyone at the photo booth) ""GO FUCK YOURSELF!""



She then turned to the kids from H and said, ""I told you guys we shouldn't have waited for the I kids.""In the end, we still took the photo.



Next day, none of the kids from Gang (except for Jennifer and Anya) were talking to me. I asked Jennifer why and she said, ""They will only talk to you if you apologise to Chloe.""



Then I asked her what I had to apologise for and she said that Chloe said that 1. I told her to get therapy (which I didn't), 2. I do not include her in group projects.



These are all untrue. Chloe was spreading lies. She always does not participate in group activities and I end up doing all the work. I was very hurt that my friends would trust Chloe over me so I crossed out their faces on my photo of all of us and threw the photo in the class bin for all to see. Now everyone is saying I was the AH for doing that. It's really startingto make me feel bad and question if I overreacted. Apparently Chloe cried seeing the photo in the trash.

"AITA for explaining my Poopoo Dance to my wife’s friends? My (30M) wife (28F) recently had some of her friends over for a casual get-together. The evening was going well, with everyone laughing and sharing funny stories. At one point, the conversation turned to quirky habits and routines. My wife brought up my ""poopoo dance,"" which is something I do before I use the toilet.

To clarify, this isn’t just a random dance; it’s more of a ritual for me. I’ve been doing it for as long as I can remember, and it’s something that helps me relax before I go to the bathroom. If I don’t do the dance, I get really stressed out. So, when her friends asked what the dance was like, I figured, why not explain it?

The dance itself is pretty silly. It starts with me standing in front of the bathroom door and doing a little two-step side to side, kind of like swaying from one foot to the other. Then I spin around once, because I need to make sure I’m ""aligned"" (don’t ask me why, it just feels right). After the spin, I do a few quick hops in place—this is supposed to ""shake off"" any lingering tension. Finally, I take a deep breath and march in a circle before heading into the bathroom. It’s a weird mix of a warm-up routine and something that just feels necessary.

Everyone laughed when I showed them, and I thought it was just a lighthearted moment. But afterward, my wife pulled me aside and said I’d embarrassed her by taking it too far. She said it was one thing to mention the dance, but actually demonstrating it was too much information and made the situation uncomfortable for her and her friends.

I thought I was just playing along with the conversation and didn’t see any harm in it. But now I’m second-guessing myself and wondering if I crossed a line by sharing something that’s usually just between us.

So, AITA for explaining (and demonstrating) my poopoo dance ritual to my wife’s friends?",0.21
"AITAH - Telling my brother to reconsider marrying SIL First time post, also posting on mobile. Looking for advice on how to handle this situation, please help!

This is going to be long, but I’ll try to be as clear as possible. I (24F) have a brother (37) who recently got out of prison a few years ago. During his time, he was speaking to this woman (40), now SIL, and upon his release became engaged to her. 
SIL had a baby (1 y/o) via sperm donor, which my brother had agreed to raise as his own upon his release, he was released early and was able to be there throughout the end of her pregnancy and childbirth.
Now, this is where things get a little crazy. My parents bought a house for my sister and I, and since we had a spare room, he moved in with us along with SIL and baby. My sister and I had been living in this house for two years just ourselves and so having a baby, SIL, and brother move in has been a huge adjustment. My sister and I both work 7am - 3pm, are still in college, and the baby is incredibly needy and cries a lot throughout the day, making being at home incredibly hard for us. As of right now, we’ve been on summer break from school/work and we’ve been at home majority of the time with SIL and baby as she’s a SAHM. Brother works from around 5-3pm M-F in construction. We’ve noticed SIL is constantly on her phone, doesn’t clean up after herself, yells at the baby constantly and as soon as my brother gets home from work, leave the baby to him and she goes into their shared room. We’ve asked her to clean up after herself AND the baby as he explores and makes a mess of things around the house (ex. taking movies out of cabinet, leaving food around, playing in dogs water and spilling it, etc.) As I mentioned, she doesn’t work so she isn’t helping with any of the bills, and she constantly stays home and refuses to go out anywhere with the baby unless my brother is going with her. She also is constantly berating my brother for being tired and getting upset with the baby when he’s crying, despite herself doing the same. There’s so many more things that she does (or lack of) that makes my sister and I question her ability to be a wife, and as bad as it may sound, even a mom.

SO… she’s leaving to visit her family for a week and my sister and I want to have a conversation with my brother about her, and ask what she’s bringing into his life besides from, what it appears, stress. We want him to really think about if he wants to live the rest of his life with her. Personally, we feel as though he should’ve enjoyed his time from being released from prison to get adjusted to life as it is now, and just enjoy his freedom once again, instead of completely diving into having an immense amount of responsibility along with stress so quickly. Would I be the AH to tell him all of this?

"AITA for Taking Down My Former Friend's Website and Giving Her Payment to Another Friend? My former friend (32F) and I (31F) were very close for over 15 years, despite having significant arguments along the way. We lived in different countries but visited each other often and shared the same friend group. Most of our fights happened online, rarely in person. Whenever we met face-to-face, things seemed fine, but minor frustrations often escalated into major online arguments once she returned home. She was more comfortable expressing her feelings behind screens, whereas I preferred addressing issues in person. I repeatedly told her I wanted to resolve problems face-to-face instead of arguing online, but these discussions often ended with her saying, ""I'm done,"" after which she would go silent for weeks. This left me to reach out and mend the relationship.

A few years ago, I designed, coded, and hosted her website as a favor, since she liked mine and found her existing site too expensive to maintain, trying to establish herself as an illustrator. I didn’t ask her to pay for it, she offered to pay me with one of her illustrations, which I accepted (regret that now). The process strained our friendship. I asked her to create a moodboard, she insisted I should just ""do my thing,"" trusting my judgment. I developed a concept, both design/one coded page, presented it to her. She didn’t like it, so I reworked the entire concept. The second time, she liked it/provided feedback. With her approval, I fully developed the site. However, after a few days, mutual friends informed me that she was unhappy with the site, despite telling me she liked it. She complained to them that she was not having it because she paid me. This led to another argument, I was frustrated she hadn’t spoken to me directly. I decided to redesigned the website. She bought the domain to save costs, and I hosted the website on my hosting package for free until she was more established.

A few years later, we had another argument online. She once again went silent, blocking me/not returning calls. I decided the friendship was no longer working and sent her a heartfelt letter ending it. Months later, her site was still online, hosted by me. I received a warning email about her mailaddress (linked to my hosting) having issues. I informed her, she didn’t respond. After another warning months later, emailed her again, informing her that I would no longer be hosting her website. I set a deadline for her to find another host or designer (included a full backup of her site). She didn’t respond, so when the deadline arrived, I took it down. Her boyfriend called me, angry. Since the artwork payment had caused so much trouble, I decided to give it to another friend of ours. I felt I had done the work and hosted her site for free for years, so I was justified. Apparently hates me for taking the site offline and giving away the artwork. AITA?",0.17

"AITA for not paying a share of somebody else’s holiday ticket? So, around October last year I have booked a holiday with, at the time, 2 very close friends of mine Emily & Brooke. The holiday would have been for 6 people, the three of us, the romantic partners of the other 2 friends and my best friend. 6 in total.

Since then, Brooke and I have had a very bad falling out over nothing significant and haven’t spoken to eachother for about 4 months now. I have made efforts to reach out to Brooke in order to clear the air, but I have received absolutely no reply. Still, we’re all booked in for this big 6 person holiday towards the end of 2024. 

I have considered dropping out of the holiday, but me and my best friend are really looking forward to it since we don’t have many chances to see eachother since we moved to opposite ends of the U.K and to be honest, we’re most likely going to just keep ourselves to ourselves and not interact much with Emily & Brooke during the holiday. 

So, my main issue comes from the fact that Brooke has since separated from her romantic partner. Every single person has made effort to find another person to take over the ticket but nobody has taken the offer. Now, Brooke wants everybody to split the share of Brooke’s ex’s ticket which equates to around £130 each. Am I the asshole if I refuse to pay this? In a normal situation, I wouldn’t mind paying to help a friend. But as I mentioned, Brooke has ignored all efforts I have made to build bridges and clear the air and has no clear interest in sitting down to talk things through. I feel begrudged paying £130 to cover her ex’s ticket and more so asking my best friend for £130, especially because he’s never even met Brooke in his life. Plus, we’re both not amazing financially at the moment so £130 each is hardly pocket change. I have already voiced this opinion to Emily who has called me a massive asshole for even considering this, and I’d be likely screwing her over as well as she, her partner and Brooke will have to cover the entire other ticket cost between the three of them if me and my best friend refuse. 

Am I the asshole for refusing to pay up, and refusing to ask my best friend to pay up, for a person who has no interest in speaking with me anymore? Thanks :)",0.02

I told her multiple times in the past that I would rather not to talk about her pregnancy because it’s a sensitive topic for me. I did not got into details as I don’t want to share my medical history with everyone and she stopped… for the rest of that day. 
Today I couldn’t stand it any longer.
She again started talking about how her back hurts and because of the weather her feet were very swollen. I yelled at her “just shut the fuck up and don’t bother me with your baby. You at least have a uterus to carry one”

"AITA for mostly ignoring my grandparents? For context, i (17m) back in China visiting my grandparents (78 F, 81 M) for a little over two months and I am literally going insane. I genuinely have never experienced such culture shock and disgust in my life. And it’s not the first time visiting them, not at all, which is why the sudden culture shock is well.. shocking. I visit them almost yearly. Here is a short list of things that they do that just makes me not want to interact with them at all- blocking all sources of water, leaving huge pools in sinks, floors, etc, unplugging EVERY electronic device, I’m not kidding, they turn off WiFi, microwaves, cables, etc, it’s insane. They say it will all blow up. My mother and me have tried to explain NUMEROUS times that it won’t, they just won’t listen. No ac- there is ac in the apartment where we are staying but they refuse to turn anything on, and say if it is on, it can’t go below 26 celcius or it will catch on fire??? This especially bothers me because where i am in China it is consistently over 40 degrees celcius and i hate being hot. - sanitary standards. Everything is filthy. They say they can’t clean anything because they’re old. They just douse everything in water and call it a day. I don’t dare eat the food they make because of the way they prepare everything. If i try to even attempt to clean or tidy up anything, they call me mean and somehow trying to shame them. Absolute no social awareness, forcing me to eat when im not hungry, intruding at 1 am waking us up to “make sure that everything is clean”, and guilt tripping me and my mother when we don’t want to spend time at home, and go out.

It reached a breaking point today when we were packing up to finally leave, and my grandparents just stood in the corner pestering us to leave and go eat food 3 hours before the train to the airport, and micromanaging us, sneaking random things into our bags when we had a weight limit for the bags (they knew this.) and I just snapped and yelled at them to PLEASE leave the room, and my mother shouted at me for being rude. Later I heard my grandparents talking about me behind my back in Chinese (they think I can’t understand anything because I was born in America).

"AITA for giving my boyfriend the ultimatum of his nightmares? 
My partner (28m) and I (26f) have been together for 4 years. Eight months ago, we found out we were pregnant. After two years of trying, with no success, this was a MASSIVE deal for us. We had decided that we weren’t going to post anything as we were only 12 weeks - it seems crazy because that is the safe zone but we had lost a baby previously at 14 weeks so we wanted to wait a little longer before getting our hopes up. We had told our parents when we were 10 weeks - the first words that came out of his mums mouth were “I didn’t think she could get pregnant, will she lose this one too?” which she directed to my partner like I wasn’t sitting there. At 12 weeks, I got a notification on Facebook that my partners mum had tagged both myself and my partner in a post on Facebook. I opened it and immediately was sent into a full throttle anxiety attack.
The Facebook post was as follows;
“Would like to congratulate my son on finally being able to be a father! I hope your baby is healthy and (my name) can carry this one to full term and not break our hearts again with loss”. I had felt like I had caused my miscarriage and in turn, the death of my baby. My partner forced her to delete the post, not only was it deeply wrong and horrible, we also hadn’t had a chance to announce our pregnancy yet. It’s now been 5 months since this happened and his mum still makes snide comments about me and how she will always be the number one priority to her son. Last night we had family and friends over for dinner. My partners best friend made a joke about his mum not being invited and my partner was quick to put the blame on me saying “it’s (my names) fault, she’d be here if it wasn’t for her”. After dinner, I decided enough was enough, I sat my partner down and told him that it was me and our baby or his mum. And not in an aspect that he had to completely cut one or the other off - but that I wanted her to have minimal contact with our baby and any time she did, both him and myself were to be present. She wasn’t welcome to our home anymore. I also said that if he chose his mother, he was still more than welcome to be the amazing father I know he’s going to be, but our baby will still not be allowed near his mother without me present. He said he would always choose me and our baby, but this morning he got up for work and didn’t wake me to say goodbye. He didn’t call me on his break and had randomly put a fair amount of money in our account from our savings and text me saying “go buy everything we need for baby before they are here”. I just feel like he’s avoiding me and now I feel like an absolute asshole for giving him the ultimatum. ",0.11
"AITA calling my husband out for DUII and playing video games? I (28F) married to my husband (33M) for 2 yrs. & we’ve been together for 5 total. We’ve had our ups & downs & have really worked on communication & respecting boundaries. When I first started dating my husband he had a tendency to DUI, I voiced my concerns & he heard what I had to say. He lost his sister to a DUI accident only a few years prior & I thought maybe that would impact his decisions but it didn’t. Flash forward to now: I have just gotten back from an 8 day family trip & hadn’t seen my husband. He got off work the evening I arrived home and we spent an hour together watching TV & I tried to tell him about my trip, only for him to then go play video games with his friends. Normally, this wouldn’t be an issue. But he was leaving for a trip two days later with his dad, who was coming to stay with us the next day. So we really didn’t have time to spend quality 1 on 1. I voiced my disappointment only for him to brush me off. I decided to go to bed while he played video games, I was sad not spending time with him before he leaves. The following day I was distant & he noticed, calling me out saying it was uncalled for especially before he left on a trip. I disagreed & told him my feelings were hurt. His father came into town that afternoon & they decided to go out to dinner, I opted out as I wasn’t in the mood to socialize after I was recovering from a redeye trip home & still hurt over inconsideration. I checked in before heading to bed as it was getting late, I made sure to text him to see if he was good to drive. An hour went by with zero response, so I sent a follow up text. He responded later on saying he was good to drive. The text message proved otherwise, with misspelling all over the place. Unfortunately, by the time he texted back I was asleep. He drove him & FIL home that night & was violently hungover the next day and called out of work. To say I was p*ssed at his reckless decision is an understatement. That combined with the previous argument left me steaming. I took our dog for a walk before leaving quickly for work. He called me on the way fuming that I didn’t say goodbye. (I had gone up to say goodbye but he was in a fetal position eyes closed in bed). He asked me when I was going to stop being angry with him over “stupid shit” & I responded with “when you stop making shitty selfish decisions.”  He hung up the phone. I came home after work & he was getting ready for bed as we had to be up early to drop them off at the airport. There was no further discussion/no apology/no accountability. I took him & FIL to the airport at 3:30am today & on the way home received the following text: “It is definitely time we separate it’s clear as day now I’m done I’ll talk to you when I get back..” I just replied: “Have a safe flight.

"AITA for sending my ex half the bill for our last date? I was dating this woman for about 8 weeks, so it wasn’t a serious relationship, but we we’re spending a lot of time together. We’d go on dates throughout the week and she’d spend the night at my apartment on Fridays so we could the whole day Saturday together. The last Saturday we did this she was acting distant the entire day. Not being as talkative or affectionate. She did however allow me to drive an hour each way to pick her up, and pay for everything on our date that she helped plan. Brunch, kayaking, seafood, and dinner. I ended up spending about $250. 

After I dropped her off she was texting less, and not wanting to FaceTime. So I texted her and asked if she was ok. To which she responded with a text talking about how she just wanted to be friends. 

Which is fine, I’m not upset that she doesn’t like me in that way. Im more upset that it seemed like she knew she felt that way the entire day and still allowed me to waste time and money on her so she could have fun. She still did have fun on the date and kept it going instead of leaving at anytime. She requested to go to this specific seafood restaurant which ended up being pretty expensive.

So after that, and feeling pretty taken advantage of. Since I had payed for all of our dates! I sent her an Apple Pay request of $125.

"AITA for not exposing my plastic surgeries So I 29f had quite a fair bit of plastic surgery done and i do look visibly different from my childhood photos(chest, ass, nose, jaw, forehead, lips) 

I was quite conventionally unattractive and the first thing I did coming to age and money was my adjust my body. I do regret some of the procedures but it was life changing. I actually felt like people valued my presence and I still wouldn’t change it.

Fast forward to two years ago where I basically stop any more changes and was a lot more confident in my body, I met my boyfriend(32m) he was great. Overall I do think we were quite compatible however issues started last last week. When I took him to parents house for the first time and my mother unceremoniously showed him my childhood photos. I never intended to hide my natural face/body from him but I hated the old me and just try to hide it from everyone if I could.

At first he didn’t know it was me and thought it was my sister that I’m not really friendly with. She stayed natural so she really resembles the old me and has heavily criticised my life choices. He made some real hurtful jabs at those photos and when my mother pointed out it was me, he thought it was a joke. When he realised it wasn’t his face sunk and was quiet through the rest of the day.

On the way back home was when he lashed out and ask me why I hid this from him and that if I had such extensive procedures done, I should have told him before getting with him. He said he felt that he was lied to and accused me of a manipulator.

"AITA for getting angry and blaming my mum after my diagnosis. For context: I 21f have always had mild health concerns from the age of 13 I’d say. I’ve had really bad breathing issues, back pain, joint pain, rashes on my face etc. From the ages of 16-21 I was at hospitals constantly getting checkups because no one had any idea what was wrong with me.

Last year I visited my home country and I got really sick with a chest infection. I was literally suffocating with chest pain and my back hurt so bad that I had to go to emergency for having symptoms of a heart attack. They treated me at the hospital and 2 days later sent me to do 2 blood tests. I’m not exactly sure what they were for but one was a general blood test that checks if u have any low vitamins or it checks glucose levels etc and the other was an autoimmune disease test. The general test came back perfect I literally had no issues (despite my family constantly commenting on my lifestyle bc I don’t eat meat and other certain foods) 
The autoimmune test only flags up if your pathogens are very obvious so mine were negative but one flagged up because I had a high level of a specific protein in my body that indicated an abnormal inflammation. 
My aunt has lupus and arthritis so she took me to a specialist she knows for about 20 years now. This lady writes me a note to give to the clinic for 4 more blood tests one checking for lupus, the other for arthritis and the last 2 checking for thyroid issues. She also tells me to take my top off because she wants to look at my back. 
IMMEDIATELY she tells me I have scoliosis… and she sends me to get an xray done which confirms it…
I did the blood tests and confirmed I have ‘mild’  lupus as well… so my breathing issues were from my spine not allowing room for my lungs to expand and my other symptoms were from my lupus… I can’t do anything for my back anymore because I’m too old, besides physiotherapy and I take medication for my lupus 

I was angry with my mum because ever since I was a kid she would shout at me to straighten my back, my legs, and people asked her as well like what was wrong with my back or my skin etc and she would always say I was doing it on purpose or it wasn’t serious… so AITA for blaming her and getting angry after my diagnosis because I felt like she had so much time to help me and she rather spent it scolding me. Also even to this day she downplays it saying my conditions aren’t serious… 

Context: I got results/ xray so fast because I went private and paid for them.",0.14
"AITA for telling my parents not to speak to me after possibly stealing my medication? Feeling quite conflicted here. I (30F) was prescribed an anti anxiety medication recently after dealing with some life-altering events. I only take it when absolutely necessary and have no prior history of substance use/abuse. My husband (29M) is aware of everything and has been very supportive during this time. So, last month I was scheduled to have a pretty major surgery in a city 3 hours from where I live. My parents live closer to the hospital so my husband and I stayed with them the night before the surgery. I mentioned taking this medication to calm my anxiety before my surgery the next day to my mom and she had an absolute meltdown about it, begging me to throw it out and never take it again. She brought it up several times that night and into the morning. She came to the hospital with my husband and was questioning him about the prescription and if I took it that morning. Post surgery we stopped at my parents, ate dinner, took our suitcases and went home. I didn’t think anything of it. Well fast forward to a few days ago, I realized I haven’t seen my prescription in a while. I went in my suitcase that I haven’t used since my surgery and found the pill bottle sealed closed with no pills in it. There were originally still 13 pills in the bottle before they went missing. I’ve searched everywhere and cannot find them. The only explanation I can think of is that either my mom took them at some point, or had my dad go through my stuff and take them while I was in surgery. They keep denying it and pointing the finger at my husband or that I just lost them. But the bottle was closed in my suitcase with no pills inside. I also realized my mom wouldn’t let it go before my surgery, but hasn’t brought up the prescription issue since. My parents are not good at respecting boundaries and never take accountability for their wrong doings. I’ve been questioning them over the past few days but they will not admit it. Even my sisters called me to tell me my parents definitely took it and are lying. Today I told them that I will not speak to them until they admit they took my medication and understand they really crossed the line. My mom told me I’m an asshole and will regret blaming them for it. So Reddit, am I the asshole for telling my parents not to speak to me until they admit it? ",0.08
"WIBTA for telling my friend she needs a therapist? I’d probably start this off by saying that I, whether right or wrong, would consider myself a good friend. If you’re sick, if you’re heartbroken, if you’re short on money, I’ll be there in a heartbeat. My friends tell me I’m a good friend (including the friend I’m talking about) so this situation is kind of breaking my brain.

My friend is going through a rough time, and has been for a while. They’re depressed that they can’t find a partner and it’s really really getting them down. I’ve done the whole wingwoman bit and setting them up and even helping tinder swipe, but it has generally come to nothing. Either they’re not interested or the prospective partner isn’t interested in them. This has been going on a long long time.

They go through highs and lows but when there’s a low, it’s really low. They’re mean and snappy to me and our other friends, and bitchy about people, and deeply and darkly negative.

I’ve had a pretty traumatic and tumultuous life, which has resulted in my own pretty extreme mental health issues that this friend has helped me through, and I still struggle pretty deeply with them internally to this day though I don’t tend to show it on the surface anymore. I’m medicated and have a therapist to help me get by, without those things I’d be dead.

I say all this to highlight that I am myself on a journey of trying to deal with trauma and depression and trying every day to be a little happier and not fall off “the cliff”. Amidst this, my friend will regularly unload on me about how depressed they are and how terrible life is and how they’re going to die alone and no one wants to spend time with them. I listen and help to the best of my abilities, but although I would never tell them, it destroys my entire day mental health wise talking to them for hours on end, or watching them be rude and cold towards me or other people. I’ll start off the day ready to be positive and by midday I just want to crawl into a hole.

This friend is medicated and used to have a therapist but decided the therapy was too expensive and stopped going. I know her financial situation is comfortable, and although she may not want to spend that money, it is available to her. So basically, WIBTA for telling my friend that even if she has to cut back in other areas of life, she needs to find the money for a therapist because I’m just not mentally equipped to be hers?",0.03
"AITA for being sensitive? Hello Reddit. I came here to ask for a second opinion about something that has recently happened and I apologise if my english isn't good as it is my second language.

I (21F) am the middle child of 5 siblings. Today, my older sisters came over (28F) and (30F) as i live with my parents along with my younger siblings. The night was going well and we were all laughing as jokes were being passed around and sibling banter is usually the norm in our family. However, my sister, the 26 year old - we can call her leaf -  made a joke about my stutter which I am insecure about along with my voice and body as a whole. Reactively, I shut down and started to just look at my phone to avoid social contact. I was confronted with my sister after a bit and she asked me what was wrong.

This part was my fault here - and i became passive aggressive and asked her if she would apologise for making fun of my stutter. She bacame silent for a bit before saying no and then told me how this has happened before and told me she can't read my mind, which was true. For some reason, I started crying at being overwhelmed with emotions from these feelings from the past.

For some context, I have been confronted by leaf before for the same reason, last year. It was the first time I have been confronted about my sensitivity to things and i understood where this was coming from. I don't make fun of people appearance's, espicially my loved ones if i know they're insecure about it so I would get emotional when people wouldn't do the same for me.

It had been a while since that last confrontation happened and hadn't had emotional outbursts since then but leaf had brought up the fact that she was sick of this happening again and how I can't keep doing this. She told me that making fun of my teeth, face, body are things she wouldn't know unless i told her and i was told to say something now. I said nothing as It is a reflex for me to be quiet when i am upset and just said she just listed the things, including my voice. I left the room after I was excused and just cried on my bed for just being mad at myself.

After a few hours, I've had some time to think and I felt extremely guilty for ruining the mood. I feel as if i have regressed to when I was snarky and would make people feel as if they are walking eggshells around me. I feel so bad for my sister because she said if this were to happen again - she would never joke around me or anything anymore because she can't predict what I'll do.

Right now - I need advice. Please reddit, help me fix my relationship with my sister.

  
EDIT: I phrased one of my sentences wrong, sorry. I meant that she noted my stutter along with the other things she made fun of my before after she confronted me about it. She did not know my stutter was an insecurity until now. Also, I tease my siblings too, just never about physical appearances, rather I just annoy them by saying cringe stuff around them and tickle them. I felt as if i just phrased this entire story wrong because i dont really know how to say it properly. Apologies.",0.43

"AITA for Leaving My Career in Pediatric Oncology to Work at USPS and Use PSLF to Forgive My Loans? Hi Reddit,

I (34M) have found myself getting roasted by friends and family and I'm hoping to get some perspective from you all.

A bit of background: I spent over a decade training to become a pediatric oncologist. Between college (5 years), medical school (4 years), residency (3 years), and fellowship (2 years before I dropped out), I amassed a considerable amount of student loan debt, more than 500k. After years of intense training and emotional strain, I realized that the career wasn’t what I had envisioned for myself. The emotional toll, the long hours, and the constant stress were affecting my mental health and overall well-being.

I took a leave of absence from oncology fellowship program and spent the year in intensive therapy (including a partial hospitalization program) and really searching for meaning in my life. About two months ago, I made the difficult decision to leave the medical field entirely and took a job at the United States Postal Service (USPS). The job is stable, offers good benefits, and most importantly, it allows me to have a much better work-life balance. 

Here’s where things get complicated: I am enrolled in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program, which forgives the remaining balance on my student loans after 10 years of qualifying payments while working full-time for a qualifying employer, which USPS is. This means that in about 5 years, my substantial student loan debt will be forgiven.

When I shared my decision with my friends, they were furious. They feel that I am taking advantage of the taxpayers by having my loans forgiven while working a job that doesn’t utilize my medical training. They think I’m wasting my education and that I should have stuck it out in the medical field, despite the personal toll it was taking on me.

I understand their perspective, but I also believe that mental health and quality of life are paramount. I didn’t want to continue in a career that was making me miserable and potentially leading to burnout or worse. I don't see myself as ""mooching off taxpayers"". I'm taking advantage of a program that's literally designed for people who work in non-profit jobs. Working at USPS has given me the stability and peace of mind I desperately needed.

So, Reddit, AITA for leaving my career in pediatric oncology to work at USPS and using PSLF to forgive my loans?",0.43
"AITA for not returning a microwave I’m preparing for college and it’s expensive. My credit card is almost to the limit ($1,500) and one of those purchases includes a microwave. I saw one that I really liked and knew it would last a long time, even after college. The sign said $70, but it was actually $80 at the register. I still proceeded to check out because I was not explicitly told no. 

My mom later made a big deal on how I shouldn’t need a microwave that expensive and a 700 watt $50 one would be fine. The one I have is 1000 watt and can actually fit a plate. My dad insisted that I get a microwave I like and that I might as well keep it because it’ll be able to cook actual meals in it. I also believe he just wants to treat me because I’m his daughter and I’m going to a really nice college. My mom insists tho that i return it because we aren’t rich and she’s the one paying for it. I felt bad the next day and asked my dad to return it but he said no since we spend so much more money on other things. That is true, as my mom insisted that I buy other things such as shoes, clothes, etc that were probably up to $200 on the card. 

I’m afraid she’s going to get upset when she comes home to find the microwave and refuse to pay off the card, and I won’t be getting a job till after the payment is due. I also fear that she’ll refuse to help me move in and I’ll have to leave without saying goodbye. She hasn’t yelled at me or anything, which I think it’s because she saw me crying yesterday about how much money i had to spend (which at this point $30 sounds so trivial and i would give her cash just to make it up). But i know inside she is probably upset.

"AITA for being mad about a family playing music while camping I went camping this past weekend at a state park campsite.

The second night we were there, a huge family (4 adults, 6ish kids idk exactly how many) set up in the site right next to ours. They were constantly yelling to each other and the kids were running around and playing loudly. Not a huge deal, kind of annoying but in a totally reasonable way.

At some point (around 6/7pm or so) they started playing music. It started as reasonable volume country music but quickly became super loud house music. 

After about 10 or so mins of this I went over to them and asked them to turn it down. I was pretty polite about it, I’m not huge on conflict and I don’t like the idea of sleeping next to people who have it out for me. They turned it down for about 10 mins then it was back at the same volume as before, if not louder. I should also mention that these people were playing this on YouTube. With ads.

At this point I wanted to call the ranger but my boyfriend (who’s even more conflict averse than me) asked me not to, saying they would know it was us who called and it wasn’t quiet hours yet so they weren’t breaking any rules. I did talk (pretty loudly) about how annoying the music was and every time it would turn off (anytime the guy got a phone call) I would make a comment about how nice it was to not have music.

Around 8:30pm or so they turned on a song at the loudest volume yet and I (unintentionally, it really just slipped out) yelled “that is SO LOUD.” Around that time they shut the music off and the kids started going to bed.

The next morning, at around 9:30am they started playing music again.

I immediately turned to my boyfriend and said, “Oh my god, I have to say something. I can’t listen to that anymore. It is so rude!”

One of the women in the other campsite heard me and yelled back something along the lines of, “chill out, we’re just having fun! We’re camping!”

I said, “So are we!”

She said, “we’re hanging out having a good time, we don’t want to sit in silence.”

I laughed and said, “silence? It has NOT been silent.”

She didn’t say anything back to me and soon after they turned the music off. We left around 11am. 

I told this story to my friends expecting them to back me up and help me feel vindicated about how awful this family was, but a few of them started defending the family, saying they were on vacation and trying to hang out. I feel like I’m going crazy. I’m an avid camper and I’ve been to a LOT of campsites and I’ve never had an experience like this??",0.57
"AITA for accomplishing things without effort? AITA for having some natural skills and accomplish things without effort?

I am autistic/ADHD/High skilled and have always been able to do the things like to do without much effort. In college, I barely showed up in classes and yet I graduated summa cumme laude.

Recently, I was talking with an ex and she told me that she resented how I could accomplish things without an effort back in the day

We studied social sciences and communication. I spent much of the classes playing World of Warcraft and still was a straight A student. 

She, on the other hand, studied day and night and couldn’t get high grades, even though she is absolutely brilliant. 

 She told me that it was kind of asshole on my part to have little discipline or work ethic, with a clearly irresponsible attitude and still be able to get the dream internship that everyone wanted in my 2nd semester, that two months later turned into a full time job. 

I tend to believe that there’s some truth in what she says, even though I can’t understand why someone would resent other people just because they don’t grind themselves and still get the golds and confetti.

"AITA for posting a rant about my Manager on my Snapchat story  So I wrote on my Snapchat story about how my Manager reprimanded me for texting my bedridden mother, who has lupus, and how he and a another bartender did nothing while I and another bartender were forced to run everything for nearly two hours.
The only other people there on that day were the bartenders from the morning, so it was me, a
53-year-old woman, and my lead manager's best friend, who's a bartender there, as well as the head lead and then the other lead who came to replace him for the day.
Now, while I didn't mention anyone by name but it was pretty obvious who it was about and yeah I get it wasn't the most mature thing to do. But this head lead gets bitched about everyday by everyone else for being a hard ass the other lead today immediately start to complain about him and make fun of him after he left for her schedule.
When he asked to pull me away and talk again, I swear, I thought he was going to call me out for not being at the front again, so I thought I was texting a lot again or something. So, I like started to explain how I was trying to finish the Morning side-work since our second manager would be arriving soon. And he suddenly stopped dead in his tracks and went no cmon Nicole and started to ask me why he had to find out from someone showing him my story that I said he was reprimanding me when my mom was sick on my story instead of talking to him.
He just kept going on about how hard he tries to be nice and chill with me and how he didn't know my mom was sick, so it's not like he was trying to be a jerk, and if I had an issue with him, I should ve told him to his face.
I even apologized if he was offended when I told him that I wasn't talking trash and that it just was me venting about my manager, like most people do. I also acknowledged that I need listen to them about using my phone, whether I like it or not.
But he just kept babbling about how he's always so nice to me and how when I go behind his back instead of telling him to his face, he feels like I'm talking shit about him, and he tries so hard to be nice and chill to me that I owe it to tell him to his face when I have an issue with him. And then when I walked away, he waited for me to be out of sight, but he didn't see that ! had looped around to use the bathroom, and then I saw him bring his bestie and the other manager to the tap house at the same time, and clearly they were talking about the situation because he didn't even wait a full minute before calling them over.

"AITA for not picking up my former foster daughter in the middle of the night after she called for help? Two years ago my wife (37f) and I (39) decided to foster. We have 3 children and felt terrible that there were kids out in the world that needed a loving home.
 Our first two placements only lasted a few days. It was fine. But then we were place with “Olivia”(11)I won’t go into personal details but we were her 5th foster home since she was 9. My wife and I literally tried everything to help but she was rebellious. She ran away, broke things, stole things and lied. She lied so much it was insane. It was months and months of this. Just when we thought things were getting better she would ruin it. The 6th time she ran away we had enough. 
We asked to have her removed. She said “I knew you didn’t care! I knew you didn’t want me! You just wanted the money !” My wife and I lost it. We reminded her how we listened to her, took her places she wanted to go, and encouraged her. We told that we didn’t spend a dime of the foster care money instead we saved it for her so she could have money when she turned 18. We showed her the bank account with thousands of dollars in it and said that when she’s 18 she can still have it. 
I think, it was at that point she realized we cared but it was too late.
She went back into the system and not sure what happened. Life went on. We had another baby, we moved a few miles away. Last Saturday night my wife received a call from Olivia (now 13). She put in on speaker phone. Olivia apparently ran away from another foster home and had been living on the streets for days. Eventually she made it to our old neighborhood. I told her that we moved. She asked us if we could pick her up from a certain location. She asked if we could take her in. She was crying saying she loved the kids. She missed my wife’s cooking. She wants me to teach her how to play piano(I had started teaching her as a way to bond). I felt bad for her but taking her back was impossible. But we feared she would run away again. So we told her that we would be there. We called the police instead and they took her in. 
The police contacted us a few days later saying Olivia’s foster parents were pressing charges. She stole a few things. Also Olivia had a vape with drugs in it. We were told that she would probably go to juvenile detention until she’s 18(this is what we were told, unsure if it will happen). They asked if we wanted any updates and we declined. We also asked them not to have her contact us again. Today we were telling some friends about this. While some agreed with us a few called us monsters.
 One of our friends said “I would’ve scooped that baby up and kept her”. Legally there was nothing we could do.

"AITA for telling my parents I need a car?  I've (F18) just finished highschool and have my driver's license, and my dad said that he would get me a car for college, because I'm living with them and commuting. It's not going to be an expensive car, just something capable of taking me to school and work.
I haven't started college yet, but my parents said I need to start working, so I got a job, and am working 16 hours a week (so that I can continue the same shifts when college starts) but even before applying, I expressed that I don't think it's a good idea to start working when I have no car, as there's not many places to apply within walking distance, and the job I ended up getting is a one and a half hour walk from my house. My mom told me that she'll be happy to drive me to work until school starts back, and they both said I'd have a car before college. So I started working. 
Now I'm working with no car, and have to rely on my mom taking me when she wants to, and using Lyft when she can't take me, which costs nearly 2 hours of my pay for one ride. The other issue is that now my parents are saying they don't think they'll find a car by the time I start college.
They keep telling me to use public transport, which I can't do. There's both trains and buses in my area, but I still would have to do quite a bit of walking in order to get to them, and I've just had a surgery, so I really can't walk very much, and I also get really bad digestion cramps if I walk after eating, so even when I'm fully healed from the surgery, I won't be able to eat before going to work, and my shifts start at 1pm or 5pm, depending on the days.
For anyone wondering why I'm relying on my parents to get me a car, it's because my dad wants to get me one. If I buy one myself then he'll have less control over it, and he really likes control. He doesn't want me to have my own car, he wants me to be able to use ""a car that he owns, that I can borrow, but only for work and school"", so that I don't have my own car to do what I want with. 
I told my mom that I really need a car because of all the reasons above, and she said that I'm entitled and don't deserve anything. Am I in the wrong? 

TLDR: My parents said they'd get me a car to get to work and school, and now aren't doing so, and call me entitled and selfish when I try to speed up the process. ",0.22

And I understand that some people would jump at the opportunity, to do something like that, it's just  not something I want to do, he says that i have a shity mentality and a really spoiled mindset if  I can just turn down an opportunity to make money like that, and that your going to be an adult soon, you need to make money.

"WIBTA for telling my son to wear NOT his favourite jacket anymore because it ""looks gay""? I’m a single dad to my son, Oliver 10M. He’s with me most of the time, and sees his mum every other weekend. He’s an awesome kid, creative, full of energy, and he’s got his own sense of style that’s pretty unique. He loves bright colours, nail polish, and clothes that some people might think are more “girly.” 

If I’m honest, I think Oliver might be gay, and I’m totally cool with that. I’ve always made it clear that whoever he turns out to be, I’ll support him 100%. 

Because of how he dresses and acts, Oliver’s had a really tough time with other kids. He got bullied so badly at his old school that I ended up pulling him out and homeschooling him. The school wasn’t helpful at all, and it was heartbreaking to see him go through that. He’s struggled to make friends, and it kills me to see him feel so alone. 

Now, he’s starting back at school in September, and he’s really excited about it. But recently, we were at a cousin’s birthday party, and Oliver wore his favourite jacket which is a bright pink, sparkly one that he loves. Some of the other kids started picking on him, saying he “looked gay.” I stepped in, got the kids to apologise, but it ruined the day for Oliver. I’m worried about how things will go when he’s back at school.

I’ve been thinking about whether I should talk to Oliver about maybe toning it down a bit, especially when he’s around new people. Not because I want him to change who he is, but because I hate seeing him get hurt and feel like an outcast. I don’t want him to feel like he has to hide who he is, but I also don’t want him to be picked on or excluded because of it.

But then, I feel like a complete arsehole for even thinking about this. I don’t want him to think that I’m ashamed of him or that he has to conform to be accepted. I want him to feel free to be himself, but I’m also scared of him being hurt by others who don’t get it.

So, WIBTA if I talked to Oliver about maybe being a bit more low-key with his style?",0.57
"AITA for telling my mum I hated her? I am 17nb and my mum is 51f.

This happened a few hours ago so sorry if this is a mess or hard to read.

About five hours ago I dislocated my knee. This is the second time that has happened and after the first time I was advised by paramedics to exercise my knee to strengthen the muscles. I twisted wrong when i was lying on my bed and I couldn't reach my phone and I was in pain so I was screaming. My parents came in and when they realised what happened my dad tried to help while my mum told me off for not exercising my knee properly. I said something like ""can you please not do this right now"" and I heard my sister tell her to stop as well so she left. While she was on hold on the nhs helpline downstairs and my sister was trying to call my grandmother (retired nurse) I heard my mum tell my sister that I had ruined her day. I didn't know until later that she had been supposed to go out tonight but wasn't anymore because of this. At some point later (honestly the whole 40ish minutes is kind of blurry and hard to remember because I was in so much pain and barely coherent) I started screaming again when my knee kind of seized up and it was really painful. My mum came back upstairs and told me to stop that ""awful screeching noise"" and basically said this was my fault for not exercising me knee enough (I have been in autistic burnout and recently lost my best friend so apart from school I haven't really been leaving the house). I was in a lot of pain at this point and still really upset from an argument we had earlier so I told her to shut up and that I hated her right now. My grandmother helped fix my knee and I hadn't spoken to her since then until about an hour ago. I asked her about a doctors appointment unrelated to the dislocation and she got mad because she'd have to drive me which meant she couldn't go out tomorrow.

"AITA for eating a small yoghurt pot when I said I was too stuffed for a whole meal? AITA? I had a large meal out and so I was full but on the way home I asked my family member since I was too full to eat dinner (a whole meal), can I have a yoghurt instead, and she said yes. I got home, my family member and my two other family members had their dinner (again, a whole meal) and I went into the kitchen and got the yoghurt and ate it.

The family member I asked for the yogurts sister said I was a liar and should not have had the yoghurt if I was actually stuffed.

"AITA for telling my mum it is pathetic how she clearly favors my sister over me? So last year it was my older sister's graduation. I wanted to go with her and my mum and brother to celebrate, my sister said no clearly because I am too embarrassing. She didn't say so directly but I know what she's like. I was drinking a cup of tea and she came in asking me to help her get ready. I didn't - I know I messed up here. I should have just helped I know. My mum was helping her, I thought it was fine. She turned on me with a vicious face, tongue out and stuck her middle finger up at me. She said ""I'll remember this."" I was so upset and was crying. She had caused huge drama the night before, with her attitude and the upset she had caused I was in no mood to help her. My mum asked what was wrong, she lied essentially so she would not get in trouble.

Once they left to get the train to the ceremony I was so hysterically upset that I took to the family Whatsapp and dropped a message before I left the group chat. I said ""Well I'll remember how she broke my computer and lied about it and never apologized and when she threw broccoli all over me last year and lied and never apologized."" I was very upset and left the family chat. 

Once I'd calmed down I started asking a few weeks later if my mum the admin would put me back on the chat. She said ""Well you left it."" Never put me back on. I've kept asking since and she won't once put me on. Essentially the attitude is I made my bed and can sleep in it. She keeps saying ""Well you left it."" I keep telling her I was upset and acted in the heat of the moment, which is what happened. She won't put me back on it just to prove a point. I know I overreacted, I was very upset and acted in a moment. 

I recently told her how it is pathetic how she clearly favors sister over me. At least try to hide the favortism. She treated me like dirt that morning, lied about it and she will still side with her. She did not care how rude my sister was to me and is the reason she keeps treating me like dirt.

"AITA for not going to my best friend’s bday party because she invited my narcissistic ex-friend  my(26f) friend sarah(25f) always hosts her bday party at her apartment. at her party last year, she invited my toxic ex-best friend jenna(26f).it became clear to me that jenna is a narcissist and i just couldn’t see past it anymore. it was awkward to be at the party with her. it’s an intimate space and everyone can see everyone.where she was standing was blocking the bathroom, drinks, and snacks, so i stayed closer to the front door. i kept catching jenna looking over at me. sarah was nowhere to be found, as she’s usually overwhelmed with the amount of people she invites and is too chaotic to socialize with anyone. i wasn’t enjoying myself and i was uncomfortable being in such a tight space with jenna,so i found sarah and said bye. i could tell it bummed her out a bit since we hadn’t spent more much time together,but there were many other people there and i knew she would be fine.

for v-day this year sarah threw another house party. when she told me about it,i politely brought up that i would not go if jenna was invited. sarah started seeing jenna’s toxicity,but sarah is a people pleaser and felt like she had to invite jenna out of fear of her seeing photos on social media after. i said i didn’t mind if she invited jenna but,to respect my own boundaries,i would sit that party out. it’s the day before and sarah tells me she had an internal conflict about inviting jenna,emphasizing posting photos. sarah didn’t end up inviting jenna and it was a good party.

now it’s time for sarah’s bday this year and it’s at her house again. i went to rsvp to the evite and i saw that jenna had responded going. this caught me off guard. the last time sarah and i spoke about jenna,we agreed that she was bad vibes. however, i was scrolling around on IG and i saw a photo jenna posted a few weeks earlier with a caption indicating sarah had taken the photo. this really hurt me. sarah hadn’t mentioned hanging out with jenna at all. it felt suspicious that sarah was keeping it from me, like she withheld it on purpose. i knew i didn’t want to put myself through last year’s party situation again, given that it will have been a year since i saw jenna in person. i rsvp’d yes because sarah texted me about the invite and i didn’t want to disappoint her. as it gets closer, i can’t help but get more nervous. i really don’t want to go, but i know it would hurt sarah’s feelings. however, it hurts my feelings that my bff of 9 years doesn’t care about my boundaries and invites jenna to her party out of fear of jenna’s feelings. in her need to people please everybody else, it makes me sad that she isn’t even upfront with me about this. it makes me wonder if she was even going to give me a heads up that jenna will be there. i want to support sarah, but i’ve done a lot of personal growth since breaking off my friendship with jenna and i just can’t subject myself to being around her anymore.

"AITA for visiting fun places/doing fun things with my mother, leaving my dog home alone. I just want to start by saying english is my first language, and I'm writing this on a computer. So if I spell anything wrong you can call me dumb.

My mom (46F) as part of where she works gets 2 weeks off in the summer per year, however there was a slight problem this year with schedueling and due to that she only got 1 week during the summer. We don't usually do much in the way of vacations or things like that, and apprently that's been bothering my mom for quite some time. So she told me that this week we can do whatever I want within reason, and for the past few days I (17M) and my mother have been going to various places and doing fun things. Yesterday we went to the zoo with my older brother (30M), his gf (32F), and their kids (3yoF and 5months M). Today we went for a tour of the college that I'm hoping to attend when I graduate from Highschool. We also have plans to visit an arcade/bowling alley place tomorrow, and see the Deadpool & Wolverine movie on Wednesday, and either visit a museum or go the beach on Thursday.

This has made my dad (49M) extremely angry, as we have an energetic 3 1/2 year old Black Lab and of course we can't take her with us to these places, meaning she has to stay home. This means that when he gets back home from work she hasn't been out much, and so he has to entertain her/wear her out.

"AITA for asking my friend to pay up? i (17f) used to make digital art as a hobby but recently turned it into a part-time career after i started getting commissioned pieces. one of my friends (18m) has his own podcast and asked me to draw a thumbnail for his youtube channel. he needed it on very short notice—in literally less than 12 hours. since the artwork was complex and the deadline was so tight, i told him that i'd have to charge him for it. he initially told me that he couldn’t give me the money but when i told him making a thumbnail at such notice would require me to put in extra effort and it's only fair that i be reimbursed for it, he said ""fair enough."" this is where i might have been wrong. i assumed that meant he agreed to pay.

i started working on the artwork, but since it was pretty complex, I couldn’t finish it in time. he asked me to send a high-res version of what i had done so far. i sent it to him and he used the incomplete artwork as his thumbnail for the time being. 

later, while i was finishing the rest of the artwork, i was on a call with him. i jokingly said- ""bro don’t cheat me. don't chicken out when it comes to the payment.” that's when he dropped the bombshell. he told me that he never committed to paying me and thought i was doing it as a favor. i was shocked and asked him why he couldn’t pay me 18 dollars—which is already a really small amount compared to what i should be charging (i'm still a beginner and i didn't want to charge my friend a big amount). in our country, it’s pretty normal for people our age to take money from their parents up until the time we graduate and get ourselves a job. he told me that his mom is not his investor and so he couldn't ask her to pay for this. this left me completely baffled because it's not something you hear often, or at all, in our country. to make matters worse, he then tried to bargain and offered 10 dollars instead. it was so unbelievable of him to bargain after everything we’d discussed, so i just hung up. 

suddenly i realised that i couldn't let him use my work for free and asked him to remove the thumbnail from his video. i got worried that i had been duped so i texted him multiple times to either pay up or remove the thumbnail. at this point, he just went off on his own tangent- telling me that i had questioned his integrity and that he tried to save our friendship but i kept blaming and misunderstanding him. 

he had agreed to pay the full amount initially but then went back on his word as soon as we got on call. at this point, i was too tired and angry so i just told him to take the thumbnail down which he eventually did. now he's saying that he’ll buy the completed artwork when his startup’s first event happens so that my work doesn’t go to waste. all of this has left a bad taste in my mouth. i believe i handled the entire thing rather gracefully without being rude to him but i don't think i can continue to be friends with him.

"AITA for telling (23F) my bf (25M) that he shouldn’t get a motorcycle in Florida?  
My boyfriend and I live together in Florida and he randomly decided that he wants to get a motorcycle because of the thrill of it. I agree, they’re nice to look at and seem super fun to ride. But I’m also a nurse, and I’ve heard of how dangerous they can be and how ER workers call them organ cycles. I’ve read that Florida is one of the most dangerous states to own a motorcycle and the city that we live in is listed as one of the top five most dangerous cities on multiple websites. 

I know that I may be in the wrong because it’s something he wants. However, he never grew up with one, it’s not something tied to his soul. The police department in our city even released something saying that motorcycle riders have been passing away every other week in our city and I’ve seen dozens of comments on Reddit explaining how people have been riding for years and won’t ride in Florida because of how dangerous it felt when they did. I’ve tried explaining my point of view, and ask him to at least reconsider once we move out of Florida. 

He keeps shutting me down and tells me to leave him alone when I try to calmly express my concern for his safety. It’s been really stressing me out because I don’t want to have to constantly live in fear because my boyfriend wants to buy a motorcycle in one of the most dangerous places for them. He’s never driven one, has only had his driver’s licenses for 1 1/2 years, and he has anger problems. That’s also a big concern for me. When he misses a turn, there are times when he will yell and it’s kinda scary. He always goes fast around curves and even my mom noticed that his driving was a tad reckless when she rode with us and told me I should talk to him about his car driving. 

Now he’s yelling at me and telling me that I always won’t let him do anything in life, when I never say anything about anything he does except this. I got so stressed and started crying because I didn’t know how else to think to cope with it when he kept shutting me down, and he just started laughing. He never takes advice from me, but seems to constantly listen to other people. My biggest concern is his safety and I just have a really bad feeling about him getting on the road, especially in a state as dangerous as Florida.

AITAH because I need time to adjust after having my son Backstory: me and my ex were trying for a baby since last year. I’ve known him since I was 12. I lost our first child last year and found out I was pregnant in march of this year. He was “excited” from what he said. We were talking about moving in and parenting. This pregnancy has been scary due to my doctors thinking the baby had a chromosome abnormality. Did amniocentesis and blood work on both of us and found out the baby got an inversion from his father. Not even three weeks ago I found out he was living a whole double life when a woman texted me from his phone saying congratulations better you than me. He refused to answer my calls or texts which made him seem more guilty. When I finally did hear from him he still continued to lie and say he lost his Apple Watch and someone was texting people from it. I know it’s a lie because he had a pin on it. Instead of him just coming forward with the truth he continued to blame me and said he just wants to coparent now. After him finally deciding to respond me I let him know I can’t be around him anytime soon because I need to be able to heal and move on with my life. I am already six months pregnant. I told him I will need time after the baby is born to adjust to it just being me and the baby. Mind you I have bought everything for the baby and he hasn’t gotten one thing.

"AITA for passing in a legal passing zone? Driving down a 55 mph two-lane highway, a silver chevy truck pulls out in front of me from a side street.

"AITA for getting my partner a cologne another male coworker wears? Hi everyone, 

I was in a long-term relationship with my significant other for 11 years, and we've been having some major issues (this is one of the main instances) stemming from a Christmas gift I got him a few years ago. This situation has been a significant point of conflict for us, and it ultimately contributed to our breakup.

One Christmas, I wanted to get my SO a nice cologne. After noticing how good a scent smelled on one of my male coworkers (who is also a friend), I asked him what cologne he wore because I really liked it. My partner is really into colognes and  I thought it would make a great gift for my SO I bought it. 

However, when my SO found out later on that I chose that particular cologne because a coworker wore it, he completely flipped out. He accused me of cheating and became convinced that I was somehow attached to this coworker because of the cologne choice.

Fast forward to now, the tension over this gift has lingered and contributed to our constant fights, ultimately leading to our breakup. I’m not joking I feel like I’m going insane. This argument has been going on for a few years now and it was just brought up to me today again! I had to move across the country because he’s unrelenting! I’m starting to doubt myself and I could really use some insight.

So, AITA for getting him a cologne simply because I liked the way it smelled, even if it was a scent worn by another guy? Thanks in advance!

"AITA for wanting my wife to quit her habit after quoting mine? I (40M) recently quit drinking energy drinks because my wife (38F) said how bad they are for you and that I have also suffered previously from Kidney stones. I don’t get them all the time mind you, but I have had them twice in my life and the last bout about 8 months ago was brutal. 

I didn’t like how she came at me when arguing about it, but upon some reflection I conceded because she is 100% correct and I really don’t have a good argument other than I really enjoyed how they taste. I decided to stop drinking them and have gone 2 weeks so far without any and plan on abstaining from drinking them anymore.

I ended up quitting energy drinks the same time she went on a trip for about a week. During that time, I decided that she should also quit her habit of Vaping as well, since that is also very bad for your health IMO, not to mention that it costs much more than me drinking one energy drink per day.

She previously was a Smoker and a few years ago transitioned to Vaping. I wished then that she quit cold turkey, but much preferred Vaping to Smoking, so I was content. She was a smoker for years before I met her and I have accepted it; especially since we have had several arguments in the past about how she should quit and it never ends well. She always gets angry immediately and shuts down and is unwilling to talk and if I press, she becomes irate.

So when she got back from her week long trip, I brought it up to here that I stopped drinking energy drinks and that I think she should quit too, using the same arguments she used against me. It of course went exactly the same way that the previous requests went, which is nowhere and again she shut down and would not talk about it at all.

I think that I am valid and it is a comparable request, but since she doesn’t think so and how unwilling she is to have a conversation, I am rethinking my position.

One day at the end of the school day, I was walking home and I checked my phone for the first time since school began. When I first unlocked it, messages came flooding in from my cousin.
At first, she was asking me if I could organize her gender reveal party, since I had done it once before for my other cousin and everything was really nice and had went really well. However, after
 that she started getting annoyed since I wasn’t replying to her, and she said that if I couldn’t do it then I should just say so and not “ghost her”.
I told her that the reason I did not reply was since I was at school, and I also said that the date she chose was really not proper for me since it was  during the time of my final exams, however that was really not the case, I just didn’t want to do it for her since she’s never been nice to me and has just been a pain in the ass in general. There are many things she’s done, yet I don’t want to get into the history of anything.

"AITA for calling my aunt a selfish and rude bitch? My(19M) grandma just passed away last month. It was really rough on our entire family and our entire world came crashing down. She had dementia but was expected to live another
2-4 years. Her death was an accident, most likely an aneurysm, and was quick.

Unfortunately her and my grandfather live about 4 states away from where I do, so my parents rushed out to be with my grandfather during this time. The day after she passed away they arrive and we start making arrangements for her funeral.

As we're checking dates with our family and making sure her funeral and wake won't conflict with birthdays, my aunt texts my mom.
Reminder, this is **the day after my grandmother passed away**. She texts my mom

""I'm just making sure you know that the funeral and wake cannot be September 8-20, I have a trip to Hawaii planned. Also, what are we doing with mom's rings?""

This fucking woman, **THE DAY AFTER HER MOM DIED** wanted to make sure we knew she had a trip to Hawaii and wanted to know what we were doing with my grandmothers extensive collection of jewelry.

"AITA for waking up at 2 PM?  I’m 19m, and I’m currently living at home and about to start my second year of community college. The reason I’m going to community college is due to a health issue I had my first two years of high school, I wasn’t able to get good grades. This led to me not being able to get into any of the colleges I wanted, so I decided to go to community college, get good grades, and transfer after two years.

So far it’s been going great, I have a 4.0 and have done some extracurricular activities that look good on a resume. Last year, and this year, I signed up for all asynchronous online classes, meaning the professor just posts lectures and gives a deadline and you can turn stuff in at any point before the deadline, instead of having to go to regular lectures. 

I chose this because I like the flexibility of not having to attend lectures every day. Instead I just choose one or two days per month to work weeks or months advance and spend the rest of the time that I’m not working on extracurricular stuff on hanging out with friends, working out, going to parties, watching shows, whatever. 

This often leads me to staying up really late and waking up at 1-2 PM. My parents say this is unacceptable and I need to become more ‘disciplined’, meaning sleeping early and waking up early.

Fast forward a couple months to the day of the concert. I spent the whole morning getting ready, doing hair, makeup etc. He texts me an hour before we’re supposed to leave saying he wasn’t feeling well and didn’t think we could go. I was disappointed, of course, but understood that wasn’t something he could help. He still wanted to hangout that evening though, and seemed completely fine.

He told me he owed me for the tickets and that he would pay me back for both. I appreciated it but wouldn’t have expected him to cover both. He never paid me back but I didn’t want to bug him about it, especially when we were together. 

We broke up a month ago for unrelated reasons and said we were open to staying friends. Long story short, when we did get in touch we ended up arguing and ended things on not the best terms. In the last message I sent him, I mentioned that he never paid me back for the tickets and would appreciate if he would send me his half.

He didn’t respond, so a couple days later I sent an e-transfer request. He then messaged me on instagram saying that he didn’t owe me money and to stop messaging him. I didn’t want to push it and just said, “You’re the one who offered to pay the whole thing and I’m only asking for half. Plus, you’re the reason we didn’t go but whatever.” And left it at that.

I understand that I willingly spent the money, but he’s the one who bailed and offered to pay me back in the first place.

"AITA for telling my younger sister that there would be consequences for disrespecting me? I (21M) have a younger sister (9F) who looks up to our stepmom, with whom I don't have the best relationship. My stepmom sometimes takes little jabs at me, and I’ve noticed my sister mimicking this behavior, which hurts my feelings. I understand that kids are impressionable, so I try to guide my sister in a positive direction. However, she often responds with comments like ""You’re not the boss here"" and ""Your opinion doesn’t matter.""

One day, after another instance of disrespect, I told her that if she continued this behavior, there would be consequences, like losing her video game privileges or writing an apology letter. My stepmom was very upset and said I had no right to discipline my sister, claiming I don’t take care of her. This hurt because I often babysit and help out with her, even when it’s inconvenient for me.

Our relationship has been strained because of how my stepmom treated me growing up, and I worry that this dynamic is affecting how my sister and I interact. I genuinely want to be a good older brother, but I feel like I'm constantly criticized and blamed for things that aren’t entirely my fault.

"AITA for forgetting my husband’s (of 26 years) 50th birthday? I have been really busy at work lately and completely  forgot my husbands birthday. We went out to a lite dinner a few days before his birthday because I was going to have to work on the actual day. When his birthday came around a few days later I completely forgot. I got up in the morning, got ready for work and went in without telling him happy birthday. I didn’t realize that I had forgotten until I got home that evening and he was on the phone with his friend. I asked who he was talking to and why and he said his friend just called to wish him a happy birthday. 
I instantly wished him a happy birthday and apologized for forgetting telling him I have just been so busy at work. He said it was fine and that he didn’t care. We really haven’t spoken about it again but he has been a little distant. AITA for forgetting or is it understandable since I’m so busy at work ( I am the sole bread winner as he was laid off) and we did go out to celebrate (kinda of) a few days prior when we went out to dinner (his choice)?",0.96
"AITA for giving my friend a chance to be better and confronting another friend on using nazi symbols? So for context, I've been part of a pretty small but tightly nit group of friends on discord for half a year. One of the people in our discord server (I'll call him R from now on) has had some behavioural issues in the past. He's 14 and in the past he has said offensive jokes and slurs. He was basically the stereotypical ""offensive = funny"" teenager. We've dealt with his behaviour and have helped him work on himself over the time we've known him. He's made good progress and is doing much better currently.

I have this other friend (I'll call him D from now on) who I only briefly knew. I assumed that he was a nice, but something about him felt off, especially since he's 22. I bonded with him and sent him a invite to our discord. At the time before D joined, R was still having behavioural issues. We were going through a rough patch with him and were trying to deal with his issues. We wanted to approach the situation in the best possible way, and a lot of us have social anxiety disorder, which makes confrontation extremely difficult.

As soon as D joined, we started having problems. We privately mentioned the issues we were having with R to D, especially in regards to his username, which coupled with his behaviour had bad implications. When we told D, he pinged everyone and started to harass R to change his name. A fight broke out, D started saying unhinged things while R started using slurs and saying awful things. We broke up the fight, and me and some members of the server went into a vc for 2 to 3 hours to discuss the situation and how to best deal with it. D kept trying to get us to kick R but we told him that we wanted to give R a chance to be better.

We confronted R with a short message telling him how his behaviour was wrong and how it affected everyone. R was quiet for a few days but started talking again, and showed immediate improvement. We kept working with him and he kept improving, and it seemed like the issue was resolved. We didn't change his username because of his progress, we neglected doing so.

A few months later, D publicly mentions changing R's username in the discord, and we then change it. He texts me about the name and I tell him that I'm stressed and don't know what to say. He then changes his discord username to have nazi swastikas and starts posting racist memes in my dms and asking me if I was okay with changing his name. I confronted him about the symbols and tried to explain why what he was doing was wrong. He defended his actions by claiming that his aunt was jewish, saying he was trying to make a point, and started downplaying the power of the swastika and the atrocities associated with it and those who wear it. He claimed that we were defending R's actions and accused us of attacking him and believing that the ""swastika is worse than racism"" by confronting him, and claimed we were racist because we didn't deal with everything fast enough.

"AITA for asking my friend to lend me money behind my girls friends back?  For context I 27M have a friend 30F that I’ve known for about 4 years. My girlfriend 24F and I have been dating for 2-3 years on and off. 

Before me and my girlfriend were together me and my friend were pretty close. We hung out quite a bit, she helped me get a job at her company and I’ve always looked up to her as a sort of mentor. She is very sable and successful. We have never been romantic.

We girlfriend met her once when we first started dating and got extremely insecure about our relationship. When we went out she felt I showed my friend more attention. She pretty much told me I had to cut my friend off and I did. I stopped saying yes to hanging out, didn’t text as frequently. She kinda took the hint and got upset and said she didn’t want me as a part of her life at all if I wasn’t allowed to hang out with her.

Now the thing is we work together and sit by eachother so we still had to interact a bit. At one point my girlfriend and I broke up and we got close again. Not ever hanging out outside of work or even getting lunch but having conversations and shed give me advice on things I needed help with.

Recently I got in a really bad accident that caused a lot of money problems for me. Honestly I was embarrassed to ask my family for help and my girlfriend is just finishing college so I know she doesn’t have the type of money I needed. 

I knew my friend would lend me the money no questions asked and not judge me at all so I went to her and I was write she sent the money and we didn’t even talk about the reason.

Well my girlfriend noticed the transactions through Venmo history and blew up. Saying that I was inappropriate and me and my friend have feeling for eachother. She then went through my friend and Is text history and found a message from a year ago where I told my friend that even though we are so distant and not really friends anymore I feel the universe connected us in this weird way. She said I’m an AH and have feeling for my friend. I don’t and I didn’t tell her because I knew she’s blow up about it.

I’ve done everything she asked and pretty much made the relationship with my friend nonexistent. I hadn’t even texted her in over a year before asking for the money. So AITA? ",0.93

"WIBTA for inviting my father to my graduation over my mother I am graduating with a Second Class Second Division in Physics this winter, much to my disappointment. My mother's constant interference during my final year caused this outcome.

Background: My parents separated before my final year due to ongoing arguments. My mother is extremely religious, almost cult-like, while my father is agnostic. The separation happened before the summer, and I was aiming for at least a 2.1. However, my mother wasted my evenings, emotionally manipulating me into prayer groups, causing my grades to drop from \~67-70% to just above 50%. My father couldn’t help as he was living with his mother.

My winter exams were right after Christmas, and I tried to avoid going home, but my mother insisted. I was panicking to pass these exams due to the time she wasted. Most of my classmates were grateful for my predictions, but my revision plan fell apart, and I ended up scraping by. My grandmother tried talking to my mother, which helped a bit, but it was too late as summer exams were around the corner. Unlike the winter exams, summer exams covered the whole year, making me anxious about my performance. I attended every lecture, but my mother kept dragging me home early for prayers, wasting my time.

My father eventually got his own apartment and let me use his office. He apologized for everything, and I forgave him, as some of my siblings had tried to ""run away"" before the separation.

While I did get a 2.2, it cost me three master’s programs, two PhD opportunities, five post-docs, and over seven job offers. I had experience through internships, including work with a Medical Devices research group abroad. I was motivated to study smarter, but my mother’s interference held me back. Since getting the 2.2, I’ve faced rejection after rejection. My mother, however, continues to tell me that ""she prayed for me to get these results,"" which sickens me. I was awarded for my work placement efforts and invited my father, not my mother, to the ceremony as I was frustrated with how she treated me.

I received an offer for an MSc in Medical Physics, but it wasn’t at the college where my professors wrote recommendations, making me feel like I let them down. I plan to invite only my father to my graduation, as I’m still upset with my mother for wasting my study time and costing me potential opportunities. My father went through a lot to get my grant approved and supported me through my limbo phase after the results. I don’t think my mother deserves to see me graduate, as she’ll believe her prayers helped, oblivious to the cost of her actions. I could have been in a research group or doing a PhD by now.",0.84
"WIBTA for not going to my own engagement party? Feeling conflicted, but also want to protect my mental health. I told my fiancé I will no longer join him at a family bbq/engagement party hosted by his parents. I’m refusing to go because a few days ago James’ brother Dan (23M) decided to propose to his then-girlfriend of less than a year. He was fully aware of the party for us (not intended to be a joint one) and I know he will make the whole party about himself. This feels quite intentional considering his actions over the past few months.

To elaborate, this is Dan’s first “adult” relationship. I get how it goes and how you can go overboard, but his actions are becoming too much, with no regard for others. Barely a month in, Dan was talking about wanting to marry this girl (at least at the time he had said he would give it a year before proposing). He has since continually moved up his timeline closer and closer to ours. In fact, my fiancé’s parents were worried Dan was going to propose before or immediately after James proposed to me. 

His actions have gotten more and more inconsiderate. They’ve gotten so bad that at one point he caused me to have a panic attack, which I haven’t had in years. It seems like he can’t stand it if he’s not the center of attention. For example, when James and I got engaged, he told his friends the news in a group chat that his brother is also in. While everyone was congratulating him and talking about bachelor party ideas, his brother had to make it about himself. Flipping the conversation, he told them he was getting engaged soon and they should do a joint party – he did not talk to James about this beforehand. He has continued to make everything about himself (“conversations” with him are difficult to say the least). He only seems to interact with his family when it’s advantageous for him. No one knew when Dan was going to propose until a day or two before – and he did it while his family was on a vacation that he skipped, which was supposed to be their last vacation as a family of four. 

My fiancé has suggested that he could talk to his parents and have them remind Dan that the party is about us. Considering he has heeded all of their advice and gone back on promises to them, I highly doubt he will listen. Not to mention Dan’s engagement is all over social media so it’s not like their extended family doesn’t know about it. I’m not going to ask for Dan not to attend the party, it’s his family too. So with that, I decided I wanted to remove myself from an unhealthy situation and bow out of the party. I know I need to set boundaries, but I also don’t want to hurt my fiancé or future in-laws. Family is very important to us.

Would I be the asshole for skipping the party?",0.64
"AITA that my mom got me a shirt that I wouldn’t wear?  It removed my last post. Anyways:

-Parents are in Samoa/ Fiji
-They bring us gifts from all the countries they’ve visited and rub in our face about how good the country was
-They get my siblings everything the want but not me, which I’m glad so I can make my own money
-I’m Male 18yrs 
-Mom asks me on FaceTime what shirt I want. I tell her because it will match my closet and also is professional enough I could wear it to my sales job. I also remind her over text as well, no way she could’ve missed it. 
-She tells me she’s getting me a completely different shirt. 
-I tell her wanted the black one because of my job. -She wanted to get me a bright pink one, very nonprofessional and doesn’t match my wardrobe at all. She gets me the pink one. 
-I tell her I can’t wear it. Because I can’t. I have to look professional. She said I’m always ungrateful and have a “stick up my butt”
-I am the most grateful of the kids. I’m the second oldest of 4. They get everything. They complain. I get socks, I’m happy. They forgot 2 out of my 3 most recent birthdays. My mom was missing for the 3rd birthday. So my last 3 birthdays have been…. interesting. They tell me to suck it up. I do because I’m a man. 
-They’ve kicked me out because I was watching a puppy for a few days… lol 
-When I went to the mental hospital they were more upset that I crashed their car vs the reason I crashed it. (Intentionally)

"AITA for not picking up my inebriated roommate? So, my roommate and I, both naval officers currently (23M) in school, were gearing up for a big event on Friday. My girlfriend needed to be at the schoolhouse by 3:00 PM, but I had to be there earlier, at noon. Since my girlfriend and I share one car, I brought her along, knowing she had some errands to run while I was in class.

When we arrived, I discovered a nail in my tire—great timing, right? I asked my roommate if he’d be okay with letting my girlfriend borrow his car for a couple of hours so she could get her errands done. Without hesitation, he agreed. Problem solved, or so I thought.

Later that evening, our class went out to celebrate around 8:30. My girlfriend and I drove our now-fixed car to the event, and my roommate drove his. At some point during the night, my roommate asked if we’d want to split an Uber with him to get home. We planned on leaving around 10:00 PM, so we asked if he wanted to come with us then. He declined, saying the night was just getting started for him, but he did ask if I could pick him up later because Ubers were ridiculously expensive—about $70.

Here’s where things got sticky. I was tired and knew  I wouldn’t want to be driving around later, so I told him I wouldn’t be able to pick him up. The look he gave me was like I’d just blindsided —he just said, “Umm, okayy,” but I could tell he was upset.

He did end up getting an uber at 12 AM

In my mind, if he was choosing to stay out, it was his responsibility to find his way back, but clearly, he didn’t see it the same way. He’s been distant since, and I can’t shake the feeling that I might’ve been the jerk in this situation.

So, was I wrong here?",0.13
"AITA for sleeping on my partner’s side of the bed? For the past several days, I (25F) have only been getting 5 hours of sleep at best and 3 at worst. My BF (28M) knows that I’ve been tired but regardless I’ve been trying my best to hang out with him because I’ll be flying out soon.

Well last night, I thought we were going to bed (we were cleaning up the plates and dishes, stopped binging the show we were watching, etc). So I went and brushed my teeth, then relaxed in bed, note he hasn’t done any of that yet.

Since I was tired, I kind of just passed out in bed. From what I remember, I was on my side of the bed.

Then this morning, I got woken up earlier than usual because of his snoring. I was slightly annoyed because I have trouble sleeping in general so falling back asleep was a hassle. But I didn’t wake him up or anything, I just moved to the couch to try sleep there.

Well, my efforts failed and I stayed up for 6 hours more hours. At this point I just gave up and went back to the bedroom to lay down with my BF. I was clearly not happy but I told him it was cause I got woken up by him. I assured him that it wasn’t his fault or anything.

He started telling me that apparently he had woken me up last night as I was sleeping on his side of the bed. Which then I responded by complaining and grumbling. I rolled over to my side of the bed then he went to brush his teeth to join me in bed.

Then he had to turn the ceiling fan on, but accidentally turned on the lights too. That apparently also woke me and I grumbled at him. At that point he was upset, and then left the room for a while only to come back and see me on the middle of the bed.

At this point he is frustrated but didn’t want to wake me which would’ve made him even angrier and then just scooted into an available area on his side of the bed. He said he went into bed very annoyed with me, mostly about the fact I was sleeping on his side of the bed.

I responded saying that I don’t think it mattered that much which side of the bed he was sleeping on, he probably should’ve just left me sleep in his spot and then get into mine instead.

He then went on about how now I’m gonna complain and blame him for not getting good sleep. I told him I literally haven’t done that and wasn’t going to cause I don’t remember.

Then repeatedly he started saying that I’m doubling down on not being apologetic for sleeping on his side of the bed and then being upset about it. So I did, and he left the bedroom.

I’ve been just sitting on the bed for the last hour or two, and I know he is still angry. 

I’m not sure how to approach this topic to him now cause I feel like it wasn’t fair for him to get so upset at me for something I believe is minor, but maybe he’s valid? 

AITA?

"AITA for not returning a deposit on marketplace when I didn't hear from buyer? I have a product that I'm selling online for $150. A woman contacted me and asked if I could hold it for her...she couldn't come until the next day. I agreed if she sent me a $25 deposit so she e-transferred it to me.

  
Then she contacted me saying she had to work late and would come the next day. Then she said her kid was sick. Then she had to go away for 2 days and would get them when she was back.

  
2 weeks went by. I sent her a text asking if she's still interested but no response. So someone else was interested, so I sold it. A few days later she contacted me and said she could come pick it up. When I told her I sold it because I hadn't heard back from her she asked if I could return her deposit. I said no, and she got angry.

The way I look at it, she wasted a couple of weeks of my time. I could have sold it over 2 weeks ago for full price, but instead I held onto it for only 1/6th of what I wanted for it.

"AITA for calling my mom selfish? My(15m) mom and dad recently went through a hard time in their relationship and decided to take a divorce. I never expected it and it came as a shock to me and my brothers definitely.  
  
We have been in and out of court countless times already, to see who’s going to get custody. Now, I didn’t know what to say when the judge asked me who I prefer to live with, but they were all pressuring me so I said dad because we do more activities together. I love both of my parents equally. But my mom doesn’t play football with me or go fishing or have “guy” talks, but she does other things for me and I’m not denying she loves me.  
  
My mom looked sad when I said I wanted to live with my dad because my other brother agreed. But the little one wanted to go with mom. I understand how this can hurt her though, and after the court I ensured her I don’t have a problem living with both.  
  
But since then, our relationship became really awkward. She randomly yells at me and tells me to go to my dad for help since I “prefer” him. I explained to her that I don’t “prefer” my dad but that he’s a guy so he understands me better. But she insists that we are “bullying” her and we don’t love her .So I called her “selfish” and self-centered for not looking at my point of view.

We have another roommate (38M) who I will call Wyatt and a son (6M) who ill call Derek. We offered the room to Kay back about 7 to 8 months ago to help her out of a bad situation and she had since only paid basicly 3 month of rent (2 payments and 1 ""trade"" of a month). She brought her dog and 2 cats well since moving in I think she has cleaning litter boxes maybe twice even with my husband asking her multiple times to help clean up. Her dog has shit on my floors and she just walks past it on several occasions. My husband and I cook all meals unless we are so tired we order pizza or chicken. Wyatt cleans their bathroom majority of the time minus the times my husband and I clean up as Derek shares a bathroom with them. Wyatt also does majority of the dishes  since my husband and I do most of the cooking and we also clean the common areas like kitchen and livingroom as well as dining area. I have seen Kay do dishes probably twice and when we asked her about not putting an item in there that wasn't dishwasher safe she threw a fit and threw up her hands saying well I guess I'll stop doing dishes again. She had called my husband useless even tho he helped fix her car and didn't ask for anything in return. We'll a couple days ago we asked her to talk after her dog went into the bathroom where our son was bathing and shit right next to the tub our son was in.  I had asked a freind of mine to come over to help mediate as I am hotheaded. We asked her why she wasn't paying rent monthly she claims I never told her it was monthly that she was just helping when she could. I told her she had been disrespectful towards us by calling my husband useless and letting her dog shit everywhere and that I honestly wasn't sure that I wanted her around or to stay in our house anymore. We asked her if she was searching for a place to stay and she said yes but they were all out of her budget that would accept her animals.

"AITA for having my fiance's brothers ex as my bridesmaid? My fiancée, Oliver, and I met in June 2019. Oliver has two siblings, David and Nora. Oliver was in the US from Australia for six months for a course for work, and that’s how we met. We did a long distance relationship for most of our first year. Oliver’s brother David, is in the same field as Oliver, and went to the US to do the same course. At that time, David was in a relationship with Abby, but they faced difficulties due to the long distance. Abby, close to Oliver’s family, sought my advice since Oliver and I successfully navigated a long-distance relationship. However, David ended up cheating on Abby with a girl in the US (Jane), leading to their breakup. Abby and I remained friends, and when I moved to Aus, we became best friends. In 2021, Oliver’s entire family, including Abby, attended a concert. When David and Jane, who had by then moved to Aus, found out Abby was there, they left immediately, making things awkward for the rest of us. 

Oliver proposed to me in October 2022, and two weeks later, David proposed to Jane. I was happy for them, but I felt irritated that it happened so close to our engagement. We booked our wedding venue in November 2023 for July 2025, and a month later, David and Jane announced they would be getting married in August 2024. For some reason, this rubbed me the wrong way. David and Jane planned a small wedding in the US, as Jane’s grandmother couldn’t travel to Aus. Since moving to Aus, Jane hasn’t made any friends, and she only reaches out to Oliver’s sister, Nora, not me. Jane asked Nora to be a bridesmaid, and when it came time for wedding dress shopping, she only invited Nora. One weekend, Nora mentioned that they were going shoe shopping for Jane the following weekend and suggested I join. I felt upset because Jane didn’t invite me herself, and it felt last minute, so I declined. When the wedding invites went out a month before their wedding, it was addressed only to Oliver, not to me. They knew I wasn’t coming because we couldn’t afford for both of us to go, but I thought it would have been courteous to include me. Jane blamed this oversight on her mother, but I wasn’t convinced. She sent me flowers to apologize.

Now that Jane and David are married, Oliver and I are fully focused on planning our wedding. I asked Abby, my best friend here, to be one of my bridesmaids, and she has already bought her dress. Recently, Oliver and I spent time with his parents, and his father told Oliver that having Abby at our wedding would make him and Oliver’s mother uncomfortable. Oliver, visibly upset, later told me what his parents had said, essentially asking me to uninvite Abby. Oliver was near tears as he didn’t want to ask me and felt caught in the middle again.

"AITA for refusing to visit my MIL after she asked my daughter to stop messaging her after an accidental insult? My daughter (10F) took a video of her little sister  (7) showing off a bandaid that was on her middle finger. Everyone thought it was pretty amusing, including little sister. She kind of got the joke, but the first time she gave us the finger, it was unintentional. 

10yo thinks, hey that was pretty amusing, so she wanted to share this little laugh with family. We live in a different country, so we encourage our older kid to be in touch often even with silly little things so she can maintain a connection. 

Well, after receiving this video, she sends my spouse a message asking why exactly our daughters were sending her a video flipping her off. Even after writing back that it was a silly little joke, she asked that we please ask our daughter to stop messaging her. 

So, here I may be the asshole, because I was so so pissed. But I first refuse to share this with our daughter, and I won't let my spouse do so either. If MIL wants to break kiddos heart, she better damn well do it herself. 

Second, if MIL wants to go no contact from 10yo, then we will honor that, and we will refuse to have her visit us here, and refuse to go visit her when we travel home.

I asked how their interactions ended up with her feeling comfortable sending heart emojis and joking about sex whether it’s about patients or not. He said I was being an asshole.

"AITA for leaving a note demanding my then bf to vote.. or else Not looking for whether we should have broken up but if the note was a a-hole move. 

TLDR- Left a playfully, threatening note demanding my bf to vote in an election or he would lose things, signed it Xoxo and posted a picture on Facebook. 

Back in 2020 there was an election going on for president of the USA. I was very concerned about one person winning and  think (mostly) everyone should participate in voting...

I wrote my bf a note on a big peice of paper saying...


""*bf name* Voting is coming closer.. this is a friendly reminder that...

If you do not vote and _____ wins..

You will lose- 
My respect
Moms cooking
Your side of the bed

You will gain-
Increases rent
Abstinence 
Space where your computer use to be

Xoxo, love (from the time being) your girlfriend

(End)

Then I drew hearts all over it and left it on his computer desk. He read it, put it aside and didnt really say much about it. I told him to please vote, to do it for me. The voting station for us was about a mile down the road. 

He did not vote. He said it was a waste of time and gave me a bit of the silent treatment. I was upset but didn't follow though with any of the threats..we broke up about a year later. 

I thought the note was really funny at the time.. I even posted it on Facebook (I'm not even active on it. It's one of very few posts and was very easy to look up 4 years later ).   

Looking back... I think I might have been a bit of an a-hole leaving a note like that.. Basically demanding he vote to please me AND putting it on Facebook....

"AITA Am I in the wrong for being so brutally honest? I am a single 30f and I've had an arrangement with man for the past few months for sex with no strings attached.  The arrangement actually worked out really well for the firet few months, but there's been a change over the past few weeks. The sex has been drastically different. It's been that way because I've been thinking about somebody else while fucking my fuck buddy. He noticed the change too, but he thought it was because I had caught feelings for him. He told me that he has feelings for me too. I felt really bad and didn't want to lead him on, so I told him the truth. I could tell he was really hurt by the look on his face. He told me that I was a selfish bitch and that I'll only ever care about myself. Was I the asshole for telling him the truth?",0.38
"WIBTAH if I missed my older brothers wedding? Quite conflicted about this and still have the better part of 6 months to figure it out and make a decision, but I wanted to hear others' opinions on it.

  
My (22M) older brother (28M), is set to have his wedding in March after being engaged for two years, and having already pushed the wedding back by a year. I'm a recent college graduate and managed to land a great job that will serve to be a strong steppingstone for my professional career both in terms of experience, and workplace connections.

  
Now here's where I might be the asshole. Since I'm a graduate hire I'm a part of my company's development program for newly hired of college graduates. This encompasses a two-year rotational program, in which I experience and do work for multiple departments to fully understand what the business does and provides. Additionally, this includes a trip to the company's main headquarters, which is located out of country, this trip is likely to overlap with my brother's wedding. 

  
**NOTE:** I interned with this company last year and new this trip would be a possibility and told my entire family about it INCLUDING him and his fiancée. The wedding was originally supposed to be this past spring but got pushed back due to financial reasons.

So, WIBTAH if I chose to attend this trip in lieu of attending my brother's wedding?",0.16
"AITA for telling my friend that I'm disappointed in her after she made a nasty comment about my crush? At first my(18m) friend(18f) and I didn't get along. We had to work together on an assignment and she constantly made jabs at me about how I must be so excited to spend a lot of time with a beautiful girl and that she's only hanging out with a loser like me because she has to. But then we got to know each other better. We found out we both have daddy issues. My dad only says this when drunk but unfortunately he is drunk several times a week. He blames me for his marriage with mom breaking down. Apparently their sex life ended after I was born. As for my friend, her dad gives her his credit card and lets her buy anything she wants, but he is rarely around. She's even tried spending too much but it didn't bother him enough. Guy buries himself in work.

Anyway, I recently confided in her that I have a crush. When I told her who it is, she asked why I'm into such a 'flat, poorly-endowed' girl. I told her I'm disappointed. I thought she became a better person than she was. The next day she told me I was too quick to judge her.",0.25
"AITA for Not Letting My Sister and Her Sons Stay With Us Because Our House Is Full of Women? 
I’m a 39-year-old woman with a husband, an 18-year-old son, and four daughters aged 16, 13, and 10 (twins). We all live together in a modest-sized house with a unique layout that includes an upstairs and some outside rooms connected to the main house. My husband works full-time, and I come home in the early afternoon after work. My elderly aunt also lives with us and takes care of the twins until I get home.

Recently, my sister and her two teenage sons (aged 16 and 13) asked if they could stay with us for a few weeks due to some personal issues they’re facing. I had to decline their request, and now my sister is upset with me.

The main reason I said no is that our house is already pretty full. With my husband working long hours and me being out most of the day, the house is primarily occupied by my daughters and my aunt. They have a routine and are very close to each other. The twins, in particular, depend on my aunt’s care and support, and adding more people, especially teenage boys, would disrupt their comfort and harmony.

I also expressed my discomfort with having teenage boys in the house, as my oldest daughters like to relax at home and wear comfortable clothes you’d only wear in your own house. My sister responded by saying that we have a son too and that there’s no reason why her sons shouldn’t be accommodated. I explained that while we do have a son, he is super close with his sisters, and they’ve known and lived with each other their whole lives. Their comfort and routine are very important to us.

Additionally, I feel like my sister is trying to move in with us because our house is bigger and nicer compared to other family members' homes. Several other relatives with smaller families offered her help, but she chose to ask us, which makes me feel like she's taking advantage of our situation.

I really wanted to help my sister, but I felt it was crucial to prioritize my children’s comfort and the overall harmony of our home.

"AITA for calling a delivery driver an idiot? I was super hungover and ordered some pho to heal my soul when I woke up, and obviously I was ready to eat. I waited for my DoorDash driver to drop off my food, only to see in the picture he provided that he dropped it off at the wrong apartment (I double checked that my address is correct). Okay no problem, I’ll just call him to correct his mistake and let him know where to drop it off.

He doesn’t answer the call, then when I texted him, I told him it was the wrong location and to please pick it up and drop it off at the correct one. He refuses, saying he dropped it off at the right address and that he left it on a glass table like i requested (I never requested this?? and the order wasn’t even left on a table, it was left on the ground outside) so I walk to the apartment he dropped it off at and take a picture, showing him where it was supposed to be vs where he left it. And my food is not even there by the time I arrive at that apartment either!! That was my breaking point bc who are you messing with right now. I know that it wasn’t directly his fault my food was taken but if he had left it at the correct address, I would’ve gotten to it sooner than anyone else.

He kept denying that he made a mistake then told me I was being stupid and rude, then when I showed him the picture evidence he doubled down saying that the GPS probably glitched and that it wasn’t his fault. I told him my food was gone and he didn’t apologize or offer to correct his mistake, instead he started harrassing me and saying I didn’t have a brain.

Now here’s where i might be the AH: after he said that, I told him that he was the idiot who couldn’t own up to his mistake and that’s why he has to doordash instead of getting a real job, which he didn’t reply to. I then reported him to doordash for verbal abuse and closed the chat. AITA? I’ll try to attach the link to the screenshots with my address blurred.",0.77
"AITA for wanting a connection with my biological dad? (Throwaway account, my girlfriend is an active Reddit user and I usually use her account to browse the site, but I don't want to drag her online reputation into this.)

I (20M) grew up as the oldest of four siblings and was raised by my biological mother and her husband (early 40s). It's worth noting that my mom's husband isn't my bio dad, and I'm the only child born out of wedlock/not belonging to my step father.

I remember asking my mother about who my real father was growing up and I learned that he basically was an old lover who knew I existed but wanted nothing to do with me. The only involvement he had, to his credit, was apparently paying child support. It took a bit of digging on my own time and a lot of poking at my mom for clues as to who he was, but eventually I found my biological dad online.

I reached out to him not too long ago and explained that I was his biological son from my mother and asked if he'd like to meet up to talk. To his credit, he answered me at all. But he made it very clear that it was a no. I tried explaining my situation to him and that I would just like to at least text back and forth for a little to get to know my real father and I said that if he didn't care for me at all he wouldn't have paid child support for me, so what's the harm in at least getting to know him a little? This clearly upset him and he basically said that I ""didn't know the conditions of my birth, so to stop bothering him about it"" and that he ""paid his dues"" and ""his involvement with me has been long done and to just move on.""

I'm really bummed and I want to try and talk to my mom more to find out what could have happened and if she maybe could get us in touch, but my girlfriend says I overstepped a boundary by reaching out to him and that I was being rude. She said I was basically stalking him and to leave him alone, but I don't know. Is it wrong to want to know the man who you share DNA with? AITA?",0.91
"AITA? Unintentionally or just an AH?  So I'm (29m) worried I'm coming across an AH to my Fiance (25f) of 6 years. 
Ive loved motorbikes since a really young age but I've been riding motorbikes for 4 years /since my 25th Birthday. I started with a mid-size 650cc sportsbike then moved to a 900cc naked after 3 years. Ever since I started riding I said for my 30th my plan was to get a ""big-boy"" bike or one of my dream bikes. 
I turn 30 next year, also the year we get married and go on our honeymoon. 

My partner is currently as I write this is going through her access course for full motorbike licence and has also bought her first brand new 650cc bike which she's wanted for many many years. She's over the moon and super excited for it as I am for her. 

Since my 30th is next year I have been on the lookout for ""THE"" bike for many months if not since last year. 
One of the ""dream"" bikes has come about in great condition and a good price and is one of those that probably wont come around again. I have just placed a small holding deposit on it. Albeit nearly 9 months prior to my 30th. 
My worry is am I the asshole for doing this? My partner is supportive of me and thinks it's a good decision to get the bike. 

Am I unintentionally overshadowing my partners joy with her bike? I am absolutely chuffed to bits for her and so proud and happy that she's bought hers. I believe I'm super supportive of her and am genuinely so happy as this is a dream of both of ours to ride together.

"AITA for telling my parents that my sister shouldn't get snapchat? I'm the oldest in my family and my younger sister has been begging for snapchat since she started high school. She's been asking my parents since she graduated so that she could ""be cool"" and ""talk more with her friends"". I can't say I've been on snapchat personally but I've been on Amino (IYKYK) and I don't think this a good idea at all. I don't want her going down that path and possibly getting groomed. I worry for her safety but she keeps lashing out at me.

To the point where she has started making r-word and grooming jokes at me because I've been on discord since I was her age. She's made several comments such as ""How many times have you been groomed?"" or things regarding the r-word. Aside from that she's been touching me and groping me when I least expect it. It's been hurtful and very upsetting and I can't even believe she's been saying/doing that to me. We've never gotten along but I feel this is to far. 

Adding on with me fighting with her and convincing my parents that she shouldn't have snapchat (or any other social media except for Instagram) it's been worst.

"AITAH for not splitting the bill evenly at family meal  Me (30M) and my girlfriend went for a meal with my mum, my brother (40M), my auntie and her daughter. 

GF is pregnant so didn’t drink any alcohol & I only had a couple of beers. We also just had 1 main meal that wasn’t too expensive. 

Everyone else had cocktails which were quite expensive, 2 courses & more expensive main meals. 

My brother doesn’t have a job (by choice) so he probably couldn’t afford to pay for himself. I have a fairly ok job so can afford to pay for myself. 

When the bill came my Mum said shall we split it 3 ways so auntie pays for her daughter, mum pays for my brother & I pay for my partner. 

I felt annoyed really that my Mum was paying for my brother (probably sounds selfish/spoilt but it just annoyed me!). I suppose it’s a perk to being unemployed! 

My partner mumbled that we didn’t consume that much and the bill was quite high. My auntie overheard & asked (nicely) if that was ok with us. Partner said not really so we ended up paying a little less. 

My mum looked really bugged by this. She didn’t say anything but I could see from her face that she wasn’t happy that it had been mentioned and that we were paying less.

"WIBTA if i told my bf to man up and fix the dryer? I'm 25f and my bf is 33m. I grew up extremely poor and if shit broke we fixed it. He grew up middle class where if shit broke you just bought a new one or payed someone else to fix it. 


But times do be changing and while our financial situation isnt bad we dont really have money to throw at every given situation. So I've started fixing shit myself. But he's got a kinda sexist/toxic masculinity mindset about it. I think its subconscious. Whenever i fix things he gets kinda weird and downplays it. Like when i fixed his cars blinker light he was super not helpful the entire time and he was just supposed to hold the flashlight but kept moving it and saying my hair was touching his engine (cuz i told him we had to pop the hood and let his engine cool off before i could go see whats wrong since he just drove home) and i repeatedly told him it was fine and his engine wasn't that hot anymore and it started feeling like he was trying to act like he knew more than me when he literally didnt know the front lights had break lights and thought i was fuckin with the wrong part of his headlights cuz he thought his break lights were his blinker. And when i got done fixing it my arms were covered in grease and i playfully held up my black hands and wiggled my fingers and was like ""i got man hands"" in a silly voice and he was like ""no you look like a lesbian"" in a kinda aggressive and mocking tone. 



Ive fixed his car or diagnosed his car problems 4 times now. Ive built furniture in our house twice. Ive done heavy yardwork and used a chainsaw to cut down tree branches that fell during a storm. So many of the stereotypical mannly tasks have been done by me. And now our dryer suddenly stopped heating. He was panicking last night and saying we needed a new dryer and i told him it probably is an easy fix. There's a few things that could be wrong but most are easy fixes. We just gotta pull out the dryer and see whats wrong. But the dryer is in our basement which i not so lovingly refer to as the dungeon. Its basically an oversized crawlspace tbh. There's no ceiling, its only about 5 feet tall, its dirty af (despite me desperately trying to clean it), and theres spiders. Not only do i not want to deal with his mockery and attitude fixing it myself i also just don't want to have to crawl around on the ground of the basement. My top guess for whats wrong is the heating breaker flipped. Its such an easy fix, he just needs to pull the dryer out and find the button for the breaker and press it. Then clean the lint trap for good measure. Thats it! But he's putting it off and looking at new dryers and shit. Like, we're going on a mini vacation to nyc in literally 2 days. We don't have money or time to buy a new dryer! 



So would i be the asshole if i told him to man up and just fix the dryer?

I did not agree to holding onto the toys for her but I also did not try to fight with her as she likes to cry to her son(38m) about how I was mean and don't like her.

"AITA for getting irritated for how my friend said hi at the gym. A couple days ago a friend saw me at the gym while I was doing shoulders (on the short benches, like sitting on a little chair). She got close and tapped the middle of my thigh with the ball of her shoe. 

  
I was initially bothered because I though it was a random person, but still bothered because why couldn't she just say hi or grab my attention a different way. Personally, I though that was a rude way to grab someone attention and wouldn't do that to someone I know.

"AITA for refusing to attend my sister's wedding because of her choice of venue? I (24F) have been having a major disagreement with my sister (32F) about her upcoming wedding.

I told her that I love her, but I don't think I can attend the wedding if it's held there. She became furious, calling me selfish and accusing me of trying to ruin her special day. Our parents are split on the issue – Dad thinks I should suck it up for my sister's sake, while Mom understands my position but wishes we could find a compromise.

"AITA for forcing my wife to get rid of her pet dog?  TL;DR at end of post.

Edit: To clear things up, when we first met she lived with her mother and her mother also had three dogs. My wife made the decision on her own that she did not want to separate her dog from her mother's dogs. I also made it clear to her that I was okay with her bringing the dog back once we found a place that dogs were allowed so I'm not completely opposed to him being with us because I love her, despite my dislike for him. Under our current situation though it's simply not feasible.

So, my wife has a dog that she’s had for over six years. When we first met, she was living in North Carolina, and I was in Tennessee. When things got serious between us, she decided to move to Tennessee with me. The place we moved to doesn't allow dogs, so she left her dog behind with her mom. I’ve never really liked the dog because he’s super noisy—he whines and howls constantly.

Fast forward to about four months ago: the dog contracted parvo and, against the odds, survived. After getting out of the vet's office, he needed to take antiviral medication for 10 days, and he would only take it from my wife. She contacted our landlord to see if the dog could stay with us just for those 10 days while she medicated him, with the plan being that he would go back to her mom’s afterward. But here’s the thing—she never took him back. Now, she wants the dog to stay with us, even though it’s against our lease agreement.

The situation is stressing me out. Due to his constant howling and whining, she can’t leave the house without him, or he’ll howl the entire time. If we get a complaint, we could possibly be evicted. I’ve told her on several occasions that the dog needs to go back to her mom’s, but she keeps making excuses, like he has a vet appointment in a few days, and she’ll take him back after that. But he never actually goes back, and she avoids the conversation because she’s trying to keep him here.

I’m at the point where I feel like I need to force the issue. Either I take him back to her mom’s, or she does. She knows I don’t like the dog, she knows I didn’t want him here, and she knows we’re not supposed to have him in the house that I pay the rent for. We can’t really afford all the expenses that come with the dog either.

So, am I the asshole for putting my foot down and insisting she gets rid of him, even though she loves the dog dearly and wants him to stay?

TL;DR: My wife’s dog was supposed to stay with us for 10 days to take medication, but she never took him back to her mom’s. Now, she wants to keep him despite our lease prohibiting pets, and it’s causing stress.  Am I the asshole for insisting the dog has to go? ",0.29
"AITAH for not standing by my SO in this argument? English is not my first language, sorry.
Some important backround story: Me (F36) and my SO (M36) have a close knit friendship with another couple for simplicity I'll name them James (M35) & Jane (F26). We all live in the same complex, almost next door neighbors. In this complex you get 1 parking permit per apartment. Me and my SO are currently without a car. Our friends do currently have 2 cars. Therefore they have been using our permit for a year to save parking costs. In exchange for this we wold get help groceryshopping. We agreed to go shopping together and bulk up with food once a month. All a win win for everybody.


Come close to a year now and they helped us out with groceries in total of 4 times. 


The argument: We were planning to go and see a movie this weekend all 4 of us. Jane & James were hesitant in booking the tickets because Jane is currently not feeling to well. They wanted to wait for another day or two. My SO grew impatient and told them the tickets will be sold out if we wait too long. This convo all happend in groupchat btw. My SO told J&J that they are procrastinators basicly. Our friends took this very badly. It escalated into an argument when my SO started with the parking permits and the almost non existent groceryshopping. 


He told me before he sent the text that he would be bringing this up. I on my hand told him not to. I told him it would not end well. That i would stay out of this argument. This isn't a conversation that should be held over texting. Everything becomes twisted.


Anyway, all hell broke loose. J&J cut our friendship because they couldn't even recall this agreement we made a year ago. They went on with beeing tired from work to having a busy schedule and so on.

In all of this took no sides. My SO told me I always should be on his side. Our friends are neutral about me but the friendship with my SO is over. AITA, should I have taken my SO:s side?

Edit: Thank you everyone for your input! I have come to the conclusion that I am indeed the A-hole in this. I spoke to my SO about this. We decided to have a talk with our friends. In the end we all had a lot of issues hashed out between us. It was in a way cathartic and everyone felt a lot better afterwards.

"AITA for refusing to switch rooms with my mom and her boyfriend? I (19NB) technically have the “master bedroom” and my mom (37F) has the only other bedroom. My brother(18M) lives in the loft. I am looking for a job right now, it’s been about 2 months but the job market is absolute shite where I live. Her boyfriend (38M) lives with us, he moved in a couple months back. My brother is also unemployed. He is not job searching.

We live in a 2bd2ba apartment with a loft. The “master” bedroom is practically the same size as the other bedroom, max 2 feet larger. It just has its own bathroom but it’s small. The bathroom takes up all the extra space the room technically has, a sink area and mirror and then a closed off shower and toilet area. I use my space appropriately, and have more furniture than she does (a bookshelf, vanity, record player on a small fold out camping table, night stand, bed ofc, and tv stand that doubles as a dresser). She just has her *massive king bed* and vanity and one nightstand. She complains that she has no space in her room. I tell her it’s because she has a king bed and needs to downsize from it, it’s just her and boyfriend (both skinny folks not fat at all) and they can use a queen, or a full like I do. A full might be a tight fit but they don’t need a king, and the room can’t fit it. She refuses, and wants my room. If she put her king bed in my room she would have *maybe* a foot and a half of extra space, not much to do with! I already have posters and flags and lights up, I don’t want to take them all down and organize it all again.

Also, her room has a walk in closet. She has an insane amount of clothing, she wears less than half of it. I don’t know why she has so much clothing. She wouldn’t be able to fit all her clothes in my tiny closet, and she says she would get a hanger thing outside of the closet but there would be *no room with her massive bed.*

Her main complaint besides the lack of space is my brother sharing the bathroom with her. He takes hours in there to shower every day and for like 10 minutes the water is on. I don’t know what he does in there. He also takes an hour in there to do whatever he does multiple times a day with the door locked. We have spoken about it, he refuses to adjust. This was MY nightmare for the years I shared a bathroom with him. I let them use my bathroom because of this. I only lock my bedroom door between 10:00pm and 7:00am while I am sleeping, but besides that my bathroom is free for them to use. 

She insists we need to switch, I am trying to say she just needs a smaller bed. And again, my bedroom space is practically the same size as hers, I just have a bathroom *that I allow her and her weird boyfriend to use whenever they need*  and it takes up all the extra space the room technically has, besides that they are *practically the same size.* AITA?

Edit: FAQ, I paid my rent portion last month and half of my rent portion this month. I also paid electric and water this month. I paid more into the household than her for a whole almost 2 years before unemployment as well so I feel I should get some leeway. Also, we would have more money if she didn’t go out every weekend and spend more money than she has on frivolous things. She did this before my unemployment and my paycheck covered it all, then I got fired for absolute bs which I won’t go into right now because it’s a long story. I don’t have a paycheck to cover her ass after she blows half her paycheck on random stuff.",0.05

My husband & I are both vegan, so we’re morally against the use, abuse, commodification, & exploitation of all animals. We have been for 6 yrs & all of our friends & family know this. Way before our 10^(th), my husband & I discussed that if they were to throw us a party that we would want to have an entirely vegan menu & if that couldn’t be the case then we’d say thanks but would prefer not to have it bc this isn’t just a health or dietary preference, it’s about our ethics. 

I called my mom to discuss this & she was NOT having it. I tried to explain what my guilt would be over this but she cut me off: she didn’t want to subject her guests to our “agenda” of veganism & that a vegan menu would be too complicated & she was worried the guests would be surprised or wouldn’t like the food. Husband & I offered to pay for catering to take the plan/cook burdens off her, & she STILL wouldn’t agree. I was surprised to find out that my normally logical & rational dad not only agreed with my mom but doubled down. They said that they’ve been “worried about me” over my veganism & concern for animal welfare & how much time they *perceive* that I spend on it. They’ve also been discussing this with my 2 brothers (42 & 48), who are also on their side (this especially hurt). They said we were being unreasonable & used it as a reason to judge me, my husband, & our faith. They even tried to make me promise that if someone “happened” to bring non-v food to the party that I wouldn’t freak out. There was a lot of emphasis on this supposed hypothetical, which makes me truly wonder why they asked. We asked what their endgame was in all this, & they said “to throw you a party for your ann” despite all of their words & actions proving otherwise. For days & weeks after I got headaches, stomachaches, cried, I couldn’t sleep & my mental health suffered.  

My husband and I told this story to 15-20 people (most of them strangers or acquaintances) & NO ONE agreed with my family. Most of the time we didn’t finish the story before they said “it’s a party for you, you should get what you want”.

This whole thing has basically changed my relationship with my family. I told them that they owed us an apology for what they said & for ruining our ann & they disagreed. I then said that I was very hurt & that I needed to go low contact. It’s gotten a little better since then, but now I’m pretty uncomfortable around them & I no longer talk to them about my health issues or anything personal. It’s like they took away one of my main safe spaces.  

They think I’m being dramatic & sensitive. I have never experienced anything like this with my family or anyone else - was my reaction wrong? AITAH?",0.25
"AITA for reading ahead of my friend? Hi this is all a silly matter but I really need a third opinion. Me and my friend has been reading a virtual novel together. I already read the whole thing maybe 2 years ago and now rereading it again with her.

Here's the problem:

Whenever she reads to me I sometimes read to myself ahead of her because her reading is not good (the book is in English. Not our native language). It so far happened twice where I couldn't resist the urge of reading myself to save my brain from having a fucking seizure.

Yesterday day she caught me doing that (the second time) and she hanged up and didn't talk to me. When I checked with her today she continued chapters alone in the story without me and refused to read with me.

This has happened for at least a decade+. A coworker consistently eats a banana at the beginning of her shifts. Meaning within minutes of clocking in she immediately eats a banana. I have told her repeatedly about my weird aversion  and have had long conversations about weird body things. She still does this on a nearly daily basis. And we work at front desk reception so really we shouldn't be eating anything. No matter how many times I have asked her not to do this she continues.

He is married but the profession is known for cheaters and womanizers. I am in the same profession although I have never cheated although I have seen first hand how true the stereotypes are. I initially told her about my concerns and she blew me off saying they are just friends and that he doesn’t want to sleep with her. I reiterated my concerns especially with my experience in the field and knowing how the guys are and she still wouldn’t accept that he isn’t just her friend. I let it go until last night I realized that he is her second most talked to person via text.

AITA for messaging my baby dads gf? So for context I was 27 weeks pregnant when this happened. I started dating my bd back In November 2023. We moved pretty fast and I was practically living with him by the end of the month with how often I was there. I had my everyday items there and would rarely go home. We’re exclusive (or so I thought) and I ended up finding out I was pregnant in March 2024. Got pregnant super fast unintentionally and when I decided to keep the pregnancy we started having problems. We were off and on up until I was 26 weeks pregnant. When I was about 24 weeks pregnant he gave me herpes and I kept finding other women’s stuff at his house. He denied and denied sleeping with anyone else and said the stuff was his first baby moms. I had also found a pill bottle with a name on it that definitely wasn’t his baby moms. We argued and he avoided hanging out for a few days and when I come over again the next morning I find two used condoms in his trash. I text him saying damn dude. Then he calls me twice which I reject as I’m grabbing my shit from his house. The third time he calls I answer and tell him I found the condoms and he starts screaming at me. He tells me to gtfo and he doesn’t want to try and work on things with me. He calls again after I had left him telling me he still wanted to be involved with baby and to keep him updated. About a week passes and I try and call him and I’m blocked. I go to his Fb and it says new post and the new post is a relationship status saying he’s been in a relationship since august 2023… before we started dating. No one is tagged so I then go to his instagram which is now private and he’s tagged a women who’s name was on the pill bottle with hearts. Go to her page and it says they’re dating. I message her telling her I’m 27 weeks pregnant with his child and from what I’ve seen they’ve been dating since before I even met him. She messages back wanting proof which I send her screenshots and she tells me pretty much I’m lying and he wouldn’t leave someone having his child.. when I got pregnant I was with this man everyday. Oh she also asked what proof I had that this was his baby. I send all the proof I have that I was at his house daily and this girl is straight delulu. She ended up blocking me which it’s whatever. After all of this I sure as hell don’t want this man I just would want to know if that was me. Aita for telling her or should I have just let it go?,0.06
"AITAH for keeping my daughter away from her grandfather AITAH for keeping my daughter away from her grandfather

Long story short my fiancé’s step dad has a drinking problem. We recently had a daughter who’s 17 months and she’s met all of her father’s side of the family. I don’t have much family on my side so for her to be able to see and get to know his family is great. 

The only issue is her grandfather has a major drinking problem. I grew up with an alcoholic father and have no relationship with him what so ever. I don’t want that for my daughter nor do I want her to be around that kind of behavior growing up. 

I don’t know how to bring this up to my fiancé or my soon to be MIL with out seeming like a controlling bitch of a mother. She helps watch our daughter some days during the week and when I travel for work, so she’s a big part of our life and a huge help to us and I don’t want to ruin this relationship between us. I would think he would want to get sober for her sake(both for his wife’s and his granddaughter’s)  and to be around her more but he’s too busy getting drunk to come and visit. It’s not like it’s a beer here and there. He’s been hospitalized and has tried to go through detox and do rehab but he relapse’s and always goes back to drinking. 

So am I the asshole and overreacting for not wanting my daughter to be around her grandfather and potentially banning him until he proves that he can stay sober? ",0.43
"AITA for being untraditional? I (23f) am planning on having a baby with my gf (25f) for some context my gf (let’s call her Bonnie) has always been known to be a complete pushover . I have told her numerous times I feel like she puts her family specifically her mother first before me. As an example we were supposed to meet at my place at 2pm her mother was not ready to leave yet so Bonnie stayed there. She did not end up even showing up bc her mother came back so late throughout the entire day she never told me she wasn’t coming btw. Me and her mother do not have a good relationship or any relationship at all due to there being a massive family disagreement ending in her mother throwing me out her house and saying some awful things about me and my mother, Bonnie’s younger sister(17)  also h** me in my arm attempting to get me to f**** her. All while she just stood there pulling me to my car. So now the actual issue. We’ve been planning for a baby for a couple of months and I’ve been VERY crystal clear I do not want to be smothered especially since this will be my very first baby. I have asked that there be no one in the hospital room including my own family and I also asked that family waits at least a week until we get visitors (again including my side too) at first she agreed to this happily and I ofc explained my reasoning. Today we revisited the conversation and I said I was willing to make a compromise I told her that her family can be at the house the first day home IF they could be quiet. She IMMEDIATELY got defensive and said “I don’t know how you expect them to do that and they want to see the baby” I was confused bc newborns need quiet anyways?and I told her “I’m afraid after I have this baby you won’t be on my side” she couldn’t understand what I meant so I reiterated to her exactly what she had just said to me after I was willing to compromise. I told her it was not fair or reassuring to me that she’d stand up for me if my polite request was seen as unreasonable. She told me what I wanted was “weird” bc and I quote “well in my family it’s normal for everyone to see the baby. I never imagined my mother having to wait a whole week to see her grandbaby” at this point I lost it. I told her how can you be worried about her after I just pushed an entire baby out?? How can you possibly still be thinking about her? Where is my consideration? I then pointed out throughout our entire conversation she never once brought up me or how I would feel just her mother. I ended up saying I refuse to go forward with this pregnancy and now she doesn’t want to talk to me. So Reddit AITAH?

"AITA for shutting down an emotional conversation with my fiancé? My fiancé and I got into a minor argument this morning, that resulted in an incredibly lengthy conversation about tons of behaviours of mine that he had not been satisfied with over the past months. He addressed situations that I had already forgotten about because they were so long ago and told me about fears and insecurities that he's had about me/our relationships for months, but had never told me about before (apparently he had developed a fear of ""having expectations in me"" months ago, because of one situation I had already forgotten about, amongst other things).

He also expected me to analyze whether his fears/insecurities are reasonable and wanted me to help him find out whether he was making up some of the problems by getting too worked up about things and overthinking them. I am not a therapist, especially not his therapist, so I refused to do so.

At some point we both decided we had worked through the pressing issues, we're both satisfied with the outcome and wanted to enjoy the rest of the day. We spent quality time together, talked and laughed normally and everything was fine.

Until I went to walk our dog, because I have to get up early tomorrow. He asked whether he could join and I said ""sure!"" (hadn't asked him because he was busy working on a project and I didn't want to interrupt). We talked about our future together first and everything was light-hearted, until he decided to drop another bombshell: He felt like I had purposely not asked him to join me on the walk to ""show him that I don't need him"".
I asked him why I should do that and that I thought everything was fine between us, but he was convinced I was holding a grudge against him.

After almost an hour of talking, I went quiet. He asked me what I was thinking and I told him that I had expected to have a nice, calm evening and that I had to go to bed early, but now I was in a state of emotional turmoil due to that hefty conversation that came out of nowhere. I told him conversations like these (they mostly consist of me having to reassure him and promise to him that I am not holding grudges or trying to hurt him purposely - it's exhausting. It's mostly about him and his emotions and whenever I bring up a good point that counters his anxiety his reply is something along the lines of: ""So you think I am overreacting and the entire situation is my fault?"") weren't good for me before bed, because I had trouble falling asleep after them in the past and I needed to get up early tomorrow.

My fiancé became really quiet, told me that I should sleep, turned off the light and left the room with his pillow. He has been super quiet and timid since I opened up about how stressful those hour-long conversations are for me. AITA for shutting it down and ""dismissing"" the importance of his feelings?",0.26
"AITA for yelling at my teacher?  my mom had a really bad heart attack so bad that she almost deleted from the world (have to say this was cause it got taken down before). It was probably the most traumatic this i've ever gone through. Luckily she ended up being ok and was in the hospital for about 4 days before she got to go home.
The heart attack happened friday night btw. I got to school monday morning (she was still in the hospital) and i went to my math class. I was extremely down that day and was just kinda keeping to myself. Class starts and my teachers asks for everyone's homework. I then realized i didn't do it. My teacher goes to me and asks where's your homework? i say that i don't have it. I don't remember exactly what he said but it was something to the extent of ""you've had all weekend to do it why didn't you do like everyone else?"" I kinda just snapped and started yelling saying ""my mom almost deleted this weekend do you really think i would have my homework done??"" (something to that extent) and then i started having a little panic attack and left the classroom and went to the bathroom. My friend came into the bathroom a few minutes later to comfort me. Then she said that my teacher basically said that i need to calm down and that i was overreacting, which now i think about it i kinda was. I told my dad after school and he ended up writing a long email to my teacher condemning him for what he said and my teacher did end up apologizing. 
AITA?? 
Something else i didn't add was that i didn't get to see my mom at all until monday so i was stressed out the whole weekend and monday and that may have provoked me to go off :/

"AITA For Asking My Neighbor to Not Pull Into my Driveway?  I recently bought my first house. I park my car in my garage, so the driveway is empty if my girlfriend is not at home. 

My neighbor across the street has a Toyota Tundra that he backs into his driveway. Every time he parks he pulls slightly into my driveway so he can back straight into his without having to turn the wheel. I get it, it's easier and helps prevent him from clipping his wife's vehicle when it's parked there. I prefer he didn't, but he isn't passing the sidewalk line so it's whatever. I've ignored it. 

Today he pulled his truck pretty much all the way to the garage (two car lengths) before backing in. I walked over and politely said, ""Hey Josh, I'd appreciate it if you didn't pull so far up into my driveway."" 

This utterly confused him and he went off, not yelling but an elevated voice, on that is a really weird request, it isn't neighborly, the previous owners never asked him not to pull into the driveway, etc. It really irked him for some reason. He compared it to a ""get off my lawn"" request. 

I told him I am only requesting him to not pull that far into the driveway , and he said it was because there was another truck parked on the curb in front of his house so that is why he did. He had plenty of room imo. 

Honestly, it's not necessary to go in my driveway at all really, as my buddy with a long bed Chevy 2500 crew cab has backed into my driveway multiple times without ever needing to go off the street. The neighbor has backed into his spot when I had vehicles parked in my driveway before so he wasn't able to use it, so it is possible.

I've talked to my friends, and everyone agrees with me that if it isn't necessary he shouldn't be pulling into the driveway at all, especially every day. Some said it would annoy them as well. I see it as it causes more wear-and-tear being applied to my driveway which already has cracks/chips. The weight of his truck is more than both my vehicles. Also I see it as rude, which is why I always try my best to avoid needlessly going on someone else's property without consent.

"AITA for wanting my neighbor to not put up a flag in the middle of the river? Very weird situation that's hard to relate to something else, so I'll explain the situation the best I can. Please bear with me. 

  
I live in a neighborhood with houses next to the river. I have neighbors on both sides of me that are also next to the river. Sometimes when the river is low, there is a rock that is exposed in the middle of the river. My neighbor has taken it upon himself to place an American flag on that exposed rock in the middle of the river. He doesn't own the rock, and he definitely doesn't own the river. 

  
From every single view of my house, I can see the flag in the middle of the river. I've tried tuning it out, but I just can't. One of the reasons I bought my house was so I could view the river, trees, and natural wildlife that comes as part of living next to a river. However, now every time I look outside I just see the flag in the middle of the river. 

  
I want to make it clear that I have no issue with the American Flag by itself. I'll admit that I'm not exactly the most staunch patriot, but if someone wants to fly an American Flag outside their home, I have absolutely no issue with that at all. Even if this flag in the middle of the river said that I was the king of the world and everybody should listen to me, I still wouldn't want the flag put there because again - it should not be in the middle of the river. 

  
The reason he put the flag there is so he could mark the rock so that he doesn't hit it with his boat/jetski - which I can understand. However, it's not like he can't go in a completely different direction and avoid the rock that he knows is there. There is miles of river in the other direction that he could boat/jetski in that don't have exposed rocks for him to run into. However for some reason, he feels it necessary to boat/jetski in circles in our ""shared"" backyard on the river, and thus, the flag. 

  
I've asked him to take it down and he immediately got defensive and offended that I'd even ask because he feels that it's not an issue, and that I'm ""attacking the American flag/being anti-American"", and he has no intention of taking it down. I've contacted various state departments, the police, the VFW, the American Legion, and none of them have helped - every single person says it's not in their jurisdiction and that they can't do anything about it. 

  
Outside of my own personal reasons for not wanting the flag there, it's also very disrespectful to the flag itself, as it does not follow proper flag code for the American flag. So even through my own admittedly selfish reasons, it's also just generally disrespectful to be using an American flag as a marker for where an exposed rock is in the middle of the river. 

  
I really, really, REALLY don't want to see that flag in the middle of the river until the end of time. AITA for wanting my neighbor to respect our shared public space and to take the flag marker down? And is there anything else I can do?",0.38

"AITA for slacking on chores due to hip surgery recovery?  I (25F) live with my boyfriend (26M) in an apartment. I had to get hip surgery (labral tear repair) in early July which caused me to have crutches for 2 weeks and wear a brace for 3 weeks, which I finally got out of on July 29th. The PA told me I could do whatever minor activity (stretching, chores, etc.) as long as I wasn’t hurting myself. I can’t walk my dog because if she pulls, I can’t hold her back due to the hip recovery. As of posting, it’s been 5 weeks since my surgery, and I’ve only done 2 weeks of weight bearing physical therapy. I’m still very weak on my hip since I have arthritis and 4 anchors holding the tear together. Well, I think I pushed myself a bit too far the first week (last week) of being out of the brace since as soon as it was off, I was going on walks, going out with friends, and doing more chores than I probably should’ve (dishes, sweeping, mopping, vacuuming, lifting, etc.).  Now this week, my hip has been extremely sore, I’m taking more pain meds, and it just hurts to put pressure on my hip for more than a few seconds. Because of that, I’ve stopped doing chores and other things around the apartment that I used to do.

"AITA for telling my friend that a friend cuddled w her bf? Okay so, I and my friends Hera, Lara, Mike, and Edward have a friend group that had a relationship/FWB situation between Lara, and Mike. 

So at a Party, that only Hera, Edward, and Mike were present at, got really drunk, however, Mike remained sober as he refuses to drink. Anyways skipping to the morning when they all woke up from being hammered af, they found Hera and Mike cuddling together whilst asleep, when I first heard of this, I was extremely disappointed, not in Hera as I believe she gets a pass for being drunk, but rather Mike, for taking advantage of a situation and sleeping and cuddling w her. Let’s make one thing clear they did not have sex. At first I told myself to just leave it as maybe it was just a mistake and what not and it doesn’t mean anything as they’re just friends. But slowly as time passed, I saw a flame begin to ignite between them as they spent more time together and would always be with each other at every hang out she went to. They began to get awfully close while Mike was still in a situationship with Lara. 

Now to dive into Mike and Lara, Mike was seriously not good to Lara at all, abusing her physically and mentally, and acting all innocent and putting on a facade just for Lara to come back and try again, but she was only met with disappointment and more mistreatment. I do not want my Hera to end up with that guy especially because I know she can do wayyyy better than him, she’s pretty, smart and funny, he is simply not worth her time. But maybe I’m letting myself get too involved as it isn’t my place to decide such a thing for her. 

Anyways skipping to now, I genuinely believe Hera is falling for Mike, solely based upon the fact that she is spending an abundant amount of time together with him and I’ve seen firsthand how they interact with one another and him changing his profile picture to something he has no interest in but.  Hera for so long that I think I kinda know when she has a crush. Anyways Lara and Mike had finally broken off their situationship or what not recently. I went to go talk to Lara, I told her what happened between Mike and Here and she said she’ll talk to her when they meet next and what not. But I received word that Hera knows I told her and is betrayed by me telling Lara. But I feel it was best to tell her but maybe I should have just cut my mouth closed but I felt since Lara is close with her maybe she can talk her out of being with him or liking him or something. I really don’t want Lara to end up with him. AITA?

"WIBTA for firing my employee following the death of her pet dog? I (36/F) run a small language school with my business partner Jed (43/M). One of our experienced teachers, Mary (33/F), called distraught last Monday morning and said she would be taking bereavement leave. She said she'd forgotten to put her dog in its crate before going on a day trip and came home to find it dead on the floor. Her dog had tipped over a waste basket, tried to eat its contents, and choked on a plastic wrapper.

Where we're located, employees are only entitled to five days of paid bereavement leave following the death of an immediate family member - pets do not qualify. However, given the suddenness and circumstances of the death, I told her she could take Monday and Tuesday off without being docked pay or burning her PTO. Mary said she was aware of what the labor law stated, but was hoping I'd be more flexible. I told her that was not possible. We are a local, non-franchised school; sudden and lengthy teacher absences impact our business, our students, and severely increase the workload of other teachers. She was understandably emotional, so I asked her to either call me or come in before 4 PM on Tuesday to check in and discuss it further. 

She ended up calling at 9:30 PM saying she was still unfit to work. She implied she wanted an additional week off. I reminded her of our school's policy - consecutive PTO of three days or longer require advanced notice of 20 days. I told her she could either use PTO until Saturday or be evaluated by a psychiatrist to go on mental health leave. She then claimed she went to the hospital that morning and was diagnosed with PTSD and depression but refused to provide the official doctor's letter required to claim sick leave. She agreed to use PTO and return to work on Saturday.

Mary showed up on Saturday, which was my day off. Jed called me late in the morning and asked me to come in because Mary went home ""sick"" and he had to cover the rest of her scheduled lessons. She's been calling in sick the mornings of her shifts and hasn't worked since. I know that Mary's dog was only 2 years old, and was a cute little 2 kg toy poodle; I understand how devastated it must feel to see such a small animal in that state and feel responsible. But I also feel I've been very sympathetic in my approach with her. This is a business - it's not fair to keep students and other teachers in limbo while she works through her grief. 

I ended up calling Mary with an ultimatum - if she can neither work nor produce a doctor's letter, she needs to find a new job. Her literal response: ""But my dog died."" She would not commit to working and felt that a doctor's letter (which is just an affidavit confirming the patient is unfit to work and doesn't disclose details) was an invasion of privacy and said ""she needs time."" I told Jed that we should prepare a pink slip. He thought I was being harsh and suggested we give Mary a ""couple more weeks to sort herself out."" I don't agree.

"WIBTA if I (f27) if I end this relationship solely because he (m28) has a child? First time reddit poster and desperate for any advice. I’m a 27 year old female dating a 28 year old male.  He has a 4 year old child from a previous relationship whom he co-parents.  

I have never wanted children of my own for as long as I can remember and still feel that way.  Everything else in our relationship is pretty much perfect, but lately I’ve been overthinking the child factor.  

For some more context, we have been together for about 1.5 years.  I haven’t met his child, and I don’t plan to any time soon, especially without his mother’s knowledge, she is unaware her ex is dating someone and my partner and I don’t see it as something she needs to know.  

I respect my partner as a father to his child before anything else and have always said his child must come first, I have a very strong relationship with my dad and wouldn’t dream of taking that away from anyone.  Lately I have been reconsidering this relationship and don’t know if it’s entirely selfish or the wrong reason to end it.  I don’t want children of my own, so why would I want someone else’s. I don’t mean for that to sound as harsh as it does.  

Even though I have not met his child, there will naturally come a time in the future when I will.  For example, if we end up moving in together, there will be times where his child will stay.  I don’t know if I’m overthinking this or looking too far into the future when I can just be present in the now.  But then I get worried I’ll let this go on too far and regret not ending it sooner, I do believe that ending this relationship due to the child factor and my own preferences on children ultimately benefits the both of us.  For example, I don’t ever want him choosing me over his child, I want him to be the most present dad he can be and I don’t want to get in the way of that.  

There will be times in the future (and has been times in the past) where we have had to cancel plans due to him co-parenting on days/nights he doesn’t usually have his child.  

His ex/mother of his child, has also expressed in the past that she has considered moving states to be closer to family, she would take their child, and my partner has the option to also move to continue to co-parent (not in the same house, but same state) That is something I agree with him doing, and although he does not want to move, he also doesn’t want to be away from his child.  
I would not move and can’t do long distance relationships (I have tried and failed in the past).  

So Reddit, WIBTA if I ended this relationship because I don’t want children? Even after knowing from the beginning that he has a child of his own? ",0.24
"AITA friend said she’d take care of my cats, said she can’t anymore, and now her bf is snapping on me i’m 31 weeks pregnant and my bf and i had to move into his parents house back in may, i have 3 cats but was only allowed to bring 1 of my cats. i made arrangements with my friend to take my 2 cats and take care of them for at least a year (with me paying for food, litter, vet care, etc). 

fast forward to late june she says she can’t take care of them anymore and i asked her for some time to find new arrangements for them. (they’re a bonded pair and cannot be separated). i left a good paying job and had to go part time somewhere else and financially was struggling until recently. the cats needed to be updated on vaccines before going to their new temp home and i just didn’t have the money to do both in one go. i got one vaccinated and was waiting until i got paid again to vaccinate the other. 

her bf has now messaged me saying he’s going to vaccinate my one cat and then give them to a shelter and is telling me i’m walking all over my friend. that he’s not threatening or harassing me. he’s saying it’s not their responsibility to take care of other people’s animals (even though that was the entire agreement from the beginning). he’s talking about her being evicted bc of the cats even though the landlord knows that she’s has them and i made sure to communicate that with him before i moved out of the building.

i’m considering unfriending my friend bc of her bf and uninviting her from my baby shower. AITA for expecting her to take care of my cats like we agreed? AITA for asking for some time to rehome them when she asked in late june? WIBTA for cutting her off? ",0.79

"AITA for being pissed at my friends for ruining my birthday  I 24f had a birthday last week and wanted to go on a camping trip with my best friends. Everyone around me knows how much birthdays mean to me. I might sound like self centered but birthdays are the one day where it is all about me. Growing up, my family would make people feel like they are on the top of the world on their birthdays so I had bought everything to have a perfect celebration in the woods with a tiny cake, balloons a banner and all but my friend were least interested. They just acted like it wasn’t even my birthday but instead took the day to make me feel left out and bullied because they couldn’t stop making fun of me for not knowing how to function in a forest. To give context, they have grown up going camping and being in the Forest a lot but I come from a whole different part of the world where I never got to experience nature like this so obviously I’m new to it. 
I didn’t get to cut a birthday or put my decor up or really do anything that made the day feel like it’s my birthday. I know I sound like a little girl but I always get to blow out the candles and cut my birthday cake. It makes me happy but they were least interested in that. I wanted to play my songs or do smth I would enjoy but no they hate my music and they were rather do smth else so I sat alone on my birthday in my tent and blew out my own candles alone.

"WIBTAH if I comment on fiancés weight gain   I would like to preface this by saying that IM STILL ATTRACTED TO AND VERY MUCH IN LOVE WITH MY FIANCE!! We are in a very happy and healthy relationship. He is so cute and kind and sweet. He is the silliest goober I’ve ever met in my life and he’s probably my one true love. We’ve been together 4 years strong and I don’t see that ever changing. 

  I was looking back in my camera roll tonight out of boredom and seen a pic of my fiance from last year and realized he’s put on a bit of weight. The photo was November 2023, and since then I would guess he’s put on 50-70lbs. I’m just concerned because it seems like a drastic amount in such a short time when I compare the photo to what he looks like now. 

   I started feeding us way more healthy, whole foods a  few months ago (in contrast to good ol southern style smothered and butter fried foods) because I was getting uncomfortable with my own weight. This hasn’t helped him though because he will still pick up fast food and things like that during the day. 

Would I be the a-hole if I pointed this out to him? I don’t want him to feel like I’m not attracted to him, I just want him to be healthy and feel good about himself. I feel like I would suggest to stop eating fast food and stop drinking cokes, but I don’t want to be harsh. I don’t feel like it’s right to make a comment if he’s already feeling bad about his appearance. I can tell he’s becoming uncomfortable with his weight with the small comments he makes about himself, I didn’t really realize how much weight he has put on until tonight though. Should I say something, or should I let him come to a realization on his own? It feels like such a sensitive topic, thank you in advance. ",0.18
"AITA for constantly getting into arguments with my friend? (NEED ADVICE ASAP) This isn't so much just one event, but multiple. I'd post this in a different community, but I like this community because of how they give harsh feedback.

I have this friend group at school, and I adore everyone there, except for this one girl. Let's call her Patty!

Patty is a semi-popular girl at our school. She talks to a lot of people, basically. But a lot of upperclassmen don't like her.

I feel as though she is looking down on me? Like she acts like she's better than me? She brags a lot...

* One time, during a group project, she refused to do any work, and then she deleted a part of the project that I had been working on, so I had to spend the rest of the night fixing it, and then she complained to my teacher about it.
* We were putting together a relay for a school event, and they were looking for a swimmer, and I mentioned that I was on a state team for swimming! And she said, ""Yeah, that's all you ever talk about."" But I'd never mentioned it before...
* When she asked me for a grade I got on my AP Biology test, I said ""I got a B."" She just started laughing.
* She bragged about being able to type with all ten fingers.
* She bragged that she could spell really well.
* She keeps arguing with me about biology concepts, and continuously shut down my contributions for a group project, even though they were correct.
* She keeps telling everyone how many AP classes she's taking.
* I took Precalculus instead of skipping it, and she kept raving about how easy Advanced Algebra 2 is, and how she could skip Precalculus.
* She keeps talking about how she's a professional artist and how everyone compliments her.
* She keeps talking about how she got a 5 in AP Biology (I got a 5, too, but one of our friends didn't and I feel bad because I feel like she's rubbing it in his face, but I don't think he seems to notice so I could be wrong.)

But the thing is, no one else in our friend group or no one else she talks to notices this? Like I don't think they notice that she's bragging, and they keep telling her how smart she is? I don't mind that they're complimenting her, I just think maybe there's something wrong with me, like maybe I'm being paranoid or something because I just see her a different way.

She also spreads rumors about me and my sister, things that aren't true, but because she's popular, everyone believes her. She also says this behind my back, so I don't have a chance to explain or defend myself. I've noticed her talking trash about me to some of my biology teammates so they would be less likely to agree with what I'm saying...

I don't know. I really really like everyone else in my friend group, but they seem to look up to her, and I don't know if it's worth this stress.

I'm probably just being sensitive, but I trust the people on this community more than myself, so I'll leave it up to you all!

"AITAH for not disclosing where a group of famous people will be staying in town, to a fan?  I know of a group of famous people who will be staying and eating in town because I know someone who will be catering to them. 
My dad is a big fan and I'm hoping to get a little hello video from them for him, as a gift but obviously only if they're happy to, from the caterer.
This person and I talked about making that small request and see what happens, but this is one thing already to be intruding on them with this request, I actually already feel kinda iffy about it as it is... but hopeful it'll be taken lightly and they'll be ok with it. 
I shared this idea with my mum in excited anticipation and since then she has non stop nagged me where and when they'll be there so dad can stalk them ?
I find this completely unacceptable. 
This could get that person who shared it with me, in trouble and just be plain rude to be loitering around where they're staying at, especially when dad will be seeing them for the purpose of their visit here anyway.
She won't give up, even after  explaining this to her and she's starting to get mad at me over it.

"AITA Boyfriend doesn’t want to unfollow ex  I’ve been with my boyfriend for over a year and we’ve talked about this issue before. My boyfriend doesn’t want to unfollow his ex girlfriend on Instagram which is something that makes me feel uncomfortable. Maybe it’s because of insecurity but I don’t feel like he’s going to leave me for her or anything. I just find it really strange and I’m not exactly sure why it’s making me uncomfortable. 

Anyways, I brought it up because we were talking about how she had commented on his recent Instagram post and he was making fun of it. So then I proceeded to tell him that I don’t like that they still follow each other and told him that I want him to “get rid of her” like at least remove her from seeing his page (as I had previously talked with him about). This is because a few weeks ago she had requested to follow me on Instagram after he posted me on his story. When I showed it to him we were both saying it was strange and he kept saying to click decline or whatever and I was still holding my phone when he actually clicked it for me. It felt a little weird but I didn’t think much of it. But then I realize it’s strange because he doesn’t seem to like talking to her and they aren’t very close friends. For example he told me he wouldn’t block or remove her unless she asked to hang out with him or something like that. He doesn’t talk to her or want to hang out with her so why does he still want to follow her? He says it’s because he doesn’t want to start anything. He also told me that he didn’t want to remove her from following him because he wants her to see that he’s doing well and basically show me/ our relationship off?

He told me before they mutually broke up with no hard feelings. However, he’s told me that she had broken up with her last partner because she still had feelings for my boyfriend. She also randomly messaged my boyfriend a few months ago asking if he would want something from an event she went to (because she knows he’s into a show), and said she would get him something and he wasn’t opposed to it and accepted the gift which she mailed to him from another state. I told him I found it strange and we agreed but he doesn’t seem to think anything was wrong with accepting it. Apparently the ex is  with someone else now but I’m confused about her actions. 

After the last time I confronted him saying I wanted him to remove her from his Instagram, he got upset at me saying that it’s controlling of me to ask him to do that. I told him that it makes me uncomfortable, and he started saying how I don’t seem to compromise the way he does in our relationship and when I’m uncomfortable I expect him to do something about it rather than accept that he’s right. He then said that I need to work on my insecurities because clearly I don’t fully trust him and at this point I’m confused because now I’m wondering if that’s true. ",0.14
"AITA for not letting my cats watch my snake? I have a corn snake, l've had him for a few months now.

We discovered that our cats (one black cat and one grey cat) like to sit outside the tank and watch him. Mom likes this because it keeps them quiet (they are fairly vocal cats) and they are entertained. I allowed it for about 2 or 3 weeks, but I discovered recently that snakes have a defense mechanism where they freeze when they're scared, this is what my snake does whenever he sees the cats. I of course don't want to freak out my snake so I immediately banned the cats from watching him, but my mother is arguing that the snake isn't that scared of them and actively comes out of hiding to watch them back, l've never personally seen him do this but I see no reason why my mom would lie about that. I think my banning the cats from watching the snake makes my moms life harder because they're more vocal and really bored and now mom has no way to quiet them down.

"WIBTA If I tell our landlord on my roommates pets? Let me preface by giving a backstory. I am a college student that dormed with a random person from facebook. In our apartment there are 4 of us, me & my three roommates Anna, Cait, & Dorthy. When I meet Anna I was told that there would be a cat in the apartment. I was hesitant about it but decided to dorm with her as the rent is relatively cheaper than other places close to campus. A few weeks into our new lease, Cait mentions she got a cat. It is a cute cat and I was ok with it as it was already here and there wasn’t much to do. Dorthy recently decided to adopt a cat, which I need to mention 1. It felt very rushed 2. I technically adopted the cat because she was underage when we went to the shelter ( I know this is my fault but at the time we both went to the shelter it was supposed to be a quick view of the available cats to adopt & two bc she is underage and I was over 18 when I went with her she asked me to technically adopt. My thing is I felt extremely pressured to do it, as she tried to adopt and the person helping us said she couldn’t bc of her age and I was right next to her and she asked me if I could in front of ppl and I couldn’t say no(I know I have no backbone but I felt so awkward). ) I don’t doubt she’ll take care of the cat but the thing is that is our third cat in the house. We all live in a two bedroom apartment and three cats is a lot. After thinking about it more clearly today I feel strongly that it was a bad decision to get the cat. Here’s the thing I don’t know what to do. The cat was put in the bathroom and the bathroom is so dirty with litter everywhere. I know technically our landlord allows us to have pets and I was under the impression that my roommate with the eldest cat was paying the pet rent. I don’t know if she does but I feel like it isn’t my fault if I tell the landlord anonymously that there are three cats living in a small two bedroom apartment. Don’t get me wrong I love cats and the cats are so adorable but I feel like it is a lot of cats in such a small space. I am torn on telling the landlord or just trying to make the most of my situation. So WIBTA if I told my landlord about our cat situation? Our landlord is a really nice lady so I feel like all she’d do is either make them pay the pet rent and potentially tell them 3 cats is a lot but she is so nice that she might just tell them to pay pet rent which I feel like won’t help my situation and just result in them paying more for rent.

"AITA for telling my mom she got what she had coming to her after grandma had her banned from the retirement community she lives at? My mom went behind my grandma's back several months ago and tracked down my grandma's half sister to try and force a reconciliation between them despite knowing grandma did not want to and did not claim her half sister as a real sibling. Grandma was furious. She told my mom that the half sister is just ""some whore's child"" and not her real sibling and her chance to have siblings died with her mom.

After my great grandma died, great grandpa remarried someone who had a very extensive reputation for going after married and widowered men. My grandma thought the woman was disgusting. It wasn't helped by the fact great grandpa's new wife was also the other woman to one of the parents of grandma's friends. So the hatred already existed. They went on to have a daughter together who grandma never looked at as anything other than the woman's daughter. She saw her dad as a traitor and disgusting for going after someone like his wife. So she never formed any connection with her and she moved out at like 16 in order to get out from under them. Great grandpa's wife's reputation proved to be more than true because even while married to great grandpa there were more and more married or widowered men who were going in and out of the house. At some point several years after grandma moved out, her half sister reached out and asked if she would take her because she wasn't happy at home and grandma said no.

That was the last time they spoke. My mom and her siblings grew up knowing grandma had a half sister she wanted nothing to do with. But sometime during her life mom decided she could be the one to change grandma's mind and she waited until grandma was older and grandpa was gone and she's been living alone for two years now (in the retirement community) and she tracked down the half sister, got that woman's hopes up because she always hoped to have a relationship with my grandma and then showed up at grandma's house with the half sister. It didn't go well. The half sister left heartbroken and my grandma tore my mom a new one. I have never seen my grandma actually angry before. She called my mom a bratty little know it all who thought she could ignore people's wishes and boundaries and she told mom that she couldn't look at her. Mom argued back that grandma has a sister and she should know her before it's too late. Grandma sent me to the store to grab some snacks and by the time I got back grandma told mom she was not welcome back there again.

Mom thought grandma would calm down but she learned a couple of weeks later, when she tried to visit, that she was banned from the community. My mom was horrified. She wouldn't stop talking about it at home and I told her she got what was coming to her with what she did. I told her if I did something like that she would ground my ass so fast.

"AITA for taking a book to read from my boyfriend’s collection? 
Last night, my boyfriend (33 M)and I (36 F) got into an argument that I still can't quite wrap my head around. It all started because I picked up one of his books and began reading a paragraph. Out of nowhere, he told me that he doesn't like people reading his books before he's had a chance to read them himself. 

I get that everyone has their quirks, but this one caught me off guard because he never mentioned it before. He has *hundreds* of books, and from what I can tell, he mostly just collects them rather than actually reading them. It's frustrating because it was just a paragraph—hardly the whole book—and I didn't think it would be such a big deal.

Now, I’m left feeling upset. Am I overreacting, or is it fair to be annoyed about this? It just feels like such a small thing to argue over, especially when I didn’t know about this ""rule"" in the first place. Would love to hear your thoughts.

"AITA isn’t ok for you to go on holiday with your ex wife if you have a partner?  
Backstory: my partner has been legally separated from her ex wife for 3 years. They co parent very well.  For info, she was not the instigator of the break up but was cheated on and treated in a very controlling way. 

The last 3 years my partner was single but her priority was the kids and making sure they were secure and did not get affected by the breakup. So she focused on a happy environment and making sure they had good experiences etc. This meaning that she went on ‘family’ holidays still and still did lots as a nuclear family unit. 

Now, I am in her life and in a committed relationship. We are official and open etc. Time scale is getting to know each other slowly since December and were official in March. So this means we have both said I love you and thinking about the future together and merging our lives. For context the ex wife has had a few short lived relationships but is currently single. 

But now, her situation is triggering emotionally quite badly for me. The ex wife has no boundaries when contacting her and over steps on imposing. As in calling for stupid stuff at 10.30pm or demanding my partner do things for het and expects it done asap. But the biggest trigger is the amount of things they still do as a family even though they are separated and live separate lives. They will go away for a night together with the kids to visit family out of town and the biggest trigger is going on holiday together. 

I have talked to my girlfriend about how this makes me feel and that I can obviously understand they want to keep a good relationship for the kids to show no negativity and so they are secure but my boundary is that I cannot be ok with them spending overnight time away or going away on holidays together. 

I’d love to get options from everyone to know if ITA in saying it’s a hard no from me about holidays and some contact must be cut?

"AITA for intentionally changing my password…  I 29(F) share my password for a streaming with my brother 34(M),his family, and his wife’s sister. Since the Netflix’s ‘no password sharing’ ban I haven’t been watching Netflix. I recently injured my knee, I’m on bed rest, and I’ve been hearing about some great shows/movies that’s on Netflix so I looked into buying my own account. It was quite expensive since I would want the ad free version. My friend suggested I asked to be added to my brother’s account because her parents recently added her and it’s only $7.99 a month. I asked my brother if I could be added and just pay him the monthly fee for an added user. It’s in his wife’s name but she agreed and added me as a user. All the communication has been handled by my brother. I was never given any due dates but I figured I just had to remember to send $7 each month. Everything was going fine! Fast forward I told my brother it completely slipped my mind and I would be sending him $14 (fee when added and current month) once I was paid from work. (When I notified him my payday was 5 days away) he said he forgot himself and that it was fine. Two days later I received an email it was cancelled. I reached out to my brother and he was unaware and said he would talk to his wife. I haven’t heard anything back and my account cancels in 5 days. I don’t charge them for the streaming service I share with them and I pay $10.99 monthly for it. I recently picked up a second job and I didn’t want to create more bills for myself because the extra needed funds will cancel out. Part of me wants to get my own ad free Netflix account and change the password for the streaming service I share that know they use frequently but part of me feels bad because it isn’t my brother’s fault and is a non factor in this situation but on the other hand I’m big on principle and fairness. AITA?? 

UPDATE: I did some research and found out I only had it for 1 billing cycle($8) as she cancelled it before being charged again but I HAVE GIVEN MY BROTHER $16 for the inconvenience and told him don’t worry about asking my SIL what happened. ",0.4
"AITA for picking on my friend's bad habits ? Long time lurker here. My(18M) friend James(17M) has a terrible circle of friends, his friends are mostly addicts and smokers. He frequently spends time with them in school and mostly forgets to come by and say hello mainly because he is spending time with them.

One day, as a joke, his other friends accused him of smoking and it became widespread in the school that he smokes for fun with them, and I picked on this subject whenever he was talking to me for fun \* for example asking him the brand of his cigars and etc. \* and told him to get better friends.  
He is very upset at me, because it is a bad rumor about him, yet he still spends time with them.  
So, AITA for picking on this subject ?

"AITA for asking my wife to pick me up from work? I have severe driving anxiety. I'm also currently the only one working between me and my wife. Usually I use public transport or Uber to get to and from work, but my wife does drive me places a lot.

I am very appreciative that she goes out of her way to drive me places. However, multiple times now she has said she will pick me up then ends up falling asleep and either no shows or shows up very late. I've asked her to text me if she is going to take a nap before picking me up so I at least know and she often forgets to.

Today I worked a very stressful and long shift. I knew in advance it would be difficult and my wife offered to drop me off/pick me up from work. I finished late at night so public transport wasn't an option. Then 10 minutes prior to when she was meant to pick me up, she rang me saying she accidentally fell asleep and asked if I could get an uber instead since we live about 30 minutes drive from my work. Uber was about $65. I told her that and said I would prefer if she picked me up since that is a lot of money (which is to support both of us), plus she had originally promised to pick me up. Now we're having an argument as she thinks I'm being unfair. AITA?

"AITA for lashing out on my girlfriend’s best friend? To give some context, there have been many months leading up to this incident and events that triggered this. My girlfriend’s best friend has always had a big disliking for me. I never understood why she didn’t know me personally she never talk to me. She never even knew who I was until I started dating my girlfriend. Ever since the start of our relationship, my girlfriend‘s best friend has been nothing but mean to me, and I can’t understand why I never did anything to harm her. I never did anything mean to her. I always wanted to be friends with her, but I can’t say the same for her. She had such a big problem with me and wanted to get rid of me in the first couple weeks I started dating my girlfriend. I would always catch her saying mean things about me behind my back. Things attacking me and my girlfriend’s relationship, as well as attacking me in general. Bear in mind that I never said anything rude to her prior to these remarks . so naturally, I got fed up. One day I see her talking shit about me to my girlfriend and for once I decided to stand up for myself, so I lashed out on her. I, said very rude things to her and made her cry. My girlfriend and her bestfriend got in a big fight as the best friend exclaimed “why didn’t you defend me?” I naturally got very angry at this as she was the one constantly giving me rude comments and saying very vulgar and insulting things about me. And the one time I lash out on her im in the wrong?  I know i could have handled this more maturely and not say anything to her, but at the same time i was fed up with the disrespect.

"AITA for refusing to eat alone with my husband’s best friend (for context, I live in Seoul South Korea, my husband is Korean, i’m white. We mostly communicate in English, my korean level is i’d say B1/TOPIK 3)

my (24F) husband (32M) usually works in the evening, meaning I eat dinner alone (which I don’t mind btw). I have met all his friends multiple times, we’ve played games together, drank together, even went clubbing together. They know me, I know them. But we’re not really close or anything as they’re his friends and because they’re also quite older than me. Plus there’s the language barrier as they barely speak English and my Korean isnt good enough to get into deep conversations (working on it everyday tho). We live in a very small 2 bedrooms apartment (kitchen is in the livingroom) since June and none of his friends have come over yet and we havent hosted a house warming. Now as I heated up some leftover food my husband called. He said his best friend (let’s call him Sam) was doing his food delivery job, but because off an error the chicken he had on him didnt have to be delivered. Either Sam would throw it away or eat it. However apparently Sam was close to our house, so my husband suggested he could come over and share the chicken with me. Once again my husband was working as well, I was home alone. Sam has never been at our house before, I’ve never hung out with him alone, and with the language barrier and my husband not being there i just felt very uncomfortable. I tried to come up with a few excuses, hoping he’d take the hint that i’d rather not, but he wasn’t taking them. I ended up saying I felt uncomfortable because if I say no Sam has to throw the chicken away. He immediately laughed and apologised, saying he was gonna tell Sam he couldnt come to our house. The moment I hung up the phone I felt bad. And now I’m overthinking it. So AITA for refusing to let him come over? ",0.1
"WIBTA for telling my friend her partner isn’t invited to my place? I (28F) have a friend I went to college with, “Jamie” , we’ve only seen each other 2-3 times  since college IRL due to living far apart; we FaceTime every handful of months. Jamie has lived with roommates up until 2-3 years ago, when she moved in with her partner “Sally” (28?F). Jamie has never lived by herself. I’ve been predominantly single since college and lived with multiple roommates until two months ago, when I got my own place for the first time. 

I FaceTimed with Jamie last night and gave her a video tour of the place, and mentioned that I have a guest bed and two couches so I’m super excited to host friends now that I have the space, if she’d like to come over anytime for like a long weekend I’d love to have her! (With our latest moves we now live “close” to each other, about four hours’ drive away.) She said she’d be down,  it was just me throwing out the offer to her, but Jamie said “we” once or twice in the convo; I thought it was strange but didn’t address it, since it was in passing and not solid plans and surely that would be asked about, if she was referring to Sally?

Well Jamie texted me this morning along the lines of “Sally and I are ironing out our plans for the next few months and we’d love to visit you! What’s the bed situation again etc etc” - Here’s the thing: I don’t know Sally. I’m sure she’s lovely, I have no beef with her, but I don’t KNOW her; I’ve seen her for maybe 20 seconds total of screen time in passing on two FaceTime calls, we’ve exchanged maybe ten words total of “hi how are you”’s, but I’ve never seen her irl and my calls are just with Jamie. We don’t usually talk much about relationships; I could barely tell you 1.5 facts about Sally. I’m VERY territorial / private about my space; I only invite close friends to visit, let alone stay the night. I’ve literally shared a bedroom with Jamie, so I’m comfortable with her, but I don’t know her partner. My other friends are all either single or have pretty independent social lives from their partners; I’m friendly with or friends with many such partners, but invitations have always been just to friends, and if partners have been invited I’ve always explicitly specified it or they have asked me about it, and hanging one on one has never been an issue. And I did not invite Sally, this call was just with Jamie and I only ever referred to her coming over, with most people in my life this has been understood as just them but Jamie has now tacked Sally on without clarifying. 

How do I politely, and with etiquette, mention that Sally isn’t invited? Or do I have to just accept that she’s coming too? Is the etiquette with cohabitating couples that invitations are going to be presumed for both of them unless clarified? I really don’t want to make anyone upset and I have no issue with Sally, but I don’t know her and don’t want a stranger in my space for multiple days and nights. Please advise me!!!",0.47
"AITA for refusing to adapt my schedule?  Hello Reddit,

My girlfriend and I are in our mid-30s. I'm currently unemployed after being laid off, while she’s very successful and takes care of all our financial needs. She works from home nearly every day, only going to the office a few times a month. We live in a small, two-room apartment, with the bedroom being the only space with a door, but she doesn't want to use it as her workspace, which I understand. We also have a terrier who barks at everything, which complicates things.

She has several meetings daily, usually around three, and during these, I’m expected to keep the dog quiet or even leave the apartment with him. I also handle all the cooking and shopping.

Today, we had a bit of a disagreement, and I might have been in the wrong. She had an important meeting, and I refused to take the dog out because I was exhausted. I had done all the grocery shopping that day, carrying home heavy bags. After I returned from shopping, she informed me about another meeting that needed to happen before the important one, and she needed lunch within 60 minutes. I wasn’t thrilled, especially since I have a stomach ulcer right now, but I prioritized her meal.

I’m stressed about being jobless, and we can't pay back debt or save to the rate she wants rn. Still, I’m financially dependent on her, and I’m very grateful for all she does, so I try not to complain about these small things.

The problem is that we have a routine of powerwalking for an hour after her work, which was scheduled less than an hour after her meeting. This meant I’d have to walk the dog for 30 minutes, then immediately go into our workout. I told her I didn’t want to do that because I had only had about 60-45 minutes to myself all day, and even then, I was too tired to focus on anything productive. The morning was also consumed by keeping the dog quiet during her meetings.

I ended up telling her that it’s called “working from home,” not “living in an office,” and expressed my frustration that I’ll never move forward with my own goals if I’m constantly adjusting to her schedule and doing housework.

I feel it’s fair that I should help out as much as possible, but it doesn’t seem reasonable for her to expect me to leave the apartment and neglect my job search with such short notice. I’m considering asking her to give me more advance notice of what she needs from me each day so I can plan better, but if she doesn’t inform me in time, I don’t think it’s fair for her to expect me to drop everything.

That said, I’m also wondering if I’m overreacting or being too sensitive because of the ulcer. I’m not sure if my reasoning matters here, but am I the asshole?",0.08
"AITA Timelimits in the bathroom?  Had an early morning flight and was on a connection in ATL. I went to the restroom, and after finishing up, I was washing my hands and glanced at myself in the mirror for maybe 5 seconds. Then this lady comes up behind me and says, ""Can I get in?"" I thought she was asking for paper towels or soap, but she actually wanted to use the sink I was at.

There were 6 other sinks, some with people who had been there longer than me, but she decided my station was the one she wanted and that I should leave because, in her opinion, my time was up. Really, lady?

I told her I wasn’t done, and she responded, ""You're just looking at yourself."" I said, ""I don't care, I wasn't done,"" and we went back and forth with me repeating, ""I don't care, I wasn’t done."" Finally, I told her to ""f*** off and get a life.""

I’m not someone who usually gets into spats with people, but for some reason, she triggered me. It felt like she had an attitude and singled me out, even though there were people who had been at their sinks much longer than me. I was only at the sink for maybe 20-30 seconds before any of this happened.

It made me wonder if she was trying to exhibit some kind of superiority by getting me to move. As I was drying my hands and looking in the mirror for a few seconds, she started with me. Also, why didn’t she ask the 5-6 other women at the sinks to move? Why did she target me? Is it because I’m a POC and they weren’t? (Not trying to go that route, but the thought crossed my mind.)

Last I checked, there wasn’t a time limit on using the sink in the bathroom. Or did I miss the memo?

"AITA for exposing sister as a bigot? My (F51) sister (F56) confessed to me that she voted Reform in the last general election. As a family, we are mostly Lib Dem or Green voters (parent was an LD Councillor for years). Sister has becoming increasingly right wing, following people like Tommy Robinson and Nigel Farage on Twitter. She has also said to me, “Islam is a hateful religion” (although she denies it). She is anti trans and is adamant that you “cannot change your sex” and that gender does not exist. She was attacked at 16 which wasn’t dealt with at all well by the family and left her traumatised. Sister also has chronic illness so is at home on her own going down internet rabbit holes, led to some dark places by algorithms. 

Here’s where I may be the AH. 

I said I thought she had voted Reform at the election and she smirked at me. I was pretty shocked and disappointed, but kind of left it at that - I said I didn’t want to talk about politics with her anymore.  I don’t recall her saying “don’t tell anyone”, but maybe I should have realised that voting is a confidential matter. 

Fast forward a few weeks and I was talking to my Spanish sister-in-law about current events and mentioned that Sister had voted Reform. SIL was a bit shocked but not that surprised. However, the more SIL has thought about it, the more offended she became that Sister had voted for an anti immigrant party, not just for herself as an immigrant, but also for the kids (9&11) who have dual nationality.  So now my Brother and Other Sister know and have been vocal in their disapproval. This has culminated in Brother and SIL not wanting Reform Sister to have anything to do with the kids and to give them all space. 

Reform Sister has exploded at me, saying I betrayed her trust and that she will never forgive me. She has unfriended me on Social Media and is not answering any texts. I have tried to let her know that I will not cut her off from my (possibly trans) child and that my door is open. 

Am I the AH for breaking Sister’s confidence (that I didn’t know was a secret), ruining her relationships with Brother, SIL and kids and throwing a grenade into the middle of a previously close family?

"WIBTA if I threw out my roommate's bowl and food because it's riddled with mold? I (24M) have been living with the same roommates for the past couple years, and generally things are fine, except my roommate Richard (28M) has a nasty habit of buying a shit load of food and then leaving it to rot in the fridge. I don't even like using it or going into the kitchen because it's so fucking nasty. I've genuinely been living off of take out and boxed mac and cheese this entire time because I don't feel comfortable storing my food in what is essentially a cold compost heap. But I can't afford to do that anymore and so I'd like to actually use the fridge. I opened it up yesterday and found three different blocks of moldy cheese, God knows what else, and a bowl of tomato soup covered in seran wrap that's essentially just a petri dish at this point. It took me a moment to identify it as soup because the surface of it is 80% mold. 

Honestly I just want to bin it all. I can't imagine Richard would actually miss this shit because my understanding is that he does this because of depression and executive dysfunction and not because he's a hoarder or something. But at the same time that bowl doesn't belong to me, I don't know who it belongs to, or if it predates all of us. I know that throwing out something that doesn't belong to me is technically stealing, and that might make me TA. But at the same time it has two or three species of mold growing in it, I'm not fucking washing it, and I really don't want to risk accidentally eating out of it in the future (it's identical to two or three other bowls). 

I know I should probably talk to Richard about this and maybe even ask him to clean it up. But I don't think he'd listen to me. Because of our age difference he doesn't really respect me (we're technically in two different generations and I guess that really matters to him 🙄). He just kind of just treats me like an annoying little kid he has to get along with because we live together and because we're both friends with one of our other roommates. Also even if he does listen to me me about cleaning out the fridge I know damn well that that bowl is going to get washed and put right back in the cupboard. He's done it before.

My bestfriend Ashley is one of the most thoughtful people I know. One of her love languages is gifts. 

So this weekend we went on a long weekend trip out of state. We arrived on Saturday. She was leaving a day early (yesterday - Tuesday) to get back to work. We spent the day apart as there where some excursions I wanted to do that she wasn't interested in (intentionally waited because of this) and I was leaving early in the morning the next day (today - Wednesday). When I got back to our room she had left a note, which was really sweet (super thoughtful) saying how much she enjoyed our trip and thanking me for inviting her (I was originally going to come alone). Next to the note was a 1000 count puzzle. I love puzzles and she knows that (again super thoughtful). The problem is I only brought a small bag, the kind you have to carry. I prefer to travel light and the puzzle makes it difficult to zip back up. And while not a ton of extra weight, just bulky, the bag isn't durable enough to check. I have to lug it from the hotel (taking local bus to airport that includes a 10 minute walk) and around the airport. 

I thanked her for the note, I thought it was really sweet. She asked if I liked the puzzle (I can be picky about the ones I choose so she asked if I liked it) would I be an asshole if I told her while I appreciate the thought, I would have preferred just the note and not the extra luggage?",0.78
"AITA fo not giving my son his raffle money? My dad asked me to write this for him, so if it seems like my account isn't matching to the speaker that's why.

I (57M) am a single father to three kids: Fred (23M), Percy (20Enby), and Henry (18M). Every year my company does a family picnic thing, and there are a bunch of raffles you can enter. One of the raffles gets you a chance to win $4,500, and in the 35+ years working here, I've never won. 

This year, without their knowledge, I payed the $50 for each ticket and entered one ticket for me, and one for each of my kids. I could have put down the same amount of tickets under my own name, but I thought it would be cute for it to feel like it was for all of us. Lo and behold, Fred's ticket was pulled, and we won the money! I announced it to the kids by telling them exactly that, that Fred's name was pulled and we won.

My intention with this money was to give $500 to each of them, and keep the rest for myself. I thought this was clear, especially considering none of them were able to come with me to the picnic this year and had no idea I was even entering their names. When I talked to Fred however, he told me he expected to receive all the money and was disappointed. I pay for his college, he has no job (which I encourage so he can focus on his studies), and he said he thought this would give him some extra money to keep himself afloat without asking me for money. Ultimately though, whether I give him the money or split it, the money would function exactly the same, but I understand his point of view.

"AITA for staying friends with parts of my ex boyfriend’s family? AITA for staying in touch with parts of my ex boyfriend’s family?

A little backstory 
I (22F) had been together with my ex (24M) for 5 years, since I was 16 and he was 18. We were both pretty close with each others families, I especially with his younger sister (14F), who I since I met her when she was 9 have seen as my own sister, and his former stepmom (his sisters mom).

Me and my ex boyfriend broke up around 6 months ago. For me at the time it was out of the blue, but looking back I could see the signs and I found out afterwards he had cheated on me.

After we broke up we lived together for about a month and a half due to financial reasons on both sides. During that time we both spent a lot of time at his former stepmoms house.
After he moved out of our apartment I still spent a lot of time at them and I also learnt from them he had cheated on me during our relationship, which they also took very strongly too since the reason his sisters mom is no longer with their father is because he had cheated on her multiple times.

And now since then I’ve still been spending a lot of time at their house, chatting and hanging around, I’m also friends with his little sister older half brother (22M) so that makes it so I’m there many times. I’ve also taken his sister out on a few “girl dates” 2-3 times since we broke up, and I’ve now learned that he’s really angry at me and them for still talking.

There’s a lot of other things connected to the breakup that they are angry with him for, but I’ve never been the one to say it to them, since I do believe it’s his family and I shouldn’t be the one to talk bad about him to his family.

"AITA for being uncomfortable around my sisters boyfriend? Hello, so I had an experience and simply wanted some outside input on the situation. My sister recently got into a relationship a few months ago and I met him a few times before all this, a few people in my family and even her herself had warned me that he was a little southern rednecky sort of type but he was very nice when I had met him, he did say a few slurs which I was not okay with but didn’t say anything since I didn’t feel it was the time or place to “call him out” for it.

But this time that they came over to visit, he was talking and recounting a joke he’d heard which I won’t retell since it is specific to our situation and I don’t want anyone guessing(that I know) but it was a joke about trans people, not a terrible one, but when he went to say trans people he said. 
“Transvestites, or transgenders”
And this made me very uncomfortable, the term transvestites specifically. One reason it made me so uncomfortable is because I myself am trans and truly do not surround myself around people that would joke or say things like that. 

So basically after that happened I didn’t really want to talk to him much or spend much time around him so I went back to my apartment early and talked to my dad about it over the phone and he agreed that it was odd and that him saying the other slurs had also put him off, but my mother on the other hand loves my sisters boyfriend and that she doesn’t have too “watch what she says” around him. 

This obviously made me even more so uncomfortable which just pissed everyone off. So the question is am I the asshole or am I overreacting about all this? I know he wasn’t being malicious and I don’t think he’s a bad person, the usage of the terms so casually just made me very uncomfortable. Any comments would be helpful, I just want some perspective, thank you.",0.15
"AITA for not getting my girlfriend a job with me? For context, I (21F) graduated college this past December and started working full time. My girlfriend (22F) is still in college and will graduate this upcoming December. We live in the same town, with different roommates. 

I started this full time job right out of graduation as a way to save up for once she graduates and we move. Since she is on track to graduate a whole year after me, I took on this job knowing I would only be working with this company until she graduated and our leases end (next August.) 

She has never had a job during the school because she works over breaks to have money for the school year. This past summer she had an internship so she didn’t get to save up. She wants a job for her last semester until our leases end. I work in construction management, she is majoring in fashion merch. I bought up the funny idea of her working with me in construction. Just for gigs I asked my managers if we could give her a job and they were all for it and would hire her part time. I was for it until I got to thinking about it.

 For one, isn’t it a bad idea to work the same job as your partner and keeping personal/work life separate? Second, I think this is my underlying fear, we are obviously lgbt, and I work in construction in rural North Carolina. It’s already hard to know who it’s safe to discuss my relationship with at work and who to avoid. I don’t want treatment to change or sway if I bring my relationship to my workplace. Third, my managers aren't reliable and talk out of their ass. I’ve asked about the job since then and they’re barely responsive about it, although I haven’t technically pushed on it. 


There's more thought to it but I guess these are the basic points. All in all, I ended up basically explaining to my girlfriend that I didn't want her to work with me because I didn't think it was a good idea to mix personal and work life, and because this isn't a company you can just work part time for and then quit instead of going full time after, and we both quit at the same time to move.

 She had already told her parents the idea because she was excited about it. She loves hands on jobs like construction and I do believe this would fit her well. She then had to tell them that I decided it wasn't a good idea. They are pissed at me for not helping get her a job because family should help family. But she just needs a temporary college part time job, this is my full time job that doesn't hire part time for college students, they hire full time interns turned to full time employees.

Her family's been giving me treatment because they're mad I didn't get her a job and I should have stuck to my word and helped her because that’s what family does. Am I the asshole for not wanting her to work with me?",0.74
"AITAH Baby daddy drama Hi, I am a 24 year old mother of 2. I have been with their father on and off for almost 6 years now. And I can’t take it anymore. When I was pregnant with our first daughter at 19 he wasn’t the greatest. He stayed out with friends way too late and I would find tinder and other dating apps on his phone. Being 19 pregnant and not having the best home life I stayed. Fast forward I’m 20 and spend my entire tax return getting an apartment, he doesn’t pitch in 1 cent. We both work and he gives me $550 a month for the rent but besides that I cover everything else. He does end up getting a better job and provides a lot more and then, cause of his stupid and dangerous driving habits, loses said job and we are plunged into financial hardship as I am now pregnant again and can’t work as much. After having my son I start working again and things get better financially but relationship wise it’s awful. When I went into labor with my son he actually made me wait while he finished his video game match before driving me to the hospital, ignoring me crying and begging him to get off. After his birth he’s distant. The minute he gets home from work it’s straight to his computer, not even giving me and the kids a glance. When I get home from work at night the house is a disaster with the kids not bathed or fed, completely ignored. I snapped and one day moved all his stuff to his parents house and ignored him. I was doing fine on my own until I got a bat infestation in my house so bad it required me and the kids to move into his parents house while I look for a new and overall better place. With being together again he’s been trying really hard to work on our relationship, gets the kids to bed, and works a lot of overtime. He says we should get a much nicer place together that would benefit the kids but the issue is I don’t love him. He’s trying so hard to be different and for our family to be together but my feelings for him are so far gone I feel nothing and the thought of moving out and getting a place with him terrifies me. But what else do I do? Move into a small apartment I can afford on my own and not give my kids the privilege of a 2 parent household? Or be depressed forcing myself to be with someone I don’t love? Recently I did sneak out to see a man I was taking to when me and the kids father were broken up and it was so nice seeing him again. I’m so scared to be trapped living a life I don’t want when I’m happier on my own. Would I be an asshole for getting my own place with the kids and leaving him again? ",0.57

"AITA for telling my sister-in-law, she doesn't need to greet me when she comes to the house anymore My sister-in-law (husband's sister) and I have a very bad history of not getting along. She is a very conniving and manipulative person. The people in our lives, have accepted her personality and think that her behavior is normal. We had a falling out several years ago when there was a death in the family. Instead of being traditional, and letting people bring food to the funeral to support the family, she decided that she was going to cater the entire funeral and asked me for my help. Out of the kindness of my heart and support my husband I had to help. We end up having a spat because she was very nasty to me over a tray of rice and so I left after completing all of my items that I needed to make for the funeral. the day of the funeral came and she did not bring one thing that I made to the after dinner and proceeded to tell everyone that I did not make what I was supposed to make. I have evidence that I did make what I was supposed to make and that she lying. Fast forward to Christmas last year. I gave her a gift with her grandson's picture on it and, try to extend an olive branch in return. She gave me a Funko pop of evil queen sitting on her throne and a Chucky toy that says do you wanna play? Needless to say I was hurt because she gave me such a spiteful gift in return for a gift that I gave her that I thought was nice.

"AITA for wanting my birthday present to be a surprise?  Me, F19 and my boyfriend M23, have been together for a little over a year now. My birthday is coming up and I've been really busy with moving into my first ever dorm room at university, plus work, and saying goodbye to all of my friends who I likely won't see for a very long time.

Throughout our entire relationship, whenever special occasions would happen and my boyfriend wanted to get me something, I would tell him what I wanted and he would get it for me. This would go even for simple things like flowers and things like that, because if I didn't ask, he wouldn't know. He maintained that he's bad with gift giving and I maintained that I hate surprises being held over my head which I think he misconstrued as me hating surprise presents at all. In actuality I just hate people teasing me about it.

I started the conversation by saying that this time I wanted my birthday present to be a surprise. He is surprised about this and starts getting anxious, and I tell him that just this once I'm too busy to put in the effort to decide what I want, and was hoping he could. He starts getting anxious about it and saying he doesn't know what to get me. I open a Google search and show him how easy it is to Google things pertaining to the things him and I like, and present ideas. This doesn't help, and by this point he's crying and the situation escalates from there. He was crying out of pure fear of getting me a present that I didn't specifically ask for. It made me feel guilty, selfish, and evil for asking for it to change even just once. I told him at this point that I just don't want anything at all. He said no, that he'd do it, just that he wishes I would have told him that I didn't like the way things were. I told him it was literally just this one time that I'm really busy, and that him crying over that is villanizing me for something I didn't even do, and that it makes me not even want a birthday present at all because of how horrible it makes both of us feel. I said word for word ""you crying over it feels like you're villainizing me for something I didn't do, in an attempt to make me feel guilty so that ill console you and make me tell you you don't have to do it.""

This may have been mean, but this was when my emotions were highest, and he does this in pretty much every fight and conflict we ever have, so it gets kind of frustrating. I just need advice. Was I too mean? ",0.55
"AITA for Writing a Story Based on My Ex I (33F) recently published a short story on a popular writing platform. The story was inspired by a past relationship with my ex, ""Parker"" (34M). In the story, I changed all the names, altered significant details, and fictionalized most of the events to create a story that was only loosely based on reality. 

Parker somehow found the it and immediately recognized himself in one of the characters. He reached out to me, furious, accusing me of airing our ""dirty laundry"" for the world to see. He said that despite the changes I made, the essence of what happened was still there, and that I had no right. He demanded that I take the story down, saying it was a violation of his privacy and an unfair portrayal of our past.

I tried to explain that the story was a work of fiction and that I had gone out of my way to make sure it wasn’t a direct retelling of our specific relationship. I pointed out that writers often draw inspiration from their lives and that the character was a blend of different experiences, not just ours. I also mentioned that no one who read the story would know it was about him unless he told them.

He still says that I crossed a line. He’s been telling mutual friends about it, and now some of them are saying I should have been more careful, even if I didn’t mean any harm. On the other hand, others argue that as a writer, I have the right to express myself.

"AITA for my baby not going to his grandparents?  
My partner and I planned for him to take our baby and two kids (from my previous ex) to go visit his parents while I’m gone. When he messaged his Mom to let her know what time they will arrive. She proceeded to say that she’s not feeling well enough and to only bring the baby with him. She also added that she just want to focus on the baby.

For context, my kids are big enough to play on their own and are pretty independent. My partner is also more than capable enough to take care of our three kids. 

I also want to add that his parents are super traditional. As a single mother coming into their son’s life, I’ve always felt like an outsider. And his mom made sure of it. 
For instance, my partner invited me and one of my child (this was before we had our baby) to join a family dinner. His mom stared me down and was very upset that my child and I was there. She then proceeded to get up and tell my partner to go outside with her and told him to never bring me around to any functions, holidays or celebrations. He then asked why she dislike me, but she wouldn’t give him an answer. I can think of many more instances as to why I feel the way I feel from my experiences with his parents.

In conclusion, I decided that it’s best to not bring our baby to his parents. I just feel that she’s making an excuse not to have my children around. I told my partner that I will not enable and tolerate that type of behaviour. I have been flexible and accommodating. I even encouraged my partner to bring the baby with him alone last week to visit. But it is not okay to treat me and my children like an outsider.

I also asked my partner to have a chat with his mom. But my partner said it wouldn’t matter because he can’t force his mom to let my children go there. He also said that he feels like him and our baby are in the middle of this. 
I told him I completely understand how he feels but I am not going to allow someone to cross my boundaries.

"AITA for Yelling at my Mom, Telling Her to Clean the Dishes Herself, and Storming off to My Room?  I (19F) just lost my temper and yelled at my mom (45) to clean the kitchen herself before storming off to my room.

These past 2 weeks I’ve taken on most of the housework because my mom had surgery for carpal tunnel in her left hand. Everyday I clean the bathroom, toilets, bedrooms, kitchen, living-room, pantry, wipe down all mirrors, hoover ALL rooms in the house and the stairs. I get my younger siblings (11F and 9M) to set the table when we eat. I also cooked once after her surgery, but I guess she didn’t enjoy it, so she either gives me instructions or cooks herself. I do the dishes.

At first, I was really slow with the cleaning and she kept complaining about it, and the fact that I wouldn’t mop the floors. I’ve only mopped upstairs once or twice. I’ve never cleaned a whole house on my own, so I’m not used to it. I felt like she was ignoring my efforts but didn’t say anything.

Today she was complaining whilst taking out the trash saying “you never remember to take out the trash. I have to always do it myself”. Then she found her clay mask in the trash, and was furious at me (I put it in the trash). I tried to explain to her that when I used it, it was full of water and broken down. I checked the packaging and it expired years ago so I tossed it in the trash. She didn’t care and insisted she was going to use it. I kept emphasising that it was unusable but she wouldn’t listen. I snapped and shouted “you won’t even listen to me! Clean the kitchen yourself, I don’t care!” and stormed off to my room.

My mom came to my room to complain again. This time she criticised how I never once mopped the floor or cleaned the guest toilet since I started doing the housework. After complaining, she left and came back again to tell me that the cause of our arguments is because I’ve strayed away from religion. She lectured me and told me “don’t expect god to make your life easy if you won’t pray properly”. 

I feel so unappreciated. All she does is point out my flaws when I’m just trying to help her. Not once has she thanked me— only complaints. I don’t expect her to thank me because helping her out is the bare minimum, but can’t she at least appreciate me trying? or is it wrong of me to want that?

She came to my room for the third time to ask me to run an errand for her. Also, when I went back downstairs, she offered me fruit. She told me about her day as we ate the fruit.. as if we didn’t just argue. 

I want to talk to her and sort this out but I know she will shut me down because it was ‘my fault’.  I don’t resent her and love her, but explaining to her that I feel unappreciated is so difficult. Plus there’s a language barrier— she can’t speak much English and is fluent in her native language. I can speak it a little and will occasionally use English words if I’m struggling. I feel so lost. I don’t know how to explain my emotions to her.

I’m not sure how to finish this post off. so AITA?",0.52
"AITA for not responding to my best friend because of surgery 
I (f, 28) have a best friend (f, 29) with whom I’ve had a very close relationship. We used to meet two to three times a week and were in daily contact over the phone. Then my situation changed because I moved 150 km away. Although she was disappointed, she accepted that we wouldn’t be able to see each other as often anymore.

Four weeks ago, we saw each other in person for the last time. Two days later, she sent me a short message asking how I was doing. However, during that time, I had an unexpected surgery, which she still doesn’t know about. Because of the surgery, I didn’t have the energy to respond.

Now, four weeks later, I’m feeling better, and I’m wondering why I haven’t heard from her since then. Apart from that one message, I haven’t heard anything from her. Wouldn’t a best friend wonder why the other suddenly isn’t responding? Now that I’m healthy again, I’m asking myself why I haven’t heard from her since, even though we used to be in contact every day. If the situation were reversed, I would’ve immediately worried why she wasn’t responding and if something had happened to her.

Now I’m wondering if I'm the asshole because I did'nt responde to her message. So she would be right not to text me again.

"AITA for ""talking s**t"" about my mother? for context: Me (F15) and my (strict-ish) mom (F43) have been having more of these little arguments lately. Sometimes they're pretty reasonable (ex. me eating too much candy or something) but sometimes they're straight up ridiculous (ex. when she was convinced that my old-a** samsung was better than the latest iphones (shes very anti-iOS lol )).

So, me and my classmates/friends have recently turned 15, and we are now legally allowed to drive mopeds and such, which is very helpful in a
small town like ours, where it's around 14km (like 9ish miles) for me even to the nearest grocery store.

Most of my friends have mopeds and they can now go do some little part- time jobs and earn money for themselves. I do not have a moped, nor did i have a job this summer, because of social anxiety, didnt want to look for a job and i couldnt really go anyways, which now leads us back to the argument part:

Today I brought up the fact that one of my friends (lets call her Maya) works 2 jobs at the moment to afford all the gas and also some other pretty important stuff i wont get into now. (I brought this up because we had plans for tomorrow but she had work so she couldnt make it.)

So i tell this to my mom, and she started going on about how Maya's so hardworking and lovely, but it quickly turned into her complaining about how i havent done any work during the summer and how i am lazy and how i should ""take notes"" about how hardworking my friends are.

Now, i love my mother very much, but this has been kind of a daily thing that everyday i bring something up and somehow she makes it about me in a negative way. I don't like arguing so i dont usually even fight back unless its like VERY ridiculous.

Here's the possible a-hole part: I have started complaining to my friends pretty much everyday about the things my mom says and i might come off as mean in some of them, even saying stuff like ""f*ck, now shes criticizing me for some s**t again"" (direct quote from me). 

Some of my friends think I'm the a-hole for not keeping it between me and my mother and how im ""hypocritical for criticizing my mother for criticizing me"". I just think it's relieving to kinda just tell them outloud about whats going on, especially all the ridiculous stuff. But since some of my friends told me i am the a-hole for talking shit about my mother, i've been thinking about this a lot. So, AITA?

And again, I'm only 15, so if im the ridiculous one here, i understand. I also dont speak english as my first or even second language, so im sorry if theres mistakes!! 

I tried to keep it short enough that someone could read this to the end, so im leaving a lot of details out about my friends and my relationship with my mother, but I don't think they're important as for the story, but if someone wants more info, just feel free to ask in the comments <3",0.35
"AITA for asking my boyfriend about marriage? I’m a 20y F and my bf is 25y M. We have been dating for a little over a year now, but I believe our relationship has matured a lot overtime. We no longer have stupid arguments, we agree on most things and when we don’t, we always come to an understanding. Before we even started dating I told him that I wanted someone to marry and that couldn’t take long as I did not want to start my family too late (in my perspective). We both live alone, but I particularly moved to his city about 6 months ago so we could be closer (I used to live 40 miles away). We have talked about marriage before, we were very excited to get engaged, even looked at rings and took pictures with it together. After that first talk he didn’t bring up the subject anymore which I thought was weird, he didn’t seem excited about it anymore when I brought it up, I had this feeling of disappointment as I built expectations in my head, his answer was that we weren’t ready yet and he changed his mind because we argued very often at the time, I took accountability for it and decided to change my responsive behavior, we now only have conversations about what we dislike. A Couple months went by and still nothing, I saw a lot of change within our relationship, we planned big trips, he bought a car under his name for me, he even mentioned how he is going to be very protective once we have our kids but still no sign of marriage.

"AITA for being angry about my husband not listening to my professional advice twice I'm a doctor, and recently my husband had two accidents. First, he burned his hand with hot water, and then he cut his hand while doing some work around the house. Both times, he asked for my advice on how to treat the injuries, and both times, he ignored my suggestions.

I work in emergency medicine and deal with wounds frequently. My advice was simple and inexpensive (he doesn’t like to spend)—just disinfect the area and cover it with a sterile dressing. The cut would have benefitted from stitches, but now he’ll probably have a scar because the skin didn’t adhere properly. I even offered to take him to my facility for the stitches, but he refused, saying he preferred to spend his evening differently. Instead, he just washed the wound with water and used a small bandage.

Now, I’m frustrated that he ignored my advice, and he’s angry with me for being upset. He says I’m being unnecessarily harsh and that I don’t have the right to tell him what to do. He thanked me for my care but believes he handled the situation fine, even though the second wound just happened yesterday, so we don’t really know the outcome yet. I tried to explain that proper care could prevent infection and scarring, but that didn’t change his opinion. He also pointed out that I don’t always follow his professional advice (we share some work in a field unrelated to medicine), which is true, but I feel this situation was more straightforward with less room for debate. His advice to me often involves online business, which is more variable.

My main frustration stems from feeling like my time and words are wasted, and that he doesn’t respect my expertise. I even consulted a surgery colleague about his wound, was late to my exercise class to respond to his texts, and offered to take him to my workplace for sutures, even though it would take a lot of time out of my already tight schedule. He didn’t ask for this extra effort, so I’m partly angry at myself for caring so much when he clearly doesn’t.

I understand his reasoning to some extent, but I’m upset about how he’s handling this. To me, his communication feels arrogant, though that might be just my perception. I expected him to come home today and try to make amends, but instead, he’s angry that I’m angry. I told him, “You don’t have to follow my advice, but then why ask?” To which he responded, “Okay, then don’t ask me about online business if you’re not going to take my advice.”

"AITA for telling my teenage son that I am closer with my younger sons and that's how it is? I have four boys who are 17yo, 12yo twins and a 7yo.

My 17yo son Jeremy is exceptionally close with his mom. They do things together like go grocery shopping and walk the dogs. I know he tells her things that he doesn't tell me. I am totally cool with that. 

My younger kids are far more close with me than with their mom. We just have a certain rapport. I can literally walk up to them and give them a big kiss on the head and they don't mind. They like to sleep in my bed and we do cool things like take early morning weekend hikes.

The other day Jeremy asked if he could throw a senior back to school party. I said sure. He asked if he could use my office which is empty on the weekends in a ritzy high-rise commercial building. I said sure. Your mom and/or me can supervise and you can let your friends parents know. 

He said, no. It's a ""parent free"" party. I said I'm not cool with that. It's not like I'm going to try to hangout. Once I see things aren't getting crazy then I'd leave. He said no. So I said no party.

He then accused me of playing favorites with my younger kids and how they get to do whatever they want. I asked him to name me one thing. He said I let them jump off the roof into the pool and had a sleepover of 8 kids for the twins birthday. I said yes and I was around.

"AITA for the way I communicated to my boyfriend about our next date? My boyfriend stayed overnight at my place on both Monday and Tuesday. On Tuesday, we talked about when he could come over next, and I said that I _might_ have to run some errands after work on Wednesday (today), and that I would have to come back to him on whether I had time. 

I did have to run those errands today, and I told my boyfriend around noon, and that I would tell him when I'd be done once I knew. Around 5:30 PM  I knew I would be done around 7 PM, and I told him so. However, I also said I was feeling tired, and wanted to go to bed before 11 PM. We stayed up to 2 AM both times he was over this week, so we only got ~5.5 hours of sleep both nights, and my back was hurting from sleeping in a weird position the night before.

He told me ""If you're not tired and want to meet up, let's do so. If you want to relax, let's do so another time."" I'm paraphrasing, as was not originally written in English. 

I responded by saying that I wanted to see him, but I _also_ wanted to relax, and that I could take a painkiller and come back to him later about whether I felt better. In my mind, ""later"" would be in ~30 minutes, when the painkiller would've had time to work, still around an hour before I'd even be home, but I did not state which timeframe I had in mind.

However, this upset my boyfriend, who said I didn't respect his time. Early on in our relationship, I cancelled a date a few hours before we had agreed to meet up, due to circumstances I knew about ahead of time, but underestimated. He said the same thing about respecting his time back then. I was in the wrong then, and promised to be more considerate.

I explained that I meant 30 minutes later, and apologized. He said situations like this hurt and disappoint him. He said ""he was waiting to see me, and then I tell him I'm too tired to see him, not very nice."" 

I never told him I was too tired to see him. In my mind, I tried being considerate of him by implying I wouldn't be very energetic, and that we wouldn't have many waking hours together. When he told me we should find another time if I wanted to relax, I delayed making a decision in an attempt to perk up for him, as I assumed he didn't want to come over if I were feeling tired.

I don't feel like I did anything wrong on the face of it, but I feel bad for upsetting my boyfriend. He believed we had planned for him to come over today, and that I would just till him when, while I believed I'd tell him when I'd be free, and that we'd make plans from there.

There is a complicating aspect to the story. My boyfriend is learning _my_ language. I'm so proud of him, and I think he's a brilliant learner. We usually communicate in this language when texting, which is where the entirety of this conversation took place. There are also cultural differences between him and me, and connotations of the language that I find obvious aren't evident to him.

We r online friends since i moved but last night they told me to turn on my camera and they screamed and died of laughter at my face. I just sat there for about 20 minutes while they ridulced me, saying i looked old, dead, ugly, and how they expected me to look better and how “it’s not looking good for you” stuff. It was like mental torture, the more i looked at myself in the camera too, the worse and worse i felt about myself.

And they keep telling me that they’re trying to help me to go from “little me” to “big me”

i’m short and ugly and mid. I hate the way I look and they’ve made me so insecure. They get a bunch of girls and shame me for not being able to get any girls come up to me first.

When i told them to stop they laughed and said “i didn’t think u were actually being serious” in a condescending way. 

I’m so tired man. I want to stop talking to them but I also don’t want to give up/let them hurt me. But it’s hard. 

Am i just being the asshole for being too sensitive about it or are they the asshole?

"AITA for being disappointed my boyfriend got the wrong drink? My boyfriend (24M) and I (24F) were on vacation. I really loved this drink spot because we don’t have anything like it where we live. We stopped by and decided to get and share the peach milk tea. We were discussing it a minute before ordering. When he walked up, he ordered a completely different drink. After he came back, I asked him what’s up with that and why he ordered something else. He says “Oh shoot I completely forgot and blanked.” I was starving and pretty annoyed but I know it happens and it was a mistake so I tell him it’s alright, no worries. I was a little irritated and went quiet for a little to try and get over it. 

Here’s the part that I’m stuck on: he proceeds to get upset at me for seeming annoyed and tells me he doesn’t like my attitude. At this point I went from mildly annoyed to quite irritated. I never once verbally made him feel bad and even assured him that it was okay, I just needed a minute because I was really excited for this drink. He tells me that my quietness makes him feel like he messed up and that I’m inconsiderate for being annoyed at his mistake. Am I the AH? ",0.86
"AITA for making my future in-laws choose between my wedding and their daughters first college softball game?  I (25F) and my fiancé (29m) are getting married this fall. We decided to keep things small with a micro wedding, only inviting our immediate families. We also planned our wedding date just over 4 months out, so it could be considered a rush to most people. But since it is so small we only had to check with a few people to see if the date worked. My family is 100% on board and excited for the trip. My fiancé's family is feeling the opposite as his sister (18f) will be having her first college softball season. When we chose our date we asked everyone if that works and everyone said yes. FIL did say that SIL might have softball but they haven't heard anything yet and they didn't know any specific dates. We asked if she could possibly skip the game and they said they would ask the coach. The venue confirmed the date so we just went with it. Now almost 1 1/2 months since we chose the date, the softball schedule has been released it turns out her first college game is the same day as our wedding. Of course we are bummed but asked if she'd be willing to miss the game. Which we know is a big ask. She said she will talk to her coach. Since then we've been asking if she's called or emailed her coach and she just keeps putting it off. Which if she doesn't come we will be sad but understand. Since then my future in-laws have been nothing but negative about our wedding. ""We are causing them to miss their daughters first college game."" ""We should've been more thoughtful when picking our date."" ""We aren't being fair."" Are just some of their complaints. They are going around town openly complaining to people about our wedding. And anytime we go over to the house they ask why we can't wait till next year or choose a different date. The are constantly giving different suggestions but never in a nice way.

"AITA for telling hubby he needs to wear PJs to bed once we have a kid? My husband (37M) and I (34F) are expecting our first kid in a few months. Hubby generally only sleeps with a T-shirt on (no underwear/pants) because he likes the “freedom” down there. Up until now, even though I don’t like it, I’ve had the opinion that “you do you”. 

However, given we have a kid on the way, I feel very strongly that he should have something covering up his nether regions. We don’t plan to cosleep, but kids sometimes want to crawl into bed for snuggles, etc. and it feels super creepy for their dad to be naked. 

I don’t care what he wears, as long as he’s covered, but he has been very resistant because he doesn’t like wearing it and thinks it should be his decision on what he wears (or doesn’t). AITA for pushing him to cover up down there???",0.57
AITA for asking my adult son to move out I (50F) have 2 children (14F) and (26M). My daughter (14F) has severe anxiety disorder  and my son (26M) has asperger syndrome . My son moved back in with us after a break up and has been living here for half a year. He pays half of the utilites and 200 euros a month for food. My daughter (14F) has been stressed since he moved back here due to past trauma with her brother. We had an agreement that he won’t bring any women to live here anymore due to past things. 3 months ago he met a really nice women (25F) and since then she has been here very often sleeping over and just being here. My daughter has been complaining that it’s too much for her. I tried to talk with my son about it that his girlfriend would come over less but he told me that we are too dramatic. Today i got back from the psychiatrist with my daughter and she was prescribed anti-psychosis medication with her 150mg venlafaxine. We got told that my daughter mental health wouldn’t get better if something about her brother and his girlfriend wouldn’t be done. We went home and my daughter went outside to calm down same time i had a talk with my son about moving out. He got really angry telling me how i favourite his sister over him and that she’s overdramatic. He stopped the argument with that he should’ve gotten the parental controls over her and not me.

"AITA for failing to procure a custom made celebratory ring for our newborn on time My wife had made it clear even before getting pregnant that she would like to have a ring to celebrate the birth of our first kid. Don't think it matters but the design for the ring is very meaningful to us because its design is linked to our lore/history as a couple and weaves the concept of now having a child too into the design too. She dropped explicit hints on the design and it was clear that I would have a specific jeweller make it. I was and still am actually very excited about the ring.

I sent the specifics for the ring to the jewler about 2.5 months before the baby due date thinking that would be enough time, but I was wrong. I had to follow up multiple times by email and phone to move things along, and coupled with the fact that the jeweller is in another country and also closes a long time for the holidays, the baby has been born a month ago and the ring will be in our hands only in September.

  
Wife is really disappointed and gave me a hard time about it today, saying I don't care enough about her. (she waited about 1 month to give it to me explicitly but I could tell it was brewing....)

Trying to asses how bad I fucked up.

  
I could have been more insistent with the jeweller but that is not my style. I probably didn't give the symbolism of having the ring right around the birth enough weight, waiting for months after the event does detract from it I guess.

"AITA for charging my mother extra compensation for having adjustments to the final product? My (19) mother (45) has commissioned me to make a poster for their expo whatever. Long story short, I accepted and I've done my job. however, it wasn't as easy as pie. While I was doing the graphic designing, the problem came through the sizing of fonts, information, etc. It was hard to fit everything in even with preparation, I wasn't even confident that it'll be visual once its printed on a 20"" x 60"" canvas.

When I finished, my mother gave me triple the amount of what I asked (an addition to my allowance). I thought that was the end, I thought that shit of an editing was done. It wasn't my problem anymore. I asked her multiple times before I finally submitted the final poster if there are any changes, adjustments, and she said ""none, this is okay.""

Now, fast forward 5 days later, I receive a message from her asking for an adjustment, because they wanted to add an acknowledgement at the end of the poster. Mind you, I've adjust the damn poster for many times now and I really just can't adjust it even more unless I was given another compensation. I asked for extra compensation in a very awful manner. It wasn't a thought-through message, I was annoyed because of it, thus it was awful manner. She then confronts me that I shouldn't talk to her like that because she asked nicely, that she is deeply offended because of the way I spoke, and I replied that it's hard to adjust things without my time being wasted, and apologized for lashing out to her.

Am I the Asshole for charging my mother extra money? Maybe I asked it because I really needed the money too, but the way I replied to her made me feel bad. I get her feeling, I really do, and I was I approached it better.

---

UPDATE (after 3 hrs. later) about the situation:  
Thank you everyone for being straightforward about this. I have decided to talk to my mother and asked for forgiveness for what I asked for. I told her why I had reacted that way, and wished I approached better. The extra compensation? I didn't want it anymore, it was greedy of me to ask for more, and I realized that, yes, she did pay triple the amount of what I've asked before. I am deeply sorry for that behavior.

She was still hurt about what I said, but she's willing to forgive when she comes back here at the house. She wants me to explain face-to-face and to see my genuine words and actions. As of now, I've done my additional work and hope its already perfect for the expo. Thank you once again for telling me what I needed to hear. It wasn't my intention to make her feel like a client, I was greedy and immature.",0.88
"AITAH for not being more understanding of my husband’s depression?  It started with my husband taking a new job and meeting a new group of young, primarily attractive females. First time I met them I immediately had a conversation with my husband about boundaries, because they were all overly flirty and had lots of inside jokes/a constant group chat going that he was engrossed in. I had a bad gut feeling. 

Fast forward a few months, he starts staying after work every Friday for drinks. On many occasions I asked him to limit his drinks due to plans or dates, he would agree and then still come home drunk. It’s important to note, during this time I was sober for about 6 months. He said I demonized alcohol and was controlling him. But in honesty, I was just disappointed that he couldn’t spend time with me sober. He told me he needed these drinking nights because his coworkers were the only ones that understood how bad his job was. 

I felt bad and wanted to get him a small gift, he had just been looking at band t’s on his computer the night before so I pulled up his history to find one and that’s when I saw it. So much fucking porn. All women only, alt girls, instagram models.. I call him and was like we need to talk about porn boundaries. He apologies profusely and we agree to talk that night. But when I try to bring it up again, he deflects and instead tries to fuck me. I shut it down and bring it up another day. We eventually agree on some boundaries (I thought).

Then the inappropriate texts started. His female coworker texted him asking was position he would fuck another coworker in. At first I ignored that I saw it, but later I approached him about it and he denied it all, I asked him to show me the texts but they were gone. I asked him why he deleted them if they weren’t inappropriate, he said cause he knew I’d get angry but it was just a joke. This led to me breaking his trust and going into his phone. He said Despicable stuff like “I’m so down bad, I just want to put my dick in things I shouldn’t, like my ex” and my personal favorite “I’m more shocked about the GYAT than anything, they def got some nice personalities but I can’t fuck that yfm?”. After an explosive fight we decided on couples therapy and that he would set boundaries with them going forward and his male coworker. 

Then comes couples therapy. He admits to a porn issue and asks for help. The therapist puts him on a monitoring app, searches for adult content in what you do/look at. He continued to lie and then the app caught him. That day I kicked him out, he swore on his life that he wasn’t looking at women anymore, I believed him and he said thank you for still believing in me. Then the therapist pulled up the report and 100’s of screenshots of porn. He agreed to leave the house and I told him I needed time and space.

Current day: He swears he’s changing, listening to self help books, stopped looking at porn, found a new therapist and says it’s all because of severe depression. He wants me to give him a second chance.",0.2
"AITA for asking that my partner and I make the furnishing/decorating decisions in his new home (co-signed with his parents).  My partner and I are in our early 30s and moving into a house in September.  His mother keeps buying stuff to decorate and fill the house. I want us to have the autonomy to make our own decorating and purchasing decisions - but I'm scared to tell her because I do not technically own the home. It's in my partner's name, co-signed with his parents. 

Some backstory: my partner has been living with his parents for the last five years to save money for a home, and I moved in with them a year and a half ago thinking we would find a home soon. I recently lost my job, and my boyfriend is on a teacher's salary. The only reason we can afford this house is because his parents picked it out and offered to give him his inheritance early as a down payment. I am really grateful, however, we haven't had much autonomy since living with his parents, and I would prefer that we be the ones to decorate the house to make it feel like home, even if it means we don't have the house filled right away. Should I just be grateful I have a roof over my head and someone generous enough to contribute to our space? Am I the asshole if all I want is to decorate where I'll be paying rent?",0.3
"AITA for not inviting some cousins? So my fiancee and I (m34) sent out the invites for our upcoming fall wedding.

I intentionally kept this fact from my dad bc I knew he would not like it. He has since asked me about it and has been frank in his disproval of only inviting 2/4 of my cousins. It's not that I don't like them but with space constraints I kind of had to choose which two I liked more. My dad seems to think I should've given the two seats given to those cousins' kids to my 2 cousins I didn't invite, but I'd rather invite the whole family unit than leave their kids out.

"AITA for Ruining a Dinner with my BF? context: me(29f) and my bf(30m) have been together 2 years.

today we planned to have a late lunch/early dinner because i had to take care of family matters in the beginning and end of the day, which i told me bf about. he was upset to begin with because we could not go to dinner, but finally agreed to a 2:30 lunch. he wanted to go to a specific restaurant so we had a plan.

i had an appt with some family around 1:30. i get a text from him saying the restaurant he chose would be too expensive for him, so he wanted to go somewhere else. i suggested three other places, but got no response back. i was done with the appt an hour early than i expected so i let him know that i could come get him now, or i could run some errands for an hour to align better with our scheduled time. i get no response, so i run my errands. about a half hour later i get a text saying ""hurry up"", and ""im waiting on you"". i simply reply with an ok, and i go pick him up.

he gets in my car, silently staring at me. at this point im a little upset, and explain why; for his lack of communication and for being upset at me when i told him what was going on on my end.

we figure out a place to eat, and the whole time he constantly is telling me not to be so grumpy and sensitive. i reiterate why i was so, and i simply got an ""ok"".

"WIBTA for reaching out to a girl whose heart I broke for a favor?  I'm 17m. Recently, things in my life have been awful. I don't want to get too into details, but essentially it's very, *very* bad on my mental health.

Actual mental health support is something that isn't accessible to be right now because I'm a minor and my parent don't believe in it. In absence of that, something I've decided might help in the short term is vaping again. Obviously long term it won't help, but it calms my anxiety, so it will tide me over for the time being so I don't feel awful everyday.

The thing is, I'm not in contact with the girl that initially was the reason I started vaping. She and I met last year and started hanging out, she caught feelings, I didn't, this hurt her a lot, and this ended with us in no contact. She has a fake and is super extroverted and knows loads of people, so she can get me a vape easily if I want it.

However, I know I really hurt her, and until recently, she had me on blocked, so I'd feel bad reaching out to her. If I had the option to, I'd ask somebody else, but I'm really shy and don't have any other friends at all.

"AITA for telling a mom I couldn’t see over her daughter?  So, I at the time (17 F) went to a concert with my boyfriend (19 M). I saved up to buy us these tickets for his birthday. We waited 8 months and drove to another state to be able to go. By the time we got to our seats this family arrived and sat in the seats in front of us, it was a woman probably in about her 40’s, two daughters one probably about 16 and the other 12/13, then there was what I am assuming was the father. We had some problems with them from the beginning, they were taking very obnoxious selfies where I was in the photo more than they were, so I pointed it out to my boyfriend and he politely asks if they can try to be more mindful while taking photos, the father then turns around and with lots of attitude says ""I guess"", the mom then proceeds to say ""I didn't know you guys were like that', also with lots of attitude. They proceeded to take photos this way.  They also got into a bit of an altercation with 3 girls because they were sitting in their seats, 5 of them came to this concert but only got 4 seats?  Fast forward to when the headliner came out, she lets her 12/13 year old daughter stand on the chair in front of me. I am not a tall person, I am only 5'2 and was already having a bit of a hard time seeing, but I did not mind as my boyfriend could see; The daughter was my height, so I couldn't even see the screen, Now I wouldn't have minded if it was for a minute or two, but it was easy to tell she was planning on staying there. As the headliner began to play, I tapped on the mom's shoulder and politely said ""I am so sorry but I cannot see anything with your daughter standing on the chair"", she turns around and says ""Fucking deal with it, it's her birthday!"" So in defeat I backed off and decided I wasn't going to bother her anymore, as long as my boyfriend could see I was happy, although a little sad because this is both of our favorite artists. The daughter apparently heard this altercation and proceeded to sit in her chair and pout, the mom then turns around and begins to scream at me, saying ""Thanks for making her feel like shit you're a fucking cunt."" This set my boyfriend off, and he proceeds to scream at her until she sits down and begins to pout as well. She then stands up and tries to yell at me again, setting my boyfriend right off, screaming at her even more to leave me alone. At this point we were getting looks from others and I was wondering if I was in the wrong. My boyfriend reassured me and I began to have fun. But the mom then sees me recording and starting putting her hands up to block my phone, and flipping her hair in my face, my boyfriend took my phone to record for me because he was a lot taller than her and she could not block his view.

"AITA for getting my daughter a designer bag when not everyone in the group could afford it? Hey, I'm not new to Reddit, but this is a throwaway account!

So, I'm part of a playdate group that my sister invited me to. We're all in the 30s-40s range and our daughters are in the 6-8 age range, but we're all at different life stages. Out of the group, my husband works a lot and makes the most money. While none of them are struggling (at least no one has outright said), we do have different budgets. There hasn't been any drama in the past two years until recently when one of the girls, Autumn (not her real name), got a purse and then everyone got a purse except for my daughter. She's two years younger than the other girls, so I didn't know how to feel about getting her a brand-new purse, but I also didn't want her to be left out.

Now, I only carry designer bags because I like the way they look, and because my daughter wants to be my mini-me, I bought us matching crossbody bags. It was adorable! I didn’t see a problem with it since kids can’t tell the difference, and when we were at our weekly playdate, no one said anything, so I figured no one cared... Well, I was more than wrong when I checked the group chat. All the other moms, including my sister, were texting me saying they felt like we were trying to show off that we had money, which felt unfair because they were the ones who always brought up bills and shopping for clothes, while I usually stayed out of the conversation. Then Autumn's mom texted that she was crying because she wanted the same bag for her approaching birthday now and they couldn’t afford it. And while I feel bad, I also think this is just a part of life. Even my daughter doesn't get everything she asks for because she sees it.

"WIBTA If I Told My Friend to Stop Talking About Race If She Can’t Stop Pursuing Her Crush? So I (16f), am friends with M (17f). I’m Black American and she’s Latina. Most of our conversations are usually about race, where she starts like “black people do this” or “Latinos do this”. Sometimes I do get abgry and tell her to stfu.
M told me her dad says the n word, and seemed to look at me for a reaction. The man is 300 lbs and about 6 ft, the hell am I gonna do? She’s also told one of our mutual friends that she said the n-word because some black students paid her to say it. (Okay, weird right?).
The issue I’m having now is that M likes this Latino guy, J, that says the n-word like he gets paid $100 each time he says it. When I tried to talk to him about it during lunch, he told me “well it’s in my language”. I tried to explain to him that the word he said is NOT (directly) in his language. He looked at me like I was a fucking alien and walked away.
During the school year she told me that he has a girlfriend, so she wasn’t interested in him anymore. I told her about the encounters right after they happened and she didn’t seem to care, but him having a girlfriend is stopping her?
I feel today was the final straw. We were talking to this girl named Lia (17f) and somehow the conversation shifted to boys. M tells us about how she likes a guy, and when my friend K said “the guy that said the word?” She said yeah. M proceeds to tell us about how it doesn’t matter to her - J’s ruining his own life, to which Lia says “that’ll ruin you as well by association”. M got mad at the poor damn girl, went on a rant about how the French should be the last people talking, and said she doesn’t care, she’s just waiting for him to make a move on her. She also said that black people also say slurs. I said yeah, they do, and it’s shitty, but I still felt that she was being insensitive to me, her friend that SHE KNOWS has never said any slur pertaining to another group of people. (And before any of you ask, yes, I say the n word but it’s ONLY around my family or other black friends).
I feel like I wouldn’t have cared AS MUCH if I didn’t feel as if we were close friends, on top of her always bringing up race and how “this group needs to stop doing this” and “I always see this group of people doing this.” I guess I’m just not used to my friends being so sensitive and insensitive at the same time.
And I feel that if I had a homophobic friend or if I had a crush on someone who was homophobic, she’d be so upset, and I wouldn’t even be able to handle her being mad and would stop pursuing that person immediately.
I feel so invalidated in my beliefs and values because faculty and staff just push matters like this to the side, not to mention how the media normalizes the use of the n-word.

"AITA for choosing not to meet my boyfriend’s female friend, who is staying over at his place? So let me give you guys some context. 
I’m 23F and my boyfriend is 21M. We haven’t been dating for too long (around 2 months, exclusively for 1). My boyfriend is amazing. He is caring, attentive, funny and all, however he has some female friends, even though I’m not a big fan of it, that is fine to me. 

The issue is the fact that his «female bestfriend» (his words) is coming to visit him from spain, and she is going to stay over at his place for 5 days. The thought of it honestly just makes me really uncomfortable. My boyfriend has 2 male roomates/buddies that he lives with and he said he’s gonna try and hook them up but it still doesn’t sit right with me, considering the fact that it’s him she’s coming to visit afterall. 

I communicated my feelings to my boyfriend and he was really understandable. He assured me that there’s never been anything between them and that when they got to know each other, he even had a girlfriend at that time, so there was never any «romantic» situations. He has also spoken about me to her and shown her pictures etc, bragged about how «he won» etc. However I feel like it’s not enough… 

I trust my boyfriend fully, otherwise I wouldn’t be with him. But I have never met this girl before, and even though he might see things that way, how can I be sure there was never any romantic interest from her side?? How can I be sure she won’t try anything while she’s there?? He told me that she had said she really wanted to meet me and that we were cute, and it makes me feel bad for thinking the way I do, but I really can’t help it. She’s an attractive woman, pretty, nice body etc. Not that I’m not, but it doesn’t really help the overthinking. 

When talking about it my boyfriend said he could cancel if it made me very uncomfortable, but I said no to that because I don’t want to be labeled as the «crazy controlling girlfriend», so instead he invited me to come over aswell, the same time she’s there. If I’m going to be completely honest I don’t want to in the slightest. Maybe I’m just being difficult or too jealous, but I don’t want to meet her. If he would’ve introduced me to her normally I wouldn’t mind at all, but the fact that she’s staying over really makes me dislike her, and I know it’s wrong. I don’t wanna see them laugh at inside jokes, see them tease each other etc. Hell I’d probably throw up and go home if they held eye contact too long. 

So with all this info I ask you guys, AITA for not wanting her to stay over? Or AITA for being difficult and not wanting to come meet her? ",0.9
"AITAH if I demand my husbands passwords? I found out my husband lied, now worried he is lying about other things.  My husband knows I hate certain things and  we agreed to never have them. I overheard a friend ask him if he liked his ‘new toy’ and my husband shushed him, which of course sparked my curiosity. From there I found out he had bought this object. I simply found it hidden and set it on his desk. 
He was very apologetic when he realized I knew- and swore he would never do anything behind my back again. 
Before this happened I knew all of his passwords to social media. I did find a picture he took of the object and he sent it to his friend after I found out, and I think he thought that was how I discovered he owned this object and he subsequently changed all passwords.
I don’t necessarily feel he is cheating on me, however do not like the secrecy.

"AITA for telling one of my bestfriends that he's a loser? There are more times than I (21M) can count when he (23M) chooses to do things that seem right to him but feels disrespectful. I typically set up a fight night so I and whoever comes to my apartment enjoy the fights with food and drinks.  Recently, I only invited him as I didn't want many people and just wanted to relax for the night.

I thought we could have a chill guys' night but it wasn't at all. He came over a sat down on the couch and whipped out his Nintendo Switch. He consistently paid zero attention after I went through the hassle of getting a PPV fight and buying food, drinks, etc.

I told him like wtf, I thought we'd chill and have a guy's night. He told me we were without leaving his eyes off the screen. I told him if you just here to play some games just go home and play them. I ended up calling him a loser (in an ahole way) because all he would do was be glued to a screen at any given moment. Any serious or non-serious conversation we had or any time we hung out. He still lives with his mom, his room is never cleaned at all, jobless, and ultimately doesn't do a thing.

He ended up staying for a bit longer before leaving; trying to play his game consistently throughout the fight night and it was just weird. I felt like he just continued to gaslight me and didn't care about anything I set up.

"AITA For going off at my boyfriend for renewing his lease? I '22 F' have been with my boyfriend '22 M' for 3 years now. It was a wild beginning on Hinge to where we are now.

Moving in together at 5 months (to his hometown), a cheating scandal on his end (albeit nothing physical just thru social media), a miscarriage, a break, moving together (to my home city), breaking up, getting back together but living separately, a possibility of living together again, but him deciding to move in on his own to an apartment closer to his school.

The drive is 40 minutes from him to me and he also quit his job at the beginning of the year and has had no luck finding a new one. I've been providing him with money for meals since only eats fast food and so have his parents along with them paying for his rent. (About $1300 a month) 

The move out caused a pretty big argument between us because I was under the impression that we would find a place together or move in with my parents to save money. So when he tells me his mom is coming over to help him look for apartments I was pretty upset, and even more upset when he found one and cosigned with her the same day for a 6 month lease without telling me about it. Just packing his things and moving out.

I learned to get over it and he would come over often to my parents place (where I'm staying) or drive me over to his place bc I was adamant I wouldn't since I spent the last 6 months driving over to the apartment we used to share before we broke up and got together again.

In March he explained to me that he was stressed out financially because he had already taken a loan out for his classes this semester and his parents were asking when he was getting a job since his sister would be going off to college this year and they needed to help pay for her. I told him I think it would be best for him to move with me and my parents to save money despite the drive to school being 40 mins longer. He agreed and I thought we were set on that.

Since then I've gotten a dog that is sort of ours but stays with me, and I've been counting the days till we can be together again. Until today, he told me his mom would be coming over to his apartment to help him clean. In my head it's to help him clean out the place and move stuff to storage. Then he tells me him and his mom moved the furniture around and she bought him groceries. 

I asked him what that about and he tells me that he's decided to lease the place for 6 more months and he's taken out another loan for school. I don't even know what to think anymore. I'm incredibly upset said some things and now he's not talking to me, we have a trip planned this weekend to go visit his friends and hang out with them. I love him very much but everything is just becoming too much for me. Am I being controlling or do I have a reason to be upset? 

His mom doesn't know about any of this by the way, she is a devout Christian and i feel like all of this information would make her implode. She's a very nice lady tho and none of this is her doing, atleast intentionally.  ",0.67

The building where I live has around 100 such apartments and around 80 of them are occupied. There as often a few parties on the ground floor (I used to live on the first floor but recently shifted to the second floor because I feel uneasy about using lifts/ elevators and prefer the stairs). There hasn't been much problem with noise even when I lived on the first floor but this year around 15 new residents moved in and they made A LOT of noise at the part that was hosted last Sunday. 

I'm still a student and was studying during that time. It threw me off since I had never heard so much noise. I injured one of my ears when I was around 7 and it still hurts due to loud noises. I went downstairs and told the manager politely that I was being disturbed by the noise. (I was not the only one, around 20 residents weren't attending the party, including me and they all had the same problem, even the ones that lived on the 4th floor.) The manager told me use my ""noise-cancelling earphones/headphones"" and I don't have any. 

I argued that I shouldn't be force to use them even if I had them since it was basic for them to keep their noise down. Also, it was mentioned that there will be occasional  
 parties when I moved in and when I asked if they would be ""loud and noisy"", I was told that they would keep the sound under check so that nobody is disturbed. 

The manager (>40 F) got very angry when I threatened to call the police (I didn't but the noise didn't stop until 2 am the next morning) and is now threatening to ""throw me out"" since I was disrespectful for.

"AITA for refusing to share a bed on a group trip I (18F) am travelling with 5 other friends this December. We divided into 2 groups of three using a randomizer and booked 2 rooms. Each room has a twin bed and a queen bed, which has become a problem. I, wanting my own bed, talked to my roommates about having the twin and them sharing the queen. One roommate was okay with it, but X also wanted her own bed. So, in our group discussion, I asked the other room how they were planning to split their beds, and they had all decided on who was getting the twin. I asked the person with the twin if they would rather have a queen, they said no, and I left it at that. 

Fast forward to a few days later, I mention to X that we haven't yet decided on a bed situation. She said that she needed it more, because she was uncomfortable having to share a bed, considering she never had to do that before. I said I didn't like sharing a bed either. Basically, since we both wanted it, we decided the best way to split it was rock paper scissors. I won, so I got the twin bed.

She has been crying to our entire friend group about how unfair it is since then. They all know it was decided by RPS, so everybody agrees that it's fair if I get the bed. However, some of them think that even if its fair that I get the bed, im being an AH by not just giving it up when she's so upset about it (she has come to me a few times, after I say im going to prioritize my own comfort, she starts crying more). Others say that she's being an AH by complaining this much after the decision is all made, and they think she's acting childish. ",0.54
"AITA for Accepting One Way Marriage o It started slowly and I was unhappy. I discovered my wife was unfaithful and I ended our relationship. Over the course of time, we reconciled. I kept her infidelity a secret, knowing deep down, I wanted to be with her. 

She had a massage therapist that she was using for several years that we both know come over to the house for a session. It was unusual but I accepted her invitation to stay for her session.

She called me into the room a few times and I saw him massaging her. I sat and talked with them and about 15 or 20 minutes later, he aroused her and brought her to orgasm. 

It felt like an out of body experience for me. I said that I didn’t know this is what happened during her sessions and she said it always occurred and she wanted to open with me about it. That her orgasm was physically enjoyable and that was it. She wanted me to understand it. 

We talked a lot about it and I found it arousing for some reason. I even started looking forward to it. 

In time, we opened our marriage for her and I never wanted to be with anyone else.

"WIBTA if I called the cops on my neighbour if talking with them doesn’t work  So I (23f) my partner (32m) and our son (2m) live a basement suite, up down duplex style, well our upstairs neighbour is always banging shit around at absurd hours of the night.

Example, they just woke me and my partner up vacuuming at midnight, which leads me to now.

Other examples include, but are not limited to

- moving furniture at 11pm
- having conversations loud enough we can hear what they’re saying from 10pm-4am
- stomping/running all hours of the night
- showering at 2am

Thing is, there’s 0 noise all day, I know they’re home because their car is out front, I really can’t think of a valid excuse as to why they insist on doing all this after 10pm, it’s woken not just us the parents but our son multiple times as well.

Other odd behaviours include:

- coming to us asking if we’d seen a woman walking around her side of the house who supposedly had been yelling and banging on her door, and supposedly dug holes in her backyard (we share a backyard, no one is ever back there)

No one has done that, we know because my partner is home all day with our son, and with how our house is seemingly made of paper, we would have heard banging and shouting.

My partner thinks she’s using, he used to work with addicts and knows the behaviour, combine the noise at odd hours with the paranoia of being stalked when no one ever comes by, it makes sense but I’d rather not think that.

I’m sending my partner over to chat with them tomorrow cause honestly it’s been every night since we moved in and I’m really sick of it, but if that doesn’t work I’m worried I’ll have to get the cops involved.

I’m not calling them tonight, or he’ll probably not even tomorrow but if it continues WIBTA if I called the cops to come and talk to them about the noise?

our city bylaw says if you’re making excessive noise and causing a disturbance to neighbours after 10pm it warrants a fine, I really don’t want to cause issues but I’d love to actually sleep through the night.

As of posting it is 12:30am and they are just talking away, one of them just yelled “awe fuck” and they are arguing, loudly I might add but at this point I think that was obvious.

"AITA for not forcing my sister to treat all of her nieces and nephews equally when she clearly won’t even if I try? 
I (42F) have a sister (37F) who has always been somewhat distant from the family. She’s very career-focused, doesn’t like kids, and has never really connected with any of her nieces or nephews—except for my oldest son (18M).

When my son was younger, he somehow managed to crack her shell. He was the only child she ever took a liking to, and over the years, she’s grown to absolutely adore him. She spoils him with expensive gifts, takes him on trips, and constantly checks in on him. Whenever she reaches out to me, she asks about the whole family, but it’s clear her main concern is my oldest son. She’ll inquire about my other two kids (16M and 14F), but the attention she gives them is nothing compared to what she showers on their older brother.

When my sister visits, she does bring gifts for my other kids, but they’re usually modest compared to what she gives my oldest son. She tends to keep the extravagant gifts for when she’s alone with him, so the other kids don’t always see what he gets. However, when my son comes back home with these high-end gifts, the family definitely notices. It’s not subtle, and it’s starting to create some tension.

My younger kids have started feeling a bit jealous, wondering why they don’t get the same level of attention and generosity. They’ve asked why their brother receives such extravagant gifts, and it’s been tough for me to explain, especially since my sister doesn’t seem interested in changing her behavior.

Some family members have suggested that I should press my sister to be more fair with all her nieces and nephews, not just my kids. They feel that if I insist, she might change her ways. However, I’ve tried talking to my sister about being more equitable, but her response has been blunt. She told me that she didn’t choose to have nephews and nieces and that it’s not her responsibility to be fair. She sees her relationship with my oldest son as something special and separate from the rest of the family, and she’s not interested in changing that.

The thing is, my son is 18, a legal adult, and I don’t have any control over how my sister spends her money or who she chooses to spoil. I also can’t tell my son not to accept her gifts—that’s his choice. They have a unique bond, and while I understand why my younger kids feel a bit jealous, there’s not much I can do about it.

"AITA for acting distant toward my partner because of our lack of intimacy?  Hey Reddit,

I need some advice and maybe a reality check. My partner and I have been together for a while, and our relationship has always been filled with love and affection. However, lately, things have changed in our sex life. The last time we were intimate was a month ago, which is by far the longest we've gone without having sex since were together. We've been together for 15 years now. 

I know he's been under a lot of pressure at work, and I completely understand that it's impacting his mood and energy levels. I don’t want to add to his stress, so I never ask or beg for sex. I prefer to follow his lead because it feels more satisfying when he’s in the mood, and I don't want to make him feel pressured.

But here's the thing—I can't help but feel some resentment. I love him so much, and I want to be there for him, but the lack of physical connection is really starting to get to me. I’ve noticed that I’ve been acting less affectionate and less intimate toward him, hoping he’ll pick up on my signals and realize how I’m feeling.

"AITA for not giving my password to my bf My boyfriend keeps on insisting that he wants my messenger password, and I made it clear to him since the beginning of our relationship that I won't be giving him any of my social media accounts because I am not comfortable on doing so and it's mine. He knows my phone password and it's fine with me, but everytime my phone is with him I always worry that he might open my messaging app... again.

I am not hiding anything, I just simply want my privacy and wished he could be respectful about it. It's also the reason why I never ask him about his passwords nor go through his phone without his permission.

 I asked him the reason why he wants it and he told me that he just wants to, and said he won't do anything with it, won't look at conversations, he just wanted to know who I am talking to.

"AITA for sending my son's friend's mom a nasty message after she failed to see her child in the school's annual performance? My (47F) son (17M) has a best friend, ""Alice"" (16F) who hang out all the time. He never went over to her house so I have never met her parents, she is at our house every day after school. Alice is a pretty sweet girl in my opinion, she's respectful and a good house guest, cleans up after herself and holds good conversation. 

Over the years I have to come to think of her as my own daughter. She sometimes talks about her ""kind of poor"" relationship with her mom and says they aren't very close. Upon investigating my son mentioned she's really afraid of her mother and doesn't like to go home.

Yesterday, their school put up their yearly annual performance. They have 3 sections: acting, dancing and singing. Students opt for which they want to be a part of.

Alice picked singing, she said it was because she doesn't like dancing and doesn't want to be seen my too many people, and she likes how she can be in a crowd while singing. My son and I think she has a nice voice.

My husband and I were at the performance, we took videos of both our son and Alice in the performance. After the performance I was looking for my son but couldn't find him. He said Alice was crying and they would be late.

I asked him why and he said she was upset her mother didn't come. Apparently the mother said she didn't want to sit for 3 hours to watch her daughter sing when dancing brings more attention and looks better. 

I didn't mention anything to Alice or my son, dropped Alice home and when we got in, I sent an anonymous message telling Alice's mom how shameful it was that she wouldn't come watch her daughter do something she was proud of, and I thought she didn't deserve to have a kid like that.

I am pregnant, so I woke up feeling bad that it was hormones making me too protective of Alice. My husband, however, believes that it was rational.

"WIBTA to skip lunch after my friend's husband made comments about my illness? Throwaway account. I'm 41F.

As a kid my family lived in a small town in Southern OH. My dad died suddenly and mom relocated us to FL where her family is. We stayed in touch with friends from there, a pair of siblings Anna (now 44F) and May (now 42F).

My mom owns a second home in FL. Every summer Anna visits with her husband and son and stays there. May has stayed with her family too occasionally, as has their mom Janet.

A few years ago Anna went NC with her mom over what seems like a weird disagreement to me and became extremely close to my mom - they now talk every day. About 18 months ago, my mom and Janet also went NC after having a disagreement they were then too proud to work out.

Well before all this family drama I had left FL and worked my way up to a senior position in a globally known company in a field that Anna is passionate about but never pursued. Unfortunately I've struggled with chronic health issues all my life and they came to a head while working there. I had to leave my job and move back to FL and take time out to recuperate.

Better now, I work in the same field with a company that is prestigious here but not a globally recognizable one. The year after my return, Anna and her family visited. Anna's husband said, ""It's a bit of a step down from your old job, isn't it?""

I've since travelled a lot for my job, with sporadic posts on social media that I guess they've seen (my posts are more of a journal for myself). There were some comments from Anna during their visits to FL that seemed disingenuous from the tone. (""You're travelling a lot aren't you?"" etc.)

Last year when they visited I was very ill again, and bedridden when they came to my mom's house to see us.

A few months ago I had to go to Southern OH for work and I posted a picture to social media, just documenting as usual. Anna, who never likes or comments on my posts, liked it. I immediately sensed it to be quite passive aggressive. I sent her a DM and asked how she was and told her I was there for 2 days for work and wouldn't be able to meet but was looking forward to see her when she'd be coming out to FL. May ended up liking the picture too; I DMed her also.

Anna and her family are in FL right now. When I greeted them, only her husband said hi. Anna initially blanked me and I had to say hello to her 4 times before she acknowledged me - she said she was distracted by her children. Later on her husband asked me how my health is. When I was answering, he interrupted me to make some jokes about my health issues, which I found to be in really poor taste. I'd rather not say the exact joke, but it was like making a bald joke to a cancer patient's face, it was that direct and crass.

I left them alone for the rest of the evening and didn't say goodbye when they left.

They are coming back tomorrow for lunch but I intend to leave the house. Depending on how petty I'm feeling I might leave as they arrive and if they ask why I will tell them why I'm leaving. WIBTA?",0.87

This two hour window in the morning has become my “me” time and had come to be a vital part of my self care. In this two hour window I am just me. I’m not a wife, mother, sister, friend, or employee. I don’t have to mask or consider anyone or anything other than me. I can just be me. Wholly me. Nothing else. No one else. 

Recently, my husband (47M) started a new job and his schedule now has him awake during my “me” time. When we were first discussing his new schedule I warned him that my “me” time is sacred and I would not be giving up this time or changing my behavior during this time. At the time he just kind of scoffed at me. We are now 4 days into this new schedule. The first few days he kept asking me if I was upset about anything. I reassured him many times that I wasn’t upset about anything and that this was just my “me” time. This morning when he asked again I very bluntly told him that I wasn’t upset but from the time I wake up until the time I go to work I’m not his wife. I’m not anyone’s mother. I’m owe nothing to no one, including him. He responded with, “you’re my wife all the time” and stormed out the door. Am I obligated to give up a very vital part of my daily routine simply because he’s awake for it now? AITA?",0.28
"AITA for telling my husband his parents won’t be babysitting our child? Throwaway account for obvious reasons. I am pregnant with my first child and me and my husband are really excited. The other day we were talking about how our life is going to change when we have a child and I mentioned how lucky I was that my mum would be able to help out so much. My husband then said “and of course my parents will help too” I then told him that I wouldn’t be comfortable leaving our child alone with them. Throughout our relationship I have found out things his parents have done that make me uncomfortable leaving my child with them. They constantly belittle and bully him under the guise of humour, make lots of jokes at his expense, call him names and are generally not very nice to him. They are also quite a bit older and have old fashioned ideas about discipline such as using humiliation as punishment and made him feel really bad about himself growing up which he has told me about. However he believes they were just trying to toughen him up and make him the best version of himself. I haven’t said anything about this as I don’t want to be the one to poison his relationship with his parents but I don’t want my children brought up round that. I gently outlined some of these points with him and he told me that they want to be involved and would never forgive him which just to me strengthens my argument. He told me he’d need some time to think on this and I’ve given it to him but now I’m starting to worry I might’ve been unreasonable in a tricky situation. ",0.09
AITA for not hating someone that my friend/family hates? Context i am or was super close to a female family member we will call her female a and she was best friends with a male relatives wife we will call her female b . Long story short female b said some insensitive things to female a and i agree that it was crappy and i was upset at female b’s actions. Fast forward female a throws shade on facebook towards me and i message her to ask if there is an issue and she goes on to say i am two faced because i dint hate female b because i “invited” female b to MY HOUSE when the fact is i invited female bs mother in law aka my family member over and she said they were over so i just said they were welcome to come as well. Also i also went to female b’s daughters birthday as i also have a daughter and kids have no business being involved in adult drama and they deserve the right to get to know their cousin/other kid relatives. I however in no way have befriended female b because i have a loyalty to female a for the things said and done to her. So my question in AITA or a shitty friend because i dont treat female b like shit ?

"WIBTA in this scenario Me (37M) and my friend (34F) have known each other for 10 years and have talked every day for the past month.

Yesterday, she called me after midnight and said I sounded too tired and like I didn't want to talk anymore. I called her back and said her call had woken up, but that didn't mean I didn't want to talk.

This somehow turned into an argument (as it usually does when she wakes me up, because I think she thinks I'm upset; I'm still not sure why). She had went to the store at 8:30 and said she'd call in an hour. A quarter after 11, I still hadn't heard from her, so I called. She said she was out with a friend getting food. She called back after midnight.

She said she didn't need to check in with me. I said that's entirely NOT the point, and I don't expect her to check in, but if she said she's going to do something, I'm going to expect her to do it, and that a text would've been fine, because in the past, that's what she's done: if she's late, she'd let me know.

She's hyperfocused on this supposed ""need"" I have and I feel like she's starting to think I'm controlling, despite me telling her that's not why I called her back. I called her back because I wanted to talk because I missed her that day.

I would hate having her think I was controlling all because she used to let me know about these things, and I feel like that's such an overexaggeration.

But maybe I'm wrong? WIBTA for having that expectation, even though that's not what this was about?",0.8
"AITA for not walking the dog?  
My sister got a dog when she was 18 and failed to take care of him, leaving it to my mom’s responsibility. 

My mom LOVES her dog like he’s her child. She will diligently walk him for hours and let him lead. 

 I don’t mind walking him when I feel the urge. 

But I’m not a dog person. I don’t have a dog for this reason. I have two cats, which my mom also helps to take care of along with her cat (feeding if I’m not up yet, or when I go to work, etc.). I recently moved back home after being out of the house for 3 years. 

My mom recently developed knee pain and works part time. I work full time in a demanding job, and I am trying to work on mental health struggles. 

As long as he has been here, he has never been *my* dog, I’m the dog’s aunt/sister as it’s called by my family. 

I love him lots, but I’m just not a dog person. I can’t do the upkeep right now, and have just never bonded with dogs like I do cats. 

My mom will lose track of time or come home from working tired and ask me if I would do her the favour of walking the dog. 

I will do it if I have to (if he will not get a walk without me), but it’s not typically something I WANT to do. Her dog is a bit spoiled and will pull, expect me to follow him and I just often don’t have the energy with my mental health. 

She will take him out, but will be upset that I didn’t do it immediately when she asks. 

I feel for her, because it’s the responsibility even if she is tired. I want to help, but I also just don’t feel up to it if for example, I’ve worked a 12 hour shift and she worked 6, then comes home not feeling up to it. 

It makes me feel guilty when she asks, and I am obviously reluctant. I want to help, but I’m also dealing with my own things and find it a struggle to bring up the motivation when she asks for the favour. I just want to know if I’m being an asshole by not walking the dog?

"AITA for letting my girlfriend stay over every so often and not pay rent  So a few months ago I got i it a lease with my college friend and things have only gone downhill from there. 

She is rarely at the apartment as maybe been there a week in total out of the 3 1/2 months we have had the place, her issue is that my girl friend come over every so often ( spends a night, 1 whole day is she has time bit thats rare) .

My roomate is demanding she pay 1/3 of out power bill because of this and part of her rent. Keep in mind my gf buys her own food for the apartment and doesn’t eat anything but that, while my roomate has said she wants to split groceries and made it clear not to use her food whenever she has been over its been with friends or a hookup.

Shes using the place like a sex house and notting more, the friends also ate a number of snacks and had around 6 drinks but her logic is “ i didnt drink them so im not laying her back. 

She constantly hides behind her mom saying shes gonna call her to deal with it and anytime we set a day for all 3 of us to sit down and talk about her issue she locks herself in her room.

He got up this morning and made his breakfast like usual while standing with no problem. He has done this thing before the injury where he goes to the bathroom and “forgets to do them” after.

"AITA for questioning my fiancée's boundaries on overnight stays w/ family & friends 
Me (f24) and my partner (m24) have moved to Australia for a year. Two of my best friends (called O and S) moved out here 4 years ago, and I haven’t seen either in a couple years. I’ve known them since high school- where me and my partner met, therefore he knows them but they’ve never been super close.

We plan to meet O and S for a weekend and I suggested  that we should ask them and their partners if they’d like to share an Airbnb for the weekend- having our own rooms obviously. Also, once we settle down in this country we don’t plan on living in the same city as O and S, so I wouldn’t be seeing them often.

My partner does not want to share an Airbnb with my friends and their partners. He likes his own space and would feel uncomfortable sharing a space with their partners as he doesn’t really know them (we have only met O’s partner this week and never met S’s partner). He said he would meet them during the day for activities and dinner, but would like to go back to our own place at night.

I do admit that his firm no upset me a little. For some context, this is something that has come up in our relationship a lot, especially in the last year as we moved into our own place together. He did not like guests in our flat. If any of my friends would come over (which was rarely) I would try meet them outside the flat as he would discourage me from inviting them over- and if they did come over he would leave the house before they got there and stay out for the duration. My family also lived far away but only my sister ever stayed the night once, and my partner left the house while she was there. He does not like going on holiday with my family, or staying with my parents when we visit them (2 hours drive away).

As you can guess- this quickly turned into an argument. As best as I can- I will bullet point our main arguments. 

His points:
• He is upset I questioned his answer when he told me no- he is uncomfortable with staying with people he doesn’t really know. 
• This is a boundary he believes is important, he values his space and time. 
• That I put my family and friends above him. 
• He is not going to change- this is who he is.
• If I don’t accept that he is like this- and it is too much for me to deal with, I should break off the relationship now. 

My points:
• I rarely see my friends since they moved abroad. He does occasionally stay with my family (and has been on holiday with them before) and I’ve had the same friends since high school so I genuinely didn’t know what his answer would be.
• I don’t put my friends and family above him- I compromise a lot.
• Instead of breaking up, he should work on trying to fix this issue as I don’t think this is healthy. 

Am I the asshole? I’m obviously not going to ask my friends anymore if they’d like to share an Airbnb. Any help is appreciated- I really don’t want us to break up over this. ",0.87

"WIBTA If I told my fiancé that our toddler is his problem for the day? For some background, our toddler did not sleep well AT ALL last night. We all were having a rough night due to this fact.

My fiancé had plans this morning at 9, so last night he told me he would drop our toddler off at daycare on his way out. This morning when I woke up, he and the baby were both still home in bed. I asked him about it and he told me he called him out of daycare because he wanted to sleep in. 

This alone irritated me because he could have woken me up and I would have taken him to daycare myself. I don’t like when he misses daycare for no good reason. We pay $350 a week for him to go, and it does not get cheaper if he misses days. 

He’s also a two year old so I like to keep him on a regular schedule for both baby’s and my sanity. 

They’re still asleep, but I plan on telling my fiancé that the baby is his problem today when they wake up because he unanimously decided to pull him out of daycare and I have plans already as it’s my and his day off. 

I will admit I’m also I little peeved because our days off rarely align, especially without the baby. A tiny part of me was hoping for some “us” time before we picked baby up. 

I feel like I could be the asshole because obviously I’m also a parent to our child. And I feel like I might be a little petty to act this way. I know it will start an argument as well.

"AITA for sharing an Airbnb with female friends while in a relationship? I shared an Airbnb with 3 female friends as a male in a relationship. I am on a 4-week trip with friends around Europe. Its a mix of men and women with most people in relationships, some married. 

Most of the time I have had my own room or shared with the male friends from the group. Two of those days I was at Vienna and the only people who wanted to visit were some females. Their partners left the week earlier. We booked the same Airbnb due to cost effectiveness and obviously to drink together, make dinner quicker, leave at the same time from the one place. Everyone had their separate bedroom with common kitchen and bathroom.

"WIBTAH if I reported my family member for internationally burning down her house for insurance money?  My aunt’s (60f) house recently burned down due to a “electrical fire” which completely destroyed the home. Although she is claiming this is a tragic accident several strange coincidences have come to light which leads me to believe she had her son (30m) do it intentionally for the insurance money. Coincidences like my aunt leaving several sentimental items (an old clock, a pressure cooker for canning food, items of clothing) at her sons house, or the fact that she and my uncle as well as her dog just happened to be out of the house the night it happened, even though they notoriously never go out together and there is always someone in the house. The biggest reason I feel the fire was intentional is because ten years ago her son did in fact burn down the barn on their property and got a huge insurance payout for it (her son told me he did it). Her and her family are notoriously bad with money and are currently in massive debt either to loan agencies (I believe they have a three mortgages on the house that just burned down). 

Normally I would stay out of something like this but there has been a huge amount of financial support that has been given to her from a go fund me to people sending her money and clothes. I’m also a little more than angry that she put firefighters lives at risk, most of which are volunteers, just to get a huge insurance payout. 

I’m just wondering if it would even be worth sending an anonymous tip to the local fire warden. I understand everything I’ve said is circumstantial and could be a coincidence but I believe in my heart that her and her son did this to fix their financial troubles. ",0.42
"AITA for evicting my daughter and selling her home?  In 2020 I bought my daughter’s Alexis town home that she has been living in since 2016. 

My daughter was having a tough time since her divorce and the prices was under market in August of 2020. 

I was stupid and nieve about Alxis. She said she got screwed over in the divorce even though she received alamony. Her ex moved out in March 2020 and she had a previous roommate that she said she hated from March - January (I bought the house during this time butI couldn’t legally evict that roommate due to Covid laws) I was happy when she moved out on her own. 

Next was Alexis boyfriend and she refused to rent out the spare room with bathroom and moving him in. He was a grifter and held these odd jobs like instana cart. He moved out in late 2023 and I operated the townhouse at a loss because they never matched me on rent to cover my mortgage. 

Next there was this new girl Amanda who sub leased from my daughters.  This is for a room in a popular spot in California and Alexis said she was changing her $2000 and Alexis was paying her part. I thought Amanda defaulted because that’s what my daughter told me. I moved in with eviction paperwork as soon as I could legally do so. It was sent and Amanda had a lawyer and showed me the receipts where she paid Alexis every month on time or Alexis. I asked my daughter wtf is going on and my daughter lied to me it has been her not paying. I’m stupid and moment that I realize Alexis was the problem. Amanda still moved out and I have a pending lawsuit from her. 

I told Alexis that I’m sick of owning this town house at a loss and I’m selling it before the housing bubble bust. My daughter thinks I should give her the profit and I told her she is the reason I’m selling it she has never paid rent. I told her I could legally evict her or she can move out on her own. My family is thinking that I am the worst mom and I have told everyone that Alexis has not only scammed me but other people. Alexis checked herself in rehab trying to make it harder on me to evict her but now I’m determined and my family is upset and her father(divorced) cannot figure how I can do this to her? ",0.14
"AITA for voting to sell the family cottage Back in 94 my grandpa put the family cottage into a partnership that included him, my parents, me, and my 4 siblings (we were small kids). He did this to legally protect the cottage since my grandma was suffering from severe mental illness and was talking about giving the cottage away. 

The cottage was built by hand by my great grandpa over 100 years ago. It is a seasonal 1600 sq ft oceanfront property on the coast of Maine in a cute tourist town. The cottage is located next to two other homes, with which it shares a dock and parking, and those homes are shared by many members of the extended family. The cottage is a very sentimental place to many.

Since 08 my grandpa was begging to add his daughters to the partnership. He said not including them was one of the biggest regrets of his life. Adding my Aunts was not allowed to be under consideration because my mom absolutely refused to work them.

My grandpa ran the place as GP and would rent it out to pay for upkeep. We would put in sweat equity every Spring and Fall. My grandpa and Aunts were suspicious that my parents wanted to sell the cottage. My grandpa kept saying that “this is not a money maker from rentals – we break even” and that the cottage is intended to be passed down to the next generation. My parents insisted that the reason they did not want the Aunts included was because my mom didn’t want to work with them. They said they did not want to sell the place. My mom would always say that if someone needed a life saving medical procedure ONLY THEN would we sell it. My Aunt’s could use it every summer and it would stay in the family–so why do they need shares? This was their main argument for not including them.

Grandpa passed away 07/25/2024. According to the partnership, we have 90 days to unanimously decide to continue, otherwise the cottage goes up for sale. My grandpa's dying wish was that we don’t sell the cottage. The only person that wants to not sell in my immediate family is one brother. My mom, who wanted to run the place, now wants to sell because she wants to pay off her mortgage. Her and my father are in their 60s and have 0 for retirement. My other brother bought a house that needs repairs. I have kids and can’t save enough to afford a downpayment on a house. Most of us dislike putting sweat equity into the place. We are going to try and sell shares to extended family (10% off) but I don’t think there is enough money – it would be about 700k. If we sell everyone would get \~100k. We would split the profit 9 ways to include my Aunt’s. My SIL says that the place isn’t ours to sell, that we are stewards of it for future generations, and that we are basically stealing from her son (whom she wants to experience the place). My brother and SIL have offered to run the place and maintain it, and not ask anything of us. But everyone wants the money so it looks like it’s going to get sold. AITA for voting to sell the family cottage?

"WIBTA if I do what my niblings do?  Okay, so this is purely hypothetical bc I am unfortunately not this level of petty but here's the situation:

My (30s NB) niblings, 12F and 10M, have been running around every night from 12am to 5am all summer. We've spoke to them many many times about the noise level but they just continue. The frustrating part comes from the fact that they're quieter during the day than they are at night. 

Now their excuse is that they're playing with the cat. And I know cats are mischievous but afaik they don't open the fridge, grab pickles, laugh loudly to each other, and chase each other up the stairs. I don't think our cat can turn into two beings but it might. 

I have a concussion and of course they woke me up with their running which sucks cause my head feels like it's gonna fall off. Of course it ""was the cat"" bc yk cats famously sound like two kids running around and giggling. And cats also stop running when you send a text to tell the kids to stop running bc cats are great at listening. 

Now I told my niece that they woke me and it's been literal months of us telling them to stop running. Even though it was definitely the cat and not the kids her response is that all kids run around at night. 

Here's where the aita comes in. When they get back in school I want to go up at 3am and play with the cat. Bc yk that's what we do in this house when people are trying to sleep. WIBTA? ",0.17
"AITA For telling my wife her sister is about to ruin 2 marriages My wife's sister is going through a very rough time.  Her husband of 5 years kicked her out of his house after he found out about an affair she had earlier in their marriage.  He is now questioning the paternity of their 2 kids (4 & 2).  My wife being the people-pleasing big sister that she is, agreed to take her sister and the kids into our home.  They've been living with us for about 8 weeks.  

The paternity question is currently tied up in the courts because SIL is refusing to consent to testing the kids.  She is adamant that her husband is the father.  They also have divorce proceedings going on, so it's a whole lot of stuff.  SIL spends a lot of time crying but I'm finding it hard to feel sorry for her.  She doesn't deny the affair and knows she messed up.  But still, I have very little sympathy for her.  I'm cordial and polite with her but that's about it.  I refuse to be a shoulder to cry on or lend an ear to let her vent.  

When they first came to stay with us, my wife and I agreed to give them 2 months and then reevaluate.  Those 2 months have passed and I'm ready for them to leave.  My wife and I don't have kids of our own and having 2 in the house has been an adjustment I have struggled with.  My wife has even had to take time off work to help with the kids during court hearings.  

I had a talk with my wife the other night about how things are going and expressed to her my concerns and how I'm feeling.  She agreed that things are difficult now, but also expressed that her sister is still dealing with a lot with the paternity and divorce.  She said we should let things play out in the courts before rushing to make SIL's life even more difficult.  

I told her I don't want to wait on the courts because who knows how long that will take.  I told her that she and SIL need to figure out a plan because the current arrangement is not working for me.  My wife told me that she knows this is hard on me and asked me to be patient and she'll work with her sister to figure out a plan.  I told her that they need to figure out something ASAP before SIL ruins two marriages.

My wife got upset at that and asked me what I meant.  I told her it's exactly what it sounds like.  SIL already ruined her marriage and her presence in our house is now causing conflict and potential resentment in ours.  She told me I'm being an AH by trying to put her in a position to where she has to pick between me and her sister and niblings.

We're already in couples therapy but that isn't helping much.  I know my wife is stressed and feels torn, but I'm feeling like a 3rd wheel in my own house.  My wife has said she's more concerned about the kids than she is SIL because they are innocent in all this.  I've started refusing to do anything to help with the kids and will find excuses to do something else when asked to help with them, which I know has made my wife's and SIL's lives harder.  ",0.15

"AITA kicking off about my boyfriend’s friendships? Hi all, I’m stuck between I’m in the right in how I feel and it’s my mental health(trust issues/paranoia, possible bpd) 

I’ve been with my boyfriend for a year and a half, and living together for nearly just as long, I split from my ex not long before getting with my now boyfriend and never realised just how badly it impacted me and caused a lot of mental issues until it became a regular argument with my boyfriend 

He has two close female friends, one an ex from years ago who he got back with again before breaking up with again, not speaking for ages then forming a friendship and one he met years ago from a dating site.

I didn’t think I would have such issues with him being friends with an ex but his friendships with both females has caused a lot of paranoia and arguments, he thinks I’m just overthinking things and calls me paranoid, I think his closeness with them disrespects me and our relationship.
He has banter with his ex where they take this mick out of each other or speak on the phone/facetime (she’s in a relationship and apparently is very happy in it)
His other friend, they text a lot and spend hours talking on the phone to each other or FaceTiming when I’m not there (mainly because of the arguments it would cause because of me and my head) 
He love hearted a selfie of her and her son which caused an argument because in my mind yeah it’s a nice photo but why does it deserve a heart emoji? He said I’m not looking at the context of it and it’s not like she’s dressed inappropriate or anything and that it’s just a family photo
When we’ve had arguments, he speaks to her and gets her opinion on it which feels like there’s no privacy being in this relationship. He asked me to ask my coworkers their opinion on him hearting that photo and they agreed with me, I asked them their opinion and made sure to mention my paranoia issues so they could give their honest opinion (now we’re all wrong because of their issues make this opinion unreliable) but his friend’s opinion is right which makes him right (let’s face it, people will agree to something when it benefits them) 
The latest argument was we was texting each other then he read my message and never replied back (he said he had nothing to respond back to it) but then said he had been on the phone to his friend for hours, which made me feel like my conversation wasn’t as important and I’m not as much as a priority as he said I am. 
Despite living together, I don’t feel we have a lot of deep, hours long conversations but he seems to be able to get his mental stimulation from talking to them for hours.
He has cut out friends before when his ex had issues with it but says he’ll never do that again (he only has female friends as he doesn’t connect to males)

I F20 have been working at a fast food place this summer and was expecting to work there for a while since I had to do college online this year due to no housing. Fast forward to last month, I found out they had a spot open for me and I could go back to college this fall.

I told my manager that I could work up until today but told her a few days ago that I underestimated how much I have to do preparing for college and that yesterday would be my last day.

So yesterday after my last shift she told me that if I don’t come into work today, that means that I quit. 

I explained to her that we discussed this already and she knows I tried to find someone to cover me but couldn’t, I have never missed a day of work or even called out. But regardless of what I said, she reiterated that if I don’t come this one day then I quit. This manager has been pretty nasty to me in the past, telling me months ago that I talk too damn much for telling my 17 year old coworker that she should go to the job that was offering her more, waiting until I would clock out to tell me to wipe one singular stain off the table and clock me back in, me telling her my roads were flooded during hurricane Debby and her telling me I had no choice but to come, seeing my coworkers do no call and no shows yet still coming into work the next day unscathed, and overall doing little things that made me dread working shifts with her. I feel like she has been taking advantage of my kindness and knowing that I need this job at the other location, but this was my last straw. Im nervous that she’ll go and tell the managers at the other location that I quit and am not reliable. What should I do?",0.13
"AITA For telling my girlfriend it felt weird that she made AI write her ceremony speech? My girlfriend is officiating her best friends wedding this weekend. She is 35 and has been best friends with the bride to be since they were 2.

She was reading what she had for the ceramony to me last night and I said that it sounded great. She replied and said ""well I had Chat GPT write it."" I replied and asked if it wrote the whole thing and she said ""more or less, yes.""

I then said that it made me feel kinda weird in my stomach that she would have AI write the ceremony for her longest and dearest best friend. I said that to me, it seemed a little disingenuous since she they have been best friends their entire life and she is an amazing writer who could wrote something of equal or greater caliber to what AI wrote. To wrote something from her heart that reflected what this life event meant to her best friend.

I said I couldn't really explain why I felt that way, but that it made me feel weird in my gut.

She got pretty upset about it and said that I was calling her lazy and that I said she was an immoral person. She cried a lot and said I made her feel like a POS, which made me feel like a POS.

I apologized a lot and said I didn't mean for her to feel that way. I said that I felt that it was important in a relationship to voice concerns if we felt weird about something. I still feel like a dick.

AITA Took my son to the beach First time posting on Reddit. I’m in a relationship with a woman who has 3 kids. I have 1 from a previous relationship. I am currently the stay at home dad for the summer and spend lots of time with all of the kids. This morning my son wanted to spend some alone time with me and asked to go to the local beach for 30 min and swim with me. I took him and we had some rare alone time in a very busy house. My fiancé comes home from work and finds out and starts lecturing me on how what I did was wrong and starts going off on me about how I should have taken all the kids etc. Am I the asshole ? ,0.17
"AITA for being enraged that my long term therapist raised her rate and gentrified me out of working with her  My therapist of 4 years is coming back from a 6 month maternity leave and just informed me my rate is being increased 45%. 

My rate is low ($100 a session) because I utilize sliding scale, however, when we started working together she was working at a counseling center that took my insurance and has since opened a private practice. She is aware that I am a student (she inspired me to pursue a degree in clinical mental health counseling) and my finances are tight, making this new rate inaccessible.

I understand that therapists raise their rates and she just had a baby, but a 45% increase all at once feels unethical. Moving forward she plans on taking a limited number of clients (12-14 including biweekly clients) and it appears as though I am a casualty of this decision, despite how long we’ve worked together. I am also upset she didn’t tell me about her increase in rates sooner because I would have been looking for a new therapist during her leave. 

Is my disappointment/irritation valid? Or am I being inconsiderate?  ",0.96
"AITA for giving my husband’s niece special attention? I (32F) am married to “Todd” (35M). He comes from a large family with a lot of nieces and nephews.  Family gatherings took some getting used to as I’m an only child of two only children, but it’s fun. Todd and I don’t really want to have our own kids so we’re the cool aunt and uncle. We also have pretty successful careers and make way, way more between the two of us than any one else in the family so we try to spoil the kids a little at birthdays and Christmas.

One of the nieces “Ashley” (13F) has a more difficult situation than the others.  Ashley’s mom got pregnant right out of high school and the father bailed. Her step-dad does a decent job and I think he does try to treat her like her siblings, but it’s clear that Ashley knows she’s different and has feelings about it.  Her mom has 2 other kids under 4 right now there’s not a lot of spare attention or money in the house. 

When the younger kids were born and I could see that Ashley was having trouble with it, Todd and I started offering to have her over at our place more so that her mom could focus on the babies and Ashley could have a break. Her mom has always been grateful for the help. I occasionally send her back with a new outfit or books or a souvenir I bought her on a work trip. The extra attention has really helped her settle down and she’s doing better in school and seems to be coping with her siblings.

I guess it didn’t occur to me or Todd that the rest of the family didn’t know we were doing all that and it came to a head right before school started. I was going to go to the beach for a few days while Todd was traveling for work and I invited Ashley to come with me for a “girls trip”. She rarely gets to travel and her parents were happy for her to have the opportunity, so we had a blast. I had sent her mom a lot of pictures and she posted some in the family group chat. Apparently some of the other kids saw them and were hurt that they didn’t get invited to go and the parents were kind of mad. Todd explained to them individually that we feel like Ashley kind of needs the extra attention but his siblings are now mad that we’re playing favorites and kinda mad at Ashley’s mom for accepting so much from us. His parents said that they know we’re trying to be nice, but we shouldn’t do more for Ashley than the rest of the family because it stirs up a lot of bad feelings and jealousy.",0.11
"AITA because I (30f) want my partner (30m) to get a better job? 
My partner and I have been together for almost ten years, and we share an incredible connection that people often notice. Despite this, I’m struggling with the financial imbalance in our relationship. I’m the primary breadwinner, making about 90% of our income from a demanding job, while he’s an artist with inconsistent earnings, contributing very little.

I’ve been supporting our lifestyle, which includes traveling and living well, but it’s becoming increasingly hard for me. When we first met, he didn’t have a job or much ambition, and even when we were living in our car and I started a business, he didn’t help much. His lack of drive has been a constant issue. To make matters worse, he cheated on me when I was supporting him, which led to me having an affair myself, with someone who financially supported me. I know it was wrong, but it made me realize what I deserve. He bought me a Range Rover cash etc

Now, he spends a lot of time on TikTok instead of trying to improve his situation. We’re engaged but can only afford a courthouse wedding, which I’m not happy about. I’m frustrated that while I’m working hard every day, he doesn’t contribute financially or help much around the house. I’m exhausted and considering taking a break from work to move to a country where his income might be enough to support us. Even though we love each other, these ongoing issues are putting a serious strain on our relationship.",0.59
"AITA for wanting a do-over birthday party? For reference, I am 60, not 6.  I, (60F) have moderately severe social anxiety.  Each year my birthday is fraught because I want to feel special, but don't.  For most birthdays, that's ok, but this was my big 6-0!  I have worked very hard over the past couple of years, and finally had what I thought was a good, tight friends group.  I didn't expect much for my birthday, but a couple of months ago at one friend's 52nd, we had about 12-13 people out for dinner.  So I thought it would be similar and I was really excited to go.

But, when my husband and I got to the restaurant for my dinner, there were literally 2 women sitting there.  And the first thing they did when I sat down was to tell me all the people who could not come.  In the end, only 2 other women showed up, and we were sitting there in the middle of a 12 person table looking pathetic.

Now, I'm grateful for the 4 women who showed, and especially for the one who tried to arrange it, but overall, I was devastated!  And worse than just the low numbers was the fact that one of my very best friends didn't come.  And she was not caring for a sick child or anything, but out at a bar. 

I behaved while we were out, but when I got home, I spent the night crying.  A couple of people, including the supposed best friend mentioned a do-over party but when I said that would be great, they backed off, saying that it would be weird to invite people to 2 parties, and insulting to the woman who hosted the first one.

So, what do you think?  AITA for wanting another party?  I can't stand the thought of this being my only memory of this birthday, and TBH, if this reflects my importance to them, then I think maybe I was wrong about thinking they were my friends after all.",0.07

I have always helped out the most, spent my summer etc working for my father. Because of this i was gonna get a bigger part of the inheritance.

A couple of days ago i had a falling out with my father and now he wants to divide the inheritance evenly. And instead pay me for the time I spent working for him, for which he wants to give me 10k.

"AITA for not telling my family about my gf being pregnant? When I(27M) was 19 I moved to a different country to explore the world, I found a girlfriend and we are happily living together with 1 kid, now we recently had our second one but I did not inform my family about the pregnancy, my girlfriend wanted to keep this pregnancy as much as possible a secret to reveal once he was born. I thought it would be a nice surprise to tell them when the baby is born. Important to mention is that we live in the country my girlfriend is from so her close family knew about the pregnancy since they saw her growing. We did not mention anything until they asked about it and we knew we would have to tell them something at some point as they needed to help us out for the birth. Any other information was also hidden until the birth. Now my family is mad at me for not telling them anything. AITA for keeping it a secret and a wonderful surprise at birth?

"AITA FOR ASKING MY BF TO STOP USING PLASTIC BAGS AS CONTRACEPTION?  
So I know this is probably unheard of but I (f20) have been with my boyfriend (m22) khalid for 7 months. I came off the pill a year ago due to some health issues and I am unable to go back on it, he is really adamant that he does not want to have a child with me and that we must use some sort of contraception. I am unable to use condoms because I always end up with hives and a rash because of the latex. Because of this we do not have sex regularly, which affects our relationship. Khalid came up with the idea to use plastic bags which I was opposed to in the beginning but I was scared of losing him due to personal insecurity issues so I stupidly went along with it. It has been 3 months since we first had sex using a plastic bag, and it has affected me in many ways. Firstly, it has made me feel very sore. Secondly, I can’t shake the feeling that this whole fucking with a plastic bag is somewhat strange. I spoke to Khalid last week about it after one of my friends told me I need to voice my concerns. He was adamant that this is something he enjoys doing, and doesn’t want to stop. I explained that I find it weird but I could see that it upset him so I didn’t bring it up again until this morning. I told him that I don’t want to use a plastic bag anymore as it is uncomfortable and embarrassing. When I said this to him he was really upset and said that I am trying to “baby trap” him, which is not my intention as I don’t want to have a baby right now. 

I’m not sure what to do moving forward. I love him so much and would do a lot for him, but I deeply regret ever saying ‘yes’ to using a plastic bag as contraception. AITA??

"AITA for taking what I believe is fair?  This is going to be a long story and I am going to try and make it as short as possible. I (32f) have a cousin (32f) who has struggled off and on with substance abuse. She and her husband (deceased) have 4 children. Three of the kids are his. The oldest was not. Cousin gets check for the 3 that are his. She recently relapsed and has left me in charge of her youngest kiddo, her finances and making her car payment while she is away. (I am the co-signer on her car) she left her car with her parents (who do not have one of their own) so they could get the kids (3 oldest) back and forth to school. The check she gets are the youngest 3. Now in my mind I should divide the sum of the check by 4 take 1/4 for the child I have. Take the other 3/4 make the car payment and insurance payment and give what’s left for her parents. In the end I would end up with more leftover funds than her parents. But I feel like if they are driving the car to take care of the kids then they should be the ones paying for it. However I know her parents and they 1. Don’t have the best track records with taking care of and paying for cars. 2. Only interested in taking the money for themselves. I don’t disagree that they should get what is fair as they do have the kids right now but I also don’t want to get screwed by them either.

"AITAH Cousin’s wedding invitation no kids no plus one I may be wrong but I was really surprised when a family member recently sent an invitation to their wedding but just for me… no plus one even though I’ve been in a relationship for about 6 years and they are aware.  The invitation also says no children are to attend. I am aware that some couples do that but in this case I know with 99% certainty there will be some children there. Some as young as 7 years old. My children are teenagers but are being excluded because they are children???  Even when I offered to pay for the plate my teens would be served, I am still not allowed to bring them.  I wouldn’t be so upset but I spoke to both parties in the couple about bringing my kids months ago.. way before they had a venue chosen.

"AITA for not swimming?  in a few days me and my friend group will take a trip, i don't like the sea but ofc it's summer, where else should we go? specifically it's more of a problem with the water that i have, i can swim (learned when i was a kid) but i don't like at all the idea of swimming in the sea or pool or whatever but specifically sea water scares me and disgusts me a bit regardless of how clear it is. usually my rejection for sea water is not a problem as i simply stay on the shore and sunbathe all day, it's not a problem for me and it isn't for my friends, we all enjoy our time together.
The point is that for this fuckass vacation we also bookes a little boat trip that allows us to take dives in open sea, like really really far from shore and I don't even know if i'm gonna get seasick but sure as hell i won't get off the boat, at some point we'll be able to get off on this little ""island"" and take a look around the water caves and just swim around in the sea but i don't want to for the reasons said before. i'll be taking pictures and stuff cause I'll be enjoying myself anyway but i am scared my friends will not be as happy and that they'll get ""sad"" or think of me as a bore or someone who doesn't want to have fun.

"AITA for not defending my girlfriend? My gf and I are both women, but she dresses a lot more revealing than I do. I don't want the attention, so I try to dress to avoid it. She likes the attention, though.

We're on holiday, and so far we've been gawked at and cat called a few times. Mostly because of how she's dressed. I do my best to avoid it but it is really annoying for me because how she dresses gets more attention. We already get enough attention, she doesn't need to add to it.

But anyway, today we were walking down the street and an older women called her a ""cheap slut."" I couldn't hear whatever else she said because I started walking fast and pretending I didn't hear her. My gf was walking with me, she was angry, she didn't say anything, though, to the lady.

After we get away she got mad at me. She said I didn't defend her, and she's annoyed.

I said she makes the CHOICE to dress that way, knowing it'll bring her attention, so she has to deal with the consequences. I'm not a confrontational person at all, so I'm not going to go scream at people for her. If she has a problem, she needs to stand up for herself.

Either way she got upset at me. It feels like she's treating me like I'm the boy in the relationship, like I need to defend her honor like she's some damsel in distress. I would much rather stand up for myself than make my gf do it for me. But either way, she's annoyed at me for not saying anything.

"AITA for holding a ""Lottery"" to see who gets to be a guest at my wedding? I (33F) am engaged to my wonderful partner and love of my life (35F). She is a Vascular Surgeon and I am a Paediatric Surgeon. We met while working in the same hospital. Most of our friends work in the same Hospital as your social circle becomes rather closed when you're always at the same place. Obviously we can't invite everyone we'd want to because of logistics, not everyone will be able to get the same time off and we don't want to leave the Hospital understaffed more than it already is. 

We discussed this and decided we'd each get 3 people who would be invited no questions asked, and the rest we'd draw from a hat and after the wedding and reception we'd go to the hospital with cake and food for our coworkers so they could enjoy some of the celebration too. 

We told this plan to our families when we were discussing how many invitations we'd need to order and both sides think this is strange and unfair, and will create  tension in our workplace. Honestly I think our coworkers would get a laugh out of it and so does my partner, and we're bringing food and cake after so it's not like we're forgetting those who can't make it.

"AITA for refusing to give any leftovers to my SIL? Hi Reddit! So I (22f) am a psychology student in college and my classes started this Monday. I have online classes Tuesday and Thursday from 9-10:30am on Zoom and Monday, Wednesday and Friday, I have psychology work hours over at my college shadowing my counselor for work hours.

 Anyway, my wife (23) and I had decided to do an early dinner for a movie night yesterday as I got off “work” early. My wife “Lizzie” was babysitting her 2 nephews (age 4 years old and age 6 months) for my SIL (25f) “Maggie”. Maggie came by to pick up the kids AFTER we had made a simple and quick dinner (literally chicken nuggets, waffle cut fries and string beans)  as we had kids and it was easier that way, plus the wife and I love a simple dinner like this. Maggie was complaining about her work day and how tired she was and that she didn’t have the energy to cook the kids dinner and I had stated that they were already fed. Maggie ended up asking what we had made and Lizzie responded with our dinner. Maggie asked if we had leftovers (I ALWAYS make more for our lunches or dinner the next day anyway) and I replied that we did. Maggie asked if she could have some and I responded “no” and explained my reasoning why. We ended up getting it after Maggie whined and complained of tired she was from work (She’s a dog walker and had two clients today who had 2 dogs each). She worked from 9 in the morning to 6 pm in the afternoon so I’m not too sure what Maggie did inbetween as her clients were scheduled for 10am and noon. Lizzie cut in and told Maggie I had stated my reasoning for it. Maggie took her kids and left, not before telling Lizzie that I was major a-hole that I ‘wasn’t feeding her’

So, AITA?


EDIT: Maggie pays Lizzie $45 a day to watch both boys and is the DICTIONARY DEFINITION of a golden child. She, a grown woman, will pout and complain if she doesn’t get her way and I don’t think hasn’t been told no growing up. To confirm, Lizzie has mentioned that everyone always favored Maggie because she was a miracle baby",0.01
AITA for expecting my husband to pay my bills? Some back story we have been married for almost a year now.  We just had our first baby girl together in June and she is 2 months old now. We have not had a good marriage since I had gotten pregnant.  We fought non stop and never agreed on anything.  My pregnancy was rough so I didn’t work much.  So now since I have had our baby I am a stay at home mom.  I have debt from before marriage and my husband knew about it before the marriage.  So when I couldn’t work bc I breastfeed baby girl and take care of her all by my self I was expecting him to help pay my bills.  I told him I would go back to work when she was 6 months old.  My credit card is 266 a month and that’s all I need him to cover.  I don’t ask for anything else but that.  He refuses and says if I want those paid that I need to get a job just enough to pay that each month.  He says that I had the debt before marriage and it’s not fair to him to half to pay it.  I understand that but since he got me pregnant and I am down right now he would help till I could work again.  Am I in the wrong for asking him to do that for me?,0.3

Before he came home we had talks of getting back together but my heart just wasn’t in it anymore. Anyway, we’re having a birthday party and he briefly mentioned his gf coming. Now the thing is, the gf was once my child’s god mother. I confided in her about many things we’d gone through but we grew apart a few years ago. She didn’t know him beforehand yet started a relationship with him the last two years of his sentence. I found all of this out through my daughter a week after he was released. He really wasn’t going to tell me he had a gf let alone it was a friend. A few months back I was blocked from her account but didn’t understand why because we left off on okay terms, so imagine my confusion when I found out the real reason I was blocked. Me and her had a conversation which I could’ve done without, but I did it for the sake of my daughter spending time with her father because he moved in with her.

"AITA for explaining to my brother how game audio works? So to start things off, we’re a muslim family and I’m an 18 year old boy who loves gaming and playing around, while my brother, 24, is more stoic (At least tries to) and more grumpy, he’s the type of guy where you can’t have a conversation with unless it doesn’t involve him or his problems, especially with someone like me, which I personally feel like he tolerates the least, but anyways so there I was in my room playing on my switch (play splatoon 3 that games fun af) and my brother comes in asking me to set up the Wii, (we’ve had it for a long time but he recently got back playing on it.) 

So the game starts, (We were playing Nicktoons Globs of Doom)  and while playing the characters voices were REALLY loud, so I paused the game to turn the voices down, my bro asked what I was doing, and I said “Turning down the volume.” And his response was, “Just turn it down from the TV.” I explained that it’s the voices specially that I’m turning down and while doing so he got annoyed saying I’m turning it down too much (I tuned it from 10 to like 4, but you need to understand that those grunt sounds they make in game are LOUD.)

 so I stopped and he once again said we could just turn down the T.V and I once again explained that the point of the audio settings was for tuning specific sounds. So we got back playing with him being visibly annoyed so I tried making funny remarks like “You're about to die.” And stuff like that, only for his response to be a grumpy “I don’t care.”

 I don’t even know what happened after but guess I made a remark on the audio settings which got him pissed as he started raising his voice saying “Can you stop talking about that?!” I then tried calming him down telling him he doesn’t need to get worked up over it and idk why but I started jokingly saying “shhhhh” which made him even more mad as he threw the controller across the room storming out saying “You're so annoying!” He repeated while going downstairs. 

My mom who heard then told me I was in the wrong and I should stop bullying him (remember the age difference here) and my bro then for some reason asked me if I even prayed Isha yet, which I guess it’s because I sometimes pray a little late so he tried getting at me, though I did so that’s what I said, he kept making a big deal out of it the whole time, which at that point, I kinda just found it amusing because my mom was so into what he had to say while refusing to hear me out, only for him to finish saying, “I don’t even want to keep fighting, I don’t want to make this a big deal.” And went to his room all calm and composed and proceeded to listen to the Quran, so now I’m sitting in my room still trying to process all this cuz I did keep bringing up the audio, but did he have to blow up like that?

"AITA for wanting, even demanding, that my roommate get rid of his dog Okay so here's the story: our roommate (also my brother in law) is a little chihuahua mix who is, in my opinion, at least a little bit evil. I desperately want to get rid of him and both my brother in law and my husband are against me. We have a 4 year old and a 6  month old who is starting to learn to crawl. The chihuahua shits in the house in the middle of the night, at least once a week. By the time we all wake up, the smell dissipates, so I don't always notice it right away. My worry is when the baby starts crawling, he will find it before me and put it in his mouth. The 4 year old already accidently rolled a toy through it last week. He also is bitey and isn't good with kids once they can walk and grab, while we do teach to be soft with animals, he gets mad for them even trying to pet him and has bit our 4 year old multiple times (though those bites haven't broken skin enough to bleed, they still bruise) and that's just not okay to me. He once even bit a hole through one of our friends noses when he was trying to pet him. We ripped up the carpet and the amount of stains underneath from him peeing on the floor was insane.

"AITA for having a bf and falling for another friend? I feel so so terrible asking this and feeling this way, but I (18f) have been dating my bf (18m) for 6 months or so now, and he is a great guy but he's not very romantic and neither does he meet my emotional needs. I never realized this is something I greatly valued in a relationship until I met my guy friend (19m). We are both communicators and have gotten each other through such tough times; I've never opened up to anyone but he has gotten me through so much and gotten me to open up, even when I never wanted to. I am used to caring for others, but not used to being cared for. We ended up in this situation through hanging out in a friend group (my bf is not a part of this friend group).

He (guy friend) struggles with a lot mentally so I have sat on call with him late into the night to help and make sure he is safe. I know this is not fair to my bf, and I need to break it off with him but I don't know how because he hasn't done anything wrong, we are just incompatible in a relationship sense. I love both of them, and I know my bf deserves someone who does not feel this way, and I need someone who will emotionally be there for me too. My bf cares for me a lot and he shows it in his own ways, we just don't match in that manner and I don't want to force my emotional burdens on him when he isn't equipped for them.

I think the emotional vulnerability with my guy friend and just who he is as a person has led me to have some feelings for him (and he has feelings for me too which is unfortunate), but I do not want to be in a ""dump my bf for another guy"" situation bc that is so disgusting, and I feel terrible for feeling this way. Being listened to and helped and consoled has helped so much, and we both have similar mental health struggled which adds relatability. We're the same person in different fonts.

Also, to complicate things, a female friend (18f) from the friend group who is also very close to me, and she recently confessed she has feelings for the guy friend, and she wants me to try to set them up.

AITA? And mostly what do I do 😭

TLDR: I have a bf but am falling for a guy friend, and I don't know how to break it off bc no one has done anything wrong (other than me) and where to go from there because a close female friend likes the same guy friend.

"AITA for telling my sister I’m getting the same material glasses as her? I’ve had glasses for as long as I can remember. When I was younger my older sister would bully me for them so I would hide them in my backpack once I got to school but eventually my mom found out and had my teacher search my bag everyday. So I started hiding them around the house and even broke them on a few occasions. I hated them but once i reached fourth grade I started wearing them. 

I stopped when I reached high school and have been trying to get back in the habit of wearing them since then. In the past couple of years I’ve tried multiple frames and I just hate them. Recently, though, I’ve been getting headaches when I don’t wear them but I just cringe whenever I see my own reflection. 

Now to my younger sister. She got glasses a few years after I did she went through a few styles before settling on her recent frames. The day that she picked them out, we were both looking for a new glasses and I recommended she get clear frames and in return she picked out a pair of metal frames for me. I ended up hating those glasses more than any other that I’ve had while she loved hers.

I’ve tried every style but clear even though I’ve always liked them. I think that if I had a pair with clear frames I’d be more likely to wear them because right now I have to just deal with the blurriness and headaches or wear glasses that make me avoid looking at myself altogether. 

The only reason I haven’t gotten them yet is because I brought this up with her as a courtesy, thinking that she wouldn’t mind but she got really upset and said that it was her ‘signature’ and that I’d be fucked up if I got those.

I kind of get where she’s coming from but also I’ve never had a problem with sharing things so I can’t fully understand how she feels. 

I don’t know; am I the asshole?

"AITA for asking my boyfriend to cuddle with me after hours of him being on the living room couch? For context, my boyfriend and I have been together for six years. We started dating pretty young (14) and we would always hang out at each other's houses until we moved in together at (20).

We use to cuddle everyday, even when we went to college and we lived in two separate dorm rooms, we would lay in each other's beds and cuddle for at least an hour or thirty minutes a day. Never forced and it isn't like a sexual thing or anything. We would watch TV or scroll on our phones, or even just sleep.

When we moved into our apartment the first half, he'd still do it, no problem. Recently, he'll come home from work at 5:00 PM and stay on our living room couch without coming to the bed at all.

The couch is two reclining chairs put together with a holder and cup holder in the middle. You can't cuddle or even be next to the other person without the medium in the way.

He will sit there the entire time watching TV (on our way smaller and more grainy TV than the big brand new one in the living room,) or just sit there playing guitar.

I'll ask him everyday to come into bed and cuddle when he's obviously not busy doing something and it seems like we both can lay down and relax. Literally every time his response is ""Idk like an hour I'll come in"" and he NEVER DOES and if I go and ask again, he'll bump it up another hour. 

He will never come in here anymore and if he does it's a blue moon.

I recently went to Japan for three weeks and it's the longest we've been apart for years. Everyday he texted, saying he misses me and wants to be close to me and cuddle.

I come back, and he's getting even more mad that I'm asking him to cuddle just at least for a minute so he can get out of the pitch dark living room reclining chair he's in and be close with me.

I asked and he said the same response and I said ""Whatever you use to never do this, in Japan you wanted me back so bad and you just are glued to this couch still."" then I left to go to the bathroom and I came back and he's saying ""DO YOU THINK I FIND IT ATTRACTIVE THAT YOU BEG ME TO COME CUDDLE WITH YOU EVERYDAY WHEN I JUST WANT TO SIT HERE?!!!"" and I called him weird and I just laid down.

I just don't get it. He will have all the lights off sitting in that reclining chair no matter what. The better TV and the more comfier spot is in the bedroom. It literally smells better in here, has less, a huge TV, a fan, it's a whole better area! I don't understand?

"AITA I (M25) got into an argument with my gf (22) because she called her ex Tonight, I had an argument with my girlfriend of one year after she called her ex-boyfriend to apologize for something that happened over a year ago.

When we first met last summer, we had a rough start because she joked about infidelity. She believed it was harmless, expecting me to trust she’d never actually cheat. We argued but eventually moved on, and she promised to stop making those jokes. 

Later, we argued about her allowing men who were interested in her to keep contacting her without directly telling them she wasn’t interested. After multiple arguments, she promised to stop, but she didn’t follow through.

She kept in touch with an ex-boyfriend, claiming she had no feelings for him and that he knew how serious our relationship was. I could tell he was still interested, but I decided not to seem insecure and let it go. One day, while we were cuddling in the kitchen, her ex called. She looked at her phone but didn’t answer. I noticed the caller ID and walked away to the living room. She let the phone ring and continued doing things in the kitchen, which is in the same area.

She came over and asked why I wasn’t talking and why I had walked away. I told her I felt uncomfortable and asked why she didn’t pick up the phone when she answers all her other calls in front of me, just as I do with her. I questioned why, if she’s okay with texting him and talking sometimes, she couldn’t pick up the phone.

She said there was no issue, that they don’t talk often, and that I shouldn’t be insecure. I told her I was going to leave, but she started crying and begging me to stay. I said, “Okay, if everything is as you say, call him.” So she did.

They talked casually for a bit, and I whispered for her to ask if he knew she was in a relationship. She hesitated but eventually asked. Her ex said he wasn’t aware of any relationship. She started to panic and asked him several times, but he insisted she hadn’t made it clear. I tried to leave, but she cut the call and begged me to stay, insisting she wasn’t playing games. I asked her to call him back, and I had an amicable conversation with him. He assured me there was no issue, that he didn’t want to come between us, and agreed to block her. After the call, she blocked him and deleted his number.

That happened a year ago. Today, she called me to say she had contacted her ex to apologize for her actions. She said she’d always wanted to apologize because she didn’t want to be someone who hurts others. She didn’t tell me beforehand because she thought I’d find it weird. During her explanation, she changed her story a few times, which made me suspicious. I told her that while wanting to apologize was valid, not telling me beforehand made it hard to trust her. It felt sketchy and dishonest. We argued, and now we’re not talking. Am I the asshole?

"AITAH for potentially not going to see my grandma before she dies/not going to her funeral? I (21) live abroad and would need to get on a plane to get to the country she’s in. The thing is, over the years I developed a severe anxiety disorder and even though I used to fly multiple times a year, the idea of having to get on a plane now is just unbearable. I can’t even describe the dread it fills me with. It’s not a fear of the plane crashing, it’s like stuck anxiety, like claustrophobia. A fear of having a panic attack up there and just not being able to deal with it. It’s so bad. The idea of having to wait around at the airport for the plane, the idea of the take off, the flight, the fact that no matter how bad it is I would HAVE to do it again to get back home. 

I’m in therapy and this is a topic of discussion and I’m trying to get better but I feel sick with anxiety at just the idea of having to fly now, before I’m ready. 

My mother expects me to go, even though she knows about my anxiety, she doesn’t really understand it I guess, and I have no idea how to have this conversation with her.

"AITA for getting married in Australia, where I live? I’m a 25 y/o from Germany, and my fiancé (28) is Australian. I moved to Sydney over six years ago, but we make a point to visit my family in Germany at least every 1 1/2 years. Last December, we flew back for the holidays, my birthday, and, as it turned out, for my fiancé to propose to me in my hometown, so my family could share in the moment. Everyone was over the moon for us!



We decided to have our wedding in Sydney, as none of my family, except my mum, has ever visited us here, so we saw it as a great opportunity for them to get a glimpse of our life, meet our friends, and explore Australia. My main concerns were my dad and one of my sisters, both of whom struggle financially, and my sister Jessie (27), has mental health issues that make big gatherings difficult for her.

When we announced that the wedding would be in Sydney, most of the family was keen, but my stepmother immediately brought up their financial issues and the need to cancel other holidays for it. Jessie seemed excited and planned to use the trip to visit New Zealand as well with her boyfriend to see Hobbiton (we're all big nerds).

We chose October 2025 for the wedding to give everyone nearly two years to prepare and to fit around my younger siblings' school schedules - the venue is booked, so the plans are set.

However, things got complicated when I had a falling out with my dad over inviting my aunt (his sister), whom he despises on and off. He initially said he wouldn’t come if she was invited. After my mum intervened, he promised he’d make it to the wedding, saying the thought of missing it was too painful. 

Recently, Jessie sent me a long message saying she understands why my dad is struggling with the wedding and complained about the expense and the effort it takes to get there, which confused me because she was initially so positive about it all, and he had already promised he'd be there.

I told her I’m not forcing anyone to come but really want my dad there, as I’ve never asked him for anything else and I need him. I tried to move on, but the situation has been eating at me ever since. 

This week I found a cheap hotel deal for October next year and shared it with my eldest sister Laura (29), suggesting they book it and cancel if plans change (free of charge). The next morning, I woke up to a voicemail from Jessie, furious and yelling she is not going to attend. Apparently Laura had shared the link with her asking if they should book it, and that's when Jessie disclosed that her bf is turning 30 in December and wants to go on holiday to Asia, which now takes priority over my wedding. Needless to say, things got ugly between them.

I get it if Jessie can’t come due to finances or her mental health but wish she’d at least show some interest and support. It’s been really rough planning the wedding with this hanging over me, and part of me is just wants to elope to avoid the stress it's causing for everyone.

"AITA for telling my friend my feelings? 
I’m completely lost and unsure of how to proceed. Recently, I was told that in order to see my niece, I must also spend solo time with her step-sister. I raised my niece for the first ten years of her life, as she lived with me during that time. My half-sister, her mother, has been in and out of rehab, and we no longer speak. My only option to see my niece is through her father, who has since married and adopted his wife’s 7-year-old daughter.

The first year after my niece’s father remarried was great. I was able to reconnect with my niece, whom I love as my own child. I got to know her stepmother and her step-sister, and while my niece and I continued our solo adventures as we always had, I also spent some time with the entire family. I’ve even developed a friendship with her stepmother.

However, due to a series of surgeries, I couldn’t visit for a year and a half. Despite this, I felt confident that my relationship with my niece remained strong, as I always felt welcomed. Now that I’m slowly recovering, we were planning to resume our solo outings, but the stepmother approached me with a request: since her daughter has become attached to me and sees me as her aunt, she asked that I spend solo time with her as well.

This left me confused because I’ve only spent a handful of group outings with her daughter. The stepmother argued that since her daughter now sees me as “Aunt Jax,” it wouldn’t be fair to exclude her, as it could hurt her feelings. I’ve always made sure her daughter felt seen and valued during our group time, providing equal attention and gifts to both girls. I never corrected her daughter for calling me “Aunt Jax” because it’s what my niece calls me.

When I expressed to the stepmother that I care for her daughter but see her as my friend’s child rather than my niece, things became tense. She was clearly hurt, and our conversation turned uncomfortable. She insisted that because I’m seen as “Aunt Jax” to her daughter, I need to take on the roles and responsibilities of that title. I tried to explain that my primary focus is my relationship with my niece, whom I’ve loved and cared for as my own child. While I’m not against developing a bond with her daughter, I feel this relationship should grow naturally over time, not be forced upon us.

Unfortunately, they’ve made it clear that spending solo time with their daughter is now a condition for me to see my niece. This has raised several red flags for me, especially since the stepmother questioned when I would “make the time” if I truly wanted to foster a relationship. I’m upset and hurt that I’m being asked to fulfill their expectations without them considering my feelings. It’s concerning that my time with my niece, which has always been special to us, is now being controlled rather than respected.

But because of the constant helping out and of course expenses involving school I do not have any savings. 

Last 2 years, they asked help in paying their car however at that time I dont have extra money to give them so they asked my boyfriend for help. They didn’t return the money so I ended up paying for it (which again I didn’t ask them to pay back). Now, early this year, they asked help again for my brother’s tuition. But since I do not have a large amount of money again, they ended up asking my boyfriend. However, up until now they have not paid it yet. Now, they needed money again and they want to borrow again from my boyfriend but before they can do that, I told them no because they have an outstanding debt.

"AITA for ending an almost 4 years long relationship? I 20f met a guy 4.5 years ago at my school, we both loved each other's company to much that we used to basically talk 24/7 and we're constantly laughing. fast forward to some time we randomly decided to date (nothing was planned it was just out of the blue) now at that time we thought it would last just a week or 2. Fast forward we got into the same high school he was a year younger than me, now as time passed I noticed that his personality isn't loved by everyone so much that my friends excluded me from things because he was with me or like we used to hangout out all the time ofc but I tried my best to be with my friends too, at that time I didn't think that he might be the reason of me losing friends but in the future I realized maybe it was him. Now, for the past 1-2 years things have been going down hill, were not the same whatsoever we had a complete personality change, we aren't goofy anymore, we barely share anything to each other and don't even have anything to talk about!! LIKE I DONT GET IT HOW WE ONLY TALK 2-3 WORDS PER REPLY. Also ig it's important to mention that,
during the initial time we used to kiss as well, but soon I realized I am not the type that likes that I don't want to kiss or anything as that's how I've been raised, but whenever we used to meet outside he used to force me to kiss and basically say things like i know you don't like it but I want too and used to basically manipulate me into doing it. Now recently I have been vocal about hating this physical thing and how I dont feel comfortable being around him, and it's not just about him as I as a person myself hate myself too I don't know where is the real me this personality change really fucked up with my brain I don't feel happy anymore I have no friends now and I just feel constant burden on me due to family problems and also the problems I'm facing in this relationship. Recently we had a fight explaining all this to him and he apologized alot and said he'll give me space but I also told him that I want to just end it to which he said u can decide, I'll totally respect whatever u want but before we do can we meet for 15 mints? To which I said okay but after a month or so weet with friends I completely forgot, and neither did he remind me rather when we met he was completely away from me didn't talk the entire time, didn't sit beside me, didn't interact with me, it was me who tried to interact a bit and later when I asked that why were u like this he was like oh I wasn't feeling well so like ya I couldn't do it and then also said that he was upset how I didn't meet him for 15 mints alone. Now also please understand I can't meet friends alot I barely go out to meet friends or anyone once every 2-3 months or even more so when I met him the last time that was after 5 ish months so we he acted that way and just said he was sick I did feel really bad and just thought ke u could have told and we could postpone.

"AITA for telling my cousin his relationship is weird? 


My cousin is 20 years old and recently started dating a woman who’s 39. I know age gaps can work, but this one has been making me feel uncomfortable.

For context, my cousin has always been mature for his age and is pretty built. He’s also been saying for years that he’s into older women, but I never thought he’d actually end up with someone nearly twice his age—and who’s divorced.

His girlfriend is stunning and treats him like royalty. She’s always asking our family for advice on what gifts he’d like or how to make him happy. She seems really dedicated, which is great for him, but it feels a bit intense to me. Earlier, he told me he’s ""living the dream"" because he’s finally with someone who fits his idea of the perfect partner.

I decided to bring up how I felt and told him that I think his relationship is a little weird, especially given the age gap. He just looked at me and said, ""It’s none of your business. Hell, I could date a 60-year-old grandma if I was single”

We were getting along very well, we were flirting, having fun and had even expressed about eventually getting together in the future, but just last night, we had an argument over something, and while he did say “I’m sorry”, his apology felt very dry and in the middle of our discussion, he suddenly said that he was preoccupied at the moment and that we should discuss it later. 

The next morning, he was still very dry with his responses and he later on told me that during that night, that Polish girl has finally replied to him after two months and was planning to see him in his country, and just like that, he told me he was going to push his plans in proposing to her and getting married to her. 

At that time, I was already very irritated since it was very early in the morning, I didn’t get any sleep and mood swings kicked in since my period just started on that day.

While I went searching for it he also went looking in my other bag, that I didn’t really like because it was fully packed. I told him that he should be careful and that he need to check if nothing fell out of my bag. My wallet was in the side pocket with some other things where he went through. Here maybe I am wrong because I should have double checked if everything was there but we also needed to go to the train). 

Couple of hours later we needed to pay for something and I went to grab my wallet out of my bag but it wasn’t there. Of course I immediately went doubting myself if I misplaced it but I know for SURE, that I put it there because we just received our deposit back.

For me this is a lot of money, I don’t have a lot of money but I can still afford the things I want to do or buy because I live very frugal. Still it is a lot of money for me and that I lost this money made me very emotional because I already spent money on this vacation and I didn’t take this in account.

When our kid was younger, 12 like, I'd find him getting ready to go out in my clothes and he'd reject anything for lasses, he'd never let anyone call him a girl, his birth name or she/her.

Liam ended up with a foster family when he was 13. Only thing I can say for them is that they're middle class so they're getting our kid the stuff he wouldn't have with me on the road constantly and earning nowt much. They don't get him at all, they think it's some sort of phase, they have an idea of the family they want and they're trying their best to get it; that includes Liam being a lass and limiting his contact with people he knew before they had him. They don't call my lad male pronouns, they 'compromise' with using they/them, they buy him clothes from both sections.

Last time he came over to my place after school, our kid was moaning about it all. He's a pretty lad, passes, taller than me lmao, but he's upset because he's not in a body he feels comfortable with and his foster parents, Jane (F45) and Graham (M48) are reluctant if not at all against the idea of him being on blockers or hrt.

"AITA for accidentally offending my coworkers  Long story short, we work at this one clinic where we do xrays, my coworkers are both old ladies in their 60's and have been working here for like 10 years so everyone in this facility basically likes them and will take their side in any arguments. 
I've been working here for over 6 months, my first argument with coworker #1 was after i accidentally said the acronym for the hospital name instead of the full name so after she shouted at me from another room to correct myself, which i did, i went up to her and asked ""oh people dont know the acronym? I thought it was well known"" (Now I'm aware i sound stupid and i was wrong) and she basicallyt shouted that OBVIOUSLY patient didn't know it and asked aggressively ""then i guess im stupid for not knowing it"" which i never implied. 

2nd argument was today with 2nd coworker. For reference she works 5.5 hours and i work 7.5 hours. Today it was only her and I and she ends her shift earlier than me obviously, so when it was 30 minutes left till her shift was over she said ""ok it's your time to work"". We both take turns, one works on the computer and the other takes care of the patient. She most of the time at work talks on the phone loudly, takes like 4 food breaks, is lazy and often mentions it so that comment about how its my turn to work was weird since she barely did any herself. 
But i was used to it so i jokingly said ""u still have 30 mins left"". But apparently it wasn't obvious to her it was a joke because then she gave me a silent treatment and right before she was leaving she told me im lucky shes not the other coworker cause she would yell at me, tell me they both have the high ground here and i should let her know im joking because im again rude and i should watch it.

My older sister is the favorite, the one my mom gets along with much better, and I’m frequently pushed to the side because of it. I don’t talk to my parents or sister often because I just don’t have a lot in common with any of them. But I’ve always tried to make an effort when it comes to birthday wishes and holidays. I’m not great at remembering, but I try.

Last year, my mom was asking my sister and I about Thanksgiving plans and I told her that my husband and I wanted to do our own dinner. She sarcastically said not to worry about it since she was “too much of a burden and no fun to be around”. (The burden comment was because she had surgery, but her oldest sister was going to be handling the dinner plans so it’s not like she was relying on me and my sister to cook.) This has led into a downward spiral where she didn’t bother to let me know about Christmas dinner plans, I had to ask to find out what was happening. She has barely talked to me since then.

One of the last things she said to me was when I accidentally forgot to wish her a happy Mother’s Day. She texted me the next day with a wall of text saying that I was “no longer responsible for being a member of this family”. She also made some comment about not taking it out on my aunts and grandma? I’m not sure what she meant by that, usually my aunt would host a Mother’s Day luncheon at her house, but I didn’t hear that it was happening this year so I didn’t go. I suspect that the luncheon happened and no one bothered to tell me, which would explain the comment, but I still don’t know the truth.

I just want to make sure the rest of my family doesn’t accidentally exclude me from family gatherings by assuming that my mom will pass word along. She doesn’t seem to be talking to me anymore, so I just want to make sure invitations actually go to me directly. I know that giving this information to my aunts and grandma is likely to cause them to grief her over the situation, so I’m hesitant to do it. However, I know that the family has already taken my side against her before and I know they’ll do it again. WIBTA if I send my aunts and grandma the texts my mom has sent me so they know why they need to invite me directly to family events?",0.36
"WIBTA. Two weddings one unhappy bride. So bit of context. Me and my partner have been engaged for nearly 9 years and we finally set a date this year. We booked the venues and then told the family. Everyone was really excited but a few weeks later my brother proposed to his girlfriend of 3 or 4 years which I thought was suspicious but I was excited for them.

I told my mum as long as I got married first I'm happy for them. I feel that my wedding should be the one spotlight I shouldn't have to share with other people. She told me oh don't worry you'll get married first, they're going to wait a couple years. Fast forward to a month or so later.

I get a phone call from my mum. Oh your brother has set a date. They want a summer wedding so they are going to do it in July. So three months before yours. That's okay isn't it? I was fuming because again something couldnt just be my own. Also I'm paying money for my wedding, I can't afford to gift them something decent in that short time frame. I voiced how I felt and I got backlash and was told I was being silly and selfish. This is all while I was dealing with the backlash of my previous post. They never even spoke to me about it to see how I'd feel.

"AITA for storming out when hanging out with my gf and friends because I felt the discussion was getting too personal and inappropriate? Hi all

To clarify, I am a male, aged 30. I was hanging out with my gf, and two friends of hers (both women). I am fully aware that being the lone male in the group, I have to be careful about what I do and say.

We were on a trip staying in the same hotel. My gf and I had our own room, and the two friends were staying in a separate room on the same floor. One night during this trip after we came back, we were having drinks and playing cards and talking about life and love and relationships. I'm not sure if it was because they were slightly inebriated (honestly barely drunk anything, I'd had way more than them and felt nothing), or if they act like this when I'm not around, but they were talking about this that I was VERY uncomfortable with. First they were talking about love and relationships then it became talking about sexual topics, and they were prying into my relationship with my girlfriend and asking VERY VERY VERY inappropriate, invasive and personal questions about our relationship and love life, and my girlfriend was going along with the conversation which I was very uneasy with. At one point, I said this is enough, this topic is highly inappropriate, why are we discussing this? I'm not okay with talking about this stuff with anyone except my girlfriend. I got angry and stormed out and took my girlfriend with me and we went back to our bedroom.

Next day the three of them said I was angry, controlling, overreacting, and completely ruined an otherwise fun night. All 3 of these women basically agreed that I was acting like  a jerk when I feel I did nothing wrong, I felt my own personal boundaries were being overstepped and disrespected.

"WIBTA for confronting my fiance on her lying My fiance comes from a very difficult childhood. She has told me from almost the beginning that she has had to lie about many things to her family since she can remember. She claims that I'm the only person she can truly be herself with. That she has never felt any need to lie to me and that its refreshing not having to lie when she's with me. How I'm the only person that she trusts. which i think is very unhealthy, she should be able to trust and be genuine with other people outside of me. I have never seen her actively lying until last night.

She introduced me to her uncle and his wife. From what she's told me he used to be a drug addict and a drunk but has been sober for about a year or so now. She seems to not care for him much and doesn't believe that he's going to stay sober either. But he seemed like a nice guy to me last night. The way the conversation went was shocking. Nearly every single thing that came out of her was a lie. Her uncle asked questions about the family and she would mix in lies with the truth. ""the greatest lie is the one mixed with truth"" some quote she said last night after we left.

Her dad is in jail right now for two years but she spoke about him doing things, like present tense when he's actually in prison. Her sister is in mexico for school but she was spoke about her still being with her parents. Her mother is going through some emotional issues due to her husband being in jail and she's entered a depression and is convinced she's schizophrenic or something idk but my fiance spoke about all of them like they were happy and living their best lives.

I know these things are very personal and I never expected her to be honest with it. But the way she lied so effortlessly. She never faltered, she looked like she herself believed it and if I didn't know the truth I honestly would have believed her too. it was very deceptive and she said it all with a polite smile on her face.

I'm very big on being honest. I like it when people are themselves and I've told her that she's an adult now so she doesn't have to keep up this appearance that she does.

We argued before we went to see them because she was stressing out over this conversation and I was telling her why bother when she wants to keep distance, when she doesn't even care about them in the first place?

It's a lot of lies. They think we just moved in together meanwhile we've been living together for the past year and a half. And now I have to keep track of it all. It just very new to me and I never liked lying and seeing her do it so effortlessly was like seeing a new side to her. a side she claims she hates about herself. But if I tell her to stop she claims that it's not as easy and I don't understand. She stresses out and keeps repeating I just don't understand. I want to confront her about it and want her to work on being more honest with people around her but i don't know how to go about it without coming off like an asshole and having her take it the wrong way.

"AITA for considering to not invite my parents or family to my potential future wedding or engagement plans?  AITA for considering not inviting my parents or family to my future wedding and neglecting to include them in any engagement plans?

I (20f) have dated many people that I never introduced to my family plainly because I didn't feel like they were the right people and I didn't want to throw my family into all that drama. Now, 1 have introduced my boyfriend of a year (21m) to them, and they have not supported him in the least. Every moment they get alone with me, they try saying ""we're not telling you to break up with him, but you should look at other options."" I'm pretty sure that l've made it abundantly clear that
""when you know, you know,"" and this was the person I intended to stay with. this was my choice, my fishy in the sea that I had caught and wasn't releasing so to speak.
Hearing about my parents and interacting with them has always lead to me and my of uneasy. I can't bring him around them anymore.

On top of this, my mother (55f) is always trying to get me to look at other prospects and seems to have no respect for my bf or me. She is always trying to convince me to reach out to one of my guy friends (also 21m) that she likes more than my bf.

Furthermore, I wouldn't allow them at the wedding seeing as they continue to disrespect him when he (my bf) is not around. Because of this, I'm not even sure which parts of my family I could invite. It doesn't matter. But I know when it if they found out, they would be pretty pissed and try to guilt trip me for robbing them of the opportunity to at least know what's going on in my life even though I fully feel that they have lost the privilege to know anything since they like to criticize everything.

"WIBTA for not allowing my Coworker asking to stay at my place two nights? 
So I’m a teacher and have a pro-d beginning of the year three day event. The event kind of sucks already and my coworker for whatever reason doesn’t have their place available until September, last year they stayed with my wife and I for one night. This was annoying and she was somewhat rude/judgemental. 

She asked me again way back in like the winter/spring if she could stay two nights and put me on the spot so I kinda said sure. She didn’t bring it up for 6 months and said she could also stay in her car outside my house. I was thinking of saying it would be ok to stay on my couch for one night, but would prefer if she asked our other coworker to stay the second night. I’m feeling guilty about this as I technically already said ok when put on the spot.

"AITA For this argument with my brother? I (20F) recently discovered that I might have ADHD, my twin brother (20M) has also been told by his lectures to get tested. We were talking about it today and I asked why he won't get tested and he gave me the same reasons I used to give why I wouldn't, the same reasons my mother ever got me tested that I never did bad in my grades. He said that he isn't struggling, and he just doesn't want it. I started telling him about my unmasking and that I didn't notice how much it actually effected me, and I wanted to tell him that he doesn't have to get tested, but he should make sure he knows why beyond ""I just don't want to.""

Before I could finish the story, he cut me off and said ""this isn't helping, stop telling me to get tested."" I tried telling him that's not what I was trying to tell him but he kept interrupting and telling me that I was. Then he hung up on me mid sentence. After I had cooled off a little i went and apologised. I shouldn't have persisted, I should have dropped it, it doesn't matter what I was saying it was a touchy topic for him and I shouldve respected that. I kept it short and sweet, and left after I was done.

One thing that left me uncomfortable about the situation was how he communicated his boundary to me. Instead of telling me he wasn't comfortable with the conversation and asking calmly to move on, he got angry with me and repeatedly told me I was doing something I wasn't. I might be reading into it too much, but it felt like he was trying to get me angry so he could end the conversation without being in the wrong. I wasn't gonna bring it up with him yet, it's a pattern I'm noticing with him but one I feel I should communicate in a less hostile environment then just after an argument. 

Anyways, about 15 minutes later he comes into my room and tells me that what I did was wrong and that he forgives me. That also made me feel uncomfortable, why tell me this now? Idk, it felt a little like gloating, it wasn't to set boundaries because I had already told him I would respect them, it felt like he wanted to make me feel worse about the situation, then act virtuous by forgiving me. I didn't know what to say, so I just said ""okay."" That pissed him off and we wound up in another argument. I wound up telling him why I was annoyed at him and it just kept escalating. I wish I hadn't, that was something that should've been said in a calmer and less aggressive environment. Looking back at it I think I shouldve just left. Gone for a walk or something.

It's a petty argument, but it grew into something so loud and destructive. I feel like I'm reading into things I shouldn't and I have just been a complete asshole, but at the same time I'm trying to work out toxic behaviours and be kinder to myself, and one of the ways to do that is to listen to your gut when it tells you you're uncomfortable. I normally ignore when I feel uncomfortable and it's put me in a few toxic situations, but now I'm concerned that acknowledging it has made me more toxic. So that's why I'm here. AITA?",0.93
"AITA for still being mad at my godfather for not showing up to my 18th birthday? I(18F) turned 18 about 8 months ago and I had planned a somewhat big birthday party with my mom. I had been close to my godfather(40ish M) and naturally I wanted him to be there.

My birthday is in December and I infromed my godfather already in October when and where I'd be planning to have my party. He said it was fine, yet I still decided to inform him again in Novemeber when I knew more and I gave him the time of the party and more details, such as to not wear anything too fancy and that I didn't want gifts, just for him to be there and have fun. To this he said that yes the date and time was fine and he'd take the day off from work.

I was happy knowing he'd be there and was exited to see him again, since it had been a while due to me living part time in another city due to school.

Come the day and I excitedly waited and waited until an hour before the party was supposed to start my mom(NOT me) got a message from my godfather that he couldn't make it because he was at work, wich he said that he'd take that day off, and if the party could be moved to another date where he could make it. My birthday had already been moved from my actual date to a later one when I'd be home, and to inform such a thing an hour before it was supposed to start, I was angry, sad and confused. To me, having my godfather there would've meant a lot, since I've literally known this man for 18 years and we used to be close.

Moving foward to June, I was out drinkking with my parents at a bar wich my godfather worked at(we were having a really late celebration for me succesfully getting trough my 1st year of school). During that time, my godfather paid for multiple of my drinks and it felt like he was just trying to half heartedly pay me back with drinks. I did enjoy the free drinks but it did leave a bad taste in my mouth.

Afterwards, my godfather and his wife took us back home and while in the car, I mentioned how I was still sad and angry at him, his wife instantly said that he needed to work and didn't get off that day untill 1pm. My father came to my defent saying it still didn't justify him telling that an hour before my party started and said it was supposed to start at 12pm(wich was set to that time so my other godfather could drive from another city there and get back home in same day) and he could've come couple hours later. After that the car felt very tense even when making light conversation.

After all this, I haven't talked with my godfather and when I saw his wife when she came to pick up some of my old clothes for her daughter, she seemed rather cold to me and didn't even say thank you when I gave them to her.

It's been bothering me for a while.

"AITA for excluding my autistic stepdaughter from my daughter’s birthday party? My (30F) daughter’s (8F) birthday is next week and we’re planning on having a party for her and inviting around 20 other kids. I also have a stepdaughter (7F) from my marriage to my husband (38M), and she desperately wants to come. However, the thing is, she has a history of not behaving at birthday parties. She acts younger than her age and doesn’t understand social cues. She’s been invited to three of her classmates birthday parties in the past. At one of those parties, she blew out the candles, and at the other two parties, she started crying when she wasn’t able to blow out the candles. Eventually people stopped inviting her to their parties, and she claims it makes her feel left out.

I decided it would be best if my stepdaughter didn’t come. She would either blow out the candles or have a tantrum, and either way she would ruin the day for my daughter. My husband is furious with me, saying I’m deliberately excluding her for being autistic. He says she already feels excluded from her classmates parties, but excluding her from her own stepsister’s party would be even more cruel. I told him it was my daughter’s special day, and I had to prioritise her feelings first.

"AITA for offending my mother by putting in an airpod?  This post isn’t super context dependent IMO, but anyways, I (early 20’s) live with my parents (late 40’s) while I go to college and work. I have a good relationship with them and I’m thankful they’re in my life. 

Today, I walked into the kitchen and had a short conversation with my mother. I asked her how she was feeling (she is sick), and told her I hope she feels better soon. She asked me about a friend, and I answered her question, and then the room just kinda went silent. 

She then told me that she made me lunch before work today. I told her that was really nice of her, especially since she is sick. I ended up thanking her three times I think. I got myself a plate and sat down to eat. She was doing dishes silently by herself. After about a minute of silence, I put in an AirPod to listen to an audiobook. I only put one in, in case she wanted to say something to me, so I could hear her. 

She pretty much instantly told me I was being rude. I asked her how, and she said it was rude to put in an AirPod while someone else was in the same room and you could be making conversation with them. I told her I disagreed, that we weren’t conversing at that moment anyways, if she wanted to talk to me I would’ve put down the headphone, and that I didn’t realize I needed permission to put on headphones while in the same room as someone else. 

She kept insisting I was rude and even escalated it to say that I was choosing to ignore her, and just overall taking it super personally. She seemed like she was on the verge of tears. I told her she was jumping to conclusions and being ridiculous, just because I wanted to listen to my book at that moment doesn’t mean I hate talking to her or anything like that. I talk to my mom every day. In that moment, the room had been silent, and I felt like listening to my book. 

She told me that my response was even more offensive that my original action and that I had offended her. I told her that if we had been in a conversation and I decided to cut it short to listen to my book, that would’ve been rude I agree, but we weren’t even talking.

I feel like I’m being the absurd one here, but tbh I just want to know if I’m in the wrong. We’ve been fighting all day, and I just want her to not come. Just for clarification, none of us have EVER met her. My brother (M28) doesn’t want her here either, and I feel like my mom and her friend are being selfish by insisting she sleeps on MY bed. And also, each of us have personal bathrooms, with a bathroom downstairs for everyone.

"AITA For telling my boyfriend to stop faking his plans and be honest at this point? My (22F) boyfriend (27M) and I have been together for over two years now. We’ve been living together almost a year. From the beginning, I was up front with my desire to date to marry. I am looking for something serious. And he said he was too. When I met him we were both still living at home. I moved out a few months into our relationship into my own apartment. Previous to that, I was 100% responsible for my own bills. His family supports all of his bills except rent and his car note. When I met him, we both seemed to work similar hours. He was working a stable job. He wants to be the one to propose. 

Now, his job has been slowly cutting his hours for the past few months and on average he is working 2-3 days a week. Sometimes his shifts will be only 3 hours. He says this is the first job where he has felt valued and appreciated.  And he is good at it, but a job needs to give you financial security rather than emotional security. He doesn’t want to work in customer service or a desk job even if it’s something stable to get his foot in the door. We currently split the rent half way and the utilities are included in the rent. With groceries, it’s half. Even though his food costs more than what I usually eat.

Months ago, he was asking me about my ring preferences. The shape, the size, the color. We have talked about weddings, he told me he has plans to propose and he’s “saving up for a ring” but I told him I don’t need an expensive ring.

We have talked about children, how we would raise them, and we even agreed to think about trying in a year once his job gets more stable and we can save.

We have been discussing this all for over a year now along with getting a bigger place when the lease is up. But almost a year has passed, and nothing has been planned or even attempted.

On days where he doesn’t work, he does Uber eats during dinner time which is when I get home from work. So I feel like I only see him as I’m getting ready to go to bed, and for a short moment when I get home from work.

I told him that I feel like things are going nowhere, and that I feel like we live two separate lives. He said “he doesn’t see it that way” and leaves me feeling like I’m imaging things for being unhappy. When I said I feel like things are going nowhere, he said that it feels like I have little faith in us. But Is it reasonable for me to expect some indication of a future? When there’s been so much talk?

He doesn’t see my issue when I bring anything up with his lack of ambition. he always gets offended about my “tone” of voice rather than what I say. Or what I’m saying. It’s so frustrating. I tell him it feels like I’m being lead on and he replies with “I hate when you say that. Because marrying you is what I want”

About a year ago, I started dating my boyfriend (21M). Things were going well, but two months into our relationship, he got fired, had no savings, and was burdened with several debts.

To help him out, I lent him money for at least seven months to cover his living expenses. I even managed to get him a job at my office after pleading with my manager.

I asked him why he was upset, and he angrily replied that it was because I was pressuring him to answer. Hearing this, I started crying. After a while, I explained that I really needed the money, and even if he couldn’t pay me back, I wouldn’t be angry, just like before. But this time, he was really angry and raised his voice.

I asked him, ""Isn’t it usually the person who’s owed money who gets angry?"" But he continued to raise his voice and said, ""I never said you couldn’t be angry. If you want to be angry, then go ahead!"" I just cried, apologized, and asked him to stop, but he wouldn’t. Finally, I got really hurt and said, with my voice raised, ""Fine, then give me my money; I’m angry now.""

"AITA- For attending a concert with my Ex to celebrate Father’s Day ?  To provide some context: My ex and are legally married but have been separated for over 2 years now. We have both moved on. My current partner and I have known each other for over a decade and things moved pretty quickly when we reconnected at the start of 2023. We started dating exclusively in Feb, made it official in May, moved in together by Nov. My ex has also moved on and now has a child resulting from his relationship. 

So ffwd to May 2024, Facebook randomly has a sponsored ad and I see that one of my ex’s favorite rappers will be in a nearby city the day before Father’s Day. The tickets were only $30 and I felt like it would be a perfect gift for him. Side bar: He’s an AMAZING FATHER and my gf will attest to that. At the time of the concert my ex is single, somewhat of a loner so he has a very small social circle. The artist is B list and I know he might have a hard time finding a plus 1. I also enjoy this artist and my ex is truly one of my best friends but I do know my gf is very insecure about the fact that we’re still legally married. So before purchasing 2 tickets I asked how she’d feel IF he asked me to go bc I’d only buy 1 ticket to eliminate that as a possibility. She says it’s fine (reluctantly). I lie to my ex and tell him I have plans the day of the concert so he knows I’m not an option. 

I bought the tickets end of April. May was very rough, my gf and I were having issues communicating and prioritizing our mental health which lead to her breaking up with me and spending multiple nights out with “friends” that she just met… when I say multiple nights out, she’d leave the house at 5pm and not return until 5am and even as late as 9am one morning. The time she stayed out until 9am it was revealed that she stayed night at a random man’s house that she barely knew. I was bothered by the situation, understandably but also accepting that she had dumped me and didn’t owe me anything. We were supposed to be working to fix things and her preference was to be out drinking and avoiding the issues at home. Now it’s June and it’s the day of the concert… I asked my ex who was going with him to the concert. He explained how everyone he invited bailed on him last min and he was attending alone. So I decided to join him. I let her know I was going to the concert and of course she was very upset about it but I went anyway. 


She feels disrespected that I even asked her to begin with. I feel like it could have all been avoided if she would have just told me to buy the 1 ticket. Sooooo am I the asshole ?

"AITA for choosing my bridesmaid dress My boyfriend's (Bob) brother (Peter) is getting married in a couple of months. Recently, Peter casually mentioned to me that his fiancé (Lana) would need my help. ""Kind of as a bridesmaid"". I was happy to help out and agreed immediately.



Later that night, I was talking to Bob's parents over the phone and Bob's mom asked me if I would be buying a dress beforehand or where the wedding will be held. I mentioned that I was planning to get a semi-formal dress for a friend’s wedding that I could also wear to Peter and Lana’s wedding. Then it hit me that since I would be the bridesmaid, maybe it would make sense for me to coordinate with the maid of honour in terms of colour. Bob's mom agreed that it would look better for the photos and told me to speak to Lana directly.



That night, I messaged Lana and she agreed about matching colours but they hadn't found a dress for the maid of honour yet. I told her I would wait for them to let me know the colour and if timing was tight, I’d buy my dress first. Later, Lana found a bridesmaid dress online and asked for my opinion. Tbh it was a bit tacky bc it had a huge bow on the front and puffy princess sleeves but in the listing online, the dress came with different necklines so I told her that I liked the dress and the colour but I might choose a different neckline. I saw a few options suggested below the listing and sent a couple to her



When I told Bob about the dress discussion, he mentioned it to Peter who immediately became extremely angry and said that ""we had gotten it all wrong"" and that the bridesmaid and maid of honour wear different dresses. Confused and wanting to avoid misunderstandings, I immediately messages Lana explaining my intention of wanting to coordinate colours so I don't stand out in the photos, explaining why I suddenly thought of getting a dress and explaining that I only sent the other options as a suggestion for her and her maid of honour to look at since they hadn't found a dress yet and not because I wanted to shop around for dresses. The next day, I received a single message back from Lana saying that Peter said that the bride should be the fanciest and second the maid of honour and last would be the bridesmaids...with no response to any of my other messages.



I felt wronged and accused of trying to steal the spotlight so I called her to clarify. She asked to see where I was planning on getting my dress from so I sent her the website of a local boutique that sold dresses specifically listed ""Wedding Guest dresses"" and she said the dresses were too inappropriate and revealing for her wedding. She also mentioned that her wedding dress is really plain so if I pick the ""fancy"" dress then she would have to pick something more eye catching for her maid of honour. In the end, I reassured her that if she is sure about having me as a bridesmaid, then I would happily wear whatever dress she prepares.",0.28
"AITA for calling out my friends for exclusively speaking in a language I don’t  I (20M) study at a university in Australia, I usually hang out with four friends who I share a lot of my classes with. They are all of Asian descent and one of them is an international student, I am the only white guy. Recently a lot of the time when hanging out as we do they will exclusively talk to each other in Cantonese which is a language I don’t speak which of course makes me feel quite excluded, I ask why and one of them says that it’s because our international student friend isn’t very good with English. In my mind I’d think that if you were to study academically in English you’d be fairly competent at conversing and therefore we would all be able to speak in a language we all understand.

This same friend who said that will then get furious if I speak to one of the other friends in Japanese because we both know that language because apparently it’s “rude”. 

Would I be the asshole to call them out for excluding me? Or am I just being over dramatic? I don’t have anything against them speaking Cantonese but I do feel excluded from anything especially when they want me to hang out and then 95% of the time converse in something I can reciprocate in.

"AITA for not offering to pay for my boyfriend's car repair costs, even though he drives us around often? Hi there, I (29F) currently live with my boyfriend (35M). We've lived together for \~2 years now, and we both have our own cars.

We can both drive, and when we do drive ourselves anywhere, we usually take our own respective cars. However, since we live together and hang out a lot, we usually end up having to drive to the same destinations together -- whether it be to get groceries, supplies, etc. He usually will drive us in those instances, because I don't like driving and he's OK with driving us. He will also offer to pick me up from places when I hang out without him. Occasionally I'll ask for a ride, but I always tell him I can drive myself or take an uber if he doesn't want to drive. I never drive his car without him, ever.

We split our living expenses 50/50. Boyfriend makes significantly less than I do, but he's never asked me to pay more than 50/50, even when I've offered. I think he is too prideful to take money from me. \*\*\* That being said though\*\*\*, I do send him half a tank's cost of gas everytime he fills and I'm with him (which is 90% the time). He, however, is struggling financially (CC debt, student loans). His car needs a \~$2.5K repair, and he is upset about it. AITA if I don't offer to help split the repair costs? It feels wrong because he drives us around a lot, but he also has never asked me to drive and is OK with driving. He is not asking me for help.

More financial background about us: He comes from a wealthy family. His parents help his sister (37F) with her expenses occasionally. He refuses to ask his parents or his family for any financial help, also I think due to being too prideful. I do not come from any money, and all money I have is everything that I've earned myself. Because I come from such a low-income background/family, I always feel like I have to save every penny I have, just in case I have to survive on my own and I have no job, etc.

TLDR; Boyfriend and I both drive and have our own cars but he drives us around a lot, without asking for anything in return and I sometimes pay gas $$ just because I feel like I should. AITA for not offering to help pay for his $2.5K car repair bill?

Thank you..!!

  
\*\*\* edit: Thank you to everyone for your responses! To provide more context, I'd like to add: I do pay more in groceries and do send him gas $$ when I'm with him and he's getting gas, which is 90% of the time!",0.58
"AITA for telling my husband he's becoming a jerk? My(33F) husband(35M) has slowly but surely been getting bolder and downright meaner about the ways he talks about my weight. When we got married 7 years ago I was 120 pounds roughly. I'm 185 now( and I'm 5'2).

Rather than talking to me loving or just loving me as I am, he's opted to start telling me I need to, in his words, put down the cookies and french fries.

When I've calmly told him how unhelpful that rhetoric is, he calls it a hard truth and asks me why I don't care that I'm pushing 200 pounds?

I tell him that his quote unquote hard truth is just him giving himself an excuse to be a jerk.

I've told him time and again when he's spoken to me rudely or gone even further, so far as to grab my butt, grab my belly, that he's becoming a jerk. He refutes it and tells me I need to accept reality of where my weight is going.

"AITA for potentially ruining the relationship of the friends I set up after I told my guy friend the truth that he wasn't his girlfriend's ""type"" back in the day?  I have my friend Sarah. We used to be roommates and though we don’t hang out that often anymore I would consider her to be a good friend. 

Sarah is now dating my guy friend Paul. At first I was super happy for them. Paul has always wanted a girlfriend and Sarah has been mistreated by a lot of guys in the past so it was a great fit. However, recently Paul has somehow gotten this idea that I didn’t set them up earlier because I wanted to keep him in the friend zone  and that I must have subconsciously have a crush on him. And Sarah instead of telling him the truth has kept quiet.

So I ended up facetiming Paul and told him that I did try to set Sarah up with him multiple times, but Sarah was into tall White guys… and Paul is 5’8 and Asian (FWIW Sarah is Asian too)

I think only recently after Sarah got out of a bad situation ship and her younger sister got engaged did she say she was going to give guys a shot she didn’t have chemistry with early on. I know its harsh to say but I didn’t like this rumor circling about me secretly being into Paul so I just told him word for word what Sarah told me.

Well, after I said that now Paul is second guessing his relationship with Sarah. He thinks she is now only with him because of his job. That she is settling for him, and then he even asked me how many dates did it take for her to hook up with other guys... ( I did not respond)",0.97
"AITA Foe asking my bf to distance himself from my friend 

I (18f) and my bf (20m) have been together 2 months, before that he and my best friend were in a situations hip nothing came of it and they stayed friends. I met him though her and wr hit it off. In the early stages of their so called situationship  they booked a holiday together, (they are both very impulsive). I reluctantly agreed that he should go since os was quite 3xpensive and he couldn't get his money back and we talked it over and he promised nothing would happen seeing as my friend also isn't interested in him (or so she says). They Slept in the same bed and everything and both say nothing happened, but I wouldn't be able to ever know. 

This friend of mine can be quite toxic and I wanted to distance myself a little from her and I told him SI and he agreed. Unfortunately this holiday brought them closer together and now he want to go on an another trip next summer with me and other friends (including her)  when I asked why we couldn't go with just the 2 of us, he ignored the question. He keeps sating that she's my best friend and I can't just ""drop her"" which I'm not going to do, I just want her to be less involved in my life seeing as she has hurt me one to many times before.

"AITAH For being weirded out So my fiancé (34f)and I (45m) are sitting in a tattoo parlor, she's getting some ink done. I got her a session certificate for her birthday awhile back. 

Noticed she had this middle ring on that I hadn't seen before  in the 2 years we've been together. Cool ring, I commented on it. She's laying on her stomach (getting her tricep tatted) and lazily comments back from her prone position on the chair  ""teenage love"".

 OK, cool. So we're both single parents. I get that we both have histories. I'm grateful my kids were born, but I fathered children with the WRONG woman. I reserve no fondness whatsoever for my romantic history before my fiancé.

She feels much the same way about her exes. Her children's father is an absent POS. We both have said many times that we are each other's soul mate and best friend. Like, life before each other is a vague memory nearly forgotten. Our relationship to this point has been nothing short of AMAZING this far. Not quite perfect, but still infinitely better than anything we've experienced before. Like we were wasting time with other people, had we known fate had us waiting on each other.

However, we did have a disagreement yesterday that has yet to be resolved fully. We're affectionate and overall good today. Kisses and hugs and smiles after an awesome tattoo.

But, I can't help but be slightly insulted by what appears to be a token from a ""teenage love"" memory. And from everything she's told me over the course of our relationship thus far, she only really dated one person in high school and eventually married the father of her children. 

I'm so confused right now. She doesn't hate him in any way nor wishes no ill will on him because she has such a great heart. But everything I've understood about their relationship is that not long in, he became abusive and controlling as an alcoholic. And was out all night drinking and showed up at the hospital drunk with a buddy just minutes before their 2nd child was born. She divorced him not long after that. And, he has been completely absent form their children's lives pretty much ever since.

So why wear a momento piece of jewelery from a past relationship that was full of regret and emotional pain, and rather matter-of-factly refer to it as ""teenage love""? 

I mean, even if she was fond of the early part of their relationship when it was good... I mean, I'd never do something like that. Be fond, ok. Women are different that way. I get it. But I'm not going to wear anything that an ex bought me just because of all the bad memories with the ex (I always get rid of stuff like that anyway because of said bad memories, but I would CERTAINLY not wear it in front of my soul mate for there to be a chance for her to possibly feel insulted by it.

AITAH for feeling weird about this? Is she trolling me to get a reaction because of our aforementioned unresolved tiff?

For the ladies ITT: how do I approach her with clarification on what she meant by it or even what it is? It is her birthday this weekend, and I definitely don't want to ruin my birthday plans for her by bringing this up TODAY, but I'm afraid this is going to gnaw on me. And if and when I do try to lovingly approach her about it in a non-attacking way, is she going to say I'm being petty?

Idk, I'm just an old-school hapless romantic at heart and this has me sideways a bit.",0.83
"AITA for not staying at a party I never wanted?  Before anything else, I want to apologize for mobile formatting and thank you to anyone who reads this.

I (19 M) am going to college (Large state polytech) in a week and a half with my sister (17 F). 
 I'm transferring from another college (Small 2 year tech school) and she's starting her first year there.

She and our mother (47 F) wanted to throw a party to celebrate that we were going away for college since they hadn't done it when I had gone to a local tech school for some reason. 

I am extremely anxious around crowds and have always had a dislike for large social gatherings (for example anything larger than 10 people) to the point that I used to regularly hide in small, inaccessible spots until said gathering was over. 

I also dislike attention or being the person a party is for as growing up being the center of attention was never a good thing and have learned to avoid this at all costs.  It got to a point that I have told friends I would prefer them not acknowledge my birthday at all instead of telling me happy birthday.  (This is something I am working on.)

My sister messed up when posting the invite on Facebook and had accidentally sent it to everyone in both her friends list as well as my mother's, ending up with 120+ people rsvp'ing for the party. 

It is an expensive party, as my mother insisted on preparing for the possibility of 120+ people actually showing up and I wasn't aware of the party until yesterday as I had been uninterested and I have memory issues that cause certain things to be forgotten easily. 

I came to help set up and realized that I didn't have to attend as most of the people there would most likely only be people my mother or sister knew (We were ""homeschooled""  and I never actually made friends aside from online ones) so I left an hour before the party actually began. 

As I left, my mother called me and told me that I was being rude for leaving before the party started and that people were coming to see me and hang out with me.  This made me remind her that I had no obligation to come since I'd never wanted a party and that she should know that since I'd never liked them.
 
She called me selfish and rude and then hung up. 

After I got home, I called my father (46 M) to explain and he told me ""You couldn't even be bothered to show up to your own party"" and hung up before I could explain.

Now I'm wondering if I'm an asshole for not staying at a party I never wanted in the first place ",0.14

I 23 Female had sex with my friends bother Male 31, not long after she married her fiancé. He made a move on me and tried to kiss me during a game of truth or dare. And I gave in, I’ve known my friend and her brother for at least 15 years and began to wonder what it would be like if I had slept with him. Now I’m beginning to realize that not every fantasy needs to become a reality. And wish I never did anything with him in the first place because it wasn’t worth all of the drama I’ve inserted myself into. So one of the friends who was in “besties” bridal party, I had confided in on what I should do. She told me initially what our friend doesnt know what hurt her. And decided to text me a few weeks days later that she gave me bad advice, so if I wasn’t planning on telling her, she was going to tell our friend herself .So I decided that day to tell my friend that I slept with her brother, and everything in between. Because I would rather her know the truth coming from me rather than other people who weren’t there for any of this. She wasn’t mad at me initially and when I left her place, everything was fine after we discussed what we needed to. Then she texted me the following day that she feel betrayed for what I had done, and needs to rethink our friendship. She went and told all our friends, and her parents. Didn’t expect this to be a public affair , and having her parents involved just seems juvenile. We talked things through one more time and she told me that her brother felt disrespected when I ended things because he felt that I used him. But I had told her we never planned on making a commitment to each other. And that I feel like I would’ve had to have done something gut wrenching for her to lose that much trust in me, especially since I spent two years planning her wedding. And now everybody wants to butt in and say something , not really sure where to take things from here. Right now I’m just staying away from the hookup culture because I feel that’s it’s ruining me, and I just want to take a major hiatus from my social life to get myself and my morals in check.

"AITA for buying a memecoin about a “cum sock” I need some perspective on a decision I made recently. I've been pretty financially stable for years, and I’ve always been careful with my savings. But a few weeks ago, I stumbled upon a meme cryptocurrency called $socky. The whole thing is a fun joke – it’s themed around a ""cum sock"" for comedic purposes. I’ve honestly never laughed so hard at the memes being made for it. 

Despite the absurdity, I found myself drawn to the idea of investing in it. The community around it was pretty lively, and I thought it might be fun to get involved. Long story short, I ended up putting almost all my life savings into this memecoin, hoping that it would be that next big meme, and obviously make some profit.

My family and friends are shocked and disappointed, and they’re worried that I’ve jeopardized my financial future. They think I’m being reckless and irresponsible. I’m starting to doubt if I made a huge mistake.

"AITAH for this response? Yesterday my bf (M21) asked if I(F21) was upset, and I responded with this:

“no i want alone time but idk how to communicate that bc i feel like i have to text you all the time or else it means somethings wrong or there's a problem. sometimes i just don't want to talk to anyone even you and it doesn't mean im upset i just want to be left alone”

Prior to that I had been texting him dryly. I’m an introvert and I like to be alone and not be bothered by anyone every so often, even him, but I don’t always know how to communicate that. Especially since in the past, he would get very upset at times about me not replying soon enough, and made false assumptions about me cheating on him many times, so I’m afraid to do anything. 

He hasn’t replied back and has left me on read for almost a day now, and I get that I said I wanted alone time, but it sort of bothers me that he had nothing to say back. Ik I need to work on my communication, I recently started therapy to help with that and other things, but I feel like I have some sort of trauma due to the way he has treated and reacted to me in the past and it’s hard to stand up for myself sometimes.

In that time he gave me several items of clothing as boyfriends tend to do. My best friend (18f) let’s call her Jess came over to my house and asked to borrow a pair of joggers. (I’m British) I didn’t have any since mine were in the wash so I let her borrow a pair of me now ex boyfriend’s. 

We recently got into an argument because she cancelled on me last second after my mam had rearranged my birthday in order for her to be able to come since she promised she would keep that Saturday off work. We talked about it to which I asked about the joggers. Baring in mind it has been a year since I had let her borrow them. I have asked multiple times for them back to which she replied ‘they are at *other friends name*’. I was told that Jess and this friend weren’t on speaking terms so asked for her information so that she didn’t have to text someone she was on bad terms with (I later find out that this isn’t true since that friend messages me). She told me she had lost them and that they weren’t at her friend’s house. So I asked for the money to replace the joggers. Keep in mind that these were never my joggers to begin with and she was the one who lost them and both me and my ex has been asking for them back, these joggers were a little over £40 since they were Nike. She kept saying that she wasn’t going to give me the money to replace them and kept blocking me on every platform I reached out to her on while we were mid way through a conversation.

"AITA for telling my sibling I will fine them for not cleaning up after themself? I (F18) am living with my family through college as my college is close by and due to scholarships, I am able to go to school for almost free. In my family, we have always had chores. My sibling (16) and I both have dishes 3 nights a week, they sweep the kitchen and I have to keep our bathroom clean, cleaning sinks, shower, toilet, mirror, floors and organizing. 

I am a generally tidy person and I always clean up after myself when using the bathroom. My sibling on the other hand is not. They leave clothes (sometimes with period blood) and towels in the bathroom floor, leave pad wrappers on the ground next to the toilet when there is a trash can NEXT TO THE TOILET, they have smeared blood on the floor and generally, they leave the bathroom in disarray. I would be let it go if it was once a month but they trash the bathroom every-time they use it. 

I just deep cleaned and reorganized our bathroom which took 2 days to do and I only finished today. After a few hours of finishing, I walk upstairs to see it covered in clothes, our sink covered in their hair products and MY TOWELS on the floor. This led to me going into my siblings room and i discovered they had been using my towel to dry off instead of grabbing their own. EW! 
This same sibling has also only showered twice in the last week even though we all did things such as fishing and hiking. EVEN MORE EW!!!!! 

Where I might be the asshole is telling my family I am instating a bathroom code of conduct, where breaking the rules lead to fines (of like $10). These rules are simple : flush, clean up your clothes and towels, return the bathroom to how you found it. My mom said i was nagging my sibling too much about keeping clean and it is my job to clean the bathroom, which ticked me off cus my sibling only has to sweep a room, taking max 10 minutes.

"AITA for insulting my family and refusing to be in the wedding? I need to give some background for any of this to make sense, so Im going to briefly explain how me and my siblings are all related (numbering our parents to make it less confusing):

Dad1 and Mom1 had 2 sons in the 80s, Jack (43) and Donny (40).

In the 90s, my parents (Mom2 and Dad2) has my sister Janice (30), and then later on had my brother Mark (25) and me (21). Around the time I was born, Donny had a daughter, Susan (21).

A few years later, my Mom and Donny's dad (Mom2 and Dad1) got together and had my half sister Emily (17). Donny's dad is significantly older than my mom. 

Sorry for the migraine. Anyway, in 2021 my siblings and I met Donny since he occasionally visited Emily as she was growing up, who we were close to as she is our half sister. We also met his daughter Susan. Since then we all had, I thought, a strictly familial relationship. (We never met Jack as he apparently lives in another country and doesnt keep in touch with anyone)

But earlier this year, Janice dropped the bombshell that her and Donny were engaged. I wish I was joking but apparently they have been dating discretely since after we met him and Susan. At the end of the day I figured we weren't blood related so I guess its none of my business. But oh I wish it ended there.

Yesterday, Janice invited me over to ""discuss something important"". When I got there, Donny, Mark, and Susan were also present. Janice sat me down and told me that Mark and Susan were fucking engaged. 

They wanted to tell me in person with everyone there because they were worried I wouldn't handle it well like how I initially didnt handle Janice and Donny's engagement well. No shit! After confirming that it wasnt a joke, I went off on them. I told Janice that it was sick she was letting her brother marry her step daughter, that it must be illegal or at least SHOULD be. I told her that as if its bad enough she wants to model our family tree after greek mythology, but then slim hades over here wants to marry his niece (for context, Janice is a massive greek mythology nerd and Mark has bleach blonde hair and dresses like a middle schooler who just discovered rap for the first time). 

Susan was crying at this point and said she wanted to ask me to be a bridesmaid, and maybe this is where I was an asshole but I told her like hell I would even show my face at either of their weddings and told her to think about how her future kids will feel when during those family tree assignments kids get in class they have to present a fucking wreath!

Janice called me a lot of words, kicked me  out, and susan was still crying.

"AITA for wanting my neighbor to move their parked car? 33yo female living on a residential street. New neighbors moved in across the street a few months ago. For the last almost 2 weeks, they have been parking one of their 5 vehicles in front of my house. All day and all night, only moving it 2 or 3 times for a short period of time. I am super annoyed about it because they’re parking in the only spot in front of our house, so if we have friends or family over they have to park further down the street. I want to ask the neighbor to move their car My husband says I am overreacting to the situation and thinks we shouldn’t say anything since we ourselves park in our garage or driveway. They’re not technically violating any state or city laws. But to me it’s highly inconsiderate and I want to ask them to move it.

So we booked a trip where we had to change planes to get there. Our first flight was delayed so making our connecting flight was going to be a close call. As soon as the we were allowed to get up we tried to just jump up and get as far up to the front as we could, so as to be off sooner and hopefully connect. A few rows ahead there’s a guy who plunked his bag in the middle of the isle and refuses to let us pass. We tried to explain that we had unusual circumstances etc etc but he refused to let us by.

"AITAH for telling my sister I dislike her bridesmaid dresses? My (F21) older sister (F23) is getting married next year. I’m incredibly happy for her, we’ve always been super close and she’s marrying her high school sweetheart who’s already like an older brother to me.  She’s run a lot of ideas by me for the wedding and since the beginning (about a year ago) the accent color and bridesmaid dresses were always sage green, which I absolutely loved. A couple days ago she told me that she had the idea to possibly switch just the bridesmaid dresses to be black, so that the sage green would pop more. In the first 15 seconds of me hearing this idea, I loved it. I dress very alternatively and about 95% of my wardrobe is black anyways, so I obviously love to wear that color. However, thinking about a bit more, I told her I wasn’t a huge fan of the idea, because my plan for my wedding since I was a little girl was to always do everything black and white. My wedding dress (which is going to be my old prom dress altered because it’s absolutely gorgeous) is black and I was going to have my bridesmaids in white. I obviously told her that it’s her wedding and she can ultimately choose whatever she wanted but I wasn’t thrilled with the idea of black being such an important aspect in her wedding. A couple days later, we’re wedding dress shopping for her and she tells me that she did decide on having her bridesmaids in black. I was a little annoyed but I never said anything to her. A little while later my wedding ideas came up and I shared how my bridesmaids were going to be in white and me in black. She asked if I was only doing that because she had switched her bridesmaids, which really got under my skin. I told her absolutely not and that this has been my plan for years. I still haven’t told her that I’m unhappy about that decision because I don’t want to seem like an AH, but now I feel like my entire wedding plans need to be changed so everyone else doesn’t think I’m just copying her ideas as well. Not to mention that my wedding dress is now going to match her bridesmaids. I also feel like she has literally any other color under the sun to choose from… and she chooses the one that is going to be the entire theme of my wedding (not to mention that black isn’t exactly a traditional wedding color). It frustrates me because I love her very much, but my whole life I feel like I’ve been stuck with her leftovers because she’s older and does everything first. AITAH for being upset about this? Again, I haven’t brought it back up since she initially told me it was just an idea because it’s her wedding and ultimately her decisions, but I really don’t want to be stuck with her leftover ideas. I have been thinking about this a lot and want other peoples opinions on if my feelings are valid or if it’s just a dress and I should get over it. I’ll probably never bring it up to her as It’s not something I’m super angry with her about or anything, it’s just another one of those things where I get her leftovers and I have to change my plans around,  and I’m frankly sick of it.

"AITA for calling a girl gross after she called smoking unattractive?  I [16m] smoke. It's pretty common among teenagers in my country, but not to the point it's ubiquitous, so essentially if you meet a teen, it's 50/50 on if they smoke. 

Personally I love smoking in essentially any form-- cigarettes, vape, cigars, cigarillos, hookah, whatever-- and do so everyday. I'm aware there are some people that find it unattractive, but girls I've dated or had flings with have either been smokers themselves or grudgingly accepted it. 

Anyhow, earlier I was just hanging out and smoking at my usual spot, and one of my friends shows up with this girl I've never seen before. She immediately makes a comment about how unattractive smoking is, so I replied that it's a good thing I'm not trying in the slightest to attract her.

She reiterated that she found it immensely gross and I should stop, and I told her I found her that since I find *her* immensely gross, I'm not trying to appear more attractive in her eyes. 

She got angry and told my friend to make me apologize. He thinks I should since he's trying to date her, but I think he can do better than somebody so rude and presumptuous. AITA? ",0.33
"AITA for telling my mom how I really feel? AITA for telling my mom that what she did was out of line? 

Throwaway account.

I am 29 years old female in college and I live with my mom and one of my sisters. Some cousins came to our country for a few weeks. Today my mom and I took these cousins out for the entire day. We had a nice time going to various places and created nice memories. 

However our last stop was at a mall and we went to the food court at the mall. My mom and the cousins went to sit at a table in the food court to make sure we got a table, while I went to grab a coffee further down in this food court. No one else wanted coffee at this time. When I returned to the table, my mom told me to take the cousins deeper in the food court and buy them any food that they wanted. I told them I wanted Chinese food for myself. My mom initially said she wanted Chinese food too but then she said not to get anything for her because she wasn’t entirely sure what food she wanted. So me obeying her instructions, I did not get her any food and instead got my own Chinese food and the cousins got their food that we paid for. 

Once I came back to the table where my mom was sitting, she said: “where’s my food?” And I said to her: “you told me to wait because you weren’t sure what food you wanted to get.” My mom was getting upset at me and giving me an attitude, that I did not bring her food. While I was trying to say this, she kept trying to brush me off like as if she didn’t want to hear what I was saying. All of this happened in front of the cousins, and I was so hurt and humiliated. Then my mom went to get her plate of food from the same Chinese place I got mine from. One of the cousins looked at me funny and said: “why didn’t you just get your mom food…is it because it’s too expensive? You really should have gotten her food.” But her tone was like I had done something wrong. I explained that my mom wasn’t sure what she wanted. 

When my mom came back she saw that I had a long face because I was feeling really triggered and I was trying to hold back my tears. Throughout the rest of the time in the mall my mom kept trying to talk to me about what happened and saying that I’m taking it too deep and that I’m ruining her night and that I always have to start something which I don’t. I kept telling her I didn’t want to talk right then and there but she kept insisting to talk. 

When we dropped the cousins off where they are staying my mom was yelling at me and swearing with the f word and I told her I didn’t want to hear anything. Later when we got home I started packing my things and told her I’m done and that I’ll be out of her house this week. She started screaming at me saying f you and how she never threw me out of her house etc and how she wants to sell her house. I am thinking to go to my dad’s house as they are divorced from each other, but he can be rude at times too. 

Am I being unreasonable, or would you guys would have felt the same way as me if this exact thing happened to you? Was I in the wrong to feel and react the way that I did? ",0.15
"AITA for wanting my boyfriend to get over the past just because i have?  I f18 have been dating my bf m20 for 5 months and he has decided to go through my phone multiple times because he feels like i cheated on him. i gave him my phone and let him look through all of my messages and he scrolled so far down, that he found messages from before i was dating him. in these he saw my group chat of friends talking about how me and pedro would be perfect for each other. for a backstory, when i was in high school, everyone shipped me and pedro together because we would hang out a lot in the friend group and had inside jokes. 

when my bf saw these messages, he kept asking me who pedro was so i showed him. after i showed him, he decided to look through me and pedro’s messages. i haven’t talked to pedro in months, except the most recent message which was “happy birthday [my name]🥳“ i responded with tysm! and that was it. my boyfriend said that because i texted him after we got together that i cheated on him, because pedro and i had always flirted in the messages that he saw. (wasn’t true btw.)> my birthday is may and we started dating in march. ^
 the thing is, he searches my phone so much, that this time, after he looked through my phone accusing me of cheating, i told him to give me his. everything was fine until i saw that he had texted a girl flirtatiously and even asked one for her number - in june. he made up an excuse saying that he was getting her number for his friend, but said he would never text other girls again in that manner because he realized how it looked and made me feel. so i believed him and i gave him a second chance.

> i gave him a second chance because i didnt tell him that i had a crush on pedro for a few days, but it went away once i became good friends with him. i thought that pedro looked good but i wasn’t attracted to him when i became familiar with his personality. i forgave him because i felt guilty for leaving that part out, but i felt that since it was before our relationship, i never tried to date pedro, and that he already accused me of cheating, it wouldn’t help to add that part in. i don’t bring up the fact that he was texting  another girl asking for her number ever, but he brings up the fact that i “cheated” on him because i texted pedro every chance he gets and calls me a cheater and a beautiful demon<<?. it makes me feel upset because i gave him a second chance after actually cheating, why is he calling me the cheater?

I decided that if it was going to be this much drama she wouldn't be invited. My brother called me and asked about why he can't bring his girlfriend. I explained it made me and my fiancée uncomfortable and I don't want any ex partners there. Understandably he got upset and went on about how he loves her and plans to propose to her in a year. I told him I'm happy for him but I don't want her at the wedding end of story. We argued back and forth and both and I admit. I said somethings I regret saying. I ended up uninviting him to the wedding and hung up. I have family members telling me I'm over reacting and need to get over myself. I know my brother won't go unless his girlfriend can go.

"AITA for not reacting properly to an angry customer? (Sorry for any issues.)

   I'm a cashier at a place that rhymes with Woes. This happened at Assisted checkout. I walked over to let my coworker go to lunch, a small female with anxiety. A customer was demanding her to stop what she was doing help her with her three items. I had walked over and heard this demand so I waved my coworker to continue what she was doing while I went to deal with the customer.

Customer- ""You help me.""

Me- (at first thinking maybe she wanted a quick hand holding though her first time) Yes, of course. OK. If you want to set those down and pick up the hand scanner-"" 

Customer- (much louder now. Getting the other customers attention) No! You do it! Your job! I not slave, you slave!""

   Now at this point my face had frozen up while staring at her. I have this habit when being yelled at by rude customers where I'll drop my smile and just stare at them blankly while they rant.

   I didn't say anything else to her. Scanned her items, discounted her plant. Then I went in standby mode where I would stand off to the side while watching the customers and the exit. 

  Once she was done she turned to me. 

Customer- was so hard? Young people today. Don't know how to work. Don't know their place. You should be fire.
Me- (with my best 'customer service smile') Have a nice day madam.

   She was about to say something else but I think she thought she had done a good enough job yelling at me and walked off.

   I shook myself off before checking on my coworker. (This all took place in less than three minutes) she was shaken but otherwise fine. She went on her lunch and I went to stand at my post while waiting for my shift to be over.

"AITA for not allowing dogs inside my house? I (48m) was raised on a ranch and we didn’t allow the dogs to get inside. It stuck with me, I like dogs, but I don’t let them inside. I have a 6yo GSD right now and I built a large kennel for her to sleep and eat in.

"AITA: Being An Alcoholic When My Family Wouldn't Support Me throwaway; 

i, 22f, have been struggling for years w my mental health. i have a horrible aunt, lets call her amy, and i have bipolar, as well as a drinking problem such as her. i'm not going to try to say that i'm a saint, because i'm not—alcoholism is alcoholism, and it's devastating. i will say, though, that i feel as though my family has pushed me into it a bit—and while i don't specifically mean my alcoholism, i beg that you hear me out. 

it started when my grandmother died of breast cancer back in 2013. i am the youngest of 3 girls, so i obviously only have selective memories of my grandmother compared to my sisters who grew up with her more—however, i was essentially depended on from the beginning take care of my mom and aunts because I was the youngest and 'didn't have enough memories with her'. it never really bothered me at first, but really made itself known in the fact of my own depression and anxiety—preventing me from being able to fully process my grief or loss because i was so indoctrinated into taking care of my other family members. 

this led me to be hospitalized, and punished, for my mental illness. i had a particularly difficult night once, during 6th grade, and my friend's mom was so concerned she reached out to the school. i was hospitalized due to it. i was also punished after i had gotten home from said hospitalization—grounded, without any kind of connection to friends or family, for a month. The psychologist that was recommended was sketch as fuck, so I never went back, but it only reinforced the idea in my parents' head that I was fine, and that that whole thing was something of a mystery novel or some shit. 

Only recently, as of 2022, did they realize the full extent of the situation—only a bit. They still didn't fully understand my mental illness, and I couldn't do anything about it. When my grandfather died was whenever I really started to develop my drinking problem. I'm the youngest of three girls—T, 31f, B, 27f, and me, 22f. I was never meant to be here—my dad got a vasectomy. But here I am. After every death in our family, I've been expected to be the one to help others—I have never, not once, been able to grieve. No, I know that's not an excuse to turn to alcoholism, and I'm trying to break out of it now, but how do I bring it up to them? I've tried several times, and they've basically just ignored me. Am I really just expected to be the punching bag because I'm the youngest? Or am I doing something right by fighting for my own emotions and grief? ",0.27
"AITA for not being present with my friend for 30 minutes while he was very drunk? So the other day I (18) was at a small ""party"" at one of my friends houses with 9-10 people. We were playing drinking games and having fun. After a couple hours, one of my friends asked if I wanted to have a smoke with him before he was leaving, and I said yes. After about 5-10 minutes, while we were about to head out, the friend in question (we'll call him Jeff) asked me to come over to the sofa where he was laying to talk to me. He told me he was drunk and that  he wanted me to help him get home. I assured him I would get him home, and told him that I was going out for a while since I planned to have a smoke with a few of the people that were leaving, and that I would come right up after a while. I told him I would be right downstairs (we were sitting on a bench right outside the apartment complex, takes two minutes to get up), and that if he needed me or anything to give me a call. Keep in mind that he was very safe where he was at, both of us know the host, and including the host there was my girlfriend and one more friend to watch over him if anything happened.

I was outside the apartment complex having a fun conversation with the people outside, but after 30-35 minutes or so we wrapped it up and they were leaving. I said my goodbyes, and went back up to the apartment. When I arrived, Jeff had thrown up in the bathroom floor and was not in the best state. I asked him what happened and if he was okay, and he told me he was fine and kind of shrugged it off. My girlfriend then told me he made her call his dad to come pick him up, and that he was on his way. At this time all of the other people had left, and there was only the host, Jeff, my girlfriend and I. We sat down at the sofa to watch TV while we waited for his dad. I asked him what happened, how he was feeling and so on. He had an annoyed tone and told me something along the words of ""so much for taking care of me..."". Keep in mind I was literally right downstairs and he never gave me a call or anything. 

After a while his dad arrived, and he asked me to accompany him. When we arrived at the street I said hello to his dad, and he wasn't very nice. He had a very passive aggressive and confrontational tone, and was essentially mad at me for not taking care of his son, and looked down on me for essentially having a fun time while his son didn't. I have met his dad before and had absolutely no problems with him. I went back up to the apartment to help the host clean up a bit after the party, and eventually went home with my girlfriend. 

The people I've talked to about this have said that it was very irrational of him and especially his dad, because I was right downstairs and he never gave me a call and I didn't leave him in an unsafe space at all. No one told me to come up, and I had no idea what was going on upstairs while I was outside. But regardless I want an unbiased opinion, and I really want to know if I was in the wrong in this, I'm not making this post to get validation from anyone, I'm genuinely wondering. AITA?

"AITA for asking my landlord for remote access to the thermostat and doorbell camera?  I (21F) and my roommate (21F) both moved into our townhouse 2 months ago because we just got our first big girl jobs. I found this townhouse to live in because my aunt (who I’m really close with) has been best friends with the owner (20+ years) and the owner’s daughter is already living there for college. They agreed for me and my roommate to rent there because there were two more bedrooms on the property. Me and my roommate really appreciated that there was also a 1 car garage that the landlord told us wasn’t occupied since both of us drive to work. We signed the lease and I THOUGHT everything was fine. 

A couple weeks after I moved in - there was some issues with access to the garage because apparently the owner was under the impression that the garage wasn’t part of our lease and needed to park her car there permanently. We eventually worked it out that there would be a garage schedule once everyone moved in. 

Fast forward to 2 weeks ago. After I was granted access to the house’s Google nest camera and thermostat, it was suddenly revoked, days later. I texted the landlord about the issue 5 times. My roommate and my mom who my landlord has been talking with did the same. He refused to respond to us until we got an email 3 days ago saying that although the lease stated that “the nest camera and nest thermostat would be provided” we would not be provided remote access to the thermostat or any access to the nest camera. This is a huge issue for me because my bedroom is the only one on the 3rd floor so I was hoping to get alerts for if someone was attempting a break-in. The reasons that the landlord stated in the email was because since they are paying for electricity they need to monitor that the HVAC system wouldn’t cause huge spikes in electricity bills for them and that it could be a possible security concern for us to have access to the nest footage. However, he also stated that since the owners daughter was also an owner of the property - she would be the only one who had remote access to the thermostat and access to the nest camera. This doesn’t really help my situation because her bedroom is on the third floor and she doesn’t live here 50% of the time. 

It’s also a privacy concern because I’m pretty sure the owner’s husband also has access to the live feed so he can keep track of her movements (which I noticed on the brief time that I was given access). I don’t want some dude I’ve never met to have access to a live feed of who comes and goes from the property I pay rent on. They’re putting their foot down but I’m seriously considering turning off the camera because I have no idea who’s watching the life feed. What do I do and am I the asshole?",0.03

I pointed out that i'd brought my niece books and visited her but no I didn't medically check her as she's not a baby and my sister is definitely not a concerned new parent. My sister being the understanding and patient woman that she is /s told me that it was the principle of the matter and it showed that I didn't care for my niece. I told her to stop being a child and if nothing else this showed how much I do care for  my niece, I then told my sister she is acting like a bigger baby than our cousins son and she needed to get a life.

I feel bad for snapping like this but I hate how she questioned if I care for my niece, because I adore that girl, the two situations to my mind are very different but perhaps I should have been more patient all the same.",0.23
"AITA for telling a 'well-meaning' rich coworker she's a snob after criticising my parenting? I'm a 23 year old guy working as a project coordinator, its not the Ritz, but it pays the bills and keeps me out of trouble. Things at home aren't a walk in the park as I have to help out a fair  bit with my nephew, Gene (2M). My younger brother, Lennon (18M) is his father and he's more of a part time dad, he spends half the time trying to get modelling gigs.

We both had a rough start, living on a council estate with a da too busy sinking pints and our mam working all the hours under the sun to pay the rent after he did a runner when Lennon was 10. I've been his father figure since we were kids ourselves. Lennon's struggled with everything he had going on, he can be manic at times, and with Gene's birth everything went a bit haywire. He tries, bless him, but he can't manage by himself, that's where I come in to pick up the slack to make sure Gene has a proper chance.

Then there's Susan (46F). She's one of those middle-class southerners who's never had to worry about the price of a pint of milk, let alone rent. Her biggest worry is whether the au pair's taken the dog for a walk. She's in HR, she's the sort who'll give you a smile that doesn't quite reach her eyes, you know?

The other day I was talking to one of the lads about how Lennon's had to travel down south to get some photos done for his portfolio, and how I've practically become Gene's full-time dad. Susan's sitting nearby, and she decides to pipe up. She goes, ""Darling, don't you think you're
doing Lennon a disservice by stepping in all the time? He needs to take responsibility for his own actions, and you're just enabling him by always being there to pick up the slack.""

I tried to ignore it, but she just wouldn't stop. ""You know,,"" she says, ""sometimes people need to hit rock bottom before they learn. You're preventing him from growing up."" Then she hits me with the classic line: ""This is what happens when kids have kids. It's not your job to clean up his mess.""

I'm not about to let Gene suffer just because Susan thinks Lennon needs a ""wake-up call."" I'm doing what I can because Gene deserves better, and Lennon's got enough on his plate without Susan's condescending advice, but I do see that maybe she's trying to be helpful?

I told her straight, ""Maybe you should keep your snobby advice to yourself. You haven't a clue what it's like up here. I'm not letting Gene suffer just because you think Lennon needs some sort of 'tough love."" She looked stunned and muttered about ""making your own bed"" before huffing off.

A few of the lads reckon I might've gone too far, but I reckon she needed to hear it. Maybe her advice works in her posh little world, but not here. We don't have the luxury of letting people ""learn their lesson"" when there's a kid involved. But now I'm wondering-did I overstep? Should I have let her carry on, or was I right to tell her where to shove it?",0.14
"AITA for my family ignores when good things happen for me thinking it’s petty? I 44F took our annual family vacation with my husband and kids. We went to Disney World and saved for two years to go because I got a raise. I posted pictures on social media after we got back and said we went for our 20th wedding anniversary. A couple of my friends liked the photos which is great. 

However, my mother has 5 sisters and anytime in life my family including my parents, my 4 brothers and sister, or myself has had something good happen for us whether it be vacations, college graduations, or just something good, we are basically ignored and nobody congrats us or says they are happy for us. 

However, recently two of my female cousins on the same side of the family went on vacation in the last few months and their social media vacation posts were flooded with nice comments. This has happened my whole life and it's kind of annoying. 

My dad and mom are very successful and had their own business and they have given money to these people and given them jobs. My brothers, sister, and I have really good careers and all went to College. I'm not being petty I swear but I've had cousins copy my actual college degree, my career path, work at the same place as me so I quit and went somewhere else, and even copy photographers or outfits I've done with my kids. I'm a teacher and four female family members went to school for teaching snd started the same year as me. I've had one aunt post lies in our local paper her daughter got a bachelors that didn't exist at the sghool because I did a college degree in it. 

Anyways, my parents are overly generous. They supplied co signatures for mortgages, given thousands in wedding money, offered jobs through friends or their businesses, bought cars as thank you gifts once my aunts retired for working for them for the aunts, threw the big family reunions every time and paid for everything for grandparents anniversaries, holidays etc, and my mom always gives gifts to every sister every holiday, all their kids, and their grandkids. 

Anyways, am I the asshole for thinking my moms family is petty they aren't happy for my family when we had good things happen? 

Also, everyone cousins kid plays hockey. Everyone copies  each other. I could keep going but this would be so long. ",0.12
"AITA for considering myself a high school dropout? I (35m) stopped going to high school when I was 20. I just simply had enough of the system at the time that I just cut my losses and moved on. It hasn't stopped me from having stable jobs, even if none were high paying. I always considered myself a drop out as I didn't go for the last week or so of school, nor the final exams.

Recently I was added to the group of graduates from the school I went to, and I stated that I was simply a drop out. The school never sent me a diploma, called for me to get one, and refused to honor one when I called. The school at the time stated that even if I had all the last classes needed, I was missing a few on the way (I had history 11th, not 10th for one, I know I had English 12th but not 9th for some). I was simply a delinquent that liked playing video games until 1 a.m. and waking up at 4 a.m. to watch anime over reading and homework.

People on there simply gave reasonings as to why I dropped out, some were true, some not (and I let them know if stories were accurate or not), but that I was part of the classes, so a piece of paper wouldn't make a difference. I do agree with them, and I don't really care about being in the group (there's like 2 posts a year), only that I was a dropout, so I shouldn't be considered a graduate.

I got a ""diploma"" from the government, it's only not endorsed by the school. I know they were doing a 15 year reunion since they didn't do a 10 (from posts and comments it seems to be venue issues) and it was the only reason I was even added. They just simply stated it was a dick move holding a piece of paper over their head as well as the schools, while I said that I wasn't holding it above their heads, only the school's.

So aita for considering myself a high school drop out rather than playing along?",0.41
"AITA for not cleaning up after my parents' dog when no one cleans up after my cat? so a little bit of context here: I (25F) live with my parents and younger sister (20F). we have 2 pets: a cat, who is mine, and a dog, that belongs to my parents and my sister. usually i take care of my cat and they take care of their dog, though i do help out with it when it's not too much of a hassle (cleaning the occasional poop, walking her if everyone else is busy, etc.). my sister's supposed to help out with the cat too, tho getting her to help is usually like pulling teeth, so i usually take care of it by myself, which is fine. she used to have issues with peeing on furniture, which i would always be then one to clean up and deal with, but that hasnt happened in a long time.

yesterday, i got home to find my family was out, and that the dog had taken a huge diarrhea dump in the living room. chunky peanut butter kind of diarrhea. i usually clean up if i find her poop around, but this was a bit beyond me, so i sent a message on the family group chat to let them know what happened. she seemed to be up and fine tho, so i wasnt very concerned. my parents however, were kind of pissed when they came back home to find the dump in the living room. they said i should have cleaned it up since i was the only one at home when i found it. i argued that i dont expect anyone to help when my cat messes up stuff, and that they used to leave peed-on furniture for me to clean up after getting home from work when that happened. 

in the end me and my mom did a joint effort to clean it up, but i still think i was right and they still think they were right. so i leave it to you reddit, should i have cleaned it up from my start? am i the asshole here?",0.89
"AITA for asking my bf to pay my bills? I (25f) has been together with my partner (25m) for 5 years, living together for 4 years. 

TLDR; my rich bf of 5 years wants to keep the 50/50 finances while I don’t.

We only had a platonic acquaintance at first, because I met him when I was still together with my ex (31f). My ex and I had just moved to another country together and I broke up soon after, because of her DV that worsened after we moved away from friends and family. 

Some time after the breakup, I reached out to him and soon we became romantic after hanging out as friends. There were many green flags, like I connected well to both his male and female friends, as well as his family. He his known for his empathy, humility and kindness which are the qualities that attracted me ultimately to him. 

BUT something I did not realise as an immigrant when we met is that he comes from a rich family. As in the literal 1% living in the most expensive neighbourhood in one of the richest countries on earth. I am very open about my socialist views and he found them interesting. He has slowly introduced me to his wealth, which I still have not seen the full scope of. His family is very secret about it, and I don’t want to pry. 

I have since the start of our relationship asked for 50/50 split, including paying rent, electricity, wifi, food-subscription, gas and so on. He has loaned me money in instances of economic turmoil, like when I lost my job from Corona or when I got scammed out of a scholarship. I am always insisting on paying back, even when he says I don’t have to. 

He has not looked for jobs since he finished a masters in economics two months ago, and to be honest, I think it will be hard for him to fit in a corporate environment being the sensitive professor type. I do not mind him not working if he does the majority of housework. I graduated last year and was at one point balancing two jobs, paying back around a 1000 usd in student loans each month. My income is in the lowest 5% and minimum wage, because I took a bachelor in acting (bad decision). 

I want to apply to law school next year, because I have the passion and the grades for a full scholarship. So I asked him if he would be willing to cover our shared expenses comparable to the percentages of our incomes. My scholarship would be 880 usd a month compared to his 3000 usd he gets in passive income each month (family). I would be paying 30% of our expenses, but it would be lower if he got a salary on top of the passive income. 

We see marriage and kids 10 years into the future, and he agrees that the plan I am offering fits there, just not now. But I am tired. I am tired of cooking while he orders. I am tired of taking public to work saturday morning, while he took a taxi home from the club. I am tired of having a messy home from working all day, while he doesn’t have a job and can afford help.

"AITA: Dying Aunt and bills My Wife’s great aunt recently had to have emergency surgery. Unfortunately, when she got out of surgery, she had to be on a ventilator. At the same time she developed an infection. She ended up not being able to get off the ventilator and has decided to no longer fight. She is 89 years old. And has decided to start hospice 

Now she lives in another state and my wife is going to fly out to see her. Which isn’t an issue. I want her to see her aunt. It so happens that incident and everything took place on a Friday.  Day my wife is off, and a weekend in which my wife is off.

Instead of flying out on Friday and being with her family. She decided that she would take a day off Monday and leave me with the kids. She will unpaid for that day. We also do not have a sitter for the days she’ll be gone. So it would force us to use our back up sitter. Which is very expensive.

Now if this was during the week and it was something that needed to be done. I’d go without to make it work. I’d fight to make it work. But that didn’t happen. It was on a weekend where we could have made it work without putting even greater financial strain on our resources.

"AITAH for telling my mom to fuck off My mom and I (f23) have always had a rocky relationship. I'm currently living with my mom, uncle, grandma, and sister. We don't have much space and that usually a source of our fights. In addition my mom, sister and I (myself to a lesser extent) are victims of narcissistic abuse from my uncle and Grandma.

My mom's car stopped working and so if we need anything to help care for my grandma or basically anything we need outside of the house I have to ask my uncle for a ride. He's been an asshole for years now but will be nice enough to give us rides some times. 

Here's where the fight with my mom started. I needed a ride so we can get food and stuff for the house and my Grandma, my mom told me not to forget that he was just an asshole to me and not to be too nice. I have a history of forgiving ppl before I should and have a lot of issues with codependency.  

I told my mom that I was going and I told her that I needed to get stuff because I don't drive (not by choice, read about MN driver's tests) and this was the only way we can get everything we need for the weekend.

My sister(f22) has a fanny pack with a cord that was hanging down her butt, it looked bad but on top of that it also is something that I know my uncle will have a problem with. He has OCD and is a control freak on top of that. So I tell my sister it's a good idea to either tuck the string in or to use another bag because he's literally tried cutting cords on backpacks and purses if they drag on the floor, by a tire, or on the ground. She runs to my mom and tells her that I'm controlling her and I say that I'm trying to make sure we get everything we need done because her car won't work and we need a bunch of stuff. 

She tells me that my keeping the peace is teaching him that he can abuse me and teaching me to accept patterns of abuse. I said mom we need to get stuff and I don't have another choice and she told me that someone was going to beat me because I'm not willing to confront him so I can get my stuff done..

I acted out and told her fuck off and don't put that shit because it really hurt to hear that from my mom and she said she's done with me for the day. I started crying and begging her to forgive me for swearing at her and I was only acting out because I was hurt by what she said.

She said it came out too easy and I must really have meant it and thought that I meant it. I would have had the same thing to anyone who said I was going to be beat by someone and tried telling her that. 

Am I the asshole for swearing at my mom in this situation?

"AITA for avoiding my SIL? 
I've been together with my husband for 8 years. He has a brother with 2 kids. My SIL never liked me. We are 2 complete different persons. But there's a difference between not liking someone and just being disrespectful.

She ignores me at family dinners. Sometimes it's even hard for her to say hello. 

She never asks how i'm doing. She is complety uninterested.

I sent her a message a few years ago saying that our relationship was worrying me and that I would like to talk to her about it.  Especially out of respect for our husbands, who are close brothers. She never replied to this.

When my mother died, I sat in a bar with a friend to cheer me up. Coincidentally we met my sister-in-law.  She just said a quick hello, obviously because she felt obligated. No expression of support. Nothing.  
As if nothing had happened.  
My mother had been dead for barely a week.

Yesterday i completly snapped.
She refused to discuss a birthday gift for our mother-in-law.  Even though our mother-in-law paid for an entire one-week holiday for us to celebrate her birthday. 'She's not my mother, I don't have to deal with this.', she said.

I told my PIL and they understand completly. My MIL even said that she is trying to deal with it too and it is very difficult. Of course, she mainly thinks about her grandchildren.

My husband cried when I told him I am  done with her.. But of course he knows how difficult it has been so far.

Right now I can't even be in the same room with her.

"AITA for making my partner pay 50% of monthly mortgage rate even though they earn less than me? Me (34) and my partner (39) bought a house together and they had a lot more savings than me, but I have a higher monthly income. We agreed that they would cover most of the initial deposit (80%) and I would then pay a higher percentage of the monthly mortgage. We split this up in a way that after paying the mortgage, we have the same amount leftover, but because I earn more, I pay $1100 and they pay $700. After 3 years, I have paid off his part of the deposit so that we have equal equity in the house. This was important to me as by law we own the house 50% regardless of who paid how much, so if we split up and sold it, we'd get 50% of the value each. That's why I thought it was fair that I pay my part.


Now that I paid that off (actually after 3 months of that happening, because my partner was in between jobs, so I didn't want to bring it up at a financially fragile time, but now they have a new job), I brought up that maybe it's time to pay the mortgage rate 50-50 since now we have equal equity. T


They became upset and said that it's not fair because that way I will have more leftover after paying the rate (because I earn more).



To which I said (and this is probably where I might have been the asshole) ""well if you want me to subsidise your income, we can talk about it, but I'd rather do it via a joint account to which we pay a certain amount of money depending on how much we earn, but keep the mortgage payments 50-50 so that we always have equal equity in the house and the situation is clear and easy to figure out if we ever need to split it"".


They became very upset then, and got offended at my usage of the word ""subsidize"" and left the room and now won't talk to me.



The thing is, I know I earn more, but I don't think that means that I need to give them money from my income so that we have the same. I had previously wanted to get married and have a joint account but they didn't like it because I am a bigger spender. Which is true, but I often buy stuff for the house which they end up using despite me paying for them. So I find myself in a situation of earning more and yet having way less savings because my money goes to my partner's savings account while I spend on everyday stuff and house stuff. 


Also, we have the same education in tech/science but I gave up on my dreams of being in academia and I work in the industry, and I've been very lucky to have found an amazing job that I don't hate but earns me a lot of income. They stayed in academia, which was also their dream, but their income is much smaller.

Invest for her y'all only teacher her short term."" To which I laugh because she doesn't know what we do or how we spend.

And i responded with ""excuse me? How would you know?"" We live 10 hours away from each other and when we go to vacation we don't spend too much time with them because we do kid friendly activities and they don't have children so we tend to hang out with cousins and family with kids in the same age group. Me and her fiancé have a good relationship we understand each other very well and I think ge noticed my tone because he changed the convo and took it back to humor. 
So I left the room and let them finish the conversation, the next day I was still angry and told my husband to talk to his sister or I would. 
He said I was over reacting and that he would talk to her and I pointed out that she needs to mind her place. For one she doesn't spend any quality time with Stacy (our daughter) to know if she's well behaved or not. 2 she assumes she knows best when she doesn't have children 3. She laughed when you said we're working on giving her chores, as if she knows what goes on in our house. FYI Stacy has responsibilities that to some consider chores ie feeding her pets, cleaning her room and bathroom and her laundry etc 

My husband didn't talk to his sister so I called her and told her she is wrong in her assumptions and we don't need to tell her anything that goes on.

"AITA? fight with girlfriend about getting a dog All names are fake and on a throwaway

My gf Jessica (f22) and I (m25) just moved in together and we've been looking at getting a dog. I don't want any toy dogs but she loves every kinds of dog so I thought choosing one together would be easy but so far it hasn't. We actually got into a fight about it.

There's one friend she has, named Ruth (f22) who also has a dog and Jessica loves it. Jessica and Ruth met while volunteering at the SPCA in their freshman year. Ruth now works part time at that SPCA. She wanted something similar to Ruth's but I didn't. She's been showing me pictures of dogs that just aren't working for me plus I want to get a puppy but she wants a grown dog although to be fair she wants to get one that's less than 3 years old. And she wants to try fostering first before considering adoption to test out how the dog is with us but I told her it's best to start out young. I thought I convinced her but I didn't like any of the pictures of the puppies she shown me. One was a toy breed. So we're back to square one.

Our fight was basically like this

me-are you sure you want that?

gf-yes that's why i'm showing it to you. what's wrong with this one?

me-why can't we just get a new puppy

gf-i did you didn't want any of the ones they had

"AITA or just pathetic  
Sorry this is going to be kinda long and I’m on mobile. I 24f am currently caring and living with my grandma who was recently diagnosed with alzheimer's. My parents and sister live nearby but don’t help a whole lot because my parents are usually busy with work. So I’m under a lot of stress helping my grandma. 

Every now and then and then I babysit, My sister started babysitting for them when I first moved away from home for college and now that I’m back she’s still the first one they contact to babysit so if I’m babysitting for them it’s because she’s already said she couldn’t. 

I’ve got the classic oldest daughter syndrome in case it wasn’t obvious before, so when my family asks for help I’m always there, even at the cost of my own mental health. I’ve picked up a lot of work for my sister and I think she’s only filled in for me twice. 

I was scheduled to babysit today but it had been a rough week mentally and somehow I strained my neck a couple days prior. I also got a wicked sunburn the day. I then called my sister to ask if she could fill in for me this time instead because I was tired and in pain. I knew she had gone to the beach earlier but had nothing going on during the time I needed her to fill in for. 

When I first called she didn’t pick up so I tried my mom to see if she was still at the beach. Thankfully my mom said that my sister hadn’t checked her phone yet so she just handed my sister her phone that I was on instead. I asked for help and instantly got shot down because my sister needed to do laundry. The job would only have taken a couple hours. I also told her in return I could do her laundry instead. She instantly refused and said she just wanted to eat. I asked her to name anything that I could do for her in return and she said no. 

Upon hearing this conversation my parents who were near the phone apparently decided to jump in. My mom asked why I couldn’t and when hearing my reasons she pretty much implied that I was weak and pathetic without saying those exact words and that if she was in my place she just would have pushed past the pain and just felt with it. After hearing those words my sister was adamant she didn’t want to babysit and started actually calling me weak. 

I don’t really ask for much from them and it had been a long and stressful week so my emotions were a bit overwhelmed already. I ended up proving them right because as soon as they said that I burst into tears. I then doubled down asking my sister for help because now I was so emotionally overloaded. My crying only made it worse as my mom hates when I cry and after trying to convince my sister my mom got mad and said I had ruined the family’s entire day. 

I had no dignity or pride left anymore so I just kept crying and asking for my sister’s help. My parents were so frustrated and ended up convincing her finally because they just want the whole thing to end. So now my parents and sister are really mad at me. Am I the AH?

She would joke to our class about an autistic kid on the playground and would even mock the way he runs and flaps his arms. I struggled in math throughout elementary school, and had an IEP for it, and this teacher would constantly in a condescending tone tell me my methods were wrong in front of the whole class. She would favor the A-students in the class & would brag about them to everyone else while announcing that they get the 'special privilege' of sitting in the back. I asked her when I could have a back seat and she angrily under her breath shouted ""no! you will NEVER get one."" I was mortified. One day she told our class we were going to have mandatory 'binder checks' to make sure ours were organized. I went to place mine on her desk and she angrily asked ""why are you giving me this?! Go sit back down & do your work."" She then had the audacity to call my mom into an 'emergency meeting' with the school psychologist and guidance counselor because she thought I was 'disturbed' and that there was something wrong with me mental health wise (all because I mentioned I don't get along with my stepdad at home, but that's a story for a different time...). She yelled at my mom that she needs to ""do something now! "", which put her in a panic and sent her late to work upset & crying. My mom revealed to me when I was older that she hated her, too.

So I took to my keyboard and wrote the absolute truth about her; it was time I set things straight. I wrote all the above about how she bullied me & other students with special needs, especially how she picked favorites in her classroom. It was a real long post, and some commenters (who clearly never had her as a teacher) had the audacity to respond that my comment was ""unnecessary."" One of my colleagues who I'm connected with on LinkedIn stopped me a few days later and said they read my comment. they suggested I not do that again because even though they do not follow my districts page, they \*still\* saw what I wrote and that I could have publicly humiliated this teacher on an international platform.

My best friends daughter is 16 months older than my daughter and there’s a huge difference in how we parent. I try not to be judgmental, but when it starts to affect MY kid, I can’t help it.  
For example, My daughter is 14 months old and has little to no screentime. Occasionally she’ll watch an episode of something low-stim but that just started about 2 months ago. My Bffs daughter however, has had an ipad in her face playing coco melon & mickey mouse since she was 4 months old (I wish I was kidding). But, whatever, that’s her parenting choice. My issue is, why does she need it while she’s supposed to be having a playdate with my daughter? Or why does she need it while we’re at the park? or in a store? or at a restaurant? or at the aquarium?? 

The other day we were at a restaurant and the babies were next to each other in high chairs. My bffs daughter had a phone playing a show loudly and naturally my daughter was intrigued. but my bffs daughter got angry when my daughter started grabbing at the phone and she hit my baby right in the face. I took the phone away and said “well we don’t need this right now anyway” and my bffs daughter started having a FIT. Her solution to that was to give her the phone right back, and she also didn’t correct her behavior at all after she slapped my baby in the face. 

I let it go and a few days later (yesterday) we were playing at her house. My daughter was playing with a toy while my bffs daughter was watching a show on her ipad. Suddenly she walks over to my daughter and yanks the toy from her and pushes her down and my daughter hits her head. My bff did absolutely nothing but say “i guess she wanted her toy” no correction of behavior. No teaching her to apologize. I did call her out for this and she said “She’s just a baby she doesn’t know any better” to which i replied “and who do you think is supposed to teach her better” and then she just ignored me so I grabbed my daughter and our stuff and said “I’m leaving because I can’t deal with the lazy parenting anymore” and I left. 

There has been many other similar situations to these two that always end with my daughter getting hurt and i’m just not feeling the play dates anymore. Even though my daughter is only 1, I always correct her behavior when she does  something unsafe, esp to another child. So, AITA? ",0.06
"AITA for flaking out of my friend's first solo art show last minute even though I was supposed to be her event photographer? An old friend recently got into art and had her first solo art show a few days ago. I recently got into photography and social media, so I volunteered to be the designated photographer for the night. 

Now, for 2 weeks before the event it turned out she needed help with something for the upcoming show almost every day! Now I'm taking photos of her art on her backyard for hours, I'm going places with her to take photos at the gallery where she had something hanging too. I'm there to help her come up with the prices. I wrote an article for her. I wrote her an artist bio that she submitted to the art show organizers. I made an instagram reel to promote the upcoming show. I wrote her a sample email to help her get sponsors for the art show. 

The day of the art show I arrive to her place at 4 pm, to help her choose what to wear (by her request), so we can leave at 4.30, and be at the place at 5 pm, before the show opens at 7. To take more photos. 

Except when I arrive she has just woken up. So for another hour and a half I sit there as she's brushing her teeth, changes her underwear 3 times, 5 different outfits, 3 bras, 5 pairs of shoes... 

While I already took time to get ready and to be there for her on time. 

We're both in out late 30s, it's not like we're teenagers. The whole time she keeps saying ""I'm almost done, 5 more minutes"". 

So at 5.30 I was beyond pissed, said ""listen, I'm sorry, I've already been at it today for a few hours, I'm now in a pretty bad mood and I don't think I can be your photographer for the next 3 hours"". And I left. 

She got mad and just said ok and left. Called me a few minutes later saying she can still come back to pick me up, but I said I don't think it's a good idea. 

She said this was her day and she needed to get properly ready and it shouldn't be a huge deal.

"AITA for calling out this woman in front of a room full of people?  I’ll begin by saying I’m 31F, and my son is 7 years old. This woman’s son goes to the same school as mine. 

Another friend of mine had us and a bunch of other people over her house last night. My son is shy and quiet. Her son has bullied him at school continuously, outside at the playground, etc. Often getting him laughed at and made to feel bad. 

When we were in my friends living room, I asked her why she’s been an awful parent, raising her son to bully other kids and think it’s funny? I saw a lot of people didn’t know what I was talking about. 

I could tell she was surprised that I said this, but my friend got involved before she was really able to respond. My friend then said that I was wrong for bringing it up at the time. 

I don’t think there’s a problem it was one of the only times I’ve been able to see this woman lately. Apparently I was the one who was wrong even though it’s not my child’s behavior. 

TL;DR: I asked a woman why she’s been an awful parent in front of a room of guests, my friend said that I was wrong for bringing it up, but I wanted to resolve this issue. ",0.89
"AITA For telling my wife that i wished we would have married a bit later so we could afford a better house Throwaway account 

So me and my wife (24) both, been married for 10 months, since we have been moved into this house which is rent free, she’s been complaining most of the time about the neighbors and having roaches sometimes


I do agree with her, the house is shit and i do wanna move out too, but im waiting to get a raise so we can afford somewhere better without have to worrying about financial security 


So here’s the problem, each time she complains about the issues that I already know about, it kinda make me feel like shit, because i feel like its because of me thats she’s suffering 

Few days ago we went to check out an apartment, we agreed before we go that we will not move in we just wanna check it out and see in future if we wanna move in here or not, so we went there and she was trying to convince me that we can actually move in right now, and i did my math which it wasn’t very logical to move in right now since i haven’t gotten my raise yet 

This caused a fight between us which we both got very hurt to be honest

Then later we made peace again and she asked me if I regret marrying her, which ofc i said no because i do love her very very much

Then she asked if i regret marrying her early, i said i don’t regret marrying you early but i wish we could have waited a year maximum so we could have afforded somewhere better, she got very upset with this comment, i explained to her many times that i do love her very much and i dont regret marrying her, its just to have a better house so we could avoid all this fights and problems 

So please tell me if im wrong here, if iam how can i fix this?

Thank you.",0.33
"AITA for planning not to go to my mother’s best friend’s funeral, and stick with my plans to go to a convention instead I (22F) just recently had my mom’s (52F) best friend (mid 50’s F) pass away from a several month long and painful battle with cancer. I’ll call her N from now on. My mom was extremely close to N, especially following her own recent diagnosis with breast cancer. I was also extremely close with N, to the point where I would consider her to be like an aunt to me. I had said my goodbyes to her a few days before she had passed, and admittedly been quite emotional throughout the entire time. 

I have a hard time seeing other people sad or in pain, and as cheesy as it sounds, have a strong amount of empathy to where I cry easily when someone else is upset. Because of this, funerals are not really my thing. I’m not a spiritual person, and as long as I have been able to, I have avoided funerals. I’ve gone to them before, but I always feel weird at them. 

N’s funeral, is on the same day as a huge convention that I have been preparing for for months. Costumes, carpooling, expensive tickets, and planned and prepaid for photoshoots have all been organized for this day. I have even managed to squeeze into an exclusive event with one of my childhood heroes. I also am planning on going to this with several friends, and we were all planning on riding together. 

As ashamed as I am to say it, I don’t want to give up my plans to go to the funeral. While I know and love N’s husband and son, who I went to high school with, I don’t really know any of their other friends or family besides my own parents. I must also say that while there is a funeral taking place, they are also planning to go down the beach to scatter her ashes at a later time, which I fully intend to go to. The only reason I would go would be to support my parents and N’s son, but they all already have a support system that would be there, and I would probably become very emotional with crying since it is still a rather fresh event in a very shitty last few weeks. I have no intention of speaking at the funeral, or really doing much other than attending.

"AITA for ignoring my grieving GF while I travelled internationally? I [late 20s M] have been dating Jane [mid 30s F] for about a year now.

In April I was about to leave for a non-refundable 2-week trip with family and friends when Jane's close relative died. 

There's a large financial difference between Jane and I, and the funeral was in another city. So, though I had to go on my trip, I made sure to get her a hotel in the city where the funeral was, and to make sure she could afford to travel there in comfort. However, she only wanted to go for 1 week.

For the first week, I was able to keep in pretty good communication with Jane despite a very large time difference (>10h). I like to think I was as emotionally supportive as someone in my situation could be while travelling so far away. 

J has previous issues with drugs and cheating. She was previously addicted to a hard substance. In the past, she has slept with somebody for drugs while a partner was away on a trip. She had assured me in the past that I was nothing like the ex-partner she cheated on and there were extenuating circumstances. I believed her. She was, however, very insistent on making sure we did regular calls.

One weekend, I missed our scheduled call. One or two nights later, she was drinking heavily and called me crying, and left several voice memos, one of which I apparently read. I have no idea how I missed all this but I did. We were moving between cities every day. Apparently, that night she was browsing Grindr (she is a trans woman) and someone who she previously dated popped up. According to her, they messaged her and asked to hang out. She said yes and went over to their place. She then proceeded to do cocaine and have sex with this person. 

She was very quiet for the rest of the trip, but I didn't really notice as I was travelling. I checked in a couple of times and got small responses. When I got back, I immediately got COVID. After I'd mostly recovered, we met and I showed her the gifts I got her from the trip. She was unimpressed as they had come from a department store and apparently were not good enough, though she didn't say so in the moment. They totalled up to $80 or so and I thought they were thoughtful (she eventually came around to them after learning the price).

A couple of days later, when I was fully recovered, she asked to come over to play some games and instead she brought a suitcase full of everything I'd ever given or lent her and broke up with me by playing a playlist and having a couple of letters inside the suitcase explaining it. I was heartbroken.

The next day she called me and let me know that she had been exposed to two STDs. This is how I found out about the cheating, since we had done tests when we got together and I was surprised that this had happened. She broke down crying and told me the above story.

"AITA for not checking my partner’s pockets before throwing his shorts in the wash and almost washing his wallet?  We had a lazy Saturday and stayed at home playing an online game. We had to leave and when we were about to leave, he 24M started looking for his wallet. 

For context, my partner has ADHD so he misplaces his wallet frequently because he doesn’t have a set place to put his wallet in our apartment. We do have an entryway where I put my keys and wallet but he refuses to use it citing what I believe is a fear of quick and ease of theft, if it were to happen. 

Since we were just gaming all day, I wanted to feel somewhat productive so I picked up all the clothes off the ground around our apartment and loaded it into the wash but didn’t start. 

When he was looking for his wallet, he asked me to help. I said no and waited on the couch while he was looking. Truthfully, I was a bit annoyed he had lost his wallet again and I didn’t feel like looking for it. He asked me what clothes he was wearing the night before. I told him what he was wearing and that I had just thrown it in the wash but hadn’t started the load. He went to check and longbehold, his wallet was in the pocket of the shorts I picked up. I explained that I didn’t feel his wallet when I picked up the shorts because I was picking up other stuff as well in a rush to return to play the game. It was an honest mistake. He explained that the shorts are thin, called me careless and stormed off. 

He has previously requested that when I do laundry, that I check his pockets but because I wear pants that don’t have pockets, I never think to check and never got in the habit of it. AITA? ",0.67
"AITA for using veteran discounts with my sister-in-law, even though I feel uncomfortable with her calling herself a Navy veteran? So here’s the situation. My sister-in-law joined the Navy, did really well in the initial testing, and was placed in a nuclear program. She completed boot camp and was still in her schooling when she found out she was pregnant. She was never assigned to a ship or a post. As part of her honorable discharge, she wouldn’t qualify for any official VA benefits. (She has expressed feeling robbed about this.)

Despite this, whenever possible, she refers to herself as a veteran and takes advantage of veteran discounts and perks. She does have a DD-214, which she showed me once when we were getting a discount for Disneyland. I have conflicting feelings about this; part of me feels bad for getting these types of discounts, especially since she didn’t complete her service or get assigned to an actual post. But on the other hand, I obviously accept the discount and benefit from it when she shows her DD-214. I realize that her military experience is important to her, and I would never tell her how I feel about this because I don’t want to hurt her feelings. However, I sometimes think it’s not right for her to claim veteran status and seek these benefits.

"AITA for giving a silly, arbitrary award to a teenage girl? I (19M) was working at a camp some time back when I got into a row with the staff over something stupid, and it led to a bunch of other bs.

Essentially, at the end of each session, the camp had an award ceremony. It wasn't super formal but campers and staff alike could give awards to each other over various things like performance in an activity or even something more silly and less concrete. I didn't even know about this ceremony before it happened, but regardless, I hadn't had any plans to give awards to anyone.

However, there was this one group of teenage boys at the camp that I had a strange dynamic with. They would diss me frequently but would still go out of their way to talk to me and engage. After giving me a somewhat back-handed award, two of them came up to me and begged me to give them an award for being my favorite campers. I wasn't sure at first if I should since they were jerks a lot, but I'm pretty nice so I thought why not. But I decided that if I was going to go up, I wasn't going to give awards to just them.

There was one camper (11-13F) I'd gotten to know who was much friendlier than other campers and greeted me by name whenever she saw me. I debated whether I should give the award thinking it might look strange to give it to a girl, but I decided I shouldn't be meek and that it'd be fine (you'll soon see I greatly overestimated the maturity of the people there; the older campers and staff were like literal children in how they spread rumors and latched onto stupid shit).

I decided to give her her award in between both of the boys, and I said a few words about how she was cool before calling her up for a single handshake.

Well wouldn't you know it, the next day a manager pulls up and asks to talk. He tells me that it didn't go unnoticed that I gave an award to a young female camper (as if I didn't do that in front of an entire crowd), and that I didn't know her well enough to do that. At this point, I'm certain I'd made her uncomfortable and she'd complained, so I decide to not engage with her again. However, at lunch she comes up to me on her own and asks me in a normal friendly tone when I'm going to give her her physical award. I realize she hadn't had any issue with it and that it had purely been the staff. I decide that since she asked I might as well give the award.

Later I ask one of her counselors a detail of her name so I could properly address it on the award. She says she doesn't know but later that night her and her co-counselors are giving me death stares and the same manager pulls me away from another ceremony and kinda prompts me to explain myself. I told him what I explained above, after which point he becomes less hostile and says I can just pass the award on to one of her counselors rather than her directly.

I feel the management here frequently tried to find things to get you on, and after this happened they became hostile and accused me of the most inane things I didn't even do. So, did I do anything wrong here?",0.08

My brother is getting married, the ceremony and reception are in my parents backyard. Not super fancy, think much more casual setting. I found out upon receiving the invitation that they're choosing to have a child-free wedding. 

I called my brother to ask him about it, he says he ""thought he told me"", when we've never discussed any wedding plans at all. He tells me they chose to do this thinking that my husband and I could enjoy a nice night out without our kids, like a date night. I explain that I understand that, and would have no trouble with complying if it wasn't my brother/my kids Uncle and a backyard wedding at our parents house. He understands and is willing work with me. He continues telling me that him and his fiance debated about this for a long time and that he even wanted to have my son as a ring bearer. I explained that my older kids are very much looking forward to the wedding, are fully aware of the upcoming celebration and we even had a minor meltdown when my oldest thought he missed the wedding. Their feeling would be very hurt if they could not attend. My feeling from the conversation was that he wanted them to be there and she does not. We ended the conversation with him planning to talk to her and work out a time frame the kids will be allowed to be there to celebrate with them. For example, they can arrive after the ceremony and leave before the real partying begins. 

Then I received a text from his fiance apologizing for how I found out from the invitation, and she assumed I was informed. She also says she's happy to talk with me so we can figure out a solution and she doesn't want me or the kids to be put in a tough spot or feel excluded. We plan to chat a week later at her bridal shower that I am throwing for her.

"AITA for standing my ground with my wife over wanting a goatee? AITA for being upset over my wife saying I cant have a goatee?

A while back I was trying to figure out a facial hair style since up until that point because of my job I had never really had any, just kept it clean. I let my beard grow in a bit until I decided to trim it, and ended up with a neatly trimmed goatee, which I thought looked good. When my wife (fiancee at the time) saw it she immediately said no, citing her sisters ex boyfriend as the cause. He also had/still has a goatee. 20+ years ago, when my wife was a kid, around the ages of 7-9, her older (by 14 years) sister and this guy were in an obviously abusive relationship. One that unfortunately my wife had to witness at the time. I should note that the abuse, both physical and emotional, was mutual between her sister and this guy. They abused each other. Flash forward to now, and hes still in the picture to a tiny degree. Her sister and this guy had a child, and although my wife's sister has moved on from this guy as much as she possibly could, he's still her daughters father and thus is as remotely as possible in the picture. We never see him, and only hear about him from our niece when she talks about her father. 
Anyway, tonight this came up again in conversation, and it caused some friction. I said that I thought I looked good with the goatee, and I felt good about. And since it's my body and I liked the way I looked, then I should be able to have the look I want. She's a huge advocate (as am I) of people having complete autonomy over their own bodies. However, she said that because there's some past trauma with her sisters ex who had a goatee, I should be a good partner and recognize that and just not have a goatee.

"AITA for Skipping Dinner with My Family After My Boyfriend Seemed Disengaged?"" My boyfriend and I met up with my family, and our plans were a bit uncertain at first. Eventually, we decided on a plan: we’d start with bingo, then do an escape room, and finish with dinner. My boyfriend and I opted out of the escape room since he doesn’t like being in enclosed spaces. Before bingo, my boyfriend got a sandwich from Starbucks because he was hungry. After bingo, my mom decided that we should eat dinner first so we wouldn’t have to wait until after the escape room. However, my boyfriend wasn’t hungry anymore because of the sandwich he had earlier so he wasn’t going  to eat at the restaurant.

Throughout the day, my boyfriend seemed disengaged—he walked behind everyone and spent some time on his phone instead of interacting with the group. Noticing this, I decided we should skip dinner with my family, thinking it might be better if I just grabbed something to eat before we got home.

When we got in the car, he was upset, saying he didn’t understand why I made that decision and that now it looks like we left because of him. He said it’s my responsibility to be nurturing and not to make executive decisions since he’s the man of the house. I thought I was being considerate since he wasn’t going to eat anything at dinner, but he feels like I made the wrong choice. I also feel like he could’ve spoke up in the situation but seeing him mope I just thought it would be best to just leave early.

I wouldn't say I cancel plans a lot, but there are a few times a year where a chronic illness flare up or panic attack forces me to cancel at the last minute. I take meds, am followed by a doctor, and I'm in therapy so my issues are far from uncontrolled.

My stepsister is coming to town. I wouldn't say we're super close, but she's nice and I like catching up with her. Last time she was here I had a flare up and wasn't able to attend. This time I was fully planning on going until yesterday when I sprained my back, and it left me bedridden. I could barely walk 5 feet without excruciating pain, and so I called my mom [F67] and she was not thrilled that I'd hurt myself, but acted more like it was an imposition than anything else. She kept insisting I could relax on the couch and everything, except our family are Deck People, meaning they like to sit outside so I'd be stuck inside, alone. (They wouldn't be the type to stay inside just because I can't join them on the deck)

I gave it a night to see if I would feel well enough to go if I let my back rest, but when I woke up I was feeling a little better, but not well enough for a family gathering. I called my mom and told her this, and she said ""well, you didn't come last time [stepsister] was in town, so if you cancel this time, it'll look like you're avoiding her.""

"AITA for Not Taking My Girlfriend to Rap Concert? So I honestly have felt a little distant from my girlfriend of 3 plus years recently. It hasn’t been anything specific, I’ve just kinda got the sense that the love hasn’t been there from her recently. I've recently moved, we live in different states, about an hour or so away so we can't see each other so much.

So today, I was honestly not in the best mood and out of nowhere when we haven't talked much at all in the day, she told me she wants to go to this rap concert that will be in town soon where I live. This is 2 rappers performing that I won't name, they're pretty big names but just from my opinion, I honestly would rather go to any other concert than theirs. I told her I don't wanna go pretty adamantly and maybe even a little aggressively. But I only feel this way because I already feel like we hardly ever have any alone time, anytime I see her it's some big get together with her family or church (I go to church every week with her and her family). So the last thing I wanted is the next time we see each other to be surrounded by a bunch of hedonistic, sweaty concert-goers from 2 artists that are completely out of my style. I told her I will not go and I will not drop her off, but I don't mind if she goes alone with her ""friend"" which I'm not sure who she's referring to.

After this, she begins to tell me how crazy I'm acting. She tells me I'm insecure and controlling because I don't want to go to a concert with her because it's a man. Over and over again she tells me how insecure I am. Now let me be clear, it's not exactly like this, but obviously if you're a man with a girlfriend, you're not gonna be SUPER THRILLED about ""dropping her off"" at a Chris Brown or Usher concert or something. She tells me I'm a controlling, mentally abusive boyfriend for saying no to the concert and that I'm like a ""right wing incel on Twitter who supports Elon Musk"" (not sure how that relates to this, I am not right wing and I do not use Twitter at all). 

My question is, am I the crazy one here? Am I not seeing something that I'm doing wrong here? I just wanna make it clear, I've been in a relationship with her for over 3 year nows, I do everything for this woman. Like I mentioned, I come to church with her every week with her family. I help her out financially as much as physically possible so that she doesn't have to work. I wish I could just come to a resolve about this, but she told me she's on the edge of breaking up with me because I'm mentally abusive for not dropping her off at this rap concert. And honestly, like I said we haven't had much quality alone, date time recently. Almost every single thing we do is with her family or somebody else around. All I want to do is spend some nice quiet time alone with her, so that's another reason I'm not thrilled about this. Am I the wrong one here? Thank you and I appreciate you reading.

"AITA for telling my son's teacher that I don't care if my son skips her class all year? My son Max is starting his senior year and me, him and his mom agreed earlier that he would go to community college next year for financial reasons.

We found out that Max could take community college classes now and for free and the classes would also count for high school classes. Max said he wished he could take two community college classes (economics and political science) instead of taking them at his high school because he doesn't like the teacher. I said why don't you? He said he wasn't sure how that would work out but he wasn't going to take the same classes at a community college and high school.

We spoke to his guidance counselor who said the school us required to honor the grade of any community college course taken if it's higher than the one earned at high school. I asked if Max skipped his high school classes and failed but then showed up with a transcript from the community college showing that he passed the same class then you'll have to honor that?

She said yes but that's insane to think about a student not showing up all semester to a class and it'snot like the high school will let a student drop a required class. I told Max that I'd support whatever he wanted to do. He said he'd rather take two community college classes instead of taking them at high school. So he was signed up for two online course.

As a courtesy, I let the economics teacher (Ms K) know that Max was taking the class through community college so he wasn't going to show up. We understood he'll get an F but we'll replace the grade with whatever he gets in the college class. 

Ms K had a fit telling me that's not how the program works and he needs to show up. I said she has it wrong and I already had a meeting with the guidance counselor (who I cc'd). 

I guess there was a separate meeting because Ms K replied that it looked bad on her for my son not to show up all semester long. I told her that Max wasn't going to plan out his community college arrangement around your feelings. He's taking the required economics course through a community college and not your class. Fail him but the grade will be what he gets at the community college. I said ironically the college class ends before her class so he would had passed her class before it was over.

She replied that I was teaching my son to ""game the system"" and he needs to be in school. I said my son is working smarter, not harder and is going to be in school but a college. And he's going to do the same thing in the spring so deal with it.

Yes, she complained to the VP and guidance counselor who asked why can't he take a different class. I said because he doesn't want to take extra classes and isn't going to stress out over his teacher's feelings.",0.5
"AITA if I'm upset that my friends don't remember things I tell them 
I'm not sure if I'm being dramatic or overreacting about this but recently I've told my friends about my whereabouts and what happened to me because that's what they do about themselves too. When I did, I noticed that they underreacted or weren't really interested in the things that I say. They have vague reactions and most of the time don't really know what to say.

Maybe it's just me because when they talk about their stuff, I act super interested and even ask them all the way about themselves. When bad things happen to them, I make sure to overreact to assure them that I'm on their side and to also make them feel less bad about their situation.

When I was talking to them about my whereabouts, they were important pieces that they forgot. I got saddened when I thought 'Ah, so they didn't listen to me?' Cause even if they were were small pieces to the story, they were very important. I guess I got hurt because it felt like they didn't pay attention to the things I were saying or they're just not interested at all. I feel upset about it up to the point I don't want to tell them things about me anymore. I genuinely don't know how to approach this situation but I'd hate that if I open this up to them, they'd start acting pretentiously and just acting for my convenience since I opened it up.

"AITA for asking my uncle’s mistress (now-wife) to pay for his healthcare? My uncle (my dad’s brother) married young to a woman from a wealthy family. Their marriage fell apart over time, and he ended up cheating on her multiple times. They stayed married until he got his long-term mistress pregnant. After this came to light, they divorced.

My uncle lost his family home and moved in with his mistress (now-wife) far from our extended family. He’s now almost 70 with a teenage daughter, while his other kids are adults with their own families. Unfortunately, he’s fallen ill and needs medication, but his savings ran out due to bad investments. My dad has been paying for his medical bills, but he is retiring later this year.

I recently asked his now-wife to prioritize his healthcare over other expenses, especially since she’s still planning to send their kid to an expensive private school (all my cousins went there) and hasn’t been taking proper care of his health (and foods). She accused me of meddling in too much and not wanting her daughter to succeed in life and jealous of her as I did not go to a private school growing up.

I sympathize with my uncle’s situation, but I also feel like this is largely self-inflicted on my uncle’s and her part. Still, I don’t think it’s fair for my dad to bear the burden.

AITA for asking my uncle’s wife to focus on his healthcare?

Edit for more context:
My dad already told my uncle and his wife about this and my dad is also paying for their dad’s (my grandpa who is 90) daily expenses (part of his pension money is used for my uncle’s bills) — I am to, but I am also just starting out in life. My uncle’s wife blocked his number and my uncle lashed out on my dad. Months later my uncle asked for foods and gas money from my dad so we suspected neglect as well.

"AITA for accepting my sister's decision not to go to hospital post-concussion? Good day!

I'll try to keep it brief. My sister has a concussion, circa 2 weeks plus. I want to take her to hospital. I work in healthcare.

We were arguing all day today and I let the personal aspect of our relationship get in the way of the fact she has a literal brain injury. And so, we argued. I took her home and we argued some more while sitting in my car. She asked me to leave because she didn't want me there any longer. I acquiesced and left. She made me promise to call her in a few hours and I did.

Her cognitive abilities are severely diminished and are getting worse everyday.  I am genuinely worried and want to take her to the hospital. After checking in on her she said ""I don't NEED to go ANYWHERE."" I let her know what she is at risk for by refusing to go. She said, in no uncertain terms, that she accepts that. Not wanting to argue further and refusing to beg at that point, I said ""Okay, rest well. Good night."" and hung up my phone.

My kiddo is pissed. Said that if their aunt dies that its my fault. I said, after presenting the risks, my sister made what I think is an informed decision. However, I kinda feel like a jerk due to the cognitive aspect of it all.

AITA?



EDIT: I apologize if I didnt make this more clear. I have fibromyalgia. Stress can trigger flares and I was already suffering from a flare up when my sister called to ask for my help on this day. And the arguing has definitely made the flare up worse. So I feel like I made a decision to lessen my flare ups.

I'll make it quick & short. Married for little over 2 decades. I cook pretty much daily. Hubby's mom never tasted my cooking because whenever we visit them, they cooked. 

MIL (does't speak English) calls hubby, asked what we cooking for dinner. Hubby told her (in their native tongue) 'name of a dish from their country'. They chatted a bit and everything was fine. Later that night, hubby starts talking and mentioned part of the conversation he had with his mother earlier. Somehow it turned into a fight. 

He told his mom I was making 'a dish from their country'. I asked, 'why you lied to your mom? I made burgers' He said something along the lines of, 'they think we only eat American food, even tho it's not true, but just so happens the night she calls, we having burgers, so I told lied to her to defend you since we just had 'name of that dish' two days ago'. I said, 'I don't care they think that. We've been together for so long, I'm sure you've told them I know how to cook by now.' He said, 'I have, but they don't believe me since they've never seen you cook but they know I know how to cook, so I lied to defend you!' I said, 'I don't care if they don't believe it, it doesn't bother me, it shouldn't bother you either.' He says I don't get it, it's these little things that matters and that I has no reason to yell and be mad at him because he lied on my behave, & that I'm like this about EVERYTHING, just imagine IF he also didn't care and just acted like me.

"AITA for giving up talking to my mom about my hyper fixation?  I(15F and autistic) have a bunch of hyper fixations, some are temporary, other stick to me like glue, one of those ones being Melanie Martinez, a popular singer. My mom is aware of this, she herself isn't a fan of Melanie because she doesn't like the sound of her voice, which I respect completely, it would be stupid to get mad at her for that! However, whenever I act excited when Melanie released a new music video, announces a new tour, or more merch, she seems so annoyed or mad. 

Sometime last month, we went to the mall which we very rarely do, we decided to stop by hot topic to see what they have, and sorta just window shop, since I was curious, I decided to see if I could find any Melanie merch or sorta just any merch of my hyper fixations, while we were there, one of my favorite Melanie Martinez songs came on on the radio, I when I tell you, I damn near exploded from excitement, I mean I damn near exploded from excitement, I ran up to my mom and IMMEDIATELY started going ""OMG OMGOMGOMGONGONG MOOMMMMMMM"" and yknow, typical fangirling stuff, but she got mad at me. She very bluntly stated ""Yeah, they carry her shit, of course they're playing her music"" or something along the lines of that, I have a poor memory, and dragged us out of the store. 

Ever since I just stopped talking to her about my hyperfixations, notaonly Melanie, but all of them, just to avoid her getting mad at me for it. I can't tell if Im over reacting, or over thinking it, shes even brought up how I don't talk to her a lot anymore.",0.25
"AITA for asking him to care? I 20F, have been friends with 23M since I was 16. He and I met online and quickly became friends. J helped me move on from an abusive and toxic relationship which happened to be the first relationship I ever had. About 3 months after we became friends, we started dating. That didn't last long because we were constantly fighting and he cheated on me more than once in the few months we were together. After some time apart, we decided to be friends again. We were friends for a while before we decided to try dating again. It was hard to be together because we couldn't meet in person until I turned 18 and in my opinion, he couldn't keep it in his pants to save his life. So, we broke up and went back to being just friends.

I wasn't perfect, I'll admit that a lot of our fighting was because I was a jealous 17 year old who knew nothing about healthy relationships let alone how a relationship should go. Anyways, we were both at fault for all of our problems when we dated. I know that I can't blame him for everything not working out because that just wouldn't be true.

Anyways, over the past 4 almost 5 years, we've gone between being just friends and being friends with benefits. Haven't gotten back together or anything.

However, I feel like he only wants to be friends with me for the sex. Anytime I try to talk to him or hang out with him outside of hooking up, he has some excuse not to. I've told him that if I'm just a fuck buddy then he should say that so I can quit putting so much effort into our friendship. He'll tell me how he cares for me and how he doesn't want to lose our friendship and that he won't constantly ask for just hooking up and I stupidly fall for it every time.

I'm constantly supporting him and helping him with relationship stuff like when he fights with his girlfriends over something, I give him advice and help him figure out a way to make it up to them. He pretends to be supportive of my relationships until he's in the mood to hook up. Then he's constantly blowing up my phone and telling me that my bf doesn't have to know and that he misses us and what we do. I never hook up with him when I'm in a relationship or vice versa. If he is in a relationship I won't even talk to him because I won't be the cause of his breakups and I won't let him drag me into the cheating game he plays or whatever you wanna call it.

Anyways, each time I ask him to put more effort into our friendship or tell me that he doesn't want anything more than friends with benefits, he gives me the same speech and then gets mad that I 'accuse' him of not being a good friend. Am I the asshole?",0.04
"AITA for telling my friend I wish there were a dating app for transmen? AITA for telling my friend I wish there were a dating app for transmen? 

For context, I 25f have had only two serious relationships in my life, both with trans men. I've tried dating cis men but something about it just doesn't sit well with me, maybe it's because of my high testosterone from my PCOS. It just feels uncomfortable for me, like they don't take me seriously because I'm so awkwardly feminine. 

The problem happened when I was venting to my friend about how I will probably die alone, the usual dramatic girl stuff. But when I said ""I wish there was a dating app specifically for finding a transgender guy because I don't think I'll find happiness with a cis-guy"" all hell broke loose. She told me I was a disgusting ""chaser"" & that's why I haven't found happiness, then she left my house. It's been 3 days since I've heard from her. 

I've been called a chaser before & I haven't let it bother me, but maybe it's true? I always chalked it up to hormones & how I'm hardwired but idk. Am I an asshole or a ""chaser"" for saying I wished there was a dating app where cis-women could find a transgender man specifically? ",0.83
"AITA for refusing to pay my son's mom to watch him? I separated from my 7yo son's (Sean) mom (Amber). We have 50/50. Our custody agreement have several provisions about who pays for what. She is on the hook for childcare. We did have a sitter for the last few years but he said he was moving back home in January would obviously not be available after that.

Amber and I both have agree on a lot of things including his sitter so neither she nor I can unilaterally hire someone to watch him. We were discussing the matter and she found someone to replace our sitter - her boyfriend Jesse.

He moved in with Amber and they've been together for a couple of years. She said he WFH and would love to spend time with Sean. I said is he expecting to be paid? She said of course and the same amount as our current sitter ($28 an hour). 

I said absolutely not. I don't know him well enough and I suspect this more about my paying your boyfriend to watch our kid than finding a proper sitter. I don't know how he drives. I don't feel comfortable with him giving him a bath. I don't know how reliable he is. I don't even know if he wants to do it. And I pay our sitter good money because he's worth it and has a good relationship with our son. I would NEVER start a sitter off at $28 an hour.

Also I'm not cool with anyone getting paid to watch my kid while on the clock for another job. The whole idea pissed me off. We got into an argument about it. She insisted that they weren't trying to double-dip on me (they both think I'm rich and they are having money issues). 

We've been fighting over it so I said that I'll take over babysitting stuff. I too WFH and will make it work. She said she didn't want me in her house and then accused me for trying to save money. I said no, this is about you trying to make money off watching our kid. I told her I'm not discussing this until November because it got heated and we have a sitter for another four months. 

Just yesterday she asked if I'd be open to a compromise of her being the ""sitter"" on days or times when I have Sean but need a sitter. I said are you to expect me to pay you? She said yes. I told her no and she's has to drop this ambition of getting paid to watch her own kid. She said could take unpaid time off work and that's why she was suggesting it.

"AITA: Pet payments to ex after breakup? My ex and I had gotten a cat when we were together. Or he surprised me with the cat - there had been some contemplation of getting a kitten, and I was excited about the idea. So it probably seemed like I was on board, so he surprised me by going out and getting the cat without me knowing.

I loved having the cat. But then long story short my Dad passed and I ended up moving out (my ex and I were living together at the time) and moving home to help with family stuff. We never really discussed pet expenses, I helped out with vet bills that came up, cleaned up and bought food and fed the cat when around, but I was living far away for almost two years. We were in a long distance relationship and the cat stayed with them.

When i moved back to the same city I continued to help out here and there but the cat was still living with them and I wasn't.

About 3 years after we got the cat we broke up. At the time my ex owed me about $600 from a recent trip we'd been on where I covered their expenses - it was obviously a loan and expected to be paid back. And while I don't think there's any easy way to bring up money during a break up, I waited a couple of weeks and then asked about it. 

They got really mad, said money was all I cared about, and then said they shouldn't owe me anything and maybe I should be paying half of the cat's expenses for the next 10 years (or however long).

They never ended up paying me back. To be honest I was so distraught that I just let it go because I thought they were using the money as a way to keep in touch with me (as soon as I said they didn't have to pay me they changed their tune and said of course they would).

Should I have paid for more of the pet expenses? The cat always lived with them and tbh I think I was young and naive about the responsibility of having a pet and it was too late when I realized I did not actually want to own a cat. Which sounds horrible. I pitched in when I was around, but I wasn't around much, for the various reasons above. And I just wonder if it was fair for my ex to keep that $600 or if I should have paid for more things for the cat. TIA!",0.06
"AITA for yelling at my ungrateful stepson? 
I’ve been stepmom to my stepson (17M) for the last 4 years. My stepson (who I will call Nick for the post) is a good kid. I love him. As much as I love him we don’t have the best relationship.

At first, it was easy, I was his Dad’s new bride and he respected me. We played video games together, cooked together, and went to church together. However, as he grew our relationship soured. The A average he maintained the first 2 years of high school dropped to a B-C average his junior year. He lived with my husband and I 5 days out of the week and I helped him with his school work so this pissed me off especially as someone who is big on grades and college. I asked Nick what was going on and he said he’s losing his passion for education. I then asked him what he was going to do with his life. To my surprise, he told me he wants to join the USMC infantry. Hell no I said. God forbid he goes to war.

Then there is his mom. I never talked to her all that much except for family gatherings. She isn’t a pleasant woman to talk to. Recovering alcoholic, emotionless, and uneducated. I can honestly see why Nick lost his passion for school. Nicholas only sees her on weekends. And she has always talked down on me to Nick. I know because he tells me and says he doesn’t believe anything she says. Recently though, he has been getting closer with her and I now know he asked her if he could move in with her. This isn’t a good idea. She’s a recovering alcoholic with little education and relatively low income. Nicholas has also insulted me a few times. Sometimes repeating the nonsense his mom has said about me. 

Sucks to say it but our relationship has been shitty lately. I was thinking of ways to improve it. His birthday was yesterday. I thought that if I surprised him with a nice new pair of shoes, perhaps he’d sit down and talk with me. Discuss his feelings with me and our relationship would improve. I did just that but he didn’t accept my gift. He says he’s to upset with me to accept anything from me. My husband yelled at him for that. He snapped a bit. Saying that he’s felt like he’s ignored at home and that he doesn’t even consider me family anymore. I nearly cried. My husband then apologized to him for making him feel that way and promised things would change. He then told Nicholas to go lay down in his room and that he would be there, WITHOUT me to talk about it more. 

I asked Nick to explain himself more to me but he refused. I then asked if we could at least take a family photo together. Him, my husband, my daughter, and myself. He said no. Here is where I yelled at him. I’ve always been fair with him, I bought him shoes and he’s been treating me like dirt lately. Nick got a visibly sad look on his face and went into his room. My husband followed him while giving me an angry face. He came out a few minutes later and told me to just leave Nick alone. I said ok and told my husband I’m sorry to which he said too late.",0.99

Some context: I knew Matt since I was 15-16 years old, at that time my parents were freshly divorced and whenever I was at my dads house, Matt would also be there as he was my dads new roommate as my mother kept the house. Since Matt was at my dad’s house all the time since he worked from home and because of Covid at the time, so we spent a lot of time together, with my father’s supervision. During 2021 my mother passed away due to Covid so I had to live with my dad. And in 2022 when I was 17 and at the time Matt moved out, he started to text me and I entertained it, which I admit was my fault for entertaining it. Once I turned 18 we got together and I moved out of my dad’s house for college and without my dad’s knowledge I moved into Matt’s new apartment and started a relationship with him, so I’ve been with him for two years.

She had me young, broke up with my dad and he died when I was 3 and let his family support me after he died and she was alone, because her family wouldn't help us. She got married when I was 6 and had two of my half siblings (10f,9m). Her marriage broke down while she was pregnant for the second time. I was never close to their dad so we don't have contact with each other anymore. But he sees my two half siblings. Then my mom got married again. Her husband ""Dave"" has a son (11m) from a previous relationship who he has full custody of. He and my mom also have two kids together (6m,5f). My mom and Dave's families are not involved in our lives. Dave was a foster kid so never knew his and my moms family still isn't over her having me when she was 19 and don't condone her having a child outside of marriage so...

My half siblings from mom's first marriage and I have extended family. They have their dad they see 50% of the time, and his family. I have my paternal family. We each have contact with them, get gifts form time, time with them, parties, dinners, etc. My half siblings get a bunch of vacations every year. The other kids don't. My mom has chased after her ex and my family to include everyone but they don't. My mom has threatened to keep my family from me if they don't include all half and step siblings. But I fought back against that and told her I want to be able to see my family without everyone else. She yelled and cursed at both her ex and my family for not ""being more inclusive"".

Mom talks about this a lot around the kids, she complains a lot, encourages them to complain and express their jealousy. She feeds into it. Which makes everything worse. Dave and I have a very tense relationship too. I said no when he offered to adopt me. And I didn't advocate for his son to join in on some of the experiences I get with my extended family. Not to mention I don't really talk about having parents. I'll just say I have a mom.

For the last two or three months my half siblings have been fighting like crazy and my stepbrother asked Dave to get divorced so it could be just the two of them. Mom was so shocked by how things turned out. She said something like families don't fight like this, they love each other. How did we get so bad. How come there's no blending. I told her because she's fucking everything up by trying to force my family or her ex and his family to treat everyone like family when they're not and how bringing up how unfair and wrong it is around younger kids is going to feed the jealousy. I told her it won't get better until she realizes she can't control everyone and lets go of us all having very different families. Mom was shocked I was blaming her at all and she told me if I was a better big sister to all five kids, I would make sure they're included and I would be on her side about everything and how much it angers her that I blame any of this mess on her.

currently, she is trying to keep our thermostat at around 75 degrees in the apartment. shes a small girl, and suffers from an ED, so she prefers things as close to boiling as she can get them. unfortunately, this has only gotten worse over the past week, and she’s keeping it anywhere from 75 to 78 degrees. 

i am politely losing my shit over it. heat stroke is no joke here, and i’m NOT used to this heat. i cannot sleep, and have essentially begged her multiple times to PLEASE keep the thermostat at what i feel is a very sensible 72. every time i leave the apartment, or if i dare to fall asleep, she sneaks over and changes the thermostat to as high as she can possibly get it, and its caused me to end up nauseous and dizzy multiple times. i work very early mornings, and its causing me to fall asleep at work because i’m struggling to get proper rest at home. 

her argument is that she is doing this for her health, because her ED makes her immune system weaker, and makes her get sick often. normally, the second she mentions her ED as part of the issue, i try my best to accommodate her, and i have offered her my winter clothes, and all the vitamins i currently keep on stock, which she refuses. but respectfully, she can wear sweaters and bundle up, i literally cannot remove my skin. 

am i the asshole for not accommodating her? i don’t want to be a dickhead who is unsympathetic to her struggle with an eating disorder, or her feeling cold all the time, but also i’m starting to become a much meaner person because i’m unable to get more than a few hours sleep without being interrupted by my roommate broiling me alive.

Our friendship deepened, and they shared more about their difficult past and current struggles, including living at home to care for siblings with severe special needs.

Recently, after not working for months, they got a new job, and things seemed to be turning around. However, just days into training, they injured their leg playing sports and couldn’t continue working. They asked me for financial help, and despite my usual rule against lending money to friends, I gave them several hundred dollars, expecting to be paid back soon.

I’m a single parent, struggling financially myself, and dipping into my savings to help them has left me in a tight spot. They assured me I’d be repaid, but as time passed, they ghosted me and then resurfaced, only to ask for more money. Each time, they promised to start repaying me, but nothing has materialized. Meanwhile, I’ve seen them out spending money on non-essential things and partying, which feels like a slap in the face.

Our friendship has become strained, and I’m starting to see it as toxic. I feel stuck between wanting to be paid back and not wanting to pressure them too hard, fearing they might cut me off completely. I’m considering small claims court, but I’m unsure if it’s worth the trouble, especially since they’re not working consistently. I don’t want to abandon a friend, but I also don’t want to be taken advantage of. I’m torn between staying in contact in hopes they stabilize and pay me back or pursuing legal action. There’s a lot more to it, but… **sigh**…character limit! AITA for wanting to be paid back ASAP?",0.38
"AITA for lying to my coworkers that I moved far away so I wouldn't have to give them a ride home anymore? I work at a restaurant/diner near my University campus and the majority of my coworkers are international students without a car. Those being our cooks, while the three other servers have cars. 

I started a year ago and ever since I got my car, they've been non stop asking for rides home when we close the store at around 10:30 PM. It'll be 1-2 people per ride everytime and they use to ask hours in advance before we clocked out and were ready to go home.

I would reluctantly agree because I have a ""keyholder like"" position and I have to stay and lock up the store and set the alarm and watch everyone leave. It's either we clock out in time after they ask me for a ride home or we're waiting about 20 minutes past close for some ride they called.

Over time I thought this would go away but our boss continues to hire more and more international students without a car. And I think the others tell them I give rides and it's become ""expected of me"" from the coworkers, to the point they won't even ask me for a ride until we clocked out and I thought they're other ride was here because they didn't mention it AT ALL to me.

PSA NOBODY has ever offered me gas money or any compensation for driving them home. Even if it's on MY way home, it's still gas, time, and I have to force conversation when I'm extremely tired.

One of our other servers mentioned they probably don't even understand to give me gas money because they're from India and they didn't even know until recently you're supposed to tip servers and food delivery people.

But a few weeks ago I went on a three week trip to Japan and I have no idea how these people have been getting home. First day I come back, me and this other girl clock out and we're walking to the door ans she asks ""can you drive me home?""

and I just flat out lied and said I moved forty minutes away and I need to go home. she was SHOCKED I said no and started calling everyone she knew and nobody got her. and then begged me to drive her home saying it's only 10 minutes away. 

*I had to drive her home. No gas money compensation. nothing.*

All the other servers know I'm lying and they fully agree but I think some of the cooks caught on and they're really upset with me because I'm known as like the ""really nice one"" to work with. Quiet, does their job, doesn't really manage that much even if I'm a little more in charge than most people. 

AITA?

Edit: I sent in our work chat a message to inform everyone.  I think I was direct but nice. I used chat gpt to help me lmao

"AITA For Returning mY Wife's Birthday Gift? My (36M) birthday was on Tuesday. My wife gave me a birthday that was probably the furthest thing from what I said I wanted. She literally *asked* me what I wanted, then proceeded to buy a completely different thing. I get it's the thought that counts but damn. 

On Friday I went to return it. She saw the email thing of the return on the day I initiated it, and asked why I returned it. I told her it was because it wasn't exactly the thing I had in mind. She looked a bit disappointed after I said that, but she let me. She's seemed a bit slighted since, and is probably still thinking about the gift.

I (26M) met up with some friends (26/25M) at Host's (24M) home. When we arrived, we found that Host had ordered us all pizza, there were four in total. They were all vegan pizzas, which isn't strange because Host is vegan, none of us minded that much but we would have ordered something else if given the choice (we aren't vegan).



At the end of the night, Host asked us to pay for the pizzas and he said he didn't have any because he wasn't hungry and insisted that we split it without him.

I thought it was a bit weird, but at the time we all agreed and left. However, at the drive home we all agreed that this was fucked up and decided we aren't going to pay because we didn't order, didn't enjoy it, and to be honest wasn't even that hungry. There was no discussion beforehand on ordering food, Host totally pulled this on us out of nowhere.



When we told Host this, he called us all assholes and now won't talk to me, the others don't think this is worth losing a friend over but I'm honestly kind of sick of this guy he pulls this shit all the time.",0.19
"WIBTA if I asked my best friend to move out My best friend Henry(28M) has been living with my girlfriend (27F) and I (29M) for the past 4 years and now wife and I are wanting to downsize and kick him out. But he still plans on going with us.

Henry started living with us in an apartment we had and then when I bought a house he moved in as well with another roommate. At the time I had asked him to pay me 400$ a month as the other roommate was too. 

That roommate only lived with us for 6 months and it’s been almost three years and that’s all he pays. He uses all utilities for free and most of the time will eat whatever we make for dinner. Never contributes to any toiletries or odds and ends we need in the house unless asked and has to be in a “good mood” to ask him. 

Gets very upset over having to help do anything around the house. And takes my car to work when he doesn’t feel like driving his. Me and my wife are so tight on money we’ve had to ask him to borrow and he gets very upset if we can’t pay him back right away. 

He’s been friends with me forever he’s lost family members and friends since living with us so I feel bad but he’s got such a bad attitude and no initiative and I can’t afford this anymore. I think he’s just got to comfortable. WIBTA if I asked him to leave? I don’t wanna ruin all of our friendship",0.1
"AITAH for wanting my boyfriend to sacrifice to get me a nice engagement ring.  So for context my boyfriend and I have been dating for almost 4 years and we have been talking about getting engaged for the past few months. We finally went ring shopping and started to decide on what type of ring we wanted to get. 

For more context he makes a good amount of more money than I do (almost double). To be fair to him I wanted to always split the bills down the middle and try to keep things equal. This has worked out fine for us but of course as he makes more money than I do and he loves to spend it on the most random things. 

Now as we were ring shopping we started to talk about what size stone to get. I wanted a decent sized stone and he wants to go a bit smaller and have more clarity. This whole conversation ended up with me being called a gold digger and being called greedy because I wanted a larger stone. 

My whole argument has been it didn't matter the price of the ring it mattered on the sacrifice he had to make to purchase it. Since he makes so much more than I do he has a lot more disposable income and I want to know he had worked hard to save that extra income to put towards a ring.

Like I previously mentioned he likes to spend his money on whatever new obsession he has in his mind. His current obsession is cars and has talked about selling his 60k car and buying another. Now that's all fine since it is his money but I guess my problem is he is going to have to put more money back into the newer car for the modifications he wants to do to it. Meaning he is just spending money rather than saving it. 

After mentioning how I felt about how he wasn't saving money he got mad at me and started accusing me of being a gold digger because I wanted a more expensive ring and that I should be happy with what he got me. (Now to his credit he isn't looking at cheap rings and again for me it's the sacrifice he has to make to buy the ring) 

My feelings got hurt that he started saying this stuff to me because I have never been that way. Our first year of dating we were both in college and I had 2 jobs and supported us whenever we wanted to do something. We still split all the bills down the middle and I have never once asked him for money. Basically what it gets down to is AITAH for wanting to know he had to sacrifice to buy me the ring I wanted?",0.67
"AITA for taking a 26 min shower? My partner lost their shit over how long I'd been in the shower. I am a female with longer thick hair, and I was doing what some refer to as a full body shower - washing, conditioning hair, shaving all, washing my body, my face, and then got out.
My parter said they were running the sink for as long as I was in the shower and asked if I noticed how much water was wasted then. I asked how I'd be able to hear that run while I was in the shower. ""Exactly."" followed by other things.

"AITA for putting parents in their place  Context: I (25f) am child free by choice. I believe I do not have any motherly instincts and would make a terrible mother. This happened a couple months ago but I can’t stop thinking about it. I was taking a flight from Washington DC to Las Vegas with a 2 hour layover in Texas with my friend. I get from DC to Texas just fine. Here’s where things started to get messy, I arrive in Texas, I wait for my two hours at my gate. However, upon boarding time apparently they didn’t have a flight attendant to take us to our final destination so we had to wait. So I waited, no biggie I waited a couple hours for a layover what’s a couple more. Well a couple hours turned into 6-7 hours, 6-7 go by and finally they are ready to board and take off, they begin boarding and I’m already exhausted so I start to fall asleep. I wake up to them telling us over the intercom we’re not approved mechanically for takeoff, so they deboarded us. Cut to now I’m in a random city in a random airport for 13 hours and I start to fall asleep, it’s now late and not many people are there so I find this table like thing in between two chairs and I put my neck pillow and blanket down and try to make the best of it. While I’m sleeping this mom and dad and presumably extremely young baby come and sit right in one if the chairs that’s connected to the “table” like thing I’m laying on. I wake up to this baby whaling and I give the parents a nasty look, I’m tired and aggravated. I go back to sleep to be woken up maybe 10 minutes later to this baby screaming again, I’ve had enough. I told them “when you become parents you’re supposed to lose this self centered attitude yet you decide to sit right next to someone you see trying to sleep in a rather empty airport” to which they responded “she’s colicky we can’t help that she’s crying” to which I said that’s her excuse that doesn’t explain why you have to be inconveniencing me by sitting your colicky baby next to me. The mother started crying, my friend started cussing at me telling me I was out of line and to be quiet and that I’m causing a scene. I said a scene wouldn’t have been caused if they weren’t so self absorbed. A couple of things to note: no this couple was not on our flight they were at a gate next to ours and almost everyone on my flight had left already, there was plenty of open seats scattered around, and yes I am aware being new parents isn’t easy but I’m also aware that being situationally aware and mindful of others isn’t hard either.

"WIBTA for Keeping my Makeup in the Bathroom? I (21M) have been sharing a room with my roommate (23M) for about 5 months. It is a tiny space, as we eat at a mess hall and work outside the space - it's just a bunk bed, some storage for clothes, and a washroom so small I can touch each end with my hands while my arms are bent. 

I wear makeup, and my roommate doesn't. When we first moved in I bought some little magnetic  shelves to hold my stuff, mainly in my bunk but I also got two for my makeup/accessories. The storage space provided in the washroom is basically nonexistent, so I thought it'd be smart to add my own. When I first put them up I asked my roommate about the spacing, if it was okay for them to be put there and he said yes. I've stored my makeup there since then. 

Now here's the issue: my roommate is much taller than me. (I'm 5' and he's about 6' I believe.) a couple months ago, my roommate accidentally knocked over the shelf that had makeup, spilling it everywhere. Multiple pieces were broken, eyeshadow was all over the floor, it was bad. I was working at the time, and found out through a text. I came back after my shift (an hour later) and cleaned up the mess; scrubbed the floors, repaired as much as I could, threw out what was beyond saving, and put everything back. All was well, until today when he knocked it over again. More things were damaged, powder all over, same story. Another accident, of course, and he immediately apologized, but when I went to clean it up again he seemed annoyed and angry. He left the room right after. I had thought that the shelves were fine, but if he's knocked them over two times now I'm beginning to worry that I shouldn't store them there. We move out in five weeks so it might be mute at this point, and he hasn't mentioned moving the shelves, but I can't help but wonder: WIBTA if I kept the shelves where they are? ",0.08
"AITA For telling my BFs boss he wasn’t going into work the next day I am going to Start with a bit of background so that hopefully this makes some kind of sense. My boyfriend (M36) let’s call him Joe, and I (F27) work in the same store (it’s a franchise) I’ve worked for this company (and owner) for four years and my goal is to work my way up and eventually own one of these stores myself. 

A year ago Joe and I moved to a new city when the owner I work for was moving to a bigger store and asked me to come with her. He started working for this store when we moved here because it was easier for scheduling as we also have a daughter together.

Our store is currently undergoing a huge expansion, we are both apart of the team that is setting up this new portion of the store. We both have our own small crew that we are in charge of, then we have a project manager, let’s call him Paul, that comes from corporate that oversees the whole project and makes sure we meet our deadlines and directs what we do. We work Monday to Fridays from 6am to 2:30pm. Our project manager doesn’t usually come in until around 7am. That usually leaves Joe and I completely in charge for the first hour of the day. Which is no problem at all as the three of us have usually discussed the day prior what the priorities for the next day of work are, and in addition to that Paul will text Joe a list of tasks to get done for the day and he then passes the info to me.

With all that in mind our problem starts here. Our crews are mostly made up of younger school/university kids, from 15 years old to 18, most of them already worked in the store previously part time. Joe had been having trouble with the kids on his crew as they didn’t really follow his direction or when they did they did a half assed job and he had to finish what they started. He got upset to the point where he decided on Thursday he just wasn’t going to come to work the next day (Friday) because he didn’t want to deal with them. 

This leaves me in a tough spot because I am now responsible to instruct his crew on what to do the next morning and I have no idea what they had been working on previously. On Thursday, Joe left work for the day, I stayed late to try and finish up what I was working on, but before I left I went to do a walk around with Paul to see what the plan was for the next day and asked that he tell me what to do with the kids on Joe’s crew as he decided he wasn’t coming in the next day, Paul then asked me for my phone number so that he could just text me the To Do list instead.

I ended up telling Joe Saturday night that I had told Paul he wasn’t coming in and he’s now mad at me for being a snitch and saying that I’ve betrayed him and have made him look stupid to our boss and he can no longer tell me anything because he doesn’t trust me.

So Am I the asshole for telling our boss that he wasn’t coming in instead of letting him call out pretending to be sick? ",0.55
"AITAH for losing my temper on my spouse?  I won't sugar coat this... I CAN be an AH. I deal with mental, and chronic health issues, and I am a high functioning person with FAS.

I (51 F) and my spouse (70's M) Have been best friends for 25 years and together for 6. (We do NOT live together)

As of late (last 2 years or so) he's been reckless while driving (but he's always in a rush to be back home) and has several accidents that could be avoided. He has tried to text and drive with our grand child in tue car. I lost my shit on him. 

He's ALWAYS 2nd guessing info I provide him and chooses to do things his way till I end up yelling, and LOUDLY explaining to him he's going to hurt or k!ll someone. 

(NOW I want to note: I don't hit him, but sometimes *not all the time* I get angry enough that I want to, but I took anger management to teach me self control and emotional regulation)

He's also very poor at communication and even though English is not his 1st language he KNOWS what I deal with, and still tends to lack context (all required info to make a comment or answer) in any convo he has with me. 

Today's example was him asking me if I had to go anywhere (it's Sunday) in an area that's out of the way. He paused and I answered him telling him no I didn't think so. He then proceeds to ADD info I didn't have, and explains he would take the bus on Tuesday (2 days from now) to go get his meds (because it's free for seniors) and not the car. I had it and looked at him and said.

 ""GESUS! Context man! You know I need all info to give a proper answer, that's 2 days from now! How can I give you a proper answer if its not today? Like wtf!! You're making me feel stupid!"" 

He then proceeds to say I didn't give him enough time to finish his question. (WTF?) - He just tried to gaslight me with that crap. I'm NO damn saint but even I say sorry when I screw up. He has a habit of blaming me for his lack of context or says, ""You know English isn't my best language."" 

25 years I've been teaching him. He knows English. He might not get the slang but he knows English. 

So yeah I yelled. Told him he made me feel stupid AND I was f*#king tired of it. I was tired of always being stressed out and I unloaded everything I said here but I wasn't tactful with my words.
I was blunt and straight out mean, no two words about that. I feel bad for it but how is he going to know if I am not direct. Being nice about all this hasn't sunk in. 
 
He WILL try to come around but I told him no visits for a week. I needed a break but as a courtesy I would let him know where I was going so he doesn't think I'm screw!ng around on him (cause I know how he gets and how insecure he is) 

Personally I think he's been pushing me away on purpose and I just don't know why or if I'm just over thinking. And NO, he's not cheating. He's elderly, and has never had luck with attracting women.

Then he started questioning why I set a time with my family without discussing it with him first. I understand his concern, but l'm confused as to why he didn't bring it up the night before. He knew for a week that we'd be seeing my family, so he could've mentioned if he wasn't available until after a certain time.
He got upset and didn't realize that the plans were actually flexible because my mom's tournament was taking longer than expected, so the time had already been pushed back to 5 PM. But then he started saying that his schedule isn't going to be interfered with by anyone, even if it's family.

"AITA for forcing my friend to pay for car damage after I sold it?  I (35M) rented one of my extra cars to one of my best friends, BB (25F). It’s like a 2014 Ford Taurus, 80k miles, valued around 10k-12k. The plan was for her to rent it until she could secure financing to purchase it. She ended up getting into a car accident which did damage to the entire back end of the vehicle, deployed the airbags, and the vehicle was unable to be driven. 
After a cluster-F with the insurance claims being denied, she promised she would pay for everything out of pocket, even if she had to slow pay me payments, but her plan was to still buy it and pay for the repairs herself. 
My mechanic said for the cost of all the airbags, new trunk, bumper, lights, labor etc., the cost would be like $6,000. But he could get it drivable for around $2000. 

The options I gave BB: 
1. Buy it for 10k and repair at your leisure. 
2. Fix it for 6k (which is the cost of the damage). 

Well we decided on the 3rd and worst option: pay $2000 for the minimum repair to get it drivable and “eventually” buy it for 10k. 
So BB paid the 2k even though the overall value of the car was diminished and there were no airbags and the truck wouldn’t open and close, it still drove fine. 🙈

One year goes by and BB has yet to come up with the 10k to purchase it, and has zero dollars to put towards it. So I trade it in for another car. Because of the damage, the dealership only gave me 2500 for it. 

After hearing what I traded it in for, BB is angry that I’m still wanting to charge her $4000, the cost of the damage minus what she already paid, since I took such a big loss on the trade in. 
She’s also super pissed that I didn’t give her the option to buy the car for $2500, since that’s what I traded it for. 😳

Facts: 
Worth 10k-12k on KBB. 
Damage estimate 6k.
Semi-repair 2k (paid by her). 
Trade for 2500.

I (34f) and my husband John (36m) have 4 children - 3 (Stacey 13f, Amy 12f, Oscar 10m) from his previous relationship and 1 (Robyn 3f) together. my husband have been together 8yrs and married for 5.Johns kids stay with us every fortnight, 2 weeks during summer, week at Easter & Xmas period this has been the set up from before I was in the picture. I have been around for a large part of the kids lives so we are no strangers and when they are here they are treated no differently.Most of the time we have no issues (yes small arguments here and there but nothing major).We do regularly get calls from mother to help defuse situations at her home as kids don’t seem to have a lot of respect for rules over at hers & a handful of times I’ve had to go and collect one of the kids to live with us (this has only been temporary as I have had to move things around so I can get them to school but still get myself to work and Robyn to childminder - so it’s a lot on me as John works a lot! But within a week or 2 all emotions have calmed down & able to return). 
Enough back story, now let’s decide if I’m the A**hole. Yesterday kids were getting sorted to return home to their mothers, I was downstairs & heard a bit of commotion but I was too interested in my coffee. John came downstairs and shouted at me to watch where I was leaving my pants! Totally confused & so then had to explain that they were all upstairs arguing as Oscar was caught wearing one of my black thongs! A wave of disgust & betrayal washed over me! Not only was I pi**ed that I was getting shouted at for my underwear (that is never just lying about the house) but my stepson had took it apon himself to go into my bedroom, raid through my pant drawer! Then went on a big lying spiral to say my pants must have been washed with his trousers & they were accidentally put on then putting the trousers on - I’m a female but I’m sure a UK size 6 thong would be uncomfortable for a boy and would be highly noticeable.  I don’t know if it was the sheer shock of Oscar wearing my pants or the scolding I got from John but i absolutely lost it !! I started shouting how this was my primary home & I shouldn’t need to hide my pants (which were already hidden in my pant drawer!) How Oscar has absolutely no right ! If he was so curious about woman’s pants he has a mother & 2 older sisters why mine! I was livid I couldn’t even say goodbye to anyone John just took them straight home. 
Right now I do feel awful at the way I acted but my privacy & intimate clothing was invaded. Speaking to family and friends they are speechless - they do see where I’m coming from, unsure what planet John is on ,  it sure how to navigate what Oscar did. I think my only relief is the kids never heard a thing as mine & johns argument took place in the utility room. If Oscar does want to wear woman underwear I’ve no problem going shopping for him, it’s just the fact it was my pants.  Me and John aren’t talking atm so maybe ATAH? ",0.4

Blake is generally bad at making friends so outside of us she didn't have many other friends. She is not meek though. Very outspoken and serious. I thought opposites attract. Blake doesn't like James' pranks but says he's perfect otherwise. She gets upset if he plays any prank on her (even something like taking a big bite of her burger is a problem for her) and she also hates it when James is playing jokes with our other friends. She accused James of flirting when all of us knew he was just having a laugh with a friend. 

About 3 weeks ago we were all hanging out at this restaurant and James decided to ""prank"" her by taking a large bite of the dessert Blake had ordered. It was a fancy expensive dish so I can understand what Blake was upset but then (imo) she really overreacted by cursing him out pretty loudly in the restaurant and called him ""cheap"" and a ""hog"". People were literally looking at us and James looked visibly embarrassed and tried to calm her down. He apologized and said he'd order her another dessert and pay for it and tried to say it wasn't a big deal. Blake kept calling him an asshole and an idiot for always being a ""joker"" and said she was embarrassed to be with him. I think that last part really hurt James but he continued to apologize and got her to sit back down and ordered her another dessert. The rest of the night was awkward and ended early. 

The next day Blake called me crying and said that James had broken up with her. 

I was sad but not surprised. James was in the wrong there but Blake really did overreact and was insulting him publicly. Blake was sad and crying when she came to my house. The next few days she tried but James didn't wanna be with her anymore and soon (as expected) many of our friends started pulling away from Blake as well. 

All of this has been very hard on Blake and yesterday Blake learned that James had gone on a date. She was obviously ranting and hurt and angry but after a while I got fed up and told her James doesn't owe her shit and she was as much at fault for the break up as he was and to just move on. Blake called me an asshole and said I was just as bad as James. She doesn't have anywhere else to go and has been locked up in her room since yesterday. She missed Dinner and breakfast too and now I'm feeling bad.

"AITA for not helping my father with the mortgage?  The deal with my father was we would move in with him and help him pay property taxes and the mortgage that he refinanced in 2020 when he got laid off. He was stupid and got a flexible interest rate. In return he would put me on the title of the home and I would be part owner. 

He dicked around with it for a year as I paid bills and refused to do the title or see the lawyer I picked out. My wife hated the situation so we left and are renting a much smaller home and no longer dealing with dad or helping him out. 

He’s now 3 months behind on the mortgage and he’s freaking out calling me saying we’ll go to the lawyers and do the title now. My wife now hates my dad because he was difficult to live with on top of all the other bullshit we dealt with. 

I told him good luck but no thanks we definitely ain’t doing that again. There’s a real chance my dad is going to lose his home and doesn’t know what to do. My other brother called and asked if I could please help my dad out one more time and I said no. I feel like it’s time my dad got to the find out phase and for a whole year we helped him and he refused in the end to follow through and we moved on.  I do not forgive him because we wasted so much money not only helping him with his mortgage but home repairs and cleaning while my dad did shit but complain. ",0.02
"AITA for not letting my family into my kid’s life?  I'm gonna try to keep this as short as possible. Almost 2 years ago, I left my husband to be with one of his friends. (I know I'm the asshole in that story). Since being with his friend most of my family cut me out of their lives due to that decision... I still have a few members who refuse to speak to me because of it. A few are on speaking terms to and a few are on good terms (I have a big family). I am now 6 months pregnant and have a few who haven't spoken to me in the last 2 years who want to be involved in my kid's life. However, they are not nice to my fiancé/baby's dad and still not very nice to me... am I the asshole for not wanting them around my kid when he's born? My mom thinks it's great they want to be involved with my kid but me and my fiancé are not happy about it nor want it to happen.

"WIBTA if I dropped out of my friends wedding due to mean girl behavior? I’ll have to start with some back story so bear with me here. I (27F) have been best friends with Ali for almost 10 years. We have been through a lot together and got into a dumb fight in January this year. Recently Ali’s fiancé reached out to my husband to see if there’s a way to have Ali and I make amends because they were getting married and wanted me involved. So I suck up my pride and reach out because I do love her and I’ve known them both since they started dating. I offer to take her to lunch to talk and celebrate and she say yes. We meet up and get a lot off our chest and honestly catch up like no time had passed. Then she pops the question “will I be her maid of honor?” She was my MOH so of course I said YES and I would be so happy to be up there to support her. That was 4 weeks ago…now onto the current dilemma, because maybe I’m being too sensitive. 

Last Nov. Ali got a new next door neighbor Gia and Gia and her husband & daughter started to come to our dinners we would have together. After my argument with Ali , Gia and her started to get closer as they were literally next door neighbors. Gia told Ali that I was being clingy towards Ali, almost staking my claim. My husband who truly is honest with me and tells me when I’m being out of pocket, said that was not at all how it went.

After I was asked to join the wedding party, I got my invite for the bridal shower which was yesterday. I show up and meet Ali’s family and Gia was really cold towards me and every time I tried to share a story or just be a part of the conversation, would talk over me and cut me out. I didn’t think much of it but throughout the day she wouldn’t stop giving me dirty side eyes. Towards the end of it Ali invite us in the wedding party to continue the party at her place. Gia reminds her that they had plans that night. So I said it’s okay I should go home and have dinner with my family as I’d been gone for 6 hours already. I get home and see that Ali had only posted photos with Gia and the other bridesmaid, even though she and I took a lot. Then they made snaps through the night, just them getting drunk and dancing in the living room (really important plans that no one else could join). With the mixed messages from Ali and just the mean girl vibes from Gia, I can’t help but feel I was  only asked to be involved so people didn’t think she didn’t have friends as she’s only known the other two for less than a year. 

There’s a lot more that I didn’t include because this is already long, but part of me feels I’m being too sensitive; the other part of me feels like I need to keep protecting my space and just let Ali go. Idk but I need some advice or someone to say snap tf out of it and don’t let Gia bother you. Thank you in advance for any sort of advice. ",0.08
"AITAH for refusing to separate laundry loads for my wife and doing laundry my way I (m33) have been together with my wife (F30) for 12 years and been living together for 5 years now. We split all chores and we decided long time ago I would do all the laundry. It's very important to note that my wife has has zero complaints over these 5 years with how the laundry is done, aside from me forgetting some things and drying them when they should be hung to dry.

I have NEVER separated any laundry. I throw it all into the washer and wash it on cold. I told my wife this when we first decided I would do the laundry and she had no issues with it.

Today my wife reminded me to separate this one shirt and do it with the delicates. I told her I don't separate the laundry and I thought she knew this. She got upset and said it would ruin her delicates and her colours would run and fade.

I asked her to give me a yes or no answer, then I asked her if any of her clothes over the last 5 years have been ruined in the wash. She kept arguing and avoiding the question until she finally said no. I then told her I would keep doing the laundry how I have been doing it because I'm not doing 4 different loads like she suggested, (Colours, lights, delicates and heavy such as towels and jeans) because we rent and I pay for all the laundry and it would triple my monthly laundry budget.

I then offered to trade chores, I would take one of hers and she could do the laundry. She got upset and said no.

My point is she has had zero issue with the laundry up until now, so why should I change it? AITAH?",0.22
"AITA for planning to meet a friend during a trip with my wife?  

Throwaway account because you know how it is. 

My wife (f36) and I (f33) live in the north of the country, and we’re traveling south for a particular event. My wife planned the 4-day trip around the event and also around my birthday which is on the second day of our trip. 

One of our mutual friends lives ~1h away from that southern city and knows about our trip. Therefore, they texted me asking if we wanted to meet up. I said yes of course (thinking my wife would not have an issue). Turns out I was wrong and she’s having BIG issues. 

She says that this was supposed to be a trip for only the two of us. Says that I’ve now shown her how much I don’t want to be with her and how little I value our time alone. And that I’m making a huge dent in our relationship by having made this plans. I offer to cancel but she said the damage is done. 

I said that the plan was always including her, I thought it could be a fun experience for all of us, just having dinner with this friend for a few hours on the first day we arrive to the city. Since I know she’s not the most social person, I did say that if she doesn’t want to join is also okay, which  is where I think I might have been the asshole. But I honestly do want her to come with us, I’ve told her many times that everything is better when she’s with me. 

I’ve been struggling a bit lately with wanting to be more social and having been married to the love of my life who’s not a very social person for the past 10 years it’s been hard on that regard. For the longest time I thought I didn’t want to be social, and I’ve never been a natural at that so I let it be. But now I recognize that I do want to be social, just need to practice I guess. We’ve talked about how I understand her not wanting to socialize but that now I understand and need to validate and prioritize my need of meeting other humans from time to time. This being a trip planned around my birthday, I thought it would be okay. 

Now we’re having this argument and we both think we’re in the right. I don’t want to involve my friends yet, so here I am. Asking you dear internet strangers, am I the asshole for wanting to have dinner with a friend during a trip with my wife?

"AITA for drinking my friend's pepsi I've(27m) recently been trying some home brew mead, been turning out pretty good, Decanted a bottle and took it to share with my friends at Anime Night. There were 3 other guys, The host, 26m, another guy 21m, and the one who travelled with me, 21m.

On the way the he bought a supply of pepsi, like, as many 2 litre bottles as a guy can carry.

So we get there, I pour everyone a glass of mead, I wasn't having because I was driving. There was still quite a good ammount left in the bottle. Ownership of the bottle, I'd say either me or the host.

So it gets to the end of the night. We've watched our last episode of, It was ""This Ugly Yet Beautiful World"" last night. As we are getting ready to leave the guy with the pepsi picks up the bottle of mead, without asking if he's allowed or offering to share with anyone else, he pours a glass, downs it, pours another glass emptying the bottle and downs that. Drinking it because it's there I guess, disrespectful, to me, the host, the other guest, the mead itself, that was a home brew mead, not cheap cider. Then holds out the bottle to me, knowing I  can use it again for more mead.

So I picked up one of his sealed pepsi bottles from the floor, open it, and drink it straight from the bottle, Downed it. Ignoring his protests.

He was pretty pissed, I told him I thought he'd be fine with it if he thought him drinking all my mead was acceptable. Threw up most of the pepsi when we got outside. Damn I  hate Pepsi. Told him, theres your pepsi on ground, probably tastes better than it did when I drank it.

"WIBTAH for potentially getting my stepdad admitted into a care home  Hey everyone.

Would I be the asshole for telling his doctors everything and getting stepdad sent to a hospital or care home.

To give a bit of context I’m a 21 year old male, live with both my mom (53) and older brother (23) and stepdad (84M)

Stepdad has been living with us for the past two years (coming on 3) now due to health complication, diabetic, kidney failure (stage 3) and multiple myeloma and some mobility issues.

So I’m the only one in the house that isn’t working full time (only part time as I’m a student) and I’ve noticed SD has very poor communication in how he acts towards me or even my mom. By constantly swearing, screaming or even hurling racist insults about anyone (to the point where he’s been attacked TWICE as a result)

Anyways, with this poor language and such. We constantly have to scold him by saying “you shouldn’t say this.”, “this is NOT appropriate.” The typical “watch your language” sort of responses. As racism and hurling it in public and then deflecting it onto myself is very very agitating as last thing I’d want is to get into harm for his own stupidity and actions.

We also was told by HIM directly that he uses disinfectant to shower near his eyes and body when he showers as “it makes me cleaner” and begins to justify his actions in which we’ve told him politely “please don’t use disinfectant it’s not for your body, it’s for the cleaning of our house. Not for cleaning your body.” He keeps saying “yeah right, fuck off. I know what’s good for me and you don’t know shit”

It’s gotten to a point where he constantly now uses it and even if we hide it, put it far out of reach.. he will go out of his way to search for it.. and I’ve told his doctors in a one off conversation and they told me “we can’t say anything as he seems to be in a right sense of mind” but I’m thinking “he’s definitely not in the right state of mind if he’s doing that” as that isn’t “healthy thinking behaviour” 

He then tries to get very physical to the point where he’s throwing things cause “we’re not letting him do what he wants.” Which I don’t understand cause the only things we’re enforcing is common sense and it’s safety. Like “don’t wash yourself up with floor cleaner”, “don’t use cleaning chemicals near your eyes or body” very trivial/straight forward things..

So I’m wondering WIBTA. Considering we’re in the midst of moving and obviously him living with us. And telling his doctor about all of this and potentially putting him into a care home/hospital 

Side note: as his finances are separate from my mom’s (not combined) we need some of his money to work on the new place we’re moving to also.

"AITAH for needing headphones? I (17 F) am on the autism spectrum. I was diagnosed at eleven, and mostly have sensory/ social needs. I‘m really sensitive to mouth noises, mostly chewing and stuff like that. 

Because of this, I often use headphones to block it out. I have this one pair of noise canceling headphones that work really well, but they make it extremely hard to hear, especially if other people are talking to me. I also use headphones to block out other sound, since I’m really sensitive to nose blowing, sniffling, finger tapping, and other things. I will also mention that my house is very loud, since I have two younger siblings (9 M, 3 F) and my father (40- something M) is very, very noisy. 

Now, onto the main thing. Lately, my dad has been complaining about me wearing headphones. It’s really hard for me to hear when I am wearing them, and he keeps insisting that I take them off so we can have a proper conversation. Also, he’s been making comments whenever my brother tries to talk with me while I’m wearing the headphones, saying stuff like “Don’t bother, she’s wearing headphones so she will ignore you,” or other things similar. Also, if I don’t have headphones and cover my ears instead, he always gets mad, so in general, he just doesn’t like me covering my ears in general. 

It’s really getting on my nerves, but I can’t help but feel guilty every time he says something about them. I feel like I might be acting dramatic. Sorry if this ended up as sort of a rant/ overload, I just felt I needed to give all the details. 

TLDR, I wear headphones to cancel noise, my dad doesn’t like it. ",0.08
"AITA for standing my ground and not letting my suite-mate take my dorm room? For context: Our college randomly assigns suites and rooms to students that apply for dorming. It is not chosen by the students, only the buildings and who they wish to room with. I (19y/o male) am moving to college in the fall. I am in the process of getting to know my suite-mates and roommate since I chose to do random assignment because I had applied late to college and everyone already chose roommates I had to go with first bed open. After I had been assigned a room my actual roommate added me and we began talking. However, he soon blocked me and I could no longer contact him. A week after this happened my suite-mates got in contact with me. They added me and we talked. They then asked me if I happened to know my roommate since he was the only one they hadn’t talked with yet. I said yes but after we talked a bit he blocked me. We then all had the assumption that he would no longer be dorming with us hence the need to block me on instagram. So after much discussion thats the best answer we could come up with as to why he did so. I thought that was the end of that discussion but it seems I would be wrong. One of my suite-mates, lets name him Phineas, would later tell us that we should vote on who got the room. I being confused asked him why since I got the room fair and square by it being assigned to me. He said that he wasn’t aware that the rooms were assigned and that even if they were, we should vote on who gets it anyways since he wanted it. I told him no for a second time and wanted to be over with it. He then told me that he had a girlfriend and that I could understand right? No. I get that shes going to visit every now and then and that it would be nice to have some privacy, especially if they were going to do spicy things, but I already told him that I wanted the room since it was assigned to me and that if he wanted a single he should’ve booked a single. He keeps pushing the matter when I shut him down every time. I told him that if he continues to talk about it, I would go to RA and get in contact with the school about the whole situation and how Phineas wanted to violate explicit rules and guidelines of living in the dorms. For more context: our college does not allow the opposite sex to enter the bedrooms of the student and may only stay in the common area with the suite door open to the hallway. This was a strict rule that even adheres to parents and family. The guy called me a dick and said that I don’t even need it since I am single and would never understand it. My other suite-mate, gonna name him Ferb for the memes, thinks we should see who needs the room more and give it to them. I think that it rightfully belongs to me since I was assigned the room and bed and that if I got so lucky that I didn’t have a roommate anymore than that was my luck and not theirs.

"AITA for getting frustrated with my fiance after a lengthy installation of laundry appliances… What started as being a simple installation of a new washer and dryer quickly devolved into numerous visits to Home Depot, other houses for tools etc when we discovered a copper pipe had issues during the removal of previous appliances. I have minimal background in doing things like this and asked for my father to help. We both got stumped on several parts along the way and ended up having to return items which weren’t compatible with the washer and the piping system. 

Ultimately about 3 and a half hours later, and learning how to solder (new foundational understanding of a skill achieved!) we got it hooked and up and running. My fiance put a fresh load into the washer to test it out and the first thing she said was “well that’s unfortunate!” I asked what’s wrong, thinking there was another issue or I’d messed up the installation some other way, but instead she said something akin to “with this washer it’s going to take like triple the time per load”. 

I was pretty frustrated given the loops and hurtles I had to jump through to set this up, but instead of getting mad I just walked off and said “I’m going to jump in the shower”.

I went upstairs and she came in and sort of gave me a look, so I said “listen, after all of the hurdles and getting two brand new appliances, that’s the first thing you say? Really?” And she responded with “that’s unfair -“ and then I just said “I don’t want to argue or get into this, that’s why I just went to go shower”. She then stormed off and is clearly agitated. I feel like if she said that maybe in a couple days I’d be fine, but today’s process was understandably not as straight forward as it should have been - and therefore frustrating, so when it’s literally the first thing she said - yeah I was bothered.

"AITA for how I reacted to my wife's news? Last night, my(38M) wife(36F) told me how, after she weighed herself yesterday morning, she saw she'd gained 24 pounds since May and now's 188lb(5'6).

Obviously over those months, she saw and knew she was putting on weight, I knew and saw too, but I never wanted to open that potential can of worms.

When she told me, my first instinct was to just not go over the top. I asked her how she felt. She said she felt fine but also notices that things like her clothes are starting to tighten.

When I responded that that doesn't sound like she's fine and that sounded like an issue, she told me to relax. I asked her, since she brought it up, what her plans were for her clothes, she told me not to worry and that there's always a bigger size.

My response was that that's not a great attitude because then the case just becomes "" I'll just buy bigger, get bigger, buy bigger"".

She tried to make it about me only loving her for her looks and my love being conditional. I told her that wasn't the case and that all I was doing was responding to her news. She called me a liar. I gave up and told her to just do whatever she wants. She thanked me sarcastically for being a jerk.

"AITA for not allowing my partner's sister's baby in the wedding? For personal reasons I will not be adding sex or gender or age as people involved don't identify and I don't want to get in trouble with them.  

So for some context I am a infant teacher. I am around children for 10-12 hours a day. My partner is not around children much and is very uncomfortable with them especially very young children. 

My partner and I agreed on having a wedding with 21+ in attendance. We have told our guest that we aren't having anyone in or around the wedding who is underage (both families are heavy drinkers and some are know for 🍃 use and I don't feel comfortable with a kid being exposed to that). We also agreed to this because of the budget we set and the amount of people we would want in attendance. 

Now my partner is considering having the baby in the wedding after we had a family meet up and the sister became upset that the wedding is 21+. I may sound like a villain but I work all day with kids. That's the last thing I would want at the wedding. I'm not jealous of the child I'm more so worried about the activities that would be going on around the child and as a mandated reporter I don't want to be put in a bad situation. Plus we already told others that they can't bring their children and now we allow one? What should I do?? AITA for not wanting this??

Edit: I came back on to verify some things. 

1. The parents are both very young (fresh out of college) and are known for getting out of hand at parties. They are both know for drinking and 🍃 usage. This is their first kid and as far as I know the dad is still doing both heavily. They are also known for pushing all of their issues on others and not taking responsibility. I'm afraid that the baby will be pushed off.

2. The baby will be 7 to 8 months old when the wedding comes around. 

3. The state where we reside is a legalize state however it is considered neglectful if a child is brought into this type of situation. I brought up the mandated reporter because I do not feel comfortable having children around these types of things, hence why we agreed on 21+. And if you are a reporter you should then know that if anything is suspicious or neglectful you can report it- not just abuse. 

4. We did offer to pay for a sitter for the baby as well and they told us no. So we did try an alternative instead of them bringing the baby to the wedding. And it wouldn't of been a stranger for sitting. We have cousins/relatives who are 19-20 who also work in childcare and I did offer each of them $20 an hour to watch the baby.

5. The wedding is only 1/2 a day long. Not a whole weekend or three day venture. ",0.12
"AITA for having to ask my gf who she is talking about? Just recently, my girlfriend received news from her friends that one of her old managers who she considered a good friend passed away. She sent me the screenshot of her friend’s text that informed her of his death. In the screenshot though, there was no mention of her managers name. Only references to “him”. 

I asked her to clarify by name who it was that died and she was immediately upset at me, telling me I don’t ever pay attention and never know anything. It turns out though, that she forgot to capture his name in the screen shot and she even acknowledged this, but persisted that I should’ve known who she was talking about regardless, and grew even more angry when I didn’t apologize. 

Maybe it’s worth noting that of all her managers from her previous jobs, this one was by far her favorite. However, she has had other managers in the past that she liked, even if only a little. And I figured that even if it happened to be one of them, she would still be upset at the news. And so, to me at least, asking for clarification doesn’t mean I don’t pay attention. AITA?

"AITA for telling off my dad when he didn't call my daughter So for some back story: my dad has a history of not being the greatest. He makes poor decisions, has no social skills and just generally causes problems. Recently his life choices have caused some issues financially, and contact has been almost non existent(it's mid August, I haven't heard from him since the end of June.). 
My daughters 6th birthday was yesterday, and my dad didn't call her, didn't acknowledge it at all. She is his only grandchild, and he's not getting any more. I don't care about a gift. I care that my six year old asked me when her papa was going to call and he never did. 
When I had a moment without my daughter today I called him and asked wtf he was doing that he couldn't take 5 minutes to call his granddaughter. He told me he just ""forgot to do it"". I told him this was the final straw. I had given him a lot of chances and he's managed to screw up and disappoint every time. 
He fired back and told me if I thought it was important than I should have called HIM and had him talk to her. I said it wasn't the point, I was mad he didn't take the effort to call her when he was off work and it was her birthday. I told him that as her grandparent he should want to be involved and I wasn't going to force her relationship with him if all he's going to do it let her down. I told him we would take a break from talking to him, and he can decide if he wants to be a grandparent or not, and hung up the phone. 
So am I the asshole for telling my dad off?


Edit for clarity: my kid asked me about him calling because she had just gotten off the phone with her other grandpa, and it was still only 8:30 in the morning. I told her I didn't know but I was sure he would call her. She didn't bring it back up the rest of the day.
Also for clarity my dad has backed out of things with her before, and left her disappointed on more than one occasion.

"AITA for not watching Deadpool 3 with my boyfriend Edit 3: I feel like I need to add some clarification for the people saying I should just go and answer questions he has - I had to pause episode 1 of Loki last week to explain the “blue cube” to him, which is in plenty of movies he’s seen, in the first 2 minutes of the show. And then I had to hear him complain because he hasn’t seen infinity wars or endgame, but they’re kind of referenced in this too, he was like “see this is why i didn’t watch to watch this, I haven’t seen that part” even though I’ve tried to watch them many times and they’ve been out for years. I know how he is, I don’t “not like him” but I’d rather not stop every time something is spoiled or he has a question since I’d be watching it for the first time too. 



I can’t even believe this is a problem but my boyfriend randomly brought up going to see Deadpool 3 this week since it’s out of theatres after Wednesday.  He’s never seen 1 and 2 but I have. I basically said “sure we’d have to watch 1 and 2 this week” which he said he doesn’t want to. I have no desire to sit in a movie theatre with someone who has no idea what’s going on so I said I don’t want to go, which he’s annoyed about now. He said that he heard it’s a good movie and he doesn’t care that he doesn’t know what’s going on. I don’t want to have to answer questions and if anything comes up in the movie that relates to 1 or 2 I can’t even talk about it since he has no idea what’s going on at all. That doesn’t seem like a fun time and I don’t feel like going to a movie theatre when I could just watch it alone in bed, I’d basically be watching it alone anyway. It’s the same thing if someone wanted to read book 3 of a series without 1 and 2, that makes no sense to me if you have no idea what led up to that. I told him to go himself then, I don’t want to waste a trip to the movie theatre for this. 
He thinks I’m an asshole and it’s not normal to think this way and I just don’t even know why it’s an issue to begin with. I feel like it’s probably pretty common so I figured I’d see how Reddit felt. 

Edit: I feel like I need to clarify the fact the he wants to go because his friends keep telling him about it, not for me. I’ve been asking him to watch marvel movies with me for years, specifically the ones that already are out so he can catch up and he never does. It’s quite literally only because his friends keep mentioning it. 

Edit 2: based on the comments, it doesn’t really seem like 1 and 2 are necessary so I’ll just go see it with him. Also, love the “gatekeeping” comments. I haven’t seen this movie yet and I was waiting for him to catch up anyway (with 1 and 2 which obviously isn’t needed). I’ve been trying to get him into marvel for years. ",0.28
"AITA for being disappointed with my 18th birthday gift? So, i just recently had my birthday and became an adult and , of course , i honestly didnt really think about gifts, i was more excited about just the thought of being 18 and my birthday party, although i obviously was looking forward to also seeing what my parents got for me. And ngl im kinda.. disappointed. I feel so shitty about not feeling satisfied and grateful for it because i realize its such a privilege to even get a gift at all but i cant lie , when i just found 50 euros and a cheap lip balm on my bedside table with not even a birthday card i was kinda sad. Yes obviously 50€ isnt little money but i was just kinda sad also about how little effort there was :( after speaking with my mom (i just thanked for the gift, didnt say i was kinda disappointed obviously, im not *that* ungrateful lol) she told me she just thought i wouldve hated anything she wouldve gifted so she just went for money.But honestly im just kinda disappointed at how she didnt even bother to look into what i liked or needed ;( Especially since for her 18th birthday my older sister got a 100€ watch and a few pretty bracelets.
So.. AITA? i feel so incredibly spoiled even just writing this out but i honestly just wanted to get this off my chest ",0.05
"AITA for Reporting My Younger Cousin’s Behavior at a Family Party? I'm a 16-year-old who recently attended a family party at my grandma’s apartment. The event was crowded, and I was uncomfortable, so I decided to stay in my younger cousin Lina's room to avoid the crowd. Lina, who is 5 years old, was not in her room when I initially went there.



Later, Lina returned to her room where I was using my tablet. A few hours into the evening, Lina started invading my personal space. She put her face on my chest and kept her mouth open, which made me very uncomfortable. I asked her several times to stop, but she continued. Eventually, I left the room to escape the situation.



I later told my mom about what happened. She informed my grandma, who then scolded Lina for not respecting my boundaries. My grandma made it clear that Lina's behavior was inappropriate and that she needed to understand personal space.



Now, I'm questioning if I was wrong for reporting Lina’s behavior. Was it inappropriate of me to involve my family, or was it justified given the circumstances?",0.08
"AITA for hiding from my fiancé that I went on a date with his brother before we started dating? I (28F) have been with my fiancé (27M) for four years, and we’ve been engaged for the last six months. We’re very much in love, but something recently came up that’s causing major tension between us. Before I started dating my fiancé, I briefly had a crush on his older brother (30M). We only went on one date and quickly realized we were better as friends.

With time I got over the crush on his brother because I realized I had genuine feelings for my fiancé. We started dating, and I’ve never looked back. Everything was going great until a couple of days ago, when this somehow came up in conversation during a friend's dinner. His brother and some friends were joking about how he used to date a lot of girls when he was younger, and someone mentioned that I was one of them. It was said in a light-hearted way, my fiancé ignored it but I noticed that his attitude during the dinner changed after that.

Later that night, he confronted me about it and asked why I never told him. I explained that it wasn’t relevant since it was before we star dating, and I didn’t want to bring it up because it didn’t mean anything. However, he’s still really hurt, and here’s where things get complicated. Growing up, they were the typical popular older brother and nerdy younger brother. He said that a lot of the girls he liked in high school and college preferred his brother over him, and he always felt overshadowed. He admitted that he’s insecure about it and feels like I ""Settled with him.""

I feel terrible because I never wanted him to feel like this, but at the same time, I don’t think I did anything wrong by not telling him about a meaningless crush I had years ago. Now he’s been distant and closed, and I’m worried that this is going to impact our relationship.",0.96
"AITA for telling my wife she has to take care of her chores? My wife (29f) and I (30m) have been married for 3 years and things have for the most part been pretty great, we’ve had our arguments like any other couple but nothing serious.

3 months ago my wife told me she wants to dropout of her grad program and just go back to working. I was supportive and told her I’ll support whatever decision she makes. She did end up deciding to drop out and began applying for jobs. She has had a few interviews in the past few months but unfortunately nothing has really panned out. It’s not her fault, just a tough job market in our area. Over the past few weeks she’s started to slack on her household chores. For reference, I cook, do the landscaping, take out the trash, and we do laundry together. She handles everything else mopping,sweeping, dishes, and just overall upkeep of the houses cleanliness. 

We have a dog that sheds like crazy so sweeping/vacuuming is really important. Mid July I noticed that the floors hadn’t been vacuumed in a while so I took it upon myself to pull out the vacuum and just vacuum the house. She noticed and said she’s sorry she’s just been busy and she’ll get around to “deep cleaning the house” I told her it was no big deal.

The other day I walked into the house after work and noticed a horrible odor, I made a comment about it and said it’s possibly coming from the huge stack of dishes that need to be done. She said she’ll get to them eventually she’s just been really busy. So I ended up doing the dishes because the odor was in fact from there and I can’t stand bad odors. After I finished I looked at my wife and said “Could you possibly start contributing to the chores, you’ve been talking about deep cleaning for a while but haven’t really done anything other than lounge around” this really seemed to upset her, she stormed off into the guest bedroom and slammed the door shut and hasn’t talked to me since. 

I understand I may have come off as rude but it’s been frustrating considering she’s been at home doing nothing. So AITA?


Edit/info:
A lot of people have asked about the division of chores. It has always been like this. When we first got married my wife had a full time remote position. It was really an ideal job, it didn’t require much of her time and that’s why she was able to handle all the other household tasks while I was at work. When she began her grad program she went to class twice a week and I volunteered to her help her out but she said “I left streaks when I mop” so she wanted everything to stay the same. 

Also, I feel a need to defend the landscaping lol we live in FL on half an acre. Yes it’s not a lot of land but grass and weeds grow like crazy, so although it is not a daily chore, it is a weekly chore that takes me about 3-4 hours just depending. The heat is also not a great addition.

Finally, I feel like I may have posted this because I had a feeling it could be depression I just needed others to reiterate it. After reading the comments I think it’s time to have a discussion. I’ll try to find the best way to broach the subject, if anyone has any suggestions on how to proceed with that, it would be greatly appreciated.",0.13
"AITA for telling my girlfriend to cook normal food at the house? I 26M have been dating Sara for 7 months. She recently moved in with me and it been great so far. I earn 2x more than her so I pay most the rent and groceries and Sara pays bills.

She loves cooking, and does all the cooking. I work long hours so I am not at home much so before her I mainly had takeout and instant ramen. She can cook, but likes experimenting more. She’s started to make all our meals as vegan as possible. I am neutral about vegan food, and can stand lots vegan foods,  but she veganised pizza, and made it on a vegetable base instead of dough and the cheese was weird.

"AITA for being mad my family won’t spend money on me (21) Yes, I know I sound insufferable. But I’m a first generation college student going to school across the country. I worked for three years of high school and took a gap year during covid where I worked full time. I’ve continued to work every summer since. My first two years I was doing fine, but now I have substantially more bills and virtually no help from my family. I plan on getting a part time job for this school year, but I’m worried I won’t be able to keep up. I rarely ask for money, to the point where last year all I ate one week was 3 easy macs, a can of soup, and an expired protein bar. My mom helps with my bills but is otherwise maxed out, my dad has the attitude the I’m an adult and I have to figure it out myself, and my sister will sometimes send me money but then make a huge deal out of it. I just get upset seeing my family blow their money on useless shit when I just need 20 bucks for groceries. I hate asking for handouts but I feel as though I’m getting more and more resentful.

"AITA for ‘claiming to have supernatural powers’?  I [20m] ocassionally have very vivid dreams that reflect things that end up happening: having very vivid dreams that end up playing out in real life exactly like they did in my dream, or dreaming about people I haven't spoken to in a while only for them to reappear soon after. Stuff like that. 

Recently there's been a case where I've been dreaming of a few people in my life that I haven't spoken to in a long time, all of a sudden, and soon after those dreams started two of them reached out to me. 

I was telling this to a few of my friends, and one of them contronted me and said I was 'misleading' my friends by 'claiming to have supernatural powers' and being able to see the future.

I pointed out that I said no such thing. What I did say is I reasonably often have vivid dreams that reflect things that then happen in real life, and dream of people often right before they return into my life. Both of those things are just factually true, I'm not claiming to know *why*. Maybe it's a series of coincidences, maybe it is actual supernatural powers, I don't have a clue and I don't pretend to.

"AITA for telling my daughter she doesn't have to give up her headbands if she doesn't want to?  I (34F) have a daughter, whom we'll call Olivia. Olivia is in first grade. She has this classmate, whom we'll call Jake. Jake is developmentally delayed, and completely non-verbal. They were in the same kindergarten class, but the classroom set-up was different so I don't think they interacted much - but things are different this year.


This year, he's taken an interest in Olivia's headbands. He doesn't pull hair or anything, he just likes to pat the bow part during carpet time I guess. And surprisingly, she doesn't mind at all. Recently, he was having a ""bad day"" (her words, not mine) so my daughter gave him her headband. The para kept asking her if she was sure about it, and she insisted on giving it to Jake. He was extremely happy about it, and now carries around the headband as a comfort thing. 


I told Olivia that what she did was very kind, but she doesn't have to give him anything else, if she doesn't want to. My husband is unhappy with what I told her. He thinks that ""Olivia has plenty of headbands, she could spare a few to make this kid happy"" and that we need to be ""teaching her to not be selfish"".

"AITA For Buying A Lockable Storage Box To Prevent My Dad From Taking My Food? Hi everyone. I am a 22F college student in CA and i live at home with my parents 58M and 56F. 

For some context: 
I work a small part time job where I only work ~ 12-15 hours/week and as a result, only make around $9k a year. In other words, I’m still very much financially dependent on my parents. My dad in particular pays for my gas (~ $55/month), car insurance (~ $160/month), and has helped me previously with any leftover college tuition my student loans wouldn’t cover ($700-$200 per semester). 
I’m also obese (5’1 tall, 215 lbs) and even more important than exercise to lose weight is controlling my diet. And I hate cooking so I prefer to meal prep a weeks worth of food at a time (~ 10 meals).

The issue: 
A handful of times, my dad has taken one of my meal prepped meals for himself to take to work. And it really gets on my nerves. I work very hard to meal prep. I have to find low calorie recipes, find the actual calories by inputting all the ingredients into the myfitnesspal app, do the shopping, cooking (I’m an incredibly slow cook, so this takes me at least 4 hours weekly), rewashing the meal prep containers (bc apparently I’m the only one in the family that cares to deep clean them), and weighing out the food into equal servings. And I do all this for my weight loss/health/convenience of having a meal ready to eat when I come home from work. 

That being said, it’s really irritating to me when my dad just takes one of my meal prepped meals for himself without asking or anything. He did so again recently so I finally pulled the trigger and bought a lockable food storage box to put my meals in in the fridge. My mom has gotten upset with me saying that after all he does for me, which is indeed a lot, I could be so cold and rash. My opinion is that he should at least have the common courtesy to ask for permission. My parents argue that everything in the house is for everyone to use. I think that’s a BS argument because I’ve never taken anyone else’s lunch food they prepped without asking permission. I’d like the courtesy I’ve given others to be extended to me. 
No matter which way I’ve explained my irritation and reasoning to buying the lockable food storage box, my mom thinks I’m being selfish. And I admit that I am a bit selfish, but sometimes you have to be selfish in order to prioritize your well being as an obese person. I haven’t made any remarks to my dad nor has he made any remarks towards me about the lockable food storage box. But I am afraid that he will retaliate and stop paying for my gas and car insurance. In which case, I’ll just buy an E Bike on my credit card and make payments since I just drive in town and I’ll be able to get financial independence after I graduate this semester.

"WIBTA if I move my daughter's room when she moves away for college Background - My husband and I have lived together for 11 years. We have three children, two daughters Anna (F21) and Beth (F18) from his first marriage and Charlie (M14) from my first marriage. We have lived in the same house for those 11 years. Due to their mother's mental health, the girl have lived full time with us since Anna was in the middle of the 6th grade. We gave Anna first pick of rooms and she chose the largest (non-master) room in the house that is in the basement. Beth took the other large room in the basement. This left Charlie with a small room upstairs. I thought I made it clear to the house that as they left for college their rooms would be up for grab. They would always have a room in my house, just not guaranteeing it would be the one they currently occuplied.

Anna moved into campus housing her sophmore year in college. She attends a local university but lives on campus. When she did I moved my office down to her room. I work from home and the dogs were driving me crazy upstairs, barking at everyone that walked past our busy street. Before I moved furniture, I asked Beth if she wanted the large room. She declined so I took over.

Later on Beth asked if we could paint her room and I agreed. I did ask that she pick a gender neutral color so that I wouldn't have to repaint in case Charlie moved downstairs.

Here comes where I might be the asshole ... Beth is getting ready to move out to college, 2.5 hours away. And she is upset/mad that she is ""losing her room"". Charlie has asked to move to the basement as that room, particularly the closet, is a bit larger and he will have more space to store his stuff than his currently cramped room. For reference, Charlie has a twin bed, desk and bookshelf but no dresser as there isn't space to put one.

"AITA for not telling my friend he wasn't able to move in? I (22M) am starting grad school next week, and am moving into my apartment by campus later this week. My friend/roommate (23M) came up to Massachusetts to move in early, as he was going to a concert in Boston tonight. He had said he was moving in today (Sunday), but the thing is that I had emailed our school's housing department, and they told me that graduate students could only move in on weekdays. I didn't tell him this, I think because my brain just filled in that he would be going up to Mass on Sunday, and would stay in a hotel that night. However, he texted me today at around 4:30 PM saying that he couldn't move in. I called him back and let him know that move-in was only on weekdays. I apologized for not telling him, and he said, ""you could've told me that a lot earlier.""

I felt bad about it, but my dad told me it wasn't my fault, as he should've known better than to move in at 5 PM on a Sunday. Also, the only reason I knew about the ""only move in on weekdays"" thing is because I'd asked housing about it. To my knowledge, they never publicly shared that. So, clearly they communicated poorly. Still, I feel a bit bad for not telling him, so was I the asshole?",0.92
"AITA for Letting My Son Leave with His Mom After a Fight Over a Game? 

My ex-girlfriend and I were together for about a year and a half, and she was always a bit of a mystery to me. She’s tall, stunningly beautiful, and always dressed so perfectly that she looked like she belonged on a runway. But what stood out the most was how she rarely showed any emotion. She kept the same calm, unreadable expression no matter what, and it was nearly impossible to tell what was going on in her head. Even now, years after we broke up, I still find her incredibly gorgeous.

Our relationship ended shortly after our son was born. She told me she was asexual and had only been with me because she wanted a child. It broke me at the time, realizing that our whole relationship was just a means to an end for her. Since then, I don’t think she’s dated anyone else. We share custody of our son, but she has him most of the time, and he’s basically a younger, male version of her. He’s tall, handsome, and has that same cool, collected demeanor. Just like his mom, he’s hard to read and doesn’t show much emotion.

I’ve moved on and am now remarried with stepchildren. When my wife first met my son, even she couldn’t help but comment on how cute he was, and I was hopeful that they’d all get along. But my son has always struggled to connect with them.

Last night, things blew up over something that feels so trivial now. My son was playing a game, and my stepkids wanted to join in. He refused to share, and I stepped in, telling him that he had to share. That’s when he snapped. He flat-out said, “No,” and then called my stepkids “hideous,” saying they were nothing compared to him and his mom.

Before I could even try to defuse the situation, my son stormed off and called his mom. Within the hour, she was at our doorstep. As always, she looked incredible—perfectly dressed with that same unreadable expression. She didn’t waste any time; she walked in, and before I could even explain, she told me I’d blown things out of proportion and that she was taking our son back with her.

I tried to argue, but she just looked at me like I was the one who’d made a mess of everything. She’s always had a way of making me feel like I’m in the wrong, no matter what. My son packed up his things and left without saying a word to anyone. My wife, who was initially upset, said it was all my fault for making such a big deal over a game.

"AITAH for going to a ""party"" without my boyfriend because he wasn't invited? I was invited to a ""party"", I say in quotes  because it was simply a gathering with food among friends, friends that I have known for 7-10 years before we head off to college. My boyfriend is not part of this friend group and doesn't like one specific guy who is attending. We have already discussed this guy and how I will not interact with him no matter what. He was still very adamant about me not going but I went anyways because I do not know the next time I will be able to see my friends. 
Prior to attending he asked me to not do a certain thing that I would rather not disclose, but it is something that I have done before I go for the past 7 years. And if I did do that thing, it would mean that I intent to cheat on him.
In the duration of the party, he is constantly blowing up my phone, asking who's there, who I'm next to, what I'm doing, who I'm talking to, stalking my location and calls when I don't answer for a little bit. 

He continued to say how I shouldn't have gone since we both weren't invited and there was another couple at the party so it's unfair. Even though we do not share the same friend group, there are some people he knows attending, I said it's ultimately up to the host and that was his decision, he blames it on the one guy who he does not like influencing the rest of the group.

"AITA for dumping him because he didn't acknowledge me as his gf? I was dating this guy intensely for 4 months. He took my virginity, we had sex 2 times in that time (for me the pace was slow because I was cautious) & he knew I was a virgin. He introduced me to his friends & said he was exclusive but never made me his official gf. We're both 20. I didn't want him to go on a 2 week annual holiday with his friends without me where they wanted to drink & go to a club because he mentioned he would be open to a threesome before (on early dates) so I couldn't trust him. He dropped the 3some topic & apologized after I told him how I felt about it. I also thought he was gay because of that threesome suggestion but we talked it out & he said he was straight. 


In an argument I called myself his gf but he corrected me & said 'you're not my gf'. He was like 'we haven't had that discussion' and 'we're not together yet'. He gave me reasons why he hasn't made it official such as me not trusting him or not messaging/calling/seeing him enough. He said I was controlling. He added for him it was too soon for love & that he needed more time for it. At the same time he talked about the potential for marriage. He said 'even if you were my wife there'll be trips where I go only with my friends & noone takes their gfs'. 


I didn't want to beg for a title & decided to end things with him because I was hurt by his words, but just wanna know why a guy would act like this. It was confusing. Was he genuinely into me & wanted something serious but I scared him off or was he not into me enough & didn't really care/mostly wanted sex?

"AITA for going to my boyfriend house and not really feeling sorry about it? To preface, my boyfriend and i got into a huge argument. I had asked him why he was still following this girl on instagram whom i felt very uncomfortable with. The girl and her friends were making videos on tiktok dissing me and they would send me random weird messages on instagram. The girl had also asked him to go to a dance event for the club they are both in, to which i didnt even know she asked him personally till weeks after the event happened. He explained that he cant cut her off because she is part of his friend group and that they are in the same major at school. I got angry because it didn't make sense to me as i was simply asking him to remove her as i felt uncomfortable. (This was her ""spam"" account he was following/she was following him with, i only asked he unfollowed her ""spam"" account, not her main, cause yeah i understand the whole thing about her being part of his friend group).

Our argument spiraled and it got even more tense. In the midst of it i asked him if he could pick me up from somewhere as i didnt have my car and i wasnt up to be where i was anymore. He had said something along the lines of ""why would i pick you up"". At the moment i was annoyed and angry so l had replied saying one of my guy friends can pick me up instead. I followed up by saying it wasnt actually true. I said this to spite him and make him angry. I know this was out of pocket and wrong for me to say. My anger doesn't justify it. Due to me saying this he accused me of cheating and blocked me on everything. He continued to tell my friends, my family, and his friends that i cheated on him. He did not let me contact him for days and would constantly tell my friends/family that i was a h*e. I personally do not feel like i cheated, i definitely agree it was disrespectful and not my place to say something like that.

A couple days after, I went to his house and rang the doorbell a few times. I then knocked on the door. His mom and dad came out the house to which i told them that i needed to speak to his son. They kept on saying he didnt want to talk. They went back inside for a few minutes then came outside telling me i should leave. I told them that i needed to talk to him as he was continuously messaging my family and friends but he would not let me speak to him. I was under the impression that he would basically never speak to me again.

He proceeds to tell me days later that i ruined the whole relationship due to me cheating and due to me making his parents hate me. And for a little backstory, his dad was never a fan of me from the start. His dad would constantly tell my boyfriend to find other girls or to go on dating apps. His dad never had respect for me.

To add: my boyfriend told me that when i came to his house, he told his parents to not interact with me as i was crazy.

After the movie I told him I had to use the restroom. When I got out, I walked outside (he usually waits out by the entrance. 
But he wasn’t there. I waited a few minutes, but I couldn’t call him, and he had the car key. I tried walking to the car, but he wasn’t there. I went back in and checked near the men’s restroom, but nothing. After about ten minutes I got pretty upset. I tried to keep myself in view of the theater while I walked around it, but he wasn’t anywhere. Some strangers even offered to get me an Uber. 

Finally I went in and checked one more time, and he was sitting on a couch looking at his phone. I told him I’d been looking for him, but I wasn’t blaming about it, but he got super defensive and told me it was my fault for not seeing him and I had no reason to be upset. He kept saying “I don’t understand why you’re so upset” on the car ride back.

When I tried to tell him that I wanted us to “be more in sync with each other” (especially since we’re going on a trip out of the country soon) he scoffed and said, “do I need to tell you where I’m going to be whenever we are separate?” Which felt unfair- I didn’t have my phone.

"AITA - gym sweat cleaning fails  TLDR: I sweat A LOT but I thoroughly clean up after myself at the gym.  Another person sweats a lot, drinking lots of water and only pretending to clean up after. And seems to be stalking me and getting on the equipment before me no matter when I switch my time to so I asked them to clean up properly afterwards and now the gym staff, which ignored my complaints, is threatening to cancel my membership.

AITA for calling out another heavy sweater at the gym?

I am a big boy and Im trying to get into shape and i sweat .  .  .  A LOT.

Physical injuries and emotional issues  make going to a gym difficult so I try to go when the rest of the world is busy. I have to use machines bc of physical handicaps.

Another heavy sweater seems to be trying to get there just before me and use the same equipment.  This is not a big deal with two exceptions.

1. The only recumbent stationary i can use has a lake under and all over it after they are done.

2. They make no real effort to clean up after.

As a result, the floor under the stationary stays sopping wet all day after they are done until second shift staff quickly mops around it. And it stinks horribly.

Making it worse, this person drinks at least a half gallon of water during their workout, increasing the sweat output.

I always carry extra towels with me plus I use the gym supplied sprays and paper towels to clean equipment after I use it.  Especially the stationary.  And I use the gym supplied mop to remove any sweat from around. I even regularly donate cases of cleaning supplies, including odoban, to the gym, and before this have never complained about anything 

On multiple occasions, I have tried changing my gym time to different times, but it doesn’t take long before this person seems to find me and starts showing up just early enough to get on the equipment first and pouring out sweat everywhere with only a pretend wipe down after done.

I have approached the staff and have been rebuffed.  Finally I asked the person to please clean up after themselves and stop leaving a lake. And they got offended, claiming they have a condition.  To which I responded so do I but I don’t force others to swim in the after math.  Now the gym staff is threatening to cancel my gym membership.

"WIBTA if I didn't attend my ex-MIL's funeral to go fishing? Context: I got separated in the fall of 2023 from my wife. Divorce is pending. I have little hope of reconciliation at this point. A major point of friction in my relationship was my ex- MIL. She was an alcoholic, and was abusive towards pretty much everybody around her. I didn't want to put up with it, but my ex wanted me to keep the peace. It strained our relationship, and while it wasn't the only cause for the divorce , it certainly was a major factor.  We have two kids aged 5 and 3. They are too young to grasp what happened.

Anyways, a couple of weeks ago I booked a end of season fishing trip with my dad for a few days. Made arrangements at work to get off. I didn't let my ex know because it was entirely on my days without the kids. We paid a 400$ deposit, while not a significant amount, I don't have that kind of money sitting around to be thrownaway.

A couple of weeks after booking that, my ex-MIL is dead. Her liver gave out. The funeral is on a friday afternoon and would make me miss the first day of the fishing trip. I am thinking of not attending. WIBTA?",0.22
"WIBTA to partially side with my MIL comments on my partner and their behaviour? Hi all, I'm looking for advices, plus English is not my first language so please forgive my mistakes. Sorry for the long post

I (30f) am in a long distance relationship with my BF (38m). The issue is his mum and his behaviour. She constantly criticise him, always telling him he is not enough etc and instead of reacting he cries. At the same time she lives over his money because she is retired and her retirement money are not enough. The economical situation in his country is not good, and despite not struggling they are not rich, they simply make the ends meet. Now he is constantly wanting revenge over his country and he is always dreaming about ""when I will be rich"", ""I'll show them what I can do because the government here doesn't appreciate me"" etc., but in reality nothing has changed since we started the relationship. I feel he is more a dreamer honestly. On the other side I am more ""on the Earth"", I work hard, I got a degree in medical research and a PhD, plus good work offers, while he is a personal trainer in his on gym and for a small volleyball team. On this note, his mum keeps on telling him he is not enough for me and putting him down. He wanted to write a book about our love, he made me read some chapters and they are not good to be published, as also his editor friend told him, so now he decided to study English and my native language, five months after still no improvement on that side either, we are still speaking in his native language and he cannot say a single word in either language. He told me he received a good job offer in another country but he doesn't know if to accept because he cannot leave his mum behind because she is old and cannot make ends meet alone. At this point I don't know what to think about it, either it is a lie or why does he care so much about a person who constantly belittle him? He keeps on speaking about the day we will be together but I feel he is all about empty promises and dreams. I don't want to be the AH telling him he should stop dreaming and start focusing on real things to improve his situation, but I am also tired of him coming to me complaining about his situation. I like him but some days I feel wasting my time with him and I see no future within this relationship because he is just a ""blablabla"" and no real action. That said, would I be the AH telling him that his mum is partially right when she tells him not to waste his time on futile stuff and to put his head on the real matters?",0.25
"AITA for hidding the thing told by my mother in his death bed ?  

""We are a respected, wealthy, and well-known family in the Middle East, and my father has always been seen as a man of strong morals and a good father to us.

Recently, my mother was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer. On her deathbed, she revealed a secret to me that completely shattered my perception of our family. She asked me to share this secret with my siblings after her passing.

The secret my mother revealed was that our father, who we always believed to be a model of integrity, had forced her into actions that deeply distressed and traumatized her ( sharing her with his friends ) . Out of fear of shame and the impact it could have on our family’s reputation and unity, she kept this burden to herself, suffering in silence.

Now that my mother has passed away, I find myself consumed by anger and confusion. I no longer see my father or our home in the same way, and I am deeply conflicted about whether or not to tell my siblings, particularly my older brother, who is very protective of our mother and if i tell him i am afraid she do something to my father and loss his life in jail .

I sought advice from a religious Imam in at our local mosque, who advised me to let this secret die with my mother and to leave my father’s actions to divine justice. The sheikh emphasized that in our society, issues of honor are very sensitive and could have devastating consequences for all of our family members, especially my younger sisters, who might face unfounded accusations or judgment from others that they are also forced by my father to do the same thing as my mom and this can destroy them .

Despite following this advice and keeping the secret, I now find myself living in a constant state of distress and turmoil, unsure of what to do next.""

"AITA for planning to tell my friend not to vent to me about her relationship again? I (f 31) have a friend (f 32, let's call her Lisa) whom I knew since Kindergarten. We were best friends when graduating High School and kept in touch until we slowly drifted apart in our mid-20s. A few weeks ago, Lisa reached out to me again which made me happy.

But very soon, all our conversations turned towards her current boyfriend (m 34, let's call him Peter) and how unhappy he makes her. I tried to be supportive but I never met Peter before and everything Lisa tells me is red flags. 

Some examples: Him shouting at her for no reason, telling her her birthday gift for him isn't good enough, accusing her of cheating, ignoring her when she wants to talk, going through her phone without permission etc. I am extremely sorry for Lisa since that really sounds like abuse to me and I want to support her, I myself had been in a similar situation as a teen without support. Unfortunately she's still wearing her rose-coloured glasses and always talks about wanting to make him happy, her future plans of what she wants to do better and her efforts to fix the relationship. So I told her right then and there Peter was toxic to her. I said there is nothing to fix and unless he changes himself on his own, there is nothing Lisa can do besides breaking up. I told her his behaviour is manipulative and some parts of his distrustful behaviour could probably be hints of him cheating. Lisa said several times she wants to give Peter a chance and when he blows it off, it will be over. In the two weeks we are talking to each other again this happend three times already, I always had her back and offered her a shoulder to cry on. And ALL THOSE THREE TIMES she texted me the next day: ""We're all good again and he promises to be better. I give him another chance.""

To me, this is frustrating. As I said, I know how that feels like and I want to support Lisa. But I just can't bear it any longer. It is like telling a toddler not to touch the hot cooking plate and she still does it, burns herself and touches it again, expecting it to be different the next time. Today, she started talking to me again – and again, the topic turned quickly towards a mean thing Peter has done. I was proud when Lisa said she blocked him so she doesn't have to deal with his BS, but in the same sentence she stressed her hopes about him being nice to her again in a few days. I almost snapped and told her that if he doesn't, he'll again show her his true colours which Lisa completely ignored and I gave up. Now I'm thinking of telling her next time she texts me to not vent to me about Peter anymore since she obviously doesn't listen to me and I can't help her that way. 

I don't want to hurt her, but I'm simply not capable of going through that discussion again anymore when I know Lisa will never dump Peter, no matter how mean he is.

So I ask you people: Will telling Lisa to stop venting about Peter to me make me the A-Hole?",0.1
"AITA for telling my son that his fiancé is not invited to family dinners due to her picky eater behavior  
My son is engaged to Clara, she is a different race than us. It is not uncommon for me to do a dinners for the family. I usually make food that I grew up eating.

My son bought Clara to met us for the first time ( they used to live in a different state but moved back recently). The whole night she didn’t touch a single dish. I heard multiple times from her that the food looks weird. She also would do the gross look. 

It felt extremely disrespectful at best and racist at worse. The whole family not Ed by the end of the night. I even asked her if everything was okay and if she didn’t like the food. My son jumped in and said she was picky eater.

This happens two more times at dinner and I brought it up again to my son. At this point I do not want her at dinners because she acts like our culture food is gross. My son keeps telling me she is just picky but I pointed out looking grossed out by food doesn’t fall into that.

We are having dinner Friday and I didn’t invite her. This resulted in an argument that I am not being welcoming and I am close minded. He called me a jerk and I told her that Clara is disrespectful.",0.5
"AITA for clipping the lock on my neighbor's trashcan? I (29f) live in an apartment building with my partner(29m). There are 4 units in total but we don't know our neighbors or interact with them besides in passing. They're young, female college students, not exactly sure of their age. When they first moved in, they locked a trashcan to the front gate, which happens to be directly next to my bedroom window. I told my partner that I was upset by it next to my window and that if they didn't take it out we'd have issues. I didn't talk to the girls at the time because my partner told me I was overreacting. Occasionally, they would forget to unhook the lock on trash day. I'd vocalize my frustrations to my partner but never talked to the girls because it was never left there more than a week and he was still telling me it wasn't a big deal.

This week, I've reached my boiling point. These girls seem to have gone home for the summer and left their trashcan chained to the front of the apartment. My window is directly to the left of the can, I'm in a basement unit. I haven't even opened my bedroom window this entire summer due to the trash smell but this got completely out of hand and was starting to overflow into the window well.

Two weeks go by before my partner leaves the first note. The next week trash is out. Great. Maybe 2 or 3 days after trash day, the power goes out in our building and I can tell they aren't home because their alarm is going off non-stop. 1 week goes by, trash isn't taken out and the alarm is still going off. I message our landlord and tell him about the alarm and trash. I doubt he even reached out to them to let them know the alarm was going off. Another week goes by without taking out the trash before my partner leaves the 2nd note saying we will clip the lock if they don't take out the trash.

Finally, the night before trash day comes, their alarm was off and it looked like the can was empty. It's still chained to the gate but looks empty. I'm happy it's gone and I plan on returning the wire cutters. As I'm walking out the door, I saw something in their can. 1/4 of the can is still full of weeks old dog poop bags, water, and other trash. At this point, I'm running late for work and I'm pissed off. I clip off the chain, dropped it in the can, and pulled it to the curb.

I called my partner and he called me TA for not knocking on their door first before immediately cutting the lock. I feel like we gave them a proper warning to have the trash out at the curb on trash day and it wasn't. It was obvious that whoever emptied the can didn't have the key. He told me it's my responsibility to deal with the consequences and that's fine. I'll buy a new lock tomorrow, if I can have a copy of the key. I plan on talking to the girls and making it clear that I want a key but refuse to be responsible for unlocking their trash. If I have to unlock it, I'll be keeping the lock and putting their can in the gated backyard space where everyone else keeps their cans. So, AITA?",0.08
"AITA for not giving the role of father of the bride to both my dad and stepdad? My parents divorced when my siblings (32m, 30f, 29m) and I (27f) were young. I was a newborn when they separated for context. My dad never remarried but he had two long term relationships since then. One when we were younger kids. His current partner he met when we were in our teens. Mom and my stepdad married when I was 5.

Our parents shared equal custody of my siblings and me. We were closer to our dad than our mom or our stepdad. Not because dad was a Disney parent or because he didn't have rules. But dad was more of a nurturer and we had a closer relationship with him. We still loved mom but it wasn't the same. I believe at times my stepdad had trouble coming to terms with us being so close to dad and not as close to mom or him. There were times we felt some jealousy and maybe even resentment about it. As an adult I can sort of understand, especially if he loved us like we were his, though I also think it should always be a positive when kids have good biological parents and a stepparent isn't needed to fill that role for a missing parent. It's less trauma for the kids.

Anyway, when I was 10 dad was involved in a bad accident. For a year we couldn't live with him because he was on life support, then in rehab working on recovery. During that year my stepdad really did try to fill the role of ""only dad"". He and mom already had a child together at this point but he focused more on my siblings and me. He was really good to us and I told him a few years ago I appreciated that he didn't resent us being there all the time. But he resented that, at the end of that year, he hadn't solidified himself as dad to any of us. We all still called him by his first name. None of us saw him as more of a dad afterward. We weren't magically so much closer. Dad was still our #1. When most of my siblings were in college but I was still at home, my stepdad became a little more angry and a lot more resentful of dad because dad was their go to person to call. I also chose to live full time with dad at that point.

So the problem today. I'm the last of my siblings getting married. My sister had dad as only father of the bride for her wedding. Now I asked just dad too. My stepdad was quiet about my sister's wedding. But he has spoken up this time and he told me he couldn't understand why I didn't ask them both. He said he did just as much as my dad, and for an entire year he was the only father any of us had. My mom, who weighed in a couple of times, said I was so young when my stepdad and her got married, that it made no sense to see him as less of a father. They told me that even if I asked now it wouldn't hold the same genuine recognition and appreciation for my stepdad. But my stepdad wanted me to know how thoughtless he considered my choice.

He's been living with me and my mother for a while now
And he has a cat that moved in with us as well. We already own two, and that has caused his cat to mark her territory from the bathroom to our room.
We've tried everything from spraying restricted areas, giving her a free clean litter box to do her business, and we really thought we were doing good at keeping her from marking.
But just this morning, I woke up to smth wet touching my foot, and low and behold, she peed on my boyfriends blanket.
As I said before, we promised her face we'd inform my mother immediately when this happened again.. Because if she ever did, we'd have to get rid of her 
Because of how unsanitary and unhealthy It is to have a cat constantly do that. 
My boyfriend realized I was texting my mother about it and stormed out of the room and slammed the door
We're in separate rooms as I'm texting this, and I feel intense shame.
He loves that cat dearly and I can't stand being the reason his cat is getting taken away from him after she was a gift to him after his mother got rid of his cat he's had before we even started dating.

"AITA because I want my husband to come home after work when I am off sick very ill instead of seeing his parents like he does every Monday?  the last time I called out of work was October of last year when my mom passed away. I never miss work, even when I am sick, even when I feel terrible I still go in. well I’ve been feeling very sick for a while, and today I just couldn’t cut it: I knew it would be too much for me, I’m feeling very weak and just terrible, truly so terrible. my husband and I haven’t been getting along and he has grown increasingly mean, easy to trigger. 

I texted him “what should I make for dinner tonight?” To which he responded with “I go to my parents on Mondays and play Fortnite” for context, I usually get home at 8pm (12 hours shifts) and he gets home at 5pm so I normally do not mind. But I am very sick and just want my husband to come home and look after me a bit. He doesn’t even have to cook, just to be there for me when I am unwell would be nice. 

He hasn’t responded when I told him that I wish he would come home and help look after me. I do not think that he will.

"AITA for apparently being selfish  I(17) just started my last year of high school last week Wednesday. Last month my family and I moved to a different apartment but it's super close to the old due to my mother wanting to stay in the same area. Wouldn't be a problem except this new apartment is zoned to a different school that she doesn't like for whatever reason.

I'd call the school I'm currently going to Old School and the one I want to go to New school.

I went to new school before and I liked it so I wouldn't mind. But that would also mean I don't have bus transportation to the school I'm not even supposed to be at. So every morning my mom either expects me to get up at like 5:30 (not a morning person at all) and walk to old school bus stop which isn't that close. I'd say bout a 5-10 minute walk. Or wake her up or my sister at abt 6:10 to drop me off at old school bus stop. 

Old school bus stop comes at 6:20. I know we won't make it cuz they aren't exactly reliable people. They too aren't exactly morning ppl and won't get up immediately. I hate having to rely on them and already i haven't even been to first period at all. Today is also school but im at home. 

I want my mom to switch my school so that it's easier on me but she and my sister are finding a way to make it abt her. Because she has to take off work to unenroll me from new school and enroll me into the new school. And the thing is they're acting like that is a lot. It's a lot for ME to do this crap every day. 

Mind you old school bus drops me off at old school bus stop. It's not exactly that close meaning everyday I have to walk home in the heat carrying a heavy bag on me. I'm annoyed and getting mad and I'm being called selfish for not thinking abt my mom??!? AITA?",0.9

"AITA for making my renter’s kid feel bad about food? Mom (F35) of a seven year old. It’s been just the two of us in a house with too many bedrooms for a while, so when a friend of a friend was looking for a room to rent, I agreed. Harold (M42) now leases a room upstairs.

I knew Harold had a son my daughter’s same age, and I knew that Harold Junior would occasionally be staying over. All good.

Over the past six or seven months, “occasionally staying over” has turned into Harold having his son here more than half the time. No worries there, but the kids sharing food and snacks has turned into me buying ALL the food and snacks. When they come in after school, etc., I don’t like to tell one kid they can’t have what the other is eating so I’m fine sharing groceries like that, but over the past few months of school and summer camp and varying schedules I keep going into the pantry to pack my daughter’s lunch or grab a snack and groceries that used to last a month are gone in less than a week. I wouldn’t mind if they were then getting replaced, but I’ve made a couple of “hey it looks like we’re running low on (insert snack or lunch item here)” comments to no avail, or asked more directly by saying “can you pick up (whatever food item) on your next trip out? Looks like the kids burned through it,” but the furthest I’ve gotten is Harold picking up some snacks and food only he would eat and the kids would never touch and saying “hey, if you guys want I got some (think something like Kim Chi), grab some.” 

I finally put the non-perishable snacks and food for my daughter’s lunch on her school supply shelf in her closet and when we pack her lunch in the morning she chooses what items she wants. Harold Junior has made several comments about not having his favorite things for his lunches or snacks, but I’ve left that to his dad. Harold has said nothing to me.

Harold Junior‘s mom was dropping him off the other day and we were talking in the driveway for a bit and she said that it really hurt Junior‘s feelings that I was hiding food from him. I told her that was a conversation she should have with his dad, but she was pretty cold afterward and now Harold is a bit frosty too (I’m sure she said something to him).

AITA For not holding my tongue? My 32M boyfriend and I 28F have been together for two years this past weekend. Recently this year we discussed me moving in with him. We made it happen just three months ago in June. He still lives at home with his mom 61F to help her with the house and bills and his dad passed away to an illness when he was in high school. He is an amazing boyfriend and father to two lovely girls from a previous relationship and we have been discussing marriage since I moved in.  His mom liked me at first and was very welcoming when I first moved in. Please keep in mind we both come from traditional Hispanic backgrounds. So this isn’t out of the ordinary for me but recently this past month she has been passive aggressive towards me when he isn’t around. She makes slight remarks about my cooking or the way I clean. It all came to head this past Sunday though when we were getting ready to go grocery shopping and his youngest 3F asked me to tie her shoe. I of course said yes and had her sit down while we were waiting for their dad to finish getting ready in the bathroom downstairs and we were on the main level. His mom for some odd reason said no come over here I will and i said no worries it’s fine I got her. Meanwhile I was tying Lacy’s shoe and she muttered in Spanish that I was an effing disrespectful brat and I stood up and responded with at least say it to my face. So she walked up to me and said you’re a disrespectful brat whose family doesn’t even want you in their own home. I left on good terms with my parents as this is my first serious relationship and left with their blessing still visiting from time to time but they didn’t kick me out or wish ill will on me so I wasn’t sure what my suegra aka mother in law was implying. I retorted back and snapped while replying it’s uneducated of you to use such foul language to me when I have done everything as you have said you wanted it to be done since I moved in but your going to far and I won’t tolerate you speaking to me that way. She scoffed at me and said I need Jesus and I responded with it does her no good to go to church and treat me so poorly. I then told her she needs therapy and realize I’m not going anywhere I’m here to be with her son. Not her. She walked away while I went outside with Lacy on my heels and called my boyfriend. He immediately rushed outside and calmed me down and after hearing my side of the story and went inside to have a word with his mom. He stood up for me and tried to ask where all the malice was coming from her end and she cried and couldn’t say anything back so she grabbed her keys and took off almost hitting my car in the driveway as she backed out of the garage in a frenzy. We both packed up the girls and said we would talk later about what happened but it’s been a day and I can tell it’s really affecting him and I feel guilty for having said something back.

"AITA for not paying $500 for my sister’s birthday trip? AITA for not wanting to pay $500 for my sister’s 30th birthday trip? 

My dad and sister are both upset with me because I told them I can’t afford to pay $500 for my sister’s birthday trip. 

I told my sister that I didn’t want to get in the way of her having the vacation she wants for her birthday so me and my husband wouldn’t go (it would actually cost  $1000 for both of us). Alternatively if we could find a way to do a cheaper vacation that would also work. The problem is my sister’s boyfriend wasn’t happy that the vacation wouldn’t be ‘all inclusive’ so my dad made the assumption that me and my husband wouldn’t go so that they could have the full all inclusive holiday experience. I was upset by jumping straight to this assumption rather than trying to find a vacation we could all afford. My dad also offered to pay 25% of my holiday costs however that would still cost me $500 which I said I couldn’t afford so he withdrew this offer. 

Rather than them going without me and my husband because we can’t afford it now no-one is going and I am being blamed for this. They are angry with me. My sister said I was being ‘selective with my finances’ and not prioritising her even though me and my husband barely have any money for ourselves let alone other people.

Now here is where the problem is. She had gone home to visit her parents, and she calls me yesterday that I have a surprise and she sends me a photo of a tattoo on her neck. When I saw that, I felt really hurt and disappointed that she couldn’t respect this wish of mine. When I confronted her, she said she is sorry she didn’t know I will be so hurt and to let it go.     
  
When I didn’t accept her apology she started telling me to stop being a kid and not make such a huge scene out of a small thing. She was making me feel like a bad guy to not immediately forgive her.   
  
But I stood my ground and really ignored her apology and I even cancelled our upcoming vacation trip because I had zero mood of travelling anymore. She is now telling me that she will get it removed if it’s such a big problem for me but she is making me feel like an asshole for this. Somehow I am the bad person here. 
  
But am I not justified for having strong preferences and opinions about what my partner should do? Why am I the bad person here when in fact she was the one who went behind my back and did the thing I don’t like. She thinks I could have let it go because it’s not a big deal and I’m the asshole in this one.   So tell me guys, AITA?
  
Tldr: wife got a tattoo despite knowing I don’t like them and now she plans to get it removed but is calling me an asshole in the process. ",0.8
"WIBTA if I expected my mom and stepfather to cover my lost grants if they did something that lost me them I (m19) want to start off by saying that my mom and biologic father as well as my stepfather are all really good to me. I live rent free and am allowed to visit anyone I like whenever I like.

 My life is going pretty damn well thanks to all of them. i do however pay for my own food, gas, clothes and luxeries like games or computer hardware. I don't ask them for money directly and I do that thanks to my summer jobs but mostly because I get enough scholarships and admittedly grants to have about $4000 leftover per semester given directly to me after paying for tuition and fees for university.

My mom wants to marry my stepfather which I would be extremely excited for her for if it didn't mess with my fasfa paperwork and could lose me about 10k per year in grants which would leave me without a refund from uni and having to pay my tuition out of pocket, which means I would have to work during school instead of just over the summer and would have to cut back dramatically on what I could buy for myself 

The question is would I he the asshole if, upon this happening, I expected my mom and stepfather to recuperate to me and money I lost upon them marrying? Or if I expected them to delay getting married for ~3 more years until I am out of university?",0.94

"AITA for canceling on a family trip to care for my GF Earlier this year my (23m) parents booked a beach house vacation for our family  (my brother, my sister and our plus ones) which leaves this week.  While the planning process for this trip has been rocky eventually we got all the details sorted out.   
  
My GF (23f) of 4 years, was beginning to get excited for the trip. She spent hours thinking about what she would bring, buying clothes, things to do ect. but recently fell sick. Last week she underwent a surgery for her illness and has been on the recovery since. For health reason she can no longer attend the trip and I want to stay back take care of/be with her during this stressful time.   


The problem is I am getting a ton of pushback from my family, I have had my mom tell me how disappointed in me she is. I've had my sister tell me that I am being selfish. I have even had my grandma (who has nothing to do with this vacation) scold me for my decision.   
  
If it was a money thing and they booked a room for my GF and I then I would get their frustration, however my absence means that instead of having to share a bed and forcing someone sleep on an air mattress everyone get a mattress to themselves. On top of this my absence means that instead of taking two vehicles on this road trip, everyone can carpool and take one car.  
  
While I get the disappointment in me not coming and the frustration that this was last minute. I am left questioning weather AITA for canceling.  
  
TLDR: AITA for canceling a family trip to take care of my girlfriend who is recovering from surgery.      ",0.79
"AITA because my husband took our child around some man I’ve never met AITA because my husband took my infant daughter around some man I’ve never met? 

My  (36)f husband (41)m took our 10 month old daughter to his mother’s yesterday to visit and was gone for 3 hours. He does this once a week and she loves visiting her gamma. Today his mother came over and during conversation asked me if I had met Let’s call him Nate, and I said who? Apparently when my husband went to her house yesterday he had a man with him called Nate, and my mil was uncomfortable with this man being there and understandable unhappy that her time with her son and grandchild was interrupted by this guy being there. Also… they only visited her for an hour before leaving. My husband was gone with our child for over 3 hours . I’ve never even heard of someone called Nate and we have a limited group of people with interaction with where we live as most of our friends live all over the country. My husband didn’t mention anything to me about this guy. 

For some back ground my husband is a recovering addict. He’s had a few relapses and while he does his best he still leans more towards partying than I like. He loves our daughter very much but he has struggled with the life style change of having a baby. 

Anyway after some digging mil tells me that he apparently met this guy recently down the street from where we live. We live on a cute little block in town but not the best area and not far from a not great area of town. Again he’s never mentioned this guy to me. Mil says my husband and Nate talked about partying the entire time they were there. At this point I’m pretty livid. He took our child and had her around a strange man I didn’t know for several hours just the three of them, and and hour at his mothers hours and on top of it all didn’t say a word about it. Just let me assume he was with his mother the entire time. The biggest issue to me is this is not safe! When I asked him about it he yelled at me saying I didn’t want him to have any friends and that I am always getting on to him for everything. He stormed out and slammed the door scaring our two dogs ( Aussies). Examples of me getting on to him are asking him not to drive our daughter after drinking a few beers, asking him to take his car and not mine when he goes out to have a drink with his friend I know. 

I guess my question here is aitah for not wanting my husband to take our 10 month old daughter somewhere with a man I have never met before. 

Don’t know that this matters but I am not a sahm I’m a nurse so I work 3 days a week and I’m also in a graduate program currently. Also the only people that take care of my daughter are my sister, her babysitter, or us. My dad, brother, and MIL visit with her often and my FIL and his wife see her occasionally. Our out of town friends have seen her a few times and some have yet to met her but we’ve been friends for 10+ years so I trust them all. My mother is deceased. ",0.14
"AITA for convincing my sister change her baby's name? This is my first time posting on Reddit after a long time lurking. On mobile, so sorry for any typos.
My sister (19f) announced to the family that she and her boyfriend were pregnant a few months ago. She immediately followed it up with the names she'd chosen: Tyler is it was a boy (after the father), or Savery if it was a girl (pronounced ""savory""). Apparently she liked the name Avery, but wanted to make it unique, hence the extra letter. Obviously, this is a terrible name for a baby, and I politely asked if they were considering any other names. She said no, that they'd already decided. My sister and I aren't really close, so I decided to let it be and congratulated her.
A while later, my sister announced that they were definitely having a girl, and that little Savery was healthy so far. At this point, I'd decided to become more involved with my sister, since this was going to be my first niece or nephew. But I couldn't stop thinking about the poor kid getting teased for her name.
My sister has untreated BPD and any direct challenge to her decisions always escalates to a huge blowout, so I had to play my cards carefully. I got her a specific baby name book from my mom, the very same book our mom had gotten both of our names from. She loved this gift and we spent all night eating snacks and going through it. That night, I opened up about my concerns for the name she'd chosen and the bullying that might come from it, which she was receptive to, because we'd both been bullied in school.
Over the next few weeks, I said things like, ""Oh, this would be a cute name"" or ""I saw the coolest list of names on Pinterest."" My sister loved some of the names and finally, after all of that, she announced that she had settled on the name ""Margo"" instead, taken from the baby name book. I was overjoyed at having saved my niece from a life of being named the way someone would describe a steak.
Shortly afterwards I got a text from my sister's boyfriend, who I didn't really know at all because he was never home when I was there, calling me all sorts of terrible things for getting involved in his family. I asked what he was talking about and he continued to cuss me out because he chose the name Savery and I had no right to change it. I pointed out that I was only interested in the well-being of my niece and that my sister was my family, so I had a right to an opinion. This man had the nerve to tell me that I was an idiot, that I didn't know anything about family since I was still single despite being older than both of them. I pointed out that I clearly wasn't the dumbest one in the conversation, since I didn't try to name my daughter after a literal piece of meat. Now my sister is angry at me for getting involved and calling her boyfriend stupid, even though he said much more hurtful things in his texts to me. AITA?",0.22
"AITA for having a birdfeeder on my balcony? I (36F) live in an appartment building with my two kids. I live on the first floor, and I share the building with my downstair neighbours (60+ M and F) who live on the ground floor. My balcony hangs over a part of their garden. I had a small bird feeder on the side of my balcony and today my neighbour asked me to move it, because they get a lot of bird seeds dropped in their garden. I said I understood and moved it immediately. I rang their doorbell to ask if it was fine where I moved it (sort of more inside the balcony, much further away from the sides, so no seeds would spill to their garden), or if they prefered that I remove it altogether. Before I could even finish my sentence, the neighbours wife yells at me that she doesn’t want to find a single bird seed in their entire garden. Obviously I now removed it entirely. 

I feel awful for being shouted at, since I didn’t feel I had done anything wrong. I moved it immediately when they asked me. They had honestly never said anything about the bird feeder before. I always made sure I bought seeds without a shell, so there wouldn’t be too much of a mess, but obviously birds spill when they eat. I’ve had the bird feeder for at least 4 years, and they never mentioned it. 

Now, I’ve removed the feeder entirely to keep peace, but I’m left wondering if I was wrong for trying to feed the birds in the first place. AITA for how I handled this situation with my neighbors?

"AITA for telling my dad in front of his ILs that I'd rather live with my grandparents? After my mom died my dad relied on her parents for 3 years to take care of me. I (15m) was 3 when mom died. They would pick me up at 7am from dad's house and take me to their house and dad would pick me up at 8pm after he was finished work/errands. They were more like parents to me than he was. He worked 6 days a week and typically most Sunday's I spent at least 4 or 5 hours with them too. They took me to my first day of school, picked me up early if I was sick, they were there when I was sick. My earliest memories are of my time with them. I don't really remember dad from back then.

This changed when my dad met Beth. One minute it was me going to my grandparents every day and then Beth lived with us and suddenly I was home with her instead. My dad and grandparents fought about it a lot and he ended up telling me when I was 7 that I wasn't going to see then anymore and he and Beth were getting married. A month before the wedding I was sitting in front of a judge and being asked questions about my dad, my grandparents and stuff. The judge was nice. I don't remember a lot of our talk. But afterward I did get to see my grandparents again. My dad wasn't happy. I was 10 when my grandparents admitted they had to take dad to court to see me again.

My dad hates that I see my grandparents as much as I do (three days a month, one overnight a month and for a day around my birthday and Christmas). He hates that I leave my half siblings behind to go and see them. There are times he has talked about going back to court and has asked me if I'd say I don't like going without my siblings, and I always tell him I wouldn't say that.

Beth hates my grandparents too, but for a different reason. She blames them for me rejecting a closer relationship with her because they never allowed me to feel like I didn't have a mom. And I do feel that way kinda. It's hard to describe. I know she's not here. I can't speak to her. But I still don't feel 'motherless'. I don't want to have that kind of relationship with Beth and it upsets her. I don't think it's cool for her to want that so badly, because I'm sure she'd hate to be forgotten by my half siblings. So I don't like her much for that.

My dad bitches more about my grandparents now than he did when I was younger. My half siblings are old enough to know I go to grandparents and they can't come. He also knows I prefer being with my grandparents and he hates it. Beth's parents and siblings and their spouses were at our house Saturday night for a dinner party and dad was bitching about my grandparents to them and everyone was acting like my grandparents were bad people for taking dad to court and for not letting me forget mom. Dad said during the party that he'll never understand why I want to go there so badly still. I said I'd rather live with my grandparents than him. Everyone went quiet and dad made me go to my room. He was so mad yesterday and he told me I should know better than to try and humiliate him like that.

"AITA for yelling at my friend for being too high at my birthday party? I (34) have a friend, “Kelsey” (32), who struggles with a severe ketamine addiction. Her partner is also an addict and alcoholic but denies addiction is real. She switched from cocaine to ketamine, downplaying its severity and claiming it’s just her “thing.” Despite a high income and low expenses, she often begs for money for her pets' vet bills due to spending hundreds weekly on ketamine. Her behaviour has worsened over the past two years, and she frequently lies about her drug use, blaming her disconnection on diabetes, even though there’s clear ketamine residue around her nose.

In the past year, Kelsey has had several alarming incidents, including going into a k-hole while holding a butcher knife, screaming at her partner in front of me, and having drugs delivered to my house while claiming sobriety. When I voice concerns, she either dismisses or gets angry with me. She equates ketamine use with smoking or drinking. At her last birthday party, she was so impaired that she flailed on the dance floor and accidentally hit people. Her dad asked me about her drug use, but I lied because she had requested I not disclose it.

For my birthday party, I invited Kelsey despite my reservations, making it clear that it was a family-friendly event where drug use was unacceptable. However, she got excessively drunk and high, leading to inappropriate actions like insulting a 7-year-old and making disturbing comments about dog training. Some guests chose not to stay for the later BBQ due to her behaviour, and others suspected her of drug dealing or an overdose.

Towards the end of the evening, I suggested playing Telestrations, but Kelsey and her partner were disruptive. She insulted me, saying my ""autism was fucking autisming"" and I was ruining the fun. Frustrated, I yelled at her, saying it wasn’t about my autism but that she and her boyfriend were too high. I pointed out it was the third consecutive year she had been too messed up at my party and mentioned the visible ketamine on her face. They left, and I apologized to my guests for my outburst, explaining it wasn’t isolated. Over the next few days, guests reached out to support me, saying they understood why I acted the way I did.

I later sent Kelsey a letter apologizing for how I yelled but making it clear that her behaviour was unacceptable and hurtful. I told her I needed to step away for now but hoped she could turn her life around. She responded with a letter obsessively praising my husband and making personal attacks against me. She accused me of being terrible and claimed several guests apologized to her for my behaviour, saying everyone was too afraid to be honest with me.

"AITA. I told a woman's husband I matched with her in Tinder. Last night I was sitting eating at Applebee's by myself and got a notification that I had a match on Tinder. After looking at it I held off on messaging her figuring I would do it later once I was home. Not 5 minutes later that very same woman walks in holding hands with a guy, and wearing a large wedding ring on her finger. As fate would have it, they sat at the table right next to me. Once she saw me her eyes got about as wide as dinner plates and she ran to the restroom where I'm assuming she either blocked me or just unmatched me because I could no longer see her profile. I was basically finished when they sat down so I ate my last few bites, paid, and stopped by her table on my way out the door saying ""Just to let you know, I matched with your wife on Tinder about 5 minutes before you sat down. Take that information as you will"" then walked out without even looking back. Worst part is given the timeframe she was probably swipping while in the car with him.

"AITA for asking my sisters boyfriend to apologise? I (22m) recently celebrated my birthday. For this I specifically requested that nobody buy me any presents or give me any money, only that they turn up to my birthday party (a dinner at the house) in black tie as my girlfriend (22f) had never been to a black tie dinner before. 

I made formal invitations and sent multiple messages in the family group chat that all made the dress code very clear.

We have hosted black tie dinners in the past and my sisters boyfriend (36m) has often 'dressed up' for the occasion but never put full black tie on- I assumed this is because he does not own it. Knowing this I messaged him privately a month prior to the dinner offering to help him find a suit that would fit & that I would pay for. I found one that was reasonably priced and that I suspected may fit him in a local charity shop. I sent him a photo of this and he said (something along the lines of) 'thank you but it's not my sort of thing'.
I thought this meant he would not be interested in coming (as he did not reply to my following message). I still gave him a formal invite anyway in case he changed his mind.

On the day all of the guests arrived in dress code and we had a drinks party before the dinner and played some garden games - midway though one of the garden games my sister and her boyfriend arrived both dressed in t shirt and shorts. Seeing this I went over to them to ask him privately why they had not put on his black tie as it was the one wish I had for my birthday and my sister boyfriend  replied with 'what are you talking about'. Obviously annoyed I walked away and did not mention it for the rest of the night. Later in the night people were asking eachother to do speeches and he asked me to do a speech saying 'I want to hear what you have to say'. Throughout the night they littered the conversation with snide remarks about how ridiculous the whole thing was and how silly we all looked. This really annoyed me but I still did not give either of them a reaction.

I enjoyed my birthday dinner but couldn't help feel disappointed in my sisters boyfriend and my sister for not showing up with the single request I had- especially since the rest of us dressed up for it.
I told my mother the following morning I would not be speaking to either of them until they apologise for their comments.


2 weeks pass and I still hadn't seen  them (they had been abroad on holiday) and the first time I saw them they said hello and I said to them 'I am not interacting with you until you apologise for the behaviour you exhibited at my birthday party'.
My mother became furious with me over the issue and will not speak to me or even acknowledge my perspective, she is now demanding that I apologise to both my sister and her boyfriend and that we will never dress up for dinner again.

"AITA for telling my dad that I’m worried about his partner at my grandmother’s funeral? My parents divorced when I was young. My dad has a long-term (12 years plus) girlfriend, who he never married or moved in with but would see every weekend. We always got on well initially but several years ago she decided to end all contact with me for reasons unknown to me at the time. As I lived primarily with my mum growing up and only stayed with my dad every other weekend, my dad would spend every other weekend with me and the other weekend with her. This arrangement worked well for years until we crossed paths at a family event where she falsely accused me of secretly taking photos of her and sending them to my mother to laugh at. Even after allowing her to see my camera roll and my messages to my mother to prove my innocence, she continued to accuse me of doing this for 2 years until she reluctantly agreed to seek counselling. She has since apologised in writing but I don’t totally believe it was sincere. I also learnt at this point that she only cut contact with me all those years ago due to jealously over the fact that I had a more privileged upbringing than she was able to provide to her own daughter. My dad has fully taken my side in all of this, even coming close to breaking up with her several times over the matter, but they’re still together. It affected me quite a lot at the time but I just sort of got on with it and carried on with my life after the dust settled.

I’ve never that I don’t want her to attend, she knew my nan well for many years after all, but I confided to my dad that I was still worried about her making more accusations or just generally being unpleasant to me at the funeral. At first he understood my concerns but after discussing with her and asking her to provide a guarantee that she wouldn’t do anything similar, he’s changed his view. He now thinks I’m being selfish for creating family drama when he’s also obviously shaken up over his mother’s death. I really don’t see it like this, I’m just worried that probably one of the saddest days of my life is just going to be made even more distressing. AITA for raising this?",0.19
"AITAH for comparing my pregnant girlfriend to her friend I’m 22 and my girlfriend is 24. We’ve been together for a little more than a year.

Right now shes 6 months pregnant and knew she wanted to keep it from the start. I respected her choice and I was really excited to be a dad.

Now I regret meeting her at all.

Since shes been pregnant her true colors came out. She has a shopping addiction and lives like a hoarder. I cook or buy dinner every night, and I clean up the dishes. She will go from rage-yells at me when she doesn’t get her way. I was hoping it was just hormones, but now I see the bigger picture.

She has a “friend” “Kayla” who is basically a traditional housewife/stay at home mom. (I put “friend” in quotes because my girlfriend secretly hates this friend, and it’s obvious to me that she’s jealous) Her husband pays for everything and she takes care of their baby and house. My girlfriend has been directly hinting she wants this kind of lifestyle.

Last night she came home from work early and told me she quit. I was mad because now she won’t get any maternity leave, which puts even more on my plate. She got mad back, said her work environment is toxic and IM the bad guy for not supporting her. She said “Why can’t I be more like Kayla’s husband”

I lost it and said Kayla’s baby was planned, and maybe I’d act more like Kayla’s husband if she acted more like Kayla. That really enraged her so I left to drink with my friend and slept on the couch.

My friend and I (who she hooked up with btw. The day before I met her they hooked up and she never told me, I had to hear it from him) we came to a conclusion that maybe this pregnancy wasn’t an accident at all. Maybe she wanted to be a stay at home mom like Kayla and baby trapped me to get it. I’ve caught her in white lies more times than I can count (she is a compulsive liar actually)

I wasn't sure what to wear. I thought a blouse and stretch pants would suffice, but decided against it. Against my better judgement I wore a button down shirt that was way too tight and jeans that I could just barely button. It wasn't a great look but I told myself to just get through the dinner.

I could tell that my brother was not happy when he saw me, but he said nothing. The dinner was fine, the girlfriend was lovely. Dinner ends, she gets in her Uber and heads off for home.

My brother tears into me, telling me I looked very heavy and asked why I thought it was okay to come to a dinner looking like I was, in his words, "" 2 slices of bread from popping your pants button"".

I tried to calm him down, reassure him things were fine. He retorted that things were not fine, called me heavy and lazy and told me I was just going to get bigger and bigger. I asked if he had anything else. He called me a fatass and told me to make a salad every once in awhile.

"AITA for wanting my boyfreind to stay in my room while he visits My boyfriend (21M) bought a plane ticket to come visit me (21F) in a few weeks. we have been dating now for a little over half a year and have been long distance since we left college to come home for summer vacation in June. I have met his parents and he has met mine as well, and they seemed to like him. He is my first boyfriend and I his first girlfriend but we are committed and serious about eachother. My parents know I stayed with him at his apartment for almost a week before I came home for the summer and had no qualms about it. Which is why when he told me he wanted to come visit (which my parents both offered him when they met him), I thought it would be a given that he would stay in my room with me. (I want to make it clear even before all this was brought up we had no intention of getting intimate with my parents around) I had never gotten the impression from my parents that they felt strongly about traditional approaches to dating (I knew they had lived together before marriage and all that) but apparently I was wrong about that.  

At lunch the other day my dad (56M) broached the topic saying my boyfriend would have to stay in my brother's room while he is here with us. He said that otherwise it would be ""disrespectful to him (my dad)"", that even though he ""knows we are together"", ""he doesn't want to see that"" and that it would make him uncomfortable. I was a irritated with this and asked what part of two adults in a committed relationship wanting to stay together was disrespectful to him. After that he took the tone he saves for when he lays down the law and said that ""it just isn't how things are done"" and ended the conversation.

  
Afterwards my mom (58F) approached me and said that since she and my dad will be leaving on a business trip a few days into my boyfriend's visit, we can just do whatever we want after they're gone.

Now I am probably the least confrontational person you'll meet. The last thing I want to do is upset my dad or put my boyfriend between a rock and a hard place. We will survive if we have to spend a couple more nights apart. I told my dad if he feels this strongly about it that's fine. But my dad is treating me like i'm the asshole for even asking. Lately I have felt like my parents don't treat me like an adult, don't respect my boundaries, and don't trust me to make good decisions. The way they have handled this situation says to me that they don't respect the relationship I have with my boyfriend and still see me as a child.

33M here, and I’m caught in the middle of a family conflict involving my sister (28F) and my brother (36M).

My sister is getting married next year and wants a lavish wedding. However, she doesn’t have enough savings to cover all the expenses. She recently asked (more like insisted/expected) that our brother pay for a significant portion of her wedding, arguing that he has a well-paying job and can afford it. (N.B. My brother  made some good investments and cofounded a business which has really kicked off).

When I heard about this, I intervened and told my sister that it’s unfair to expect our brother to pay for her wedding. I suggested that she either scale down her plans or find other ways to finance it. This led to a huge argument. My sister accused me of not supporting her and being selfish. My mom sided with her, saying that family should help each other out and stick together. 

As I was so frustrated I then started an additional argument accusing my mom of spoiling my sister and always taking her side, caving into whatever she asks for and this is why she feels its ok to ask my brother to pay for the wedding. 

Now, there’s a lot of tension in the family, and I’m being blamed for making things worse.

That he should be consistent with her son who already lost one dad and didn't need to lose the dad he'd remember. Dad argued that he was juggling two kids and that I (17m) needed him more than ever right now because my mom was never going to get better. Mom was in an accident and she's got severe brain damage. They said she will need around the clock care for the rest of her life. Dad's wife said none of that was an excuse to make her son question if he still loved him.

She told dad I already make him feel unwanted because I have never wanted to be his brother. That I have shown *so much jealousy* that dad has taken responsibility for another kid. And now dad is making all of that so much worse. She's not wrong that I have never wanted to be her son's brother.

My parents broke up when I was 3. My mom was the parent I spent the most time with. I saw dad on weekends. He was not a consistent dad. Sometimes he was fine, other times he sucked, he let me down a lot, but he also told me he never wanted to lose me a lot. When I was younger I opened up to dad one time that I was scared he would just stop being a good dad to me, that he'd replace me like some of my friends were replaced by their remarried parents. I told him I never wanted him to be a better dad to some other kid over me. Dad assured me it would never happen and I'd always be his number one. Three years ago that conversation was stupid in my head because I realized he'd never be a good dad for real.

He started dating his wife 4 years ago, moved her in because Covid, and I didn't see him for over a year because of Covid. My mom had her accident a few months ago and I moved in with them which was the first time I really spent any time with his wife or her son. My dad was real weird after I moved in. At first it was like he didn't even remember I was there and then when I spent a few days at a friends house he freaked out and told me he'd thought I wasn't coming home. I told him I didn't see a point in being there. So he spent a bunch of time with me and now he flip flops between me and his wife's son.

Dad told me a month and a half ago that if I ever wanted him to choose between me and his wife's son, he'd always pick me, he'd forget the other kid existed. I rolled my eyes at him because I found it crazy and I didn't really believe him.

During the fight she said all this shit about me and mom. She told dad he was a better dad before I moved in. So I told her what he said about choosing me if I made him choose. Shit hit the fan and of course she got so loud her son heard and I was blamed for that. She called me a monster, told my dad he said he loved her son and how could he do that to her boy. Now every time I pass her in the house she tells me I'm a monster.

"AITA For Taking Away The Ticket Of A Friend/Crush After She Said She Wasn't interested? I (26M) have a friend Mary (25F) who I met in university. She's really smart and kind, and we started out (and are still) as friends, but I've caught feelings for her over the last few months. Even through jobs and stuff we still hang out regularly. 

A couple days ago I asked her out. I offered a first date thing of seeing a Commanders game this upcoming Sunday. Preseason game, but still. She said yes, so I thought she was interested in the whole dating thing as well. 

The next day, she texted, saying that she didn't think the feelings for me were there, which is fine I guess, but the problem topic of the post was when she added at the ""Would still love to catch the game with you though!"" I texted back, saying that I hoped seeing the game would be more of a date type of vibe, and going as just two friends hanging out isn't really what I was hoping for. I also added obviously we're still friends, but I'm saving the extra ticket for someone that wants to go with me as a date type of thing. And if I couldn't find a date, I'd go with her. 

She just said ""K"" in response, and given how long I've known her, means she's not too happy with what I had said. I told some other friends about it, and I've gotten mixed responses of ""She didn't want a date sooo you didn't do anything wrong,"" and ""Just take her, bro.""

"AITA for ending the friendship with my crush? I, 24m, met up a girl, 24f, from a weekly social gathering event from my local community. She and I got assigned to a same group because we were in same age group. At the end of the event, all of the people in our group exchanged number because we all vibed well and wanted to meet again outside of the event. Thanks to the social event, she and I had plenty of chances to talk and share about lot of things.

Several months passed by, and things around us changed quiet a bit. She and I became very close friend. We did alot of things together. Up to the point where people around us were sure we are secretely dating. How did people find about our ""hanging out""? She would often mention me to her family, friends, and my friends. For example, we would often start our conversation with people in the social gathering event about what we have done over the week. She starts the conversations with ""he and I went to watch a movie together! We also went to this cool bar!"" Anyway, with other people's supports to my love life, I asked her out again. The answer wasnt so different from her, but my reply was. I told her,
""Im sorry but I cannot just get rid off my feeling towards you. I get jealous, and if by an chance you find someone, i dont think i can just congratulate you as a good friend. Lets not talk anymore""
She told me I am the worst and ran out of my car. 

After that, it was just very cold between us. She no longer talked about me to the people in the gathering event.

Couple months passed by, I got a phone call from her at 11pm. She asked if we can meet at a bar. I got out of my house in an excitement and arrived at the bar not so long after. We talked until the bar closed. Near the end, she asked me if we can go back to being a friend. Furiously I told her why is she doing this to me. She is a very popular girl at the social gathering event. If she wanted to, she could be hanging out with 100 of other dudes, but I did not understand WHY she was so persistent in being friend with me. She replied,
""Because I like you."" 
I could not think after that reply. I said i will think about it, and she laughed and said  ""i will see you tomorrow"". 

Things went back to way we were when we first met. But, honestly, it was a torture for me. I finally gave up again, when she began talking about her new crush at the event. I was right next to her too when she was talking about him. She said it so nonchalantly that the exact moment felt so heavy and embarrassing. I blocked her from everything. I stopped attending the event too. 

When I saw her at the christmas event with my new girlfriend, she came up to me when my girl left to use restroom. She gave me a christmas present that she bought earlier year. She told me i am the worst friend and i shud learn from this and dont treat other ppl like the way i treated her.

Did I handle the situation wrong? ",0.16
"AITA for reselling items that were given to me for free? I (28F) live in a very large neighborhood. We have a neighborhood Facebook group and people sell and giveaway items on there very frequently. I have two small children that grow out of things quickly, so I’ve grabbed a few bags of free clothes, shoes, and toys. Once my kids grow out of those, I sometimes sell them on FB marketplace. Recently a neighbor saw my listing and reached out to ask if this was the item she gave to me for free. I said yes, and she said I should have posted the item in our neighborhood group for free first before trying to sell it. She called me a scammer and said what I was doing wasn’t very neighborly. I told her that I used the item for several months and wasn’t scamming anyone. I didn’t see anything wrong with making a few dollars here and there. I have given away several things to our neighbors that I didn’t want to go through the effort of selling and I honestly don’t care what they do with them. I understand that it may be the “neighborly” thing to try and find someone that can use them first before selling but I don’t think I’m an a***hole. In my opinion (which may be wrong, that’s why I’m posting this) if someone gives away something for free, it’s out of their hands once someone picks it up. So AITA for selling items that were given to me for free? 


Edit to add: The Facebook group isn’t a specifically “buy nothing” group. It’s a neighborhood group and people post about what’s going on, sell/give away items, etc. I only picked up items I actually had a need for at the time. I never picked anything up with the intention of selling. Most of the time the post will just say “free bag of clothes on curb” with the address. Anyone could pick it up.",0.33

"AITA for not buying cigs for a minor? Hi all, I (18M) have a friend (16F) and one day, out of nowhere, she asked me if I could buy her booze and some cigarettes. (18 is the legal age in my country, so I could buy them and she could not)

I was okay with the alcohol, but the cigarettes were a bit too much for me. Even though she kept trying to convince me, I just refused. 

I know that she already smokes, so it probably wouldn't be *that* bad, but still, it just felt wrong to me.

So, AITA?

edit (cus i'm kinda stupid to not mention it before): the alcohol is justified for me because I can just say ""it's for me"" if somebody asks and it would be normal, but I'm not gonna admit I'm buying cigarettes for myself even though I don't smoke.
Also it's pretty common in my country for teens to drink.

"AITA for wanting my partner to contribute more to our household rather than blow his money on an expensive trip for himself? Several months ago my partner moved across the country to live with me after years of maintaining a long distance relationship. He makes far less money than I do, so I recognized that I would need to shoulder the majority of the financial responsibility - house, food, utilities, etc., and that he would contribute what he could. He already owed me money from the long distance years and I've rarely brought it up. Since living together, household costs have gone up three or four times more than I was paying before - far more than I originally thought we would be spending when he moved here; and I also pay for the majority of the food for both of our dogs, so dog expenses have doubled as well. It is now to the point that I have wracked up a fair amount of credit card debt to compensate for the additional costs, of which he is aware. He consumes a lot more electricity (leaves lights on, etc.) and eats at least three times as much as I do, to the point that when I go to make breakfast or lunch, the food is gone and I have to dine out or pick up even more groceries. He always seems to have money for booze, vapes and fast food when he's on his way home from his part-time job, but is unable to commit to a monthly amount to contribute to bills, etc. When I have brought up the idea of a regular monthly household contribution, or cost cutting measures such as turning out the lights when not in a room or leaving me half of whatever food may be in the fridge rather than finishing it all off (leftovers, for example), he gets upset and it almost always results in some sort of argument.   
So here's the thing - he has recently discovered that he is going to be getting a considerable tax return and has started to plan to use the money on a vacation for himself, without me. While I recognize that he should be able to treat himself to something fun or nice, I also feel that he should be at least offering to pay me back for a portion of the debt I've incurred these past few months. However, he hasn't offered to do so and doesn't seem to understand why I don't like the idea of him choosing to blow the majority of his tax refund on a trip when our household costs are so high and he is in debt (both to me and to others). AITA for wanting him to contribute more to our household rather than blow his money right away on a trip for just himself?",0.21
"AITAH for telling my parents to kick out my cousin and her child? My cousin is 40+ years old and she's an alcoholic.  She's a single mother with a Kindergartener. My parents took her in when the baby was born because they didn't want to see her couch surfing and see the baby be taken advantage of.

My cousin can not hold a job past 2 weeks because she acts very loud, obnoxious, dresses inappropriately and steals stuff. My parents do not ask her for money and in fact have told her they don't want her money. They just want a safe place for the child to call home. The problem with that is she constantly is out of the house until all hours at night with her child. My husband works in a jail and he suspects she does drugs (he's experienced people on drugs from his work).

Everyday/evening is another party or funeral that my cousin has to attend and she constantly drinks and takes her daughter with her.

My cousins room (that she and her child share) is full of garbage and crap. You literally can't see the floor and the room smells weird. This is very out of place for my parents. My mom keeps the house so clean on a daily basis that you could actually eat off the floor (not that anyone would).

I don't talk to my cousin anymore because she's a narcissist that likes to make me feel like crap but she sucks up to my siblings. Also, I don't like that she is using her child as a meal ticket for a roof over her head.

Am I the Asshole for telling my retired parents that they need to kick my cousin out so they can enjoy their life and their retirement?",0.11
"AITA for supporting my daughter's sports preference against her mom's opinion? I just had a fight with my ex-wife, who I unfortunately still live with until we sell our house, over sports. Our daughter is 12 very soon, she's 5'2 and skinny and entering 6th grade. She has celiacs, so diet and nutrition are a concern and we've been working for a couple years to get her weight up and she actually had an appointment today with her GI and they were really happy with her weight gain and said she doesn't need to be seen every 6 months anymore. But she is a healthy, tall, beautiful, amazing kid and she plays rough.

This evening we were talking to her about picking sports. She's been playing girls soccer off and on through different recs for a few years but she's not great at it and she wanted to try something new. She was interested immediately in girls volleyball because her PE teacher had told her she was good at it and we also both think she would be fantastic at it. However she asked what crosscountry was and when I explained it she was really interested in that and wanted to do that. My ex immediately became adamant that she could not do CC. She said that CC requires a specific diet and because my daughter is a picky eater and already has celiacs she was afraid it would be bad for her health because she wouldn't keep up with the carbs and that it was bad for her joints. This upset my daughter because she is very sensitive about the things that she is prevented from doing because of her celiacs and started crying. Then my ex brought up that running and high impact running can affect periods and that my daughter is showing signs of starting her period soon and she doesn't want that to be rough for her or be delayed because of running. I had a really hard time understanding the logic of this. Despite this and trying to keep the peace I tried to help my daughter come around by suggesting that I think she would be really great at VB and she's also interested in VB so maybe she should just do that, and try track in the spring instead. That pissed off my ex again saying that no she feels very strongly that it wouldn't be good for her health to be in a running sport and then of them kept arguing. She said you can play soccer or volleyball or whatever but I don't want you doing cross country or track. I made the comment ""you know a soccer player on average runs more than 2 miles in a game, same as CC"". She flipped out and yelled about me trying to get my way and stormed out. I went and talked to her and we argued. I told her she was being manipulative and hurting our dhtrs feelings by bringing up celiacs and that it was completely illogical that she couldn't do CC if she could do the other sports and that other girls can play all these sports. She was upset and crying and wanted me to leave so I left. She says I undermined her,, but I think that I did my best to convince my daughter to go along with what her mom said but when my daughter still wanted to do it I couldn't just back her mom up because it didn't make sense to me.",0.12
"AITA My Boyfriend’s AP can’t stop him from texting me all day  I dated a guy for a year. I met his kids and was supposed to meet his family. We had summer plans with all of our kids. He told me he wasn't sleeping with anyone else and he stopped scrolling.

Then, he just started sleeping with another woman who still lives with her husband who didn't even know they were ""separated"". 

Boyfriend tells new girl we weren't exclusive, so she accepts it and thinks I'm crazy because I'm upset that she basically moves in with him after sleeping with him on the first date. She continues to live with her husband and sleep with my guy. But, I don't put up with that, so I'm out.

MIL brought dinner and brownies for dessert. I (F39) have 4 daughters 19 (Livy), almost 4 (Charlotte), 2 (Rose) and an infant (Sadie). Most of us were eating in the living room except my MIL and Charlotte (MIL's very obvious favorite). Charlotte is very silly. She was joking with MIL saying she was going to eat 1 brownie; no, 2 brownies; actually 3 brownies. MIL responded ""you can't do that, you're going to get fat!"" Immediately Livy looked at me, mouth gaping open and eyes wide like ""did you just hear that?"" I was so frustrated because she's still a toddler, she's rail thin and we struggle to put weight on her, we don't say things like that to anyone and I grew up with a very negative body image and disordered eating. I messaged my husband what she said and asked him to address it because I was way too upset in that moment. I said ""well girls, it's bedtime"" then I grabbed both of my toddlers and hauled them up to bed, hoping my husband would say something because it was wildly inappropriate. When I came down, they were gone and husband said he didn't address it because he didn't hear it. So he doesn't know what to say. Both my teenager and I explained exactly what was said and why it was so upsetting. I wanted it done right away because MIL has a history of saying shitty things and acting like she didn't mean it the way it was taken or pretending she never said it at all. Out of her 3 daughters in-law, I'm the only one that has any semblance of a relationship with her. Husband knows this, so when I bring up something against her, he takes it personally because he wants me to like her. He also knows I don't not like her, like my SILs. Husband also knows I try to keep the peace and am not comfortable confronting his mother because I can be more emotional than him. Also, if it were my own mother, I would have spoken directly to her because I'm more comfortable with her, but she would never say something like that to my kids. Husband thinks I'm the AH because he thinks I'm looking for a reason to not like his mom or that I should have just confronted her myself because I was upset about it.

"AITA for wanting a contingency plan if our relationship doesn't work out? My boyfriend (30M) and I (30F) have been together less than a year, but we are very much in love and actively planning a future together. 

He’s chasing his dream job in a different state and we want to rent an apartment together with the end goal of marriage. I would need to move two states away and find a new job to join him (it would be my first time living with a partner) which I'm happy to do - with some conditions.

The assholeishness: I tend to be more of a realist while he is more of a hopeless romantic. He has no ‘plan b’ for us and it deeply upsets him that I think/talk about the following: how I would like a remote job just in case things don't work out and I could move back to my home state and not be up a creek without a paddle... or that we should find an affordable rent that he could afford on his solo salary just in case.. or how I’m worried going 50/50 on every large ticket price furniture item ($1k+) and not knowing how we would divvy it up.

I feel like I'm being responsible, but I think he’s worried I don’t fully love him or I’m keeping myself one foot out the door, which couldn’t be further from the truth.

"AITA for canceling my family x-mas trip  the past 8 years, my mom & her hubs have driven 6-7 hrs with their RV to visit us before Christmas, they see me, hubs & 3 kids plus my step sister & her son. They stay for 2-3 days at a RV park (not a campground) about 1.5 hours from our house. They rent the “clubhouse” actually the employee break room that they still use while rented.  we’re not allowed to stay in their 6-bed RV, and tents aren’t permitted at the park. So We visit for a day, and they usually come to our apartment the next.

Last year, after the clubhouse rental, we left because it was raining & they wouldn’t let us stay in the RV. The next day, I asked if they’d visit as usual, but my mom avoided answering until almost 3 PM, leaving the kids wondering all day. She said they were thinking of leaving early the next morning like 3am. I tried  to get them to come for dinner and games but she ghosted me until they left around 7 AM.
That entire situation made me disappointed. I feel like with each trip it seems more like a just get it over with trip. 

for the last three years, I’ve suggested we go to a real campground for a better experience for the kids, hiking trails, a lake something more than a parking lot with a park. I told my husband after last years trip that it was the last time I’d go to the RV lot. I’ve offered to pay for camping spots, pick closer spots to them but it all falls on deaf ears. 
So this  year, my mom asked for campground suggestion but ended up finding one herself that was perfect—activities for the kids, grass, trees, trails, and rock climbing. Excited, I agreed to camp there and said “we will camp anywhere like this”

But then, she texted me the next day saying, “This is where we decided to pick, let me know if I should rent you a tent spot.” I saw the campground name and quickly agreed, thinking it was the same one she’d found. But when I checked the map, I realized she had booked a different campground ran by the same organization hence the confusion—it’s a dirt parking lot in the desert, four hours away, with no trees, no trails, no activities, and a prison nearby. When I confronted her, that maybe she booked the wrong site she claimed it was the right one and sent a picture of the receipt with a “you’re welcome.”
she went on and offered to find another spot an hour further away. This area isn’t even known for camping; it’s in a dead town between our 2 states known for  bad  weather, I don’t want to get rained out in a tent while we’re not allowed in her RV. 

I feel like she bait and switched me. She sent a zoomed in picture of the map so I couldn’t see the name of the campground, no heads up she switched the location,Just booked and this is where we decided and it’s nowhere like what we discussed. When I continued to say it wasnt what I agreed to she said, “You told me you’d camp anywhere,” listing reasons why she HAD to pick that one.

I’ve ghosted her since. 
Am I  asshole for canceling this trip?

ETA: 
Reasons she had to pick the spot: 
With her weight and age it’s hard for her to travel more than hour, she has to stop for 20-30 min cause of her “traveling anxiety” she is over weight but not obese, she still walks her dog and works. 
Place she booked is 5 hours away from her vs 8 hours at original place 

The club house rental was more than $500 or not available; she didn’t explain which it was. 

She wants to bring my step brothers baby (2 years old); doesn’t know how the well the baby will do traveling long hours but hasn’t even told my step brothers her plan to take his baby.

"AITA for wanting more photos of me from my school production? I am a senior in High School and was recently in my final High School production. The show has a pretty ensemble cast, but everyone (including the director) agreed that there were only really 5 characters who mattered to the plot. I was lucky enough to be cast as one of them. I was in both acts, but my part was almost entirely in the second half of the first act. Within this chunk I was in two large scenes, Three songs as a soloist (two of which I led for the majority of the songs) and two other songs as part of a featured ensemble group (still as the character). In the second act, however, I was in three scenes for very small portions of time, largely in the background with a line here or there (essentially ensemble).

This week, we got the photos back (in the form of a $25 dollar photo book) and I found out I was only in 9 of the 80+ photos. Turns out the photographer had conveniently left for the exact half an hour my character spent on stage in the first act and there is no photo record of it happening at all. In most of the photos that actually feature me I am in the background (one has my back in it) and only two actually have me as a subject of the photo. The other four main characters had at least 20 photos with them in it for reference. This error doesn't just affect me though, there is also a group of the ensemble who only appear when I do (in fact they appear less in the second act than I do), so these people have also been screwed over. 

I don’t feel that I am more important than the other cast members, but this was something I’d been looking forward to since before I started attending the school five years ago. Professional photos have always been my favourite form of memorabilia as I enjoy seeing facial expressions and specific moments as well as them being a cool keepsake. I also planned on using the photos for my resume as they would have been pretty cool and now I have nothing I could use. These productions are my livelihood and I tend to get a little depressed when they end, so these photos would also help with that. 

As I mentioned I was a little upset when I found out, so I said one or two throwaway comments that were something along the lines of ""damn they missed all of my scenes?"" and “where’d he go for so long?” I tried to be very light-hearted about it and not at all accusatory, but several friends and the teacher who directed told me to calm down and that I was being dramatic as there were still photos of me.

Previous productions have never had this happen (I know this as I have been in some of them, but never a lead role) and they even recorded them for cast members to see (which also didn't happen for whatever reason this year). My teacher was under a lot of stress and I don't blame him for it. I also understand that there is nothing I can do to change that this happened, but I feel I still have the right to be a little upset.

"AITA for not texting my GF back when I have been feeling sick all day? GF & I have been together since April. Things started really well, but we started spending a ton of time together. Like she would spend the night every night, but I honestly enjoyed spending time with her.

After a month or so I felt like I wasn't getting my own space and she would become very insecure (accuse me of talking to other girls, cheating). 100% transparency, I was not talking to any other girls as I have failed in all my relationships, and I wanted to give 100% in this one. So naturally being accused of something when I have done nothing wrong was beginning to turn me off. One thing I did do wrong, was after about 3 months when we would argue, I would raise my voice and yell, because despite me being honest with her, it felt like she didn't understand me, and I was always in the wrong. 

One day after we had a talk about our relationship and our goals for the relationship, she came over gave me my key and said she was done. I let her go, but we met up the next day and talked about it. She even gave me her notebook to read her boundaries and insecurities, and I actually took the time to sit down, read it, and write my notes on her notebook. So we agreed we would take things slowly this time and truly get to know each other. 

  
Fast forward to yesterday. I felt terribly ill and didn't want to talk to anyone. She mentioned in the past texting was big to her (let's be honest, a lot of people feel the need to text) but texting is whatever to me. I'm more of a lets hangout in person and talk kinda guy. But anyways she texted me, and I replied & we went back and forth, but her last text I didn't reply to. Figured i'd just talk to her when she gets off work, not a big deal. So hours go by and i'm just dying in my bed the whole day. She calls me, crying saying she was worried about me because I didn't text back. It felt like she didn't care how I felt, and solely was just feeling anxious. So I say I don't know what to say, because I have been home sick all day and if she was really that worried she could have texted or called. She got angry saying she's not going to text again because she already did. So now I'm getting angry because I feel like it doesn't matter how I feel, I'm obligated to reply. So she once again says she's done and that I need to stay single and to leave her the F\*CK alone. So I said, ""you're acting like a psycho"" and she hung-up on me. AITA???",0.44
"AITAH if I 38M continue to push my wife 38F to have more physical intimacy? So my wife and I have been married for over 15 years. I love my wife we do so much together we have 3 amazing kids we watch movies together we travel as a family every chance we get. Our schedules can be crazy she is busy with schooling the kids, taking them to functions and their extra curricular activities.  I work in most cases from 7:00 am until I stop answering my phone which sometimes is 9–10pm. We have been fortunate enough to be able to keep my wife at home as stay at home mom/teacher. Over the past several years our argument has always been we don’t have enough sex or physical intimacy. She has gone on to say that she just doesn’t need it, that it  doesn’t bother her if she doesn’t have sex, and that she doesn’t like it when I touch her all the time or plush her to relax and enjoy sex by making her climax.
She mentions that it has begun to feel like a chore. I know there are many ways to intimate with your spouse other than sex and I know I can try harder to be closer to her in other ways. But it is frustrating to have to ask for sex 2-3 times a week just to be told well I am not in the mood, the kids are still awake maybe you should put them to bed, or I will just give you a hand job okay. I love the way my wife feels next to me, I love to be that vulnerable with her and only her, I love to see her enjoy our time together. Am I the asshole for pushing my wife to be more intimate?",0.79
"AITA for sleeping with a co worker vs my significant other sleeping with a friend?  9 year relationship here just trying to get some perspective. 
Around 4-5 years ago me and my significant other decided to have fun sexually and try new things. She wanted to have sex with another woman and told me i (male) could as well. She found someone shes been friends with for years to try this experience with. I was ok with it and her friend understood too. So they eventually hung out and had sex. She said she had fun and thats awesome. They are still friends to this day and hang out here every once in a great while.
Now i wasnt in a rush to have my turn with another woman so a few years later a co worker of mine who ive maybe interacted over work a few times asked about a summer fling with me i was fairly new to the job so she didn’t know i was in a relationship and apologized. I told my significant other about it and she told me to try. So i started conversations and told my co worker the deal me and my girl had and that if everyone is ok with it id take my turn and have fun. It took a few weeks and multiple check ins with my girl to make sure she was ok with it and she said yes to it more than once maybe i was overthinking it but i just wanted to make sure. So finally me and my co worker have sex. My significant other gets mad i did it, tells me that it’s different vs girl on girl and im told that what i did was considered cheating. After that a week later that co worker moves for college. Cause it truly was a one and done thing. My girl thinks i had real feelings for this girl and that guy on girl sex is more intimate than girl on girl so i must have feelings to even have sex with another girl. This girl was a co worker and more of a friend not someone id consider a relationship with. If im in the wrong then i am but im confused. Sex is sex to me regardless what gender on what. I think girl on girl can be intimate too and on the same level as guy on girl. Id like peoples takes on this cause now im a “cheater” and my relationship is on the line over it . Am i the asshole?

"AITA for asking my bf to pay for my nails? My boyfriend makes like 300-400K a year which is great for him. I am so proud of him. He loves to spoil me by paying for my nails n such. I on the other hand do not make a lot of money at all. I make minimum wage and I’m paying off debt. Due to this, I don’t spend lots of money nor do I pamper myself. 



My boyfriend the other day tells me to get my nails done Cus he finds it attractive and he told me to not worry as he’ll pay for them. He said to tell him the amount n he’ll cover it. I get them done and I forget to tell him the amount. A day goes by and on FaceTime I show him my nails and he loves them. I then ask if he’ll pay for them like he said he would he says yes! And sends me the money. I do not have direct deposit so I was busy n gonna accept it later before bed. 

Right as I’m in bed I get a notification saying he canceled the deposit. I thought maybe something is wrong with his bank so I screen shot n send it to him. He texts me back saying “I’m not an atm”. If he didn’t offer to pay for my nails I would have NEVER gotten them done as it is a luxury that I cannot afford :(

"AITA for asking for proof of purchase of essential things my friend bought with my loaned money ? I have a friend, let's called him Sam. Sam have been hit hard by retrenchment and I understand it. He said he need $$$ for food and essential stuff for his family.

Feeling sad for him I decided to loan him $500 (my local currency) , asking him to pay me back like $20 every month with no interest. $500 should be enough to last him 2 months of food for family of 3.

However, after 2 weeks, he said he out of money. I ask him if he used the money to buy food, he said yes but not enough. Feeling suspicious, I said I am willing to loan him another $500 but a the condition he submit the receipt and picture of what he is buying with the money.

He begin to lash out and accusing me of insincere of helping and wanting to post the pictures to social media to gain ""fame"". I said I have no intention of it but he said am I lying before leaving,

"AITA for blaming my friend and saying her mother has every right to ground her? This can be quite long, but please stay with me.
I (19f) have a best friend(18f) that I'm going to call A. A and I have been friends for about 8 years. She lost her father when she was 13 and now lives with her mother and brother. Her mother can be strict, but she's a nice woman. 
A changed her school about three years ago, and the kids there were more 'laid back', drinking, staying out late, not caring about school..
I didn't mind her new friend group at all, but after some time, I could see how they were affecting her. I didn't say anything at the time because I didn't think it was my place to do so.
Now, She's out until very late almost evey night. She has failed 8 of her subjects on her last report card and lied to her mother about it. Her mother cares about her a lot, but being a single parent, she's busy working, and she really trusts A, so she doesn't question her.
A few days ago, I received a call from A asking me to let her stay the night because she didn't want to go back home.
Unfortunately I couldn't as I wasn't even in the city. I told her she needed to go back, but she brushed me off.
Today, we spoke about it again, and she told me about how she got into an argument with her brother and left her house. She turned off her phone and didn't inform any family members where she was. Later, when she finally turned it on, she saw a lot of miscalls from her mother. Apparently, they also get into an argument after she calls her back, and that's when she called me. A ends up spending the night at a friend's house without informing anyone. Her mother had to work a late shift until 2 a.m., so she wasn't aware of it, and after she got home, she tried calling her, but A had her phone off again.
In the morning, when A got home, they got into another huge argument, and now she's grounded. (Her mother was up almost all night, calling her friends and trying to see where she was.)
A told me all of this in a group chat we had with another friend (20f, I'm calling her B). In response, I told her that her mother had every right to be angry with her. I went on to explain that everywhere in the world, young women could be in danger, and our parents have every right to be worried. It took less than 5 minutes to text or call her mother and inform her of what happened.
A went on to say that she was an adult and she had every right to do whatever she wanted, and B started backing her up.
I tried explaining to them why they were wrong, but they ganged up on me, saying that they don't need my opinion and I was being ridiculous. At some point, they began to ignore me, throwing insults, and making fun of me like I wasn't there. I called them childish and immature for not saying what they wanted to my face and left the group chat, but I'm well aware that they're talking about me behind my back. I don't think I'm in the wrong, but they got to me.
So I'm asking here, AITA?",0.58

My girlfriend who we’ll call Janice used to sleep with the current boyfriend of her friend who is having the baby shower, her friend does not know but I do because my girlfriend and I share everything about our past.

"AITAH for asking if his hair is real Okay so I personally don't think I was rude but my friend does so now I'm here.

Me f21 and my friend f22 were at an anime convention and then at the pride festival going on in my city that were happening at the same time. This happened at after the convention while we were at pride.

Me and my friend bought some food and were sitting down at the tables. Two people came over and sat next to us so we ended up talking to them for a while. Well while we were talking I noticed how long the guys hair was. I opened up the conversation by asking if it was real before I asked how he takes care of it and how long he's been growing it. He was super nice and seemed totally fine talking about his hair and how long he's been growing it, how he's been taking care of it ect. I have been trying to grow out my hair for a while now and any advice and tips are helpful.

Now my thought process when asking was, first I just came from a conversation where everyone was wearing cosplay wigs. Two if they were extensions then they were damn good extensions and I wanted to know where he got them so I can get some. In my mind asking if it was real wasn't meant to be rude, it was definitely more meant as a segway into asking for tips.

Later while I was driving us home my friend had brought it up and told me that it threw her off when I asked because it was a very rude question. She said I was lucky to get a positive reaction because someone else might not be so nice when I ask something like that. Am I in the wrong here?",0.07
"AITA for my fashion sense?  So, I(23F) often visit my bf (23M) who works at a grocery store after work, to buy the groceries of the day, see him and catch a ride home on my days off. 

I wear a lot of mushroom themed clothing items, mushroom earrings, knit cardigans, bandanas, maxi skirts, knit socks, doc martens, etc…you know the type. Sometimes, I wear other styles of clothing. For example, I’ll wear striped stockings, a black maxi skirt, boots, an antique style pendant and an Edwardian blouse with my hair in a Gibson bun.

I do like dressing the way I want to dress. Now, my bf does not particularly like this. He doesn’t openly hate it most of the time, but he will sometimes just look at me like I’m weird, or give me that “look”. 

Last week, I was wearing a pink plaid dress, a pink cardigan, a red beret, white stockings, a pink purse and Mary Jane shoes. I got a few compliments on my outfit that day, and those made me feel confident.

I came down to visit him as usual and he looked at me extra long with that “look”. He kind of sighed, and told me that he wishes I dressed normally and said that I’m generally too much with my outfits.  He was openly irritated with me. 

This has been a repeated sentiment. He’ll ask me how I’m not boiling in so many layers, and make silly faces eyeballing my outfits. I try to laugh it off but it makes me feel bad. He’ll side eye me sometimes before I leave the house with him if I’m wearing something that seems too eccentric to him to be seen in public with me. 

Lately I’ve been dressing in graphic tees and jeans and he’s told me it’s so much better because he likes the naturalness/non high-effortness of it, but it’s got me a bit down to be honest.

"AITA for ruining family game night? Basically me and my family were playing a card game called ‘last card’. There are lots of rules so i won’t explain them all but the rule im mad about is that if you place an 8, it rewinds so it becomes your turn again, so i had 3 cards, a J (which is special) and 8 (the rewind) and a K (normal card). The J makes it so you can place any card on top of it, and btw when you place a special card as your last card you must take another card. I placed a J and an 8, making it my turn again, said ‘Last card’ and then placed a K which is not a special card. then my family started calling me a cheater and barraging me because, since i placed 2 specials, the entire turn becomes special and therefore i must place another card. i disagreed because the 8 didn’t make it a continuation of my turn, it made it a seperatly turn of my own, therefore i didn’t place the specials in the same turn and that means that i win. I have autism and the fact that everyone was shouting at me made it hard to get my words out and i started crying and just stormed off. now i’m sitting in my room alone and i hear people saying that i ‘ruined game night’ and that i always argue and cheat for no reason. so AITA?

"AITA for inviting my childhood male best friend over to my house after my boyfriend said we're allowed to be friends with the opposite gender?
 I 20F and my boyfriend 21M have been dating for a year. I was over at his house when i saw he was giggling and smiling when texting someone. I asked who he was texting and he said nobody. I looked and saw a girl called olivia. I asked who she was and he said just a classmate. I got upset and asked why he lied to me and he got defensive and angry. He told me guys and girls can be friends without it being weird and i should stop being so insecure. So i went back to my house.

He didnt talk for a week and he randomly hit me up asking how my day was and if he wanted to doordash me some food. I said no my friend is cooking for me. He came over to my house and saw my best friend rin 20M. We’d known each other for 17 years. 

My bf asked why he didnt know about rin and i told him in the past, our exes always didnt feel comfortable that me and rin knew each other for 17 years even though our relationship was always platonic. Its never crossed tat boundary. We were practically raised next door as siblings. 

But to respect our exes wishes we kept our contact through text only. We are both huge introverts so it wasnt a big deal. We kind of preferred it that way. 

So i told my boyfriend that and said its different now because hes the oly guy i dated that was okay with guys and girls being friends. He asked to speak to me in a different room and yelled at me again saying this looks wrong and stuff. I told him hes the one that said guys and girls can only friends and to stop being so insecure. He realised i threw his words back in his face and now is under the assumption i did all this to make him jealous.

Which i didnt because i didnt even know he would text me that day. We’d been ignoring each other for a week. I told him to leave me alone and talk to me once he got his head correct. He apologised the next day and asked to start over. 

I thought that would be the end of it but since then he’s been over at my house every day. Whenever i go out he asks who with. When i tell him some friends he always invites himself. When im texting people he always asks who im texting and peeks at my messages. I dont have a probem with him going through my phone, im not a cheater, but to do it every time i pick up the damn thing is annoying.

My friend group is divided. Some think it was nasty for me to use rin that way to make my bf jealous (which i didn’t. We just happened to hang out on the same day my bf decided to text me after a week of radio silence) and the other half think that its eye opening to see he was okay being friends with a girl from his class and i was just expected to be okay with it, but reacts this way to me having a 17 year old friendship that he didnt know about

I feel like im not TA but i want to ask outside opinions. AITA?

"AITA For Not Allowing My Coparent to attend every event or experience on my days? 

I'm a 40-year-old divorced mother of two who ended an abusive and toxic relationship with my ex ten years ago. Although he wasn't very present for the kids back then, he's made some improvements in recent years, after my sacrifices, career sacrifices, and hard work. Despite our generally amicable relationship, I struggle with intense dislike and stress when he's around. My ex was abusive, mainly emotionally and financially abusive, which leaves me with lingering issues being around him.
We have a 50/50 custody arrangement and split holidays, so both of us get time with the kids for special occasions. Recently, though, he's been pushing to do everything together as if we were still a couple. This has caused conflicts because I feel our agreed-upon arrangement allows us to alternate special days and split holidays as per our court order, and I don’t want him to interfere or control these moments.
In the past, I tolerated him joining celebrations and parties, even though I did most of the planning and covering costs. Despite the façade of a good relationship, his behavior often overshadowed the events, turning them into occasions where he exerted control and insulted me.
This morning, I'm anxious about the first day of school. He called yesterday wanting to coordinate, but I declined because it's too stressful to wait for him while trying to get children to school. His arrival is usually late and disruptive, which affects my ability to get my children, including my new child not from this relationship, ready for school. Although he agreed to meet us at the school instead, it still dictates how my morning will go and I still have to see him today rather than just celebrating with my children as I prefer. 
Regarding sports weekends, he often shows up unannounced on my weekends, imposing his schedule and taking over the activities. Our court order specifies that the parent who signs the kids up for activities can take them on their days, but he disregards this, leading to conflicts and stress. I feel that he can enjoy sports with him on his weekends and I can enjoy sports with him on mine. Sure there may be weekends we both go, but that should be an exception in my mind.
I’m uncertain if I should continue to “suck it up” for the kids’ sake or set clearer boundaries to ensure that I have personal, enjoyable moments with my children. It seems that other divorced couples manage boundaries and separate their time more effectively, and I wonder if I’m being unreasonable in wanting the same for myself and my kids. 

AITA for wanting us to follow our court order and have the experiences with our children on our own days so that I can enjoy my own unencumbered experiences and memories with my children that are not controlled, dictated by, or rife with conflict between us wherein he blows up at me over minuscule things and engages in emotional abuse?",0.22
"AITA for asking someone if they need a surgery? 
My assistant manager told me that she has severe neck pain. She ended up taking a leave for 3 weeks, and came back with a neck brace. She proceeded to tell the whole office about how she’s going for physiotherapy, and she needs to go to back to her home country for treatment. Since we sit next to each other, i waited for her to get back to her seat so that I could ask her about it in private. I then asked her if she requires surgery, and the woman just started yelling at me. She said it was a horrible for me to say and i had to hear that rubbish in front of so many other colleagues.

Another colleague backed her by saying that I did a similar thing before by telling her that she’s lucky that she hasn’t had a wisdom tooth extraction (For context: One day, we were sent a flier from some company about the dental services they offer, and we started discussing  the procedures we’ve had like braces or teeth whitening and so on, and I told them I had a wisdom tooth removal a few months ago and it was very painful, and she’s lucky it she hasn’t had to get it removed).

I don’t understand how it’s a bad thing to ask someone if they require a surgery to have a medical problem fixed. I only asked her because I was concerned for her, not because I want her to have to go through something so painful.

Btw this manager sits next to me and we have chill conversations all the time. Was what I said really that bad?

"AITA for ignoring and avoiding my boyfriend's sister  Me and my bf's sister have been friends for around 3 years now. While it's obvious that she cares about me she's been pushing this friendship too hard to the point where I don't want to see her. She started calling me her bestfriend when our relationship is definitely not at that level, she calls me and rants about the same things over and over again when she knows I hate phone calls, she tells me she loves me every other sentence, she's very touchy feely when she knows I hate physical touch from friends and she's generally just too much for me to handle. I'm afraid I genuinely don't like her and I can't stand her. I reluctantly share some complaints like asking her to touch me less or call me less which she does respect but not to the extent that I want in my friendships.

We had a long distance marriage because he couldn’t come to my country (visa problems) but last year he came here and we lived with my mother for half a year. My mum hates him because he didn’t help much around her house and he wanted to spend some alone with me when we lived there, so when we came from work he wanted to take me out but my mother got angry that we don’t help her. Then, after 6 months, she gave me an ultimatum- her or him. I couldn’t decide so she decided for me and forced us to move elsewhere. In the meantime, sometimes when I met her, I complained about a few regular things we fought about with my husband and when we had one big fight, I told her about that and she used the vulnerable moment and took me to a lawyer to file for a divorce. Now I’m not sure about the divorce and she told me if I don’t divorce him and don’t come live with her, she will cut me off from her life. 
Notably, my husband is not perfect and sometimes the different cultures cause us to struggle to find a compromise, but I still love him. However, I don’t want to lose my mother either.

"AITA for weighing a young girl in front of her friends and embarrassing her? So I work at a waterpark and one of my shifts is at the top of our body slide. We are required to weigh everyone, as there is a maximum and minimum weight. This is to keep people safe. I’ve never really had any problems because usually I only see the weight and it isn’t visible to other people in the line. So 2 days ago I did the routine step on the scale procedure on this girl who looked 12-14 years old. She had 2 friends with her. She wasn’t fat but was probably 5”5 140lbs. Her friends were tall and skinny. So after some hesitation she steps on. Then one of her friends runs behind me and looks at the weight. She then starts laughing. Not obnoxiously but snickering. Her other friend is grinning. The girl jumps off the scale and gives me the saddest look I have ever seen. She goes down and her friends give me dirty looks and go down as well. I think nothing of it and finish my shift.

"AITA for not being more polite to my grandparents? I'm 15F (16 in 3 days). My grandparents come round our house every Sunday at 6pm, as they usually take my little sister (who's 9) out for the day and bring her back at this time. As I don't go out with them, they usually give me money when they come, usually £10. I'm really grateful for the money, but now that's what I look forward to the most when they visit and not actually talking to them. I feel bad about this. Nowadays I don't even stay down and talk to them, as EVERY TIME they come over they will say ""oh we'll only stay for five minutes"" and then stay for HOURS. At first I used to sit downstairs and socialise with then, but now I'm tired of spending my Sunday evenings making polite talk to my grandparents, who never seem to go and we can't get on with dinner and preparing for school the next day.

So the other day, I welcomed them in and made talk for like ten minutes. They gave me some pocket money and of course I said thank you and all, but then I instantly went upstairs and stayed there doing my own thing until they went.

I came back down and my parents told me what I was doing was rude. They said I just 'took my money and went'. While I understand that's a pretty rude thing to do, I'm just tired of spending my whole evening making polite small talk when I could be doing something else.

"WIBTA if I decide not to name my baby after my mum? TLDR at the bottom.

Myself and my husband have been trying for a baby for a few years, and I am finally pregnant. Both of our mums were single parents, and are both thrilled about a new grandchild.

My husband and I have been discussing names for a while now, and decided that while we don't want to use a family name as a first name, we would like to for a middle name. For a boy, it would be his uncle who was basically a father to him. For a girl, it would be a version of my mum's name.

Because of how involved our families have been in our journey, we've been open and honest about the middle names we liked. My mum was over the moon about it. She really has done everything she could for me, and she still continues to do everything possible to help us. But the problem I'm having is she's been making some really hateful comments and sharing horrible opinions about trans people and gender queer people. I've made it clear her ""jokes"" aren't funny but she will die on the hill of ""I am allowed my opinion"".

It is difficult to keep keep grabbing her and going out is awful with her. It is very difficult to keep her in one place. Ideally we just stay at my place but sometimes I am asked to a babysitter and I have stuff to do.


I have brought it up before and my daughter agrees she can be a runner but brushes it off and says kids will do that. She called me yesterday and asked me to babysit. I informed her I needed to go shopping and she told me to just take her with. 

We were at the mall and she tried to run five times and succeeded  two time in 30 minutes.  I stopped at a shoe store and bought her heels.  When they were on she was waddling around and couldn’t run. The rest of the trip went well and when she did try to make a break for it she got like 5 feet.


I dropped her off and my daughter was pissed I put her in heels. We had a huge argument about it and I am a jerk for doing that. I pointed out that it solved the issue and I wouldn’t of had to do something if she figured out a solution the multiple times I brought it up.",0.68
"WIBTA for increasing my brothers rent My younger brother (18) has been living with me over a year now, when he decided to finish school and go to work we got him a good paying job working with us and offered him our sleepout we have, a decent sized space, and recently renovated. I only charge $150 per week which includes internet, utilities and food, which is really cheap for where we're at considering the space he gets, with the agreement that he would start saving to buy his own place in the future. It went really well but now over the past few months we noticed he started eating out a lot, buying expensive clothes and partying a lot with friends, he recently bought a nice car with cash, that's ok i guess, he needed one but it did burn a bit of his savings, until recently he started dating a girl from work who had leave to return to her country now he's sending cash and saving to travel instead to visit her, I'm afraid financially this long distance relationship won't be viable in the long term and I feel like if he keeps this lifestyle up he's not going to be able to reach his original goal of buying his own house, WIBTA for increasing his rent to a more realistic price and save the money for myself instead? I kind of feel taken advantage of giving him a cheap place to live while he gets to enjoy the extra income instead of saving like we agreed.",0.19
"AITA for calling out my friend and BF for remaining friends with a girl who has been awful to me? My (26F) BF (30M) has been somewhat distant friends with a girl we'll call Cara for about 4 years. For time context, he and I have been together for about 3 years. He used to be much closer with Cara during COVID as a part of a larger friend group, but in the past 2ish years they speak only once in a while. 

  
From the jump, this girl has been unkind and unwelcoming to me. She literally told me that my eyes were ""brown like poop"" and teases my dog for being fat (which is true) but I am sensitive about my dog. It got a point where it felt like she was saying something targeting to me every time I saw her, but I just ate it. 

  
The conflict with Cara really escalated though when my bf and I broke up for about 4 days almost 2 years ago. We had just moved in together, and he was consistently shirking his share of household labor to go golfing 4-5 times a week. After multiple weeks of warnings, I left him a note that I was leaving while he was at the golf course, and I took off for my parents house. 

  
Here is where the problems really began with Cara-- as my bf and I started working through things and reconciling, she began texting our mutual friend about how much she disapproved of me, felt that I was lying to my bf, and believed that I was a bad partner for him. The texts were paragraphs long and HURTFUL. I even saw that our mutual friend had texted back agreeing with her, which I forgave her for because she was very apologetic. 

  
Recently, I made a joke about Cara being my ""arch nemesis"" while I was out with our mutual friend and my bf. My bf was hurt by this, saying that she is their friend and I shouldn't talk about her that way. My friend chimed in saying that I was overreacting, and that she never called me the things that I think she did. I ended up looking my friend in the eyes and saying ""you should know better than anyone else how she's hurt me."" referring to the text messages.  and then I left, alone. 

  
They think that I am TA for speaking to my friend that way, and for still holding a grudge against Cara after all of this time, who has flat out refused to speak to me in person in the last 2 years. So AITA for not just moving on to keep the peace? I feel like my friend and bf are TA for staying friends with someone who has treated me like this, and for sticking up for her when my friend couldn't even stick up for me when Cara was talking badly about me.

"AITA for sending my husband’s clothes in a cab after he asked me to come over?  
I (24f) and my husband (30m) have been together for 6 years and married for less than 1. We have mutual friends, mostly his friends that became mine. We hang out at each others houses and go out monthly on double/ triple dates. 

So, today I had to see doctor because I was having a fever and was diagnosed with a virus causing me to have flu, cough, fever. I also have headaches on and off. My husband left to go to one of his friends (30m) house at about 1pm. I left for the doctors at 3pm and  I came home at about 4pm. My husband gave me a call at 8pm asking me if I am coming over to the friends house. 
*Context: before he left, he did ask me if I will be going over and I told him “most likely no but least likely yes”. 

I took a 4 hour ‘nap’ after eating my medications. And at that moment was feeling better. So I told him yes. Then 4 mins later he called me again asking me if I could bring extra clothes for him so he could sleep over at the friends house. When I asked, “what about me” his reply was, “you can stay over if you want too or go back home”. I was quite taken aback because first of all I’m sick. Second of all, I have to take a cab to travel all the way to the other side of town, pass him some clothes and hang out with our friends for a few hours before taking another cab back home. Each cab ride costs about $30. 

So I told him I would send the clothes over to him in the cab and he can collect it. He called me an asshole for not coming. 

I messaged him telling him “Just so you know, if i was feeling well I wouldn’t have mind that you went to friend’s place and hang out with him or staying over. I’m sick so I didn’t come. I have to respect their family and not get anyone there sick. I have a virus and it could be infectious. Friend’s parents are old and her mum is already sick, I don’t want her to get more sick because of me putting her at risk” 

He apologised by saying “No im not angry for you not coming. I was just trying my luck to see if you would come. So sorry for asking you to come. This won’t happen in the future again”. 

He FaceTimed me 10 minutes after sending me the apology message to remind me to eat my medicines. After a while of two of us not talking (just awkward silence) I said bye. He told me I had an attitude, I just said ok and cut the line. 
*in my defence he wasn’t talking to me and I had nothing to say to him. So what’s the point of the phone call?* 

Him calling me an asshole reminded me of this thread, and I want to know if I actually was in the wrong for not going over? 

I think I might have been the asshole because I could have just gone over to hang out with all of our friends especially since I was feeling better and said I would come (before he told me he was staying over) and also I could have said something in the FaceTime call instead of just saying “ok” and hanging up. It did kinda seem like an asshole move especially since he apologised. 

Edit *thank you everyone for your comments. I see what wrong I’ve done here and shouldn’t have even thought about going to see my friends while I’m sick. I used the excuse of having to bring the clothes over as an excuse to be angry at my husband for not coming home and I should have better communication that. Moving forward, I’ll take better responsibility for both myself and others around me and I will do better to communicate with my husband. Thank you again! ",0.42
"AITA for telling my sister she's taking advantage of her boyfriend My sister and her boyfriend have been in a relationship for three years and lived together for two years. They're both mid 20s and it's the first time either has lived with a partner. 

Her boyfriend is super nice and shy which is great for her, but I think she is taking advantage of him. He won't say no to her. She has him doing all of the housework even though they both work full time. He does all of the cooking and cleaning and she basically doesn't lift a finger at home. 

She works in an office and he works from home, and she literally gets him to take her shoes off and massage her feet when she gets home from work. Sounds nice of him right? Guys, her feet reek. They always have, and she has no shame about it. She does this thing where she tries to get people to rub her feet even though she knows they're gross. 

So like good for her for finding a guy who will put up with her, but I think she is driving him away and that he is too nice to say anything about it. I told her that she needs to stop expecting so much from him. She said it's not my business. I'm trying to help both of them. AITA?",0.93
"WIBTA If I break my word and tell my fiancé his friend lied to him? I am a 32F, my fiance is 33M, and the friend in question is around our age M.  John is my fiance Mark's long time friend and John comes by once a week to work out with Mark and hang out.  John has a long history with a woman, June, who he has been in and out of a relationship with.  By all parties accounts, June is very toxic, an alcoholic, and makes John miserable every time they get back together.  Mark has expressed that he is fed up with watching John get mixed up with June time and again only for John to come vent to Mark when she inevitably makes John miserable.

Yesterday, John arrived before Mark came home from work.  I greeted him at the door and I could immediately see he was weathered.  When I asked what was wrong, he asked that if he told me that I not tell Mark.  I agreed.  He told me he had fucked up and reached out to June again and she had been trying to manipulate him into day drinking with her.  He expressed he didn't want Mark to know, because he knew Mark would give him a verbal lashing for getting back in contact with her.  I understood and was happy to keep this to myself and give emotional support, as I have been in many toxic relationships in the past and know how hard it is to get out of them.  Mark also has a very tough love style and doesn't beat around the bush when it comes to his opinions (personally, I adore this about him, but I've observed it can push away some people).

However, to my shock, as soon as Mark got home from work John went to him and instantly told him that June had ""messaged him out of the blue"" and was harassing him and wouldn't leave him alone.  I continued to overhear during their work out John spin a version of events to Mark where they could bash on June together and John was 100% innocent of the situation.

I am very conflicted now.  I was fine keeping John's situation private, but I don't like being a secret party to a lie where John can pretend he's being chased by a crazy woman instead of having a problem with continuing to return to the same poisoned watering hole and actively encouraging the bad relationship.

So reddit, would I be in the asshole if I told Mark the truth?

  
EDIT:  Thank you all so much for your thoughts.  I honestly didn't think I'd get more than a few responses.  After listening to you all, I first decided to talk to Mark.  

I talked to him about his boundaries concerning if someone we both knew asked one of us to keep something from the other.  He said ""I guess it depends on if it affects the other person"".  I decided for certain then those of you who said I should tell him were right and I did.  He wasn't upset with me, but is unhappy John would put me in a position like that.  He also realized that being so hard on John concerning June was pushing John deeper into her clutches.  We decided not to tell John about our conversation.  We also discussed further what either of us should do if the other person is asked to keep something a secret and decided we will do as many of you suggested and say ""I can't do that"".

I've also sent the following text to John:  ""I need to put down a boundary.  Don't confide something to me if you're going to turn around and sell Mark a false version. That doesn't sit right with me.  I'll keep your business private until your ready to open to another party, but I'm not willing to participate in a lie.""

Though I didn't say this in my text to John, I won't be agreeing not to share something with Mark in the future (unless it's a surprise for his birthday ;) )

I feel like both Mark and I have grown from this experience, and I thank you all for you help.",0.7
"AITA for making ""misogynistic"" comments and calling my cousin soft? So I (M19) have been on a family retreat that we do with my dad's side of the family once per year. Last night I went down with some of my cousins to watch some TV at night and I suggested putting on Better Call Saul. My cousin Emily (F16) said that she wouldn't watch it because it was ""sexist"" since there was only one female main character that only serves as a satellite to Jimmy (Saul.) I countered by explaining that it wasn't sexist since the story was about Jimmy and showcases the characters involved in his life, and since Kim is his law partner, girlfriend, etc. the show didn't need any more female main characters and simply inserting them in for the sake of diversity would just be shoehorning them in for no real reason, especially when there's nothing misogynistic about the show or Kim to begin with. Emily then doubled down by stating that's why the show was sexist and told me that my explanation was sexist, and I then told her that if she thought that was misogynistic she's just soft.",0.92
"AITA for asking my husband to take 2 hours out of his friend’s wedding day to celebrate our anniversary? DH and I are in our mid 30s, married 5 years. For a bunch of sad reasons, including covid, family illnesses, and my husband being just kind of immature, my experience of our wedding, engagement and honeymoon were really bad. I had been upset for a while, and DH and I had talked about doing a vow renewal just the two of us and taking a second honeymoon on our 5th anniversary. 

DH’s friend asked him to be in his wedding, on the same day as our anniversary, last spring. DH and I couldn’t communicate well about it, and he felt anxious and insecure, so we agreed to go even though it REALLY REALLY hurt my feelings to move our trip. We are taking a nice vacation, but we aren’t doing the vow renewal I wanted. I’ve been pretty depressed and upset about it. 

DH noticed I was upset, and told me he would plan a little brunch for us on our anniversary. DH’s friend is getting married on a resort, and the wedding doesn’t start until evening, so we figured there would be no problem. 

DH called his friend to explain the situation, and ask to be put in touch with their contact at the property to arrange something private for us at our expense for the morning. We don’t want to make a scene or anything, we just want to take a moment for ourselves, given it’s a special day for us too. DH’s friend said no. He got really defensive and basically asked my husband why he would even think to make such a request. It seems to be that he wants everyone to be together, apparently including me even though I did not agree to be in his wedding, all day. He wants to do some kind of hike or exercise I guess in the morning, but I’m really unclear. His response to my read was really negative, but I’m getting it second hand. 

So my question - AITA for setting up my anniversary brunch anyway, or leaving the property to do something to celebrate my anniversary during the day? We never should have agreed to this, and DH agrees we aren’t communicating well. But at this point, I feel like the groom is being an asshole by not giving us even a little bit of flexibility/ time to ourselves after I sacrificed my celebration for him. So AITA for doing it anyway? Also WIBTA if I told others at the wedding he said no to our request? ",0.75
"AITA for arguing with an elderly man in Germany about his age? My wife (43F) and I (43M) both visited Europe in June to about 9 cities (Berlin/Potsdam, Szczecin, Gdansk, Poznan, Wroclaw, Katowice, Ostrava, Prague, Dresden) and in Potsdam, I encountered a very old man on an electronic wheelchair at a very obscure royal museum (I believed he was born somewhere in the early to mid-1920s) but his story was very hilarious, because he supposedly worked for King Friedrich Wilhelm II back in the 18th century and he even showed his birth certificate in 1755 as well as his ID and German passport stating he was born in 1755 in a village close to Berlin.

I thought it was so preposterous, so he showed me a series of photos showing Berlin pre-WWII and there, it showed him and that he by that time (around 1936) already looking really old (like 80s/90s), which is absolutely insane. He even shown me signed papers for his service with his name on it from the Kingdom of Prussia as early as 1783, which is absolutely mind boggling. He has told all of us he tried to hide from the spotlight after about 1850 (when he was 95) to avoid getting spotted by news coverage, so all we know is the oldest person was Jeanne Calment, until about June of this year when an even older man born 120 years before (I thought more like 1922, but it was 1755) opened an obscure royal museum, and it is absolutely hilarious how he even outlived many major world events being born before the American Revolution.

He even showed me a painting that eerily looked similar to him in 1787 of which he wore a wig and looked like his 30s, which is absolutely insane. He even spoke to me in Prussian (don't understand Prussian) but could decipher that it sounds different from German or any Slavic language out there. When he was a child, he could recall seeing Potsdam look like a small royal village, and that many people wore powdered wigs as well as ride horse drawn carriages. He also witnessed several dead relatives, and according to him, his father's name is Dietrich von Koenigsmann and he lived between 1723 and 1785. His name was Johannes Wilhelm von Koenigsmann. He is a connoisseur of classical music and remembered meeting Mozart, of which Mozart would play multitudes of pieces by Mozart himself, Haydn, and Bach.

Before this, I always thought the upper lifespan of a person was around 110-115 years and many died in their 70s, 80s, or 90s, as even though both of my parents are still alive (84M, 83F), their parents all died.

My paternal grandfather lived between 1907 and 1988, my paternal grandmother lived between 1909 and 1992, my maternal grandfather lived between 1913 and 1996, and my maternal grandmother lived between 1918 and 2009.

"AITA My (26F) boyfriend (22M) will go on vacation with his gay friend  BEFORE YOU ALL COME AT ME PLEASE READ FIRST!!! 
My boyfriend has recently started hanging out with a guy who after a few days told him that he was gay. My boyfriend already kinda knew it so it wasn't a big surprise. He didn't really care anyways.  That day he came to me and told me that ""I think 'X' might flirt with me or try to make a move while on vacation"" because he saw some ""signs"" (idk). They still hadn't bought the tickets though so I just told him ""don't go if you think that there's this possibility"". Now here's where I'm uncomfortable. I really don't give a flying fck if it's a man or a woman. But I DO care that my boyfriend still ended up buying the tickets (aka making the trip official) with someone that HE (I never said anything about his friend. I didn't mind) thought was being/gonna be inappropriate. I know that my boyfriend would never do anything with a man because he is 100% straight so i don't worry of him cheating. But let me tell you a few details about his friend. He is in an open relationship with his boyfriend. They both like doing threesomes with married man, so they don't really care if someone is in a relationship to respect it. And that's why i now don't want him to go. I feel disrespected if my bf goes when he knows there's a big possibility (his words not mine) that his friend is gonna find an opportunity while he's there and flirt/make a move. It's all about respect. And then I asked him ""what are you gonna do is he actually does flirt or make a move?"" And he said ""just say no and continue with the trip"" AND. I. FLIPPED. Please DO correct me if I'm wrong but if I was in his shoes I wouldn't continue the trip like nothing happened. I would avoid that person until the last day because it would be disrespectful to my boyfriend to continue and hang out with him. I don't care if he's a man and that my boyfriend would never go with him. He is still SOMEONE that's probably gonna flirt with him while knowing he is in a relationship.

"AITA for telling her I probably won't be able to marry her? I messaged a girl on a casual dating site about a week ago. She seemed interested and sent me her private telegram. We hit it off and would be messaging each other daily, mainly in the morning and evenings. She has a history of being with some abusive partners and she told me she wasn't looking for a boyfriend but someone she could feel comfortable being physical with. Some of the messages got very frisky, multiple photos/videos/audio clips were exchanged. We met up for a date on Sunday - went for some brunch and an escape room. We got on really well and she started holding my hand. Following my suggestion, she invited me to her place so we could go for a walk. We had a great time and she started getting more cuddly in private. After we had dinner, a netflix and chill type situation occurred. We were together for around 8 hours that day but it felt like time had flown by.

The following day she messaged me telling me all she could think of all day was me. Then she asked me honestly how far I could see this going with her (we are from different cultural backgrounds). I really like her and enjoyed our time together but I felt it was important to be honest. So I told her I like her but due to our cultural differences we probably wouldn't be able to get married as my family likely wouldn't accept it.

She sent me a message the following morning saying she used to really liked me but I used her as a toy for my own pleasure and basically that I'm an arsehole.

From my perspective, she told me she wasn't looking for anything serious, we had a great time together, I care about her and I really enjoyed her company. We've also only been talking for 1 week and been on 1 date. I don't think I've been the arsehole here but I can see why she could be upset if she developed stronger feelings.

"AITA for excluding my obese friend from rock climbing? There’s this new rock climbing centre that just opened up at the mall.

She’s technically obese, and they told her that she couldn’t participate since she weighed too much for the harness.

However, everyone else really wanted to try rock climbing, and we didn’t want to miss about because of one person.

The next day, she texted us saying that we were fake friends for abandoning her and making her feel excluded for her weight.

"AITA For blaming my wife after I got fired My wife (36F) and I (37M) have been married for 5 years and have a 4-year-old son.  My wife is a pediatrician and I work in marketing.  Our son is in daycare during the day and recently moved up to a new preschool room.  The first few weeks in the new room were fine.  But then he became friends with a couple of older boys in the class and began to have some behavioral issues.  

The three boys seem to feed off each other's energy and can get really rambunctious and play too rough.  Games of tag will regress into pushing, shoving and hitting.  Nap time comes with them tossing pillows at each other and being disruptive.  Disagreements turn into hitting and throwing.  We've had meetings with his teachers and the director and changed the way we do a few things at home.  We've tried different types of goal-setting, positive reinforcement, multiple conversations, taking away of privileges, etc.  But his behavior continues to be disruptive at best and dangerous at worst.  We're exhausted.  Next step is getting him in touch with a behavioral therapist, thankfully my wife knows a few of them and they can expedite the scheduling process.

It's gotten to a point where we have had to pick him up from daycare in the middle of the day multiple times.  The daycare has both of our cell and work contact numbers, but they only seem to ever be able to get a hold of me.  I've had to leave work probably 7-8 times in the past 2 months to get him.  Every time daycare calls me, they say they tried my wife but she didn't answer.  I will then call and text my wife to see if she can get him, but her responses are always delayed to the point that daycare has had to call me back before to remind me that our son needs to be picked up. I understand she has patients to attend to, but she also has a family.

After the last 2 times I had to pick up our son, my boss told me that I can't keep doing this.  Then, it happened again.  I tried getting a hold of my wife, but she didn't answer or return texts.  I told my boss I had to go pick up my son and he told me if I leave to not bother coming back.  I tried my wife again and still nothing.  I waited an hour until daycare called me again and told me I need to come get our son.  So, I left work and got a phone call later that day that I am fired.

My wife finally called after I got home with our son.  She apologized for not getting back to me sooner and gave excuses about patients.  I told her that I don't want to hear it and she doesn't need to make more excuses because I got fired so now I can just stay home with our son anyway.  She wanted to know more but i told her I don't want to talk about it.

After we got our son to bed, she asked if I wanted to talk about it and I told her that her dedication to her job and her patients cost me my job.  I told her that she never once made arrangements to pick our son up and now we're a 1-income family.  She told me it isn't her fault and I'm being a jerk for blaming her.  ",0.6
"AITA for screaming at my mom and lashing out because she refuses to stop ranting to me about her marriage? My (20F) parents (55M and 55F) have been going through a rough patch in their marriage for some time now. It’s been almost a year since my grandfather passed away which has led my dad to spend more and more time with my grandma. He has also been through stress at work and usually decides to spend his day silently doing work or playing squash. My mom and dad have been arguing almost everyday because she feels neglected and wants him to go back to his lively self.

In the past year, I have been subjected to various conversations about their marriage and cracks in their relationship in general. My dad tries to convince me that he doesn’t have time to spend with us because he’s busy (this upsets me equally if not more than my mom because i’m very very close to both of them) and my mom has a long monologue about my dad and how he has no time for her, thinks she is boring and would rather spend all his time with my grandma.

I have heard both of their statements and tried to maintain an empathetic bond with both of them throughout. Both by lending an ear as well as trying to offer them advice.

Today, I told my mom how done I am with hearing the same story again and again, how I don’t have the emotional capacity anymore or handle any of this. I told her how i’m not involved in the situation and don’t want to talk about it anymore because it’s getting too much for me. My mom told me that i’m trying to escape the situation, she said “you’re a copy of your dad and grandpa.” My mom disliked my grandfather because he was always cruel towards her and said some nasty things to her. This hurt me very much because I have done nothing but tried to offer them some respite from their lives and listening and listening and listening to the same goddamn thing everyday. I slammed the door and screamed at her that I don't care about her marriage and don't give a shit about the situation anymore. 

AITA for screaming at her? 

TLDR: Lashed out at my mother after an argument about my parents marriage and her feelings of neglect.

I’m sorry if this is hard to read, english is not my first language.

Update: I wrote to my mom about what happened and even apologised for lashing out because speaking calmly is clearly not my family’s strongest suit. She has chosen to not reply to me at all and hasn’t even acknowledged what I wrote. I’m giving up and will no longer try to initiate conversation or apologise.

"AITAH for not believing that the cartel is after this guy I in the talking stage with? I (F) 26 have been talking to (M)38 on and off for almost a year now. He was very charming and helpful. He would help me pay bills, get clothes and toys for my kid, and help with other things as I am a single parent with little to no help. He eventually wanted to begin to pursue me romantically.  I was hesitant because I recently got out of a toxic abusive relationship with my child's father. I eventually became open to the idea, and  we started hanging out, he took me to lunch here and there, he was still paying for things I needed and wanted. A week before Christmas a couple months after we initially started talking he got upset about some sort of minor that I don't remember what it was and said, ""I can't do this sweetheart"" as in he cant talk to me anymore because I assuming the disagreement was too much for him to bear. I let it be and he came back around a couple days after Christmas and we reconciled.

Don’t get me wrong, they are their own people with their own interests, but a lot of my hobbies, music, language, and style seems to have rubbed off on them. When I play music in front of them in the car or post music on my story, I later find them listening to it or posting it themselves. When i go somewhere on my own or with other people, they ask me to take them there too. When I pick up a small hobby (for example jewelry making), they start picking up the hobby too. Small things like this have been building up all summer and i am becoming increasingly more frustrated. I know i should be flattered, and it’s not like I personally own any of these things, but it’s starting to bug me. I don’t want to show them any new music i’m listening to or tell them what i’m doing anymore. It makes me sad that i subconsciously feel this way because sharing my interests with friends is one of my favorite ways to connect with people. One of the friends even got mad at me when i started pulling back, saying i’m being “super secretive”. I don’t know how to get over this so I can just be normal around them again. I don’t wanna tell them I feel this way because I know they will be super mad. Guys, what do I do? ",0.62
"AITA for charging two of my friend’s bf’s friends $10 each for driving them to an amusement park and back? So originally, me and my boyfriend were going to drive to an amusement park with my close friend Hannah. Plans changed when we found out Hannah's bf's friends also wanted to go, but did not have a ride. My boyfriend was hesitant to take them, but agreed when they offered gas money. We split the people up, and two of his friends rode with me and my boyfriend in my Prius. It took us about 15-20 minutes to get to the pick up spot, and 30 minutes to get to the amusement park. At the park, I was even able to give one of the friends a cheaper ticket offer because of my season pass benefits. It was another 30 minutes back and also 15-20 minutes back home. Off the top of my head, I told them it was $10 each. They then got upset and tried being super specific about the pricing (they looked up my car model and tried calculating the cost of the trip online). In the end, they only paid me $10 dollars in total. They told me if I was too broke to pay for my gas, I should get a job (they both don't have cars or jobs). I feel kind of awful because I would have compromised with a cheaper price (I also did the math after they paid me, and the trip would have came to about $15 dollars in total). I just feel offended that I did them a favor and they insulted me when they thought it was unfair. This was the first time I have ever hung out with them, so I didn't mean to cause a bad impression of myself. AITA?",0.07
"AITA for not letting my dad hug me AITA  not letting my dad hug me

I F14 am autistic and don't like people in my space unless they ask my dad hates this and will always hug me without asking even refusing to let go despite the fact that I'm using all my strength to push him off I hate this and it makes he feel extremely uncomfortable

I do understand that my dad doesn't understand my autism fully but still and my mom's no help she keeps saying when I reject his hugs it hurts him and I do understand that but I just don't generally like hugs plus I hate them even more when I'm in emotional deserts (when he loves to hug me most) 

and I will say I can be a little mean when he try to force me to hug him I can yell a bit and cry which my mom say that really hurts him I know this is a weird on but I just need some unbiased option. Am I the ass hole????

"AITAH for ignoring my dad and step-mother after being told we wouldn't be doing anything for my birthday?  My birthday was in June and in late January or early February, I had asked my dad (40M) if we could go Barnes & Noble for a day. He said he would talk to my step-mom (32F) to discuss it. After talking to her, he told me we would go. A a few days before my birthday, he told me we weren't going since they had plans.

I told him that was alright and he said we'd go sometime in July or August. We rescheduled and a new days before going, they cancelled again due to plans. Few days after each cancelation, I would ignore them for a few hours to a day. Now, they're scheduling for sometime in September or October.

"AITA for refusing to let my sister’s kids sleep over after they destroyed my apartment?  

Last weekend, my sister asked if I could watch her two kids (7 and 9) for the night because she and her husband had an event. I love my nieces and agreed, even though I live in a small one-bedroom apartment. I thought it would be fun, and they usually behave well.

Everything started fine. We watched movies, had snacks, and they seemed to be having a good time. But the next morning, when I went to make breakfast, things spiraled out of control. They were running wild, and by the time I realized it, they had knocked over a lamp, spilled juice on my rug, and somehow managed to break my TV remote.

I tried to calm them down and get things under control, but they kept running around and even started playing with my work laptop, which I had to snatch away before they could do any damage. I was frustrated and overwhelmed.

When my sister came to pick them up, I told her what happened and that I didn’t feel comfortable having them sleep over again until they could be more careful. She laughed it off at first, saying, ""Kids will be kids,"" but I stood my ground. I said I love them, but I need my apartment and belongings to stay in one piece.

Now, she’s upset and says I’m overreacting. She told our parents, and they think I’m being too harsh and that I should just “kid-proof” my place better next time. I’m feeling guilty because I know they’re just kids, but I also feel like my boundaries weren’t respected.

"AITAH for making my mom pay for my clothes? 
Okay, so I'm (24F), working two jobs to save up and move out, and currently living with my mom (46F). She's always been a bit...overbearing, but things escalated way too far. 

A few days ago, she decided to do a ""deep clean"" of my room. I asked her to please not touch my stuff because she's, let's just say, not the most careful person. Can you believe she actually got mad at me for that? She started yelling about how I should clean better, but my room was actually tidy. She just has this weird obsession with everything being her way.

Anyway, she kicked me and my siblings out while she ""cleaned."" Can you imagine? When we came back, she casually drops this bomb that she threw away a bunch of my clothes because they were ""moldy."" They weren't. They were perfectly fine! And she didn't even ask me first.

I was in shock. I mean, who does that? I looked through the mess she left and realized she'd thrown away like 90% of my clothes, including stuff I need for work. Then she has the nerve to tell me to pick five outfits and throw the rest away! I told her no way, because she destroyed most of my stuff and I need clothes for work. She threatened to throw away the rest if I didn't do it myself.
The worst part? She threw everything she tossed into the trash compactor. Like, completely destroyed. So I told her if she did, I'd make her pay me back for everything she threw away. It's like, $600-$700 worth of clothes. Now she's mad at me for wanting her to pay for the stuff she ruined. AITAH?",0.07

I told him that sometimes I don't want a fix, or for someone to offer a fix. That a fix will not make me feel better. Sometimes I just want someone to agree with me that Becky from work is being a bitch, or a customer was out of line for doing x or y.

"AITA for complaining that by brother in law does not buy food for me? 
My husband and I see my brother-in-law (BIL) and his family (his new partner and 2 girls from 2 previous relationships) approximately once every 2-3 months for the last 2 years (before that we lived very far away). We don’t have any kids, and each family earns almost the same. 

Sometimes we meet at their home, and we always bring something (food or dessert, and also a gift for their daughters).

When we go to restaurants, my husband has paid for the meal for all 6 of us on 5 occasions. Once, all the family put their orders in a McDonald vending machine for my husband to pay for everything by credit card, and I considered that very rude…My BIL paid only once, but it was a very awkward situation and in the end he did it reluctantly. When we go out and it is only a drink, it is my husband again who always pays. 

Every time we see the girls, we bring something for them (cologne, make-up kits, books, plushies, art crafts… ). Also, we have taken the girls to musicals twice, with dinner and snacks included.

Finally, this week we have seen each other twice since we are all on vacation. We went to a restaurant one day and my BIL ordered everything he wanted and my husband paid for everything. My BIL in the way out said that he could have paid, as he doesn’t care about money. 

The next day, we met in the afternoon and my BIL mentioned that we should go to a rather expensive restaurant, and we told him that it would be no problem if he paid for it, since we had already used up our vacation budget. Upon hearing this, they started to suggest having dinner at home or going out for a drink.

But, since the girls were in the mood to party, we ended up at a Mexican place. My BIL suggested ordering something to share. While he was ordering, my husband was in the bathroom and I was talking to the girls. Finally, some nachos arrived, for the 6 of us to share. Then, 4 tacos arrived, which he put aside on his side of the table, and gave one to his partner, one to each girl, and one for himself. He hadn't ordered anything for us.

My husband and I started to feel uncomfortable. As we were leaving, I said that I had eaten a lot (the irony in my tone was noticeable) and my BIL’s partner took it the wrong way. My husband interceded saying that i had eaten a lot throughout the day, and that was what I meant. Seeing that the situation was not going to improve, we each went home.

Now, I'm not sure how I should have handled that situation. My husband is kind of angry at me because my attitude could harm his relationship with his brother. for me it was a huge disrespect that he didn't order food for us after we had almost always paid and behaved very well with his daughters on every occasion.

I told him that if he wants, I will ask his brother for forgiveness. Even so, I believe that the relationship is not healthy and I can no longer look the other way.

"AITA for getting a TSA Agent in Trouble, Possibly Fired?  This is more of a privacy issue than anything else. Airport TSA checkpoints have facial recognition software to match your ID. There are signs that you can choose to opt-out and not lose your place in line. If you get your face scanned, your picture gets deleted after 24 hours. The concern is what they do with it during those 24 hours, the answer is they won't tell us. So as a matter of principle I have been opting-out without issue at various airports without an issue until today.

Here is the play by play, its actually kind of comical. TSA Agent is young and chatting with her friend about wanting her shift to be over and just go home. More like whining actually but all without paying much attention to the passengers. Simply asking for ID, inserting it into the machine and telling them to look at the camera. Once it beeps she takes the ID out and they can move on.

TSA Agent: ""ID please""

Me: ""I want to opt-out please"" (she did not register)

TSA Agent: ""ID please""

Me: (Handed over my ID)

TSA Agent: ""Look into the camera""

Me: ""I want to opt-out please""

TSA Agent: ""Too late, you needed to tell me that before I inserted your ID. Look into the camera please""

Me: ""No."" (At this point I turn to the people behind me and apologize, they seemed amused)

TSA Agent: ""You have to look into the camera or the system cannot process passengers.""

Me: ""I am not going to look into the camera. There is a sign that says I can opt-out. That is what I'm doing""

TSA Agent: ""But I already put your ID in the system""

Me: ""That is your problem. Maybe you should be paying attention instead of talking with your friend about  
going home.""

TSA Agent gets up and walks away saying ""I want to go home"", then turns back and says to me ""Do you want me to call a supervisor""

Me: ""You call whoever you have to, I am not looking into your camera."" (Then I turned again and apologized to the people behind me who now looked annoyed, not sure if at her or me.)

A Supervisor came, hit a couple of buttons then let me through. Could not have been nicer. Said I was well within my rights and asked why it all happened, I explained. Then said I will have a chat. I said I don't want to get her in trouble but she needs to pay attention. Supervisor asked me to point out the friend, which I could not.

I go through the scanner and all that jazz which took a while because of strollers in front, but when I was putting shoes on afterwards the TSA Agent walked by and said ""you didn't have to do that"", I replied ""which part?""

TSA Agent: ""Telling my boss to send me home""

Me: ""I did not tell your boss to send you home, you did that yourself, everyone heard you.""

Unsure what happened after this but I did feel bad about it for a quick second, and then thought to myself, there is someone else who actually wants that job and is willing to do the work to keep us safe. I am wrong here?

"AITA/am I normal or controlling? I seen that my husband had been texting chatting with a female and I lost it my heart crushed , so hurt would have never expected it. I’ve been so loyal and faithful to him stood by his side through a lot. I have never even acknowledged another man or even a harmless chat with the opposite sex ( old friend or not). 

He was so sorry and said it would never happen again that it was just chatting and he didn’t know why he even entertained it.

We talked and I told him I forgive him I believe him, and I would try to get over it. It might take me a while to completely let it go. And I would need him to help me heal. Bc now I’m hurt and insecure. We have little arguments and I am skeptical bc he does sketchy things sometimes and instead of him making me feel better and assuring me of his promise he sometimes says get out my feelings, or tells me think what I want, he doesn’t have to explain himself to me. 

Example: he tells me he is going to his dads and chat with his cousin, he will be back in a few around 7 … it’s 8:30 and I text/ call him and I’m like it’s after 7 what you doing ,he says oh yea I know I’m about to head home…..now it’s 11 and im texting NO REPLY… so I call he finally answers and is being ugly to me. And I’m like what’s really going on so then there’s an argument. So he strolls on home gets in it’s almost 2am! I’m pissed.. 

He tells me he don’t answer to me I don’t run shit , 
He tells me in trying to control him… I disagree, to me he knows he did wrong and I’m insecure. And I’m tell him I’m not trying to control him it’s common courtesy and communication. If he tells me a time and goes over that time he should tell me and instead of ignoring me and just staying out a simple conversation “like hey yea I know ow it’s getting late but we talking shooting dice having a good time I will be a little later, and then simply respond to my text is all I ask . To me it’s simple. 

Am I controlling? Or is it normal. Is it to much to ask. Bc to me once he gets defensive and stops answering me and is ugly to me . He is doing wrong. There is no reason a married max with a new baby needs to leave at 7pm and not come home till 2 am , no good comes after midnight. 

Am I wrong in feeling like I deserve to k is what he is doing is it to much to get upset when a 2 hour visit turns into a 6hour visit. Am I asking too much to not be ignored when I text to expect a simple reply? 

Am I controlling or is he guilty and and trying to make me feel wrong by telling me Im trying to control him!",0.31
"AITA for telling my mom the reason I don't want to get married? My (20f) mom and dad did not get along very well when I was a kid. Most of the time, they just acted like the other didn't exist, and I remember feeling so upset about it even as a teenager because it felt like we were never really a family. I don't think I've ever seen them hug or show any sort of affection for each other. One time, they got into an argument about what to eat for lunch the next day, while we were in the middle of a restaurant, and my mom yelled at him and left the restaurant. I cried for two hours straight that night because I just wished they'd get along. I cried a lot because I felt so alone. My mom was far worse about it in front of me though. She would always complain to me about dad, whether it was about his work or something he had or hadn't done (usually laundry or some small chore). It really scared me, because if that is what marriage or even just a relationship could be, I'd rather be alone forever. 

Mom has recently been asking me why I haven't started dating, and I should think about it or else it might be too late for me to get married. I told her I didn't really want to get married. She asked me why, and I do think part of the reason I decided to tell her is because of how I felt like she never understood my feelings concerning her and my dad. She got so upset. Like really upset. She talked so fast I don't remember everything she said, but some were, ""well, we stayed together for you, shouldn't you be happy?"" and ""there are some parents who murder each other. we never did that. "" and the thing that really struck me was ""why are you making it so personal? it has nothing to do with you"". I'm actually not 100% sure of the answer to that question.

"WIBTA if i moved back home For some context: I’m 18F and my partner is 20F. We moved in together a few months ago and I now work a 15 minute drive from my gf’s house. My gf’s house consists of her mum, dad, two little brothers, her older sister, her sister’s boyfriend, their child and the bf’s brother.

With all that said… Let’s get into it.

My gf and I have a great relationship most of the time but our cat has just had kittens. Her mum and dad are crazy over cats and think they’re experts. Her mum will come in every hour to have a look at them and will overstay her welcome but in between these visits, she will come in every fifteen minutes to ask my gf for something. I had already been talking to my gf, telling her how it’s overwhelming  me and getting on my nerves a lot. She says she’ll talk to her.

But, it’s not just her mother coming in either. Her little brother is also getting a kitten and comes in a lot to see it. I don’t get along with any of the brothers because they like to stir the pot and they’ve found a new target (me because we’ve been raised very differently). Her sister also comes in frequently and takes her chosen kitten out of the room all the time. Along with this, I’m also frequently asked for rides because only I and the father have our licences and the father works 10 hours a day.

No one in the house listens to us and my gf keeps saying she’ll talk to them. She’s said this for a few weeks. This leads me to wanting to move back home to my parents which is a 35 minute drive to work on a good day. Decent rent but I don’t have my kittens or my gf there…

Our Sergeant held GM black to talk to him about accountability and the importance of being on time entirely because of how late GM was.

"AITA for telling a school counselor don't try to play her game with me? My son Ethan started 6th grade a couple of weeks ago and his class is quite small. He's not on the spectrum or anything but sometimes he likes his alone time. The only time where he can be alone is at lunch. No, he's not always eating alone. He has friends. In fact he had a sleepover last Friday with three of his friends and they were up for 36 hours straight playing video games, swimming, jumping on each other, etc. 

Today the school counselor called me and asked if I was free to talk about Ethan. I asked if everything was alright and she said the VP could be calling if it wasn't. I didn't like the whole conversation so I said let's talk today. I'll make the time.

She said she's seen Ethan eating alone and asked him how he was doing. She said he was quite rude and abrasive even for a 6th grader. I asked why she was even talking to him because it sounds like he was reacting out of fear. She said she was asking him if he had friends and if he was being bullied. 

I said you must be new to working with tweens. No 6th grader is going to open up to you because you think that you're that good at talking with them. I explained he does have friends and he had a sleepover just last week. If he was nasty towards you it's probably because you were embarrassing him with your line of questioning and you should had asked me first. I'm his dad and know him better than he knows himself. We're very close. He still like to give me hugs and watch tiktok videos with me.

"AITA for not cooking for my (24) BF (29) anymore after he said his mom’s cooking is better?  Throwaway account because BF knows my real account. My BF of 18 months and I recently moved in together. During this time, I’ve learned that he’s a mama’s boy. 

She does his laundry every week and he has dinner with her every single day. And that’s fine, I’m getting used to it, but I didn’t know it was like this until we started living together. 

Anyway, I usually cook lunch for me and my BF. My BF barely has time to cook and he doesn’t know how to prepare anything besides steak. I’ve never had a problem with this since I adore cooking for the people I love. 

So today, like any other day, I prepared lunch. It was a Peruvian-Chinese dish and I even went to the grocery shop to buy the ingredients I needed. This isn’t a bother for me because, like I said, I love cooking for others. 

Sometimes I ask him to rate my food because I’d like to know if it’s worth to prepare it again. He gave this dish an 8/10 which made me really happy. 

Later on I ask him what’s a 10/10 dish I’ve prepared that he’s truly enjoyed? And he said “No offense but the only person who’ll ever cook a 10/10 dish is my mom”.

And that’s fine, I said, but I never asked for a comparison? I love his mom dearly and she’s very sweet. But I’ve never seen her cook anything besides hamburger helper, patties or canned/boxed food. Not the healthiest thing to be honest. 

However, don’t get me wrong, I’d never disrespect his mother in any form and every-time she invites me over, I’m very grateful. It’s just the way my BF said this kind of hurt me? 

I tend to spend 1-1.5 hours in the kitchen, sometimes more, depending on the dish, but I surely put my heart and soul into it every time— only for him to tell me that I’ll never cook like his mother? 

Now I’m left to think that he’s always comparing my cooking to his mom’s and that it won’t ever be good enough, no matter how much I try. AITA for not wanting to cook for him anymore?

My friend offered to let me stay with him, his parents said i wouldn’t have to pay rent. So I’d basically get to keep my life as it is. I brought this up to my parents, and at first, they said they’d think about it. But then I brought this up to my sister (40F) she immediately opposed the idea, saying her daughter had a bad experience staying with friends, and she turned my parents against the idea too.

They called me selfish for looking out for my future and not considering their feelings so then i rethought what I said and proposed a compromise where I’d visit them every 1-2 months but they started talking about legal enforcement and punishment if I didn’t follow through, which seemed excessive then the idea was thrown out the window by my other sis. They then shifted to concerns about healthcare and legal issues, but when I researched it, I found I only needed their permission, not court things.

"AITA for telling my boyfriend he should get abs I and my bf (both 36yo) have been together for 4 years. My boyfriend and I met while traveling and he admitted that he was attracted to me at first sight because he found me sexy. At that time, I was not really looking for anything serious so just went along with it. I used to surf which he found attractive. He is also very sporty himself and works as a carpenter. So he is strong, however, he has a big beer belly which I dont really mind. He is healthy, he is strong, and can do pretty much anything. 
I have known from the beginning that he prefers girls who are on the thinner side. My weight swings from 118-124. Im 5’1. But im in perfect health and pretty much can do physical labor too. We both dont go to the gym but we love hiking and my bf considers his job as a carpenter a form of workout.

Recently, since i moved to his country to be with him, i found it difficult to do any exercises (ive been procrastinating a lot). Ive been down as well from having left everything behind with non of my original social support. He’s not also here often because of work (he spends a month away for his job and 14 days at home and so on). So im mostly alone in the house doing my remote work. 

A few hours ago, I told my boyfriend that im getting fat and that my belly is getting bigger, and my weight is at 123lbs. Ive been stress eating lately. His reply was: « you know i don’t like fat girls ». He added that it’s no surprise im getting fat because i have not been doing exercises. So i told him it’s rich of him to tell me that. and i said, « why don’t you get abs? ». 

I eventually sent him a message telling him that I feel hurt that it seemed like it’s easy for him to get rid of me if i got fat. I told him that his body was never an issue for me as long as he’s healthy.. That i actually love his belly and I will never replace even if he changed his body.

I understand his preference and he did tell me that in the beginning but i feel like he could’ve said something different if he wants me to lose weight. But i also feel like i went too far when i told him if he can grow some abs and lose his belly. AITA?",0.75
"AITA for telling my MIL not to call my puppy insulting names? My MIL (67, very active and healthy) has been staying with us (F/34, Husband/34, two kids 4&5) for three days because I am currently on bed rest awaiting a major surgery and my husband had to be gone for work. My MIL can be difficult and overbearing, speaking over me and butting into parenting moments. Still, she cares a lot and has driven 3 hours here to help us. She has made meals, taken our kids on outings, and even gone grocery shopping. I am truly, deeply grateful for her help.

We have a 7 month old pup who’s mostly my responsibility. I have worked in animalcare forever and have is well trained; people never believe me when I say he is only 7mo old. He’s almost always with me. With my MIL taking care of pretty much everything else our pup has gotten the short end of the stick and has had little exercise or stimulation for days. I don’t blame my MIL for this at all, but his behavior has become a little more wild because of it.

MIL has resorted to yelling at him, tying him up or locking him up. He has been having stress accidents in the house and barking which is abnormal. We live in a very rural area and don’t have close neighbors, dog daycares, or walking services. My closest friends and family are an hour away. My sister will come up once a week to help. I’ve mostly kept my mouth shut about MIL’s decisions on handling our pup since she’s helping us out, but I’ve been getting really upset by her calling him “psychotic”, “out of control”, “nothing but trouble”, “never calms down” and other names. I started saying things like, “please try to remember he’s only 7 months old, everything has changed for him and he’s gotten no exercise in days”. 

My husband came home tonight and 10min later we had zoom counseling. My MIL insisted the puppy stay with her while we went down to our meeting. My husband heard me saying to MIL, “this is the time of night I would usually take him for a walk or play fetch, he probably won’t settle down without it. If you’re having a hard time with him please send him downstairs.” She called him a spaz and I made a comment like I mentioned above.

My husband later said I had been a major AH for correcting his mom and insinuating that she needed to take him for a walk after everything she had done for us already. I think it’s cruel to be yelling at a puppy who’s not getting its needs met. The whole counseling session I could hear him barking, her yelling at him, and it turns out she just locked him up the whole time rather than send him down like I asked.  

So, AITH for correcting my MIL?",0.71
"AITA for refusing to budge on hating someone who just lost their boyfriend to cancer? My (27F) boyfriend (28M, BF) cheated on me & left me for FF (20sF) whose boyfriend just died of cancer. I hate her and refuse to see her as a decent person.

I met BF several years ago through mutual friends. We connected on a deep level going through hard phases in life. After we met he needed a place to stay for a while & I had a futon. We fell in love & were together for almost 5 years. He was an alcoholic (which I fully accepted) & I tried getting him into therapy or rehab throughout the years but he always refused & never believed in them. I stood by him & took care of him & loved him more than anything.

Last year he started a new job & became friends with his coworker FF. I never saw any red flags. But then her boyfriend passed away from cancer & BF wanted to befriend her so she wasn’t alone. I warned him not to get too close. He promised it wasn’t like that.

One night they went to the park to play board games. Hours went by & I was getting anxious. I took a D8 gummy for anxiety & was accidentally high as balls. I was sitting in my car because I couldn’t be in our home alone. They pulled up & suddenly I was paralyzed. I was forced to watch as he leaned in & tried to kiss her. I flew out of the car, she left, he came behind me shitfaced, told me he felt confused, & I swore I would fight for us.

He continued hanging w/ her, promising me nothing would happen. One night I had to track him down & of course he was w/ her. They swore nothing happened. I asked how I was supposed to know, all I could imaging was them off f***ing somewhere. She swore she’d NEVER do that. A few days later BF & I got into a fight about it & he left to stay w/ family for the week. Guess where he actually stayed.

I was a wreck. I texted her out of desperation & I told her how much he meant to me, that I loved him, & begged her not to take him. It was pathetic. She never responded. A week later he broke up w/ me. Said I needed to focus on myself, learn to love myself, & he needed to be by himself to get sober. A few days later I found out he’d been sleeping with her. I was throwing up, crying, & my family had to come get me.

Now he’s gone to rehab & is completely sober. I stood by him as a friend & brought him things when needed, checked in w/ his family, gave them updates, & even spoke to FF sometimes. All that love, commitment & support, just for her to swoop in & take everything I loved.

He told me not to hate her, it’s not her fault, he’s the bad guy, she's a good person, etc. I’ve tried to feel any kind of sympathy for her & can’t. She knew what she was doing & did it anyway. I know it’s shitty to hate her, she’s grieving. But I f***ing hate her. I’ve been through grief & know how it fucks w/ you. However my brain is not communicating w/ my heart right now. Maybe strangers on the internet showing me other ways to look at it might help me not hate her so much. I feel like an asshole, everyone tells me I’m not, but I just don’t know. Am I an asshole?",0.13
"AITA for refusing to give my neighbors dog back? The neighbor on our back fence has a dog that keeps burrowing tunnels/ breaking fence boards to come into our yard. Several times we walked her over and politely gave their dog back, expressing concern about the damage to the fence and the ability of their dog to get through. But the last time she came over she started playing with our dogs and it got aggressive and our dog had some minor scratches/ was bleeding slightly. When we gave the dog back there was no apology or concern aside from saying they would fix the fence that weekend.
This week the dog came over once again and at the advice of animal control, who we called after the previous incident, we called animal control and scheduled a pickup for the morning. 
When the neighbors called and asked if we had seen their dog, we notified them that animal control would pick up the dog when they resumed business hours, and they could pick her up at the animal control facility in the morning. (This was per the instructions of the last time we called animal control during their business hours)
Then the police showed up at our door and told us to give the dog back. We believed we had contacted the proper authorities but the policeman said we should have called them right when we found the dog? He said that what we were doing is theft.
We ended up giving the dog back over the fence but not sure what we can do the next time this happens.
Our side of the fence has a shed and we really can get many substantial objects behind to block the holes she’s creating in the fence, although we have tried. Sometimes she will just move the obstacles out of the way if they are light enough or just break a new fence board. The neighbors, to their credit, blocked the fence this weekend with a bench or something but they are saying the lawn guys moved it and that’s why she was able to enter our yard. (I did see and hear lawn people in their yard today). And while I usually try to be very understanding, but this wouldn’t happen if they just watch the dog when they let her outside (knowing there is a hole in the fence and she will make more given the chance). They won’t notice she’s gone for 10 minutes at least but also up to 2-3 hours.
They are also saying we are contributing to her breaking in because we were very loving to the dog when she came over.
AITA if I refused to give her back tonight in order to turn her over the animal control in the morning? Again, we did end up giving her back tonight have a heated discussion through the fence.",0.46
"AITA for not saying Halo Reach? Am I the asshole for not going out of my way to say Halo Reach to my girlfriend who is also a Halo fan when Reach is a very popular game that doesn't need Halo in front of it to be recognized?

This question came from an argument I had with my gf, I was waiting for her for **12 hours** so we could play Fortnite or she give me an update saying we can't, I didn't play anything else as I didn't want to be in the middle of something when she texts me but I eventually decide to boot up MCC (Master Chief Collection) and finish Reach's story.

I finished it and a while later she FINALLY starts talking to me and I say what I said above, however she doesn't know that I was playing Reach and assumes I was playing some other random games with reach in the name that I never heard of until now. I am very confused and baffled at this because I thought since both of us are Halo fans and I have been playing a lot of it recently while trying to convince her to join me that I would not have to specify one of the most popular Halo games to another Halo fan, but she tries to make it sound like I'M the asshole in this situation because I didn't think about 2 random games that I never heard of until now which also have reach in their names. I try and explain how I'm not at fault for expecting a Halo fan to know a very popular Halo game but she is very stubborn with insisting that I fucked up by not thinking about other *""""popular games""""* and eventually tells me to shut up about Halo or she'll leave (go to bed), so I do and she says sorry (probably begrudgingly or not meaning it) for playing Gmod for 11 hours with her friends and not telling me when she sent me a screenshot of Gmod (no text) and now here we are.

Helpful (?) context:

* We are 20+ years old and she is a ***few*** years older than me and has been a Halo fan longer than me
* She always sends me random stuff so I assumed that's what the Gmod one was.
* I do not hide the fact I have been playing a **lot** of Halo recently and she knows that.

Am I the asshole in this situation? I want to know if I'll say ""You were kind of being a bitch last night"" or ""Sorry I was being a bitch last night"", we love each other so much and in so many ways that is not safe for YouTube (If ya see this, hi Daniel Thrasher).",0.9
"AITA for telling someone to wait? I live with my girlfriend and last night she was sat watching videos on her phone and I was playing a video game. 

She kept showing me videos and expecting me to keep pausing the game. It started becoming more frequent and I just told her to save the videos and show me after. 

She then tried to show me 4 videos in under 5 mins and again kept expecting me to pause the game each time. I told her again to wait as she can see I'm busy. 

She just said it wouldn't take long but I pointed it's it's pretty much constant interruptions. I asked how she'd like it if she was sat reading and I kept stopping her every minute.

She just said again she's not asking me much but I just pointed out that either was I. All I'm asking is for her to wait until I'm finished because there's no point playing if I need to pause it every 10 seconds.

She said I was being too hard on her and shouldn't be having a go at her but I just told her she shouldn't be getting annoyed at me for not wanting to be interrupted constantly,

"AITA for calling out a family feeding the animals at our local Zoo I, my wife, and her sister recently went to a local city zoo that rests in a park. This is a tiny zoo that has maybe 10-20 animals and has explicit rules about not feeding the animals. 

My wife and I are only visiting this city since we live across country, but where we live, not feeding animals/wildlife is taken very seriously as we live near bear country. 

i saw a family clearly not caring about the rules, 3-5 kids, a few moms and an older man I'm assuming was their grandfather. 

i approached them and sternly said ""Guys do not feed the animals, it clearly says on the signs"". This was directed at the groups as a whole but i made eye contact with the grandfather as he was the one handing the food out. 

The grandfather proceeded to tell me it's the zoo and they'll do what they like, and said he'd make me regret it if i don't leave. 

i said fuck it walked away and said I'll just inform the staff (of which their were none I could find)

 When we get to the car this man had followed us and decided to threaten my SIL that he had taken a photo of her licence plate and call the police. Neither of us said anything and we left. 

When we got home to SIL’s, my wife came to me and said that what I did was not ok, I’m not the police and that I shouldn’t go around scaring families trying to have fun at the zoo. 

While I understand how the threat at the end scared my SIL and my wife, i apologized for what happened and how it made them feel… but I tried to point out that the man following us and threatening us is clearly the person in the wrong.

"AITA for asking my ex to not get a job at my workplace? I (29f) dated J (23f) for about four months at the start of this year. There were good aspects to our relationship, but I struggled with some stuff, including the age difference and their issues with emotional avoidance. We mutually and amicably parted ways about five months ago due to our incompatibilities, expressing respect and care for each other. However, I did share with them the elements of the relationship I found deeply painful during our breakup conversation, and they kindly heard me out.

Since then, I have taken a complete break from dating to focus on myself, as well as on my career and my friendships. I found the relationship to be quite impactful and I needed a hard reset on my life, to figure out what I really wanted and needed. I have been going to therapy frequently, and I spend quite a lot of time with my therapist trying to heal from certain elements of the relationship. 

Anyway, I started a job back in January that means the world to me—it's at a charity I’m super passionate about, and it’s one of those jobs that doesn’t even feel like work because I enjoy it so much. I’ve developed strong professional and personal relationships with my colleagues, and I genuinely enjoy going to work every day. J and I were dating when I got this job, and they saw how much I blossomed in the initial months of working for this organisation. 

Today, out of the blue, J messaged me saying, “Hi 😌 just wanted to let you know I have an interview at [workplace] next week Wednesday so you might see me around!” I was floored, and felt very uncomfortable. My workplace is like a second home to me, and the idea of seeing them there every day felt super overwhelming. I asked why they hadn’t checked in with me before applying.

J said they assumed it would be fine since we had parted on good terms and had chatted a few times since the breakup. However, I felt this was a massive assumption to make. While I know I can't really stop them from interviewing, the thought of them getting the job is pretty devastating to me. J was surprised by my reaction and said they felt bad, but made it clear that they still plan to proceed with the interview.

I’ve been ruminating on this all day. I usually consider myself reasonable, but I can’t shake the discomfort and anxiety. I’m not sure if my feelings are justified or if I’m overreacting to a situation where they have every right to apply for the job.

AITA for telling J that I don’t want them to go for or get the job? Or are they the AH? I’d really appreciate some outside perspectives.

Extra context:
- I’m aware J might not get offered the job after interviewing, which would be a huge relief.
- They are currently employed, so it’s not a desperate situation where they need the job for survival. I’d be more understanding in that instance, because times are tough out here! ",0.88

"AITAH for telling my husband his mom is weird? My husband and I are living in his parents house, however his mom visits only once or twice a year since she lives in another country. 

She left to live in another country since he was 6, so my husband never really got the full “mom experience” in his life.

Recently , she arrived home and I keep noticing that she leaves her underwear everywhere in the bathroom.
First I thought that she may have forgotten them, as I sometimes forget my dirty clothes in the bathroom when I finish my shower. 
However this happens ALOT.

She leaves her underwear on the bathtub, on the sink and in a hook NEAR OUR FACE TOWEL.

Now I feel like it’s intentional and I feel disgusted by it , as a stranger but I expected my husband to notice it too since it’s his mom.

I tried to talk with him about it, and actually let him know what I’m thinking. I feel like she wants to seduce him or something , nothing else makes sense in my head… she’s young ( 45 years old - she had him when she was 17 , no mental disorders ) so there is no reason to “keep forgetting them”.

Another encounter that made me think that way was when she was dancing by herself in the living room when we were there and when she passed my husband she lifted her dress up almost showed her underwear while dancing.

My husband says I have mental issues for thinking about this, and that I’m the one having issues.

Am I going crazy or is this concerning?
I can’t call her out on this as it may turn back around and she may also say that I’m crazy for thinking like that.

I genuinely want sincere answers regarding this as I can no longer understand what’s normal and what’s not.

TL/DR Mother-in law keeps leaving her underwear everywhere , she has no mental issues , husband says I’m weird for telling him that this is making me uncomfortable. ",0.88
"AITA for Asking Reimbursement After My Son’s Date I (36F) have a SIL (40f) and we both have 13 year old sons. My nephew Mark invented my son Jeff on a double date which happens to be both their first dates ever and I could tell they were both nervous. I told my SIL I would chaperone and I picked up Mark to go to the movies. The boys and I waited in the theatre lobby and the girls eventually got dropped off. I found it weird that the parents didn't want to come in to meet me but I just shrugged it off. We go to pay and I found out that NONE of the kids brought money to pay for anything. So after 5 movie tickets, 2 large popcorns, and 4 medium drinks I had invested over $60 in my son's first date and their wasn't even filet mignon! After the movie I waited for the girls parents to come and this might be where I'm out of line. I explained to them how my son was invited and had nothing to do with the planning of this double date and asked if they could reimburse me the $12 for the ticket and drink of their daughter. It was a little awkward but they each offered $10 and that was fine for me. I got both the mom's numbers and we've been in contact in case they want to go out again, we did talk about expectations of paying for the future. When I went to drop Mark off I asked my SIL to reimburse be $18 for her son's ticket, drink, and one of the popcorns. She was ticked. As the chaperone, all financial responsibility was on me according to her. I was so hurt by her reaction, making me the bad guy that we left and I haven't talked to her since.

My husband thinks it's reasonable to ask for the money since I never agreed to pay for everyone and I politely set a boundary now having met the other moms. AITA?",0.07
"AITA for not attending a child's birthday party because her mother is fake? Ever since I’ve (35F) known my wife (32F) one of her friends have been fake,  but my wife has had a hard time letting her go because she already doesn’t have many friends. This “friend” invited my wife to her graduation, but didn’t tell my wife that she gave all the tickets away until AFTER she showed up and couldn’t get it. Last month, this “friend” RSVP her 2 kids for my step daughter’s birthday, but never showed up and never said anything and that’s supposedly her “god daughter”. 

The last straw was when she claimed she was bringing food to a birthday party I threw for my wife, but never wished her a HBD or said anything about the party until days after it was over. Even her friend from New Orleans flew in for the party which made the fake one look even worse. My sweet wife finally had enough. 

So last week this “friend” put my wife and her ex in a group chat inviting everyone and all the kids to her daughter’s bday this weekend. Her ex replied saying they’ll all come, even though my wife has their kids on weekends but my wife never even acknowledged the text or sent any type of confirmation or RSVP. We have 7 kids between me, my wife, and her ex’s new family, so we basically would’ve been the whole party as we usually are. Well, NONE of us showed up or said anything, and the “friend” just KNEW we’d all be there;  the only other kid at that party was the birthday girl’s brother. 

An hour into the party the “friend” texted them asking if they needed directions, then she desperately started calling my wife which is crazy because she NEVER calls or texts her. I hate that an innocent child had to suffer because her mom is fake, but adults need to learn to respect people’s time and communicate better.

"AITA for suggesting my (F25) mother (F55) wears headphones while I'm driving on our roadtrip?  For context, my mum and I are on a family holiday in Canada (my brother M22 will be meeting us in a few days). We will be doing quite a few hours of driving over the next few weeks as we travel between cities. Most of the lengthy driving will be just my mum and I in the car, some will be with my brother as well. 

It's well established that my mum is very sensitive to sound and doesn't like a lot of my music - in her words, it actually aggravates her and makes her angry. She won't tolerate anything she considers ""rock"" (which is basically just anything with an electric guitar and drums) or anything with a bass beat. For more info, her sensitivity also extends to things like sport on TV. She hates the sound of the crowd and the sport itself (whistles in AFL or the cars in F1) so I've never been allowed to watch sport outside my bedroom when I was living at home.  

This morning, before our 7 hour drive, I asked that she charge her noise-cancelling headphones to wear them in the periods that I'm driving, so that I can put my own music on without bothering her. She flipped out (for lack of a better term) and said that my request was completely unreasonable, she couldn't believe I would ask that, and that she shouldn't be expected to ""isolate herself for the entire drive"". She wouldn't listen when I re-iterated that I never asked her to wear them the whole drive, just when I wanted to play music that she doesn't like. To be clear, it wouldn't always be music she hates, but I don't want to listen to the same 100 songs that we both like for the next 4 weeks. When the situation is reversed, I'm always happy to put my earphones in and listen to my own thing. 

She insists that I'm trying to dictate the car, and that for the next 4 weeks, we can only play music that we all agree on (that venndiagram is very small). I see my request as a compromise - if she doesn't like the playlist when I'm driving, she can listen to her own stuff. I believe it's insane to think that 3 people will agree on the same music for the next 4 weeks and that we need to plan for the fact that there will be disagreements. 

Why I think I might be the asshole: my mum feels that it's isolating to wear noise cancelling earphones and we could theoretically just listen to music we both like, I just think will be boring to do for the entire time. 

So tldr, AITA for asking my mum to wear earphones on our 7 hour roadtrip so that we can both listen to music that we like? 

(To be clear, I'm not debating whether her sensitivity is reasonable or not, that's just something I've come to accept after 25 years.)

UPDATE: to anyone who still cares, we made it through pretty well! I skipped songs and she was a lot more tolerant of my music that I expected. She also did 2/3 of the driving and I put my earphones in. Here's to hoping this tentative alliance can continue for the rest of the trip! ",0.04

"AITA for second guessing my marriage after only 3 months  AITA? My husband and I have been together for a little over 5 years and we have never had an over the top sex life. I think I have been lying to myself that this isn't important to me. A few years ago we discovered that he has a hormone imbalance and this prevents him from having a normal sex drive. But the the problem is, I still have mine. I haven't been happy with our sex since the beginning and have always felt like I am left unsatisfied. 

Things were getting better when he started taking hormone therapy and I really thought we could just grow together and get past this awkward vanilla situation but it seems that things have plateaued and we have only been married for 3 months. We were on our honeymoon for 2 weeks and I didn't have a single orgasm. I know this is TMI but I am desperate for advice. 

When we do have sex, it is so quick and boring I get no satisfaction. It makes me feel depressed. I am not a cheater, I would never seek elsewhere, but I can't believe I actually married into this situation. Every aspect about our relationship is great- he is a good man and my best friend. But I am afraid to bring this up to him for fear of his feelings being hurt. He can't help he has an imbalance. I am also afraid to look like a huge whore. I recently found a therapist that specializes in sexual relationships but I am afraid to bring it up to him because of what it would do to his self esteem.

"AITA for refusing to make my dad a sandwich? For context: I (F19) currently live with my parents, and am on my way out for college, in search of an apartment. Since I live in Germany, dorms are not a very common thing.
My mother found an apartment near my school and has made a viewing appointment with the landlord to take a look at the property. I didn't ask her to search for an apartment for me, since I do that myself already, but I appreciate the help nonetheless.

My mother insisted she'd join me for the viewing since it's my very first, and suggested my dad to come as well. My dad works all day and is generally very busy, so I told her that that wouldn't be necessary, yet my dad agreed later this week to come as well.

Fast forward to today (day of the viewing) and me sitting in my room working on some freelance commissions I do for side-cash here and there as a ""job"". My mother enters my room unannounced and demands I make my father a sandwich because, quote: ""He hadn't had lunch yet and is rushing to make it for the viewing"".
I get fairly annoyed at that for three reasons:
1) I know for a fact my dad didn't ask for a sandwich, my mother just assumes he wants one. He never asked my mom for a sandwich nor me.
2) She walked up to the third floor of our house (kitchen is down in the first) just to tell me to make him a sandwich??
3) last time I made him a sandwich for lunch after work, he didn't eat it and made one himself.

Now don't get me wrong, I'd gladly make him lunch if he himself had asked me beforehand, it's the principle of my mom asking me without him even asking in the first place.

So I tell her that he is a grown man and is perfectly capable of making himself a sandwich if he wants one. 
Big mistake. 
She starts insulting and screaming at me, calling me an entitled ungrateful brat who wouldn't make her dear old dad a sandwich, after he got himself into such a hurry just for ME and MY viewing. Remind you, I specifically told both of them that he shouldn't rush himself for this viewing, it was his choice to come (which I also appreciate tho).
I get more pissy at that and blurt out a ""fine, I'll make him his damn sandwich"", to which she blows up in my face and threatens to cancel the viewing with the landlord.
I have no way of contacting the landlord myself, so she basically cornered me with that.

After that she demanded an apology and wouldn't accept any of my reasons for my reaction to her request, also not accepting any apology. 

She still treats me like a child and won't have a normal discussion with me as to why exactly I won't make a grown man his sandwich.

"AITA For telling my SIL that I love my nibblings because they are my brothers Kids? Hi.

Last weekend we were having coffee with my SIL and 3 of the my nieces classmates moms. We are all kind of ""friends"". While I don't have kids normally is me the one that take my niece to dance classes and her performance/presentation and all the dance related things while my SIL satay at home with my nephew because he is till a baby and is kind of disruptive in these situations (the dance teacher is really strict). One of my niece classmate (actually her BBF) goes to dance classes with her and that's how I got close with that mom (lets calls her Laura) . And even if we are not like close friends we hang out some times and when the 4 moms reunite they includes me or invites me.

While we were having coffee one of the moms (let call her Olivia) actually mentioned a story she read on reddit about how a widow doesn't allow her kids aunt (the dead husbands sister) to see the kids because she doesn't treat the kids of her new marriage the same way. And she asked me as an aunt my opinion.

Well the first thing I says was please to apologize me because as I am not a mom I cant sympathize at all with the mom of the story but that I feel really sorry for that aunt because the other kids are not her family. Then I say lets put an example if my brother and SIL get a divorce or my brother die, is that moment my SIL put a face like OMG!!! (here I can also be TA) and look directly at my SIL and says: I know you tents to misunderstood words so I am NOT saying I want or wish that for happens I am just setting an example. The other mom (Nella) laugh and says something like: We know how she is don't worries this is just an example. 

Then I continue saying that in a case like that if she remarries and have more kids then they wont be my problem at all and is not my responsibility at all to take care of them or provide for them or love them. Because my nibbling are my nibbling because they are my brother kids not hers. 

Then my SIL ask me with a strait face: If its the opposite? Well if my brother have kids with another woman they are my brother kids they will be my nibbling. So of course I will treat them like that. And I asked her: Like you mentioned if its the opposite do you expect your 3 sister to love or provide or whatever for the kids my brother has with another woman? If looks could k\*ll and would be in funeral right now. Since my SIL don't even care for my nibblings right now. 

And then all the other 3 moms agree with me Olivia even says that her sister is married with a man with 2 kids and since in 5 years she had only met them like twice a year she doesnt even consider them nibbling. And we just staying for like an extra hour. But the rest of the time you could see my SIL was upset.

"AITA for want my husband to spend more time with me? Complicate situation regarding his mom. OK since I was ask the job question. I didn't come here for a job AITA question, I come here for a MIL question. But I will answer here.

Lol Now I will answer the job question, I didn't see the need to answer as I did not come here for that.

My Shanghai businessman father has more money than my husband can ever have. When my parents died they leave me inheritance. Including a house in China. I do not want to work because I have my Shanghai businessman father inheritance money.

And if my husband drop his pride and ego and would let me use my inheritance money to help his mom, but No, the ""man"" him must do it ALL without the need of a woman penny.

I didn't come here for a job question, I come here for the MIL question.

=================

Sorry, English is my third language. Married 12 years, no kids.

I have a complicate situation, so please read all this so you can get a FAIR picture on all parties (my husband, me and his mom).

AITA for want my husband to balance between me and his mom? And want my husband to spend more time with me?

Situation is his mom whom old and had a stroke 4 years ago that leave her paralyze. For the past 4 years he use majority of his income to pay for her Private Nursing home so she can get the best quality care as well as a team of nurses care for her around the clock full time.

It NOT about the money, but it about he has to work 80 hours a week. He gone 12 hours a day at work. Which means less time to spend with me.

Also this is what bother me the most.

First of all his mom has a team of nurses that care for her, he pay load of money for that, the nurses can take her to her Dialysis 4x times a week. But No, his mom wants it must be her son, as his mom want to spend more time with her son.

Understandable, but each time Dialysis process is 5 hours, and 4x times a week that means 20 hours a week he gives to his mom. In ADDITION to him work 80 hours a week. So that 100 hours a week of his time total gone from me.

Let me show you his schedule so you see what I mean.

He work 8PM to 8AM, that is 12 hours a day.  
Home he take a quick shower and eat a bit, then he sleeps from 9AM to 1PM that is 4 hours sleep, and I do sleep with him.  
Then 1PM to 6PM he takes his paralyze mother to Dialysis process.  
6PM back he barely has 2 hours rest then 8PM he off to work again.  
Rise repeat.

In all fairness, he only take her to Dialysis 4x times a week, so he does have 3 days where he not take her so he will have that 5 hours from not take her, and I do let him sleep more on those days as I know he tired.

What do I want? I want him not to take her to Dialysis, but let the nurses does. I want him to say No to his mom on the Dialysis.  
He can visit her everyday at Nursing home if that what she wish, but he CANNOT just sit with her for FIVE hours straight of Dialysis, and it 4x times per week. While he has to work 80 HOURS a week.

Also, in addition, 2 days per month is she in our home where my husband care for her 24/7 on that 2 days she with us, so he also take out 2 more days give to her, in addition to all of that above.

In all fairness, doctors said his mom estimate to have 2 years left to live. BUT this has been going on for 4 years already since she had her stroke, so 2 more years it be 6 years total.

I endure this for the past 4 years already, he not spending enough time with me. I will continue endure for 2 more years out of love him.

No, I Not want his mom  to die, but I ask myself the question, what if 2 more years she still here, and 2 more years, and another 2 more years. How long will this go on, when is enough? When will he find a balance between me and his mom, and also take care of his health too.",0.77
"WIBTA if I don’t attend my girlfriend’s sisters wedding because my kid isn’t invited? I 44 have been with my girlfriend 41 for almost 2 years. We live together with her 2 kids who are 13 and 11. I also have a daughter with my ex wife who lives with us on the weekends and some weekdays every other week. My daughter is 14 and has gotten close with my girlfriend’s daughter who is the 13 yr old. 

My GFs sister is getting married in December and save the dates went out. They are doing a “mostly” child free wedding. Immediate nieces and nephews are the only children invited. There are a total of 8? I think kids who fit that category. My wife’s brother has 2 kids and the grooms brother has 4 so those are the nieces and nephews. 

Maybe I shouldn’t have assumed this, but since my girlfriend’s sister has been around a lot and met my daughter many times, I figured she would be invited. Especially since my gf and I are talking about marriage so my daughter will be officially part of the family. I found out through my gf that my daughter is not invited. 

When I was upset, my girlfriend said I was overreacting. She said my daughter is not her sisters niece. I told her that she really opened my eyes to the fact that her family, and even her, see my daughter as an “other” and not family. She claimed that’s not the case and I said that if we get married my daughter is as much a niece to her sister as her own kids are. 

I said that I’m rethinking going to the wedding. And to top it off, I heard my wife’s sister saying that I’m overreacting and restating that my daughter is not under her niece/nephew umbrella. So am I an asshole if I don’t go out of solidarity with my daughter? ",0.5
"AITA for telling my friend she can't change her name? My(19F) friend (19F), who we will call El, and I grew up closely. Our moms met at college and always wanted to have kids at the same time so we were pushed to be best friends.


El got bullied at middle school, causing severe anxiety.


El would text the guys I was with, and said it was because she couldn't believe a guy would choose me over her and it ruined her confidence. As soon as she got validation that they would cheat for her she would stop, she wasn't interested in the guys.


We still hang out a lot but we have never really had a deep connection, but still have lots of love for her because she can't help the way she is and I've known her forever.


I feel worried for whatever untreated issues she has going on (I have tried to talk to her and her mom but just get a hard response back).


When we hangout she cannot deal with a second of silence because she is worried the other person will think she is being awkward.


If we meet up with her friends together she will give me dirty looks or jab me in the side if she thinks I'm not talking enough, sometimes whispering ""You're embarrassing me, they are going to wonder why you don't talk."" Even if I am already being social. It is very hurtful and makes me more reserved.


She wants to change her name to something more charming, so people like her more based on first impressions. She also said she associates her deadname with being bullied. I was supportive in this.


Last week she told me she is going to legally change her name to the shortening of mine. My name is Lilian. She told me she is changing her name to Lily, which is my nickname and what my mom calls me. Even El calls me it instead of Lilian. She said it so casually, like pretending the two names are completely different.


I was very confused and started asking why she would choose the name but she acted confused as to why it bothered me so much, and even got rude about it.


Her mom is defending her saying it's a lovely name and not even my name so there's nothing weird about it at all. Her mom adores me and is so nice so I just don't understand how she would defend the name.


Our moms have fallen out over it as my mom thinks it's really creepy and unfair.


I have told her she can't use my name as it's creepy and there are so many better names out there she could have picked. She keeps saying it's just a name and not even my name.


She sent me a video today, which was ""What your name would be in a historical ficton""


your birth month = Darling, Miss, Princess, Damsel, followed by your first name.


She texted, ""I'm Darling Lily! What's yours?"" And I responded with ""Princess Lily too of course."" And she said ""Um. You can't be Lily as well. I'm Lily. Just use your middle name?"" She knows I have an ugly middle name, but yeah that was just her trying to force her new name onto me and it felt horrible.

"AITA For telling my wife that the house is not haunted. She’s just paranoid?  
My wife and I have been living in an old Victorian multi-family apartment building. Everything about it is old and dingy. I chalked it up to just that. Old. Not haunted. But my wife 100% believes there is an entity that goes into our apartment sometimes. She’s very spiritual and believes in all of that kind of stuff. Me, not so much. I think there’s an explanation for everything. Here are some things that have happened that I agree are weird, but there must be an explanation. 

1. Feelings of being watched. My wife said that’s what started with her. I have felt something eerie but I figured it was in my head. 

2. We have seen brooms fall from its tight spot between the wall and the fridge. Without anybody going into the kitchen or touching anything. She said she has heard keys jingle when nobody is home, fridge open.  When she was in the shower, a picture frame fell from the wall in the bathroom. 

3. Another time, I was using the bathroom and all the soaps and shampoo bottles fell from inside. I figured it might be the neighbor slamming his doors, but he wasn’t home. I thought that was weird. But again, an explanation. 

4. We have changed the batteries on our smoke detector many times, but whenever all this happens the smoke alarm seems to go off randomly two. For a few seconds, and then the second her or I go up to turn it off, it stops. 

5. Whenever this seems to happen, our back doorknob seems to be “stuck”. Like we will put our key in there, and the key will seem idk. Sticky in there. Like it doesn’t fit when it usually does with no problem. That’s what got me thinking something more sinister than a ghost. Possibly a creep breaking in? We don’t have anything to steal. 


One night, we were trying to go to bed and the smoke alarm went off again. This was close to 2am. She freaked out and said that she doesn’t understand what’s happening and she wants to move out. I told her she’s being paranoid and there are no ghosts. There’s no such thing. I agree it’s creepy but I just think moving is unnecessary. 

She thinks since all these things seem to happen all at once and leave all at once, then it much mean something. But I like the place and enjoy. ",0.58
"AITA because I refuse to kiss my partner unless he's clean shaven? My fiance sometimes falls behind on shaving his beard, which wouldn't be an issue if it didn't smell. I'm not kidding - the smell is terrible and has been so bad at times that I questioned him if he had stepped in dog shit, only to end a frantic sniff search by realising its his beard. Every. Time.

I have asked him to wash his face more thoroughly if he is going to keep his beard, and even bought him his own facial cleanser, but unless I physically come in and scrub his face myself it *always* smells like shit - literal feces. I tried every lighthearted approach to address the issue; asking him if he snacked on dog crap, telling him we should have a face washing contest and offering him a spa night experience before I finally just accepted the issue was getting out of hand and told him to either shave it off or start washing it properly.

He is frustrated and insists he washes it properly, I can smell that he hasn't and as a result I have refused to kiss him or be in close proximity of his beard unless it's shaven. This is quite possibly the dumbest dispute we have had in our entire relationship, but regardless AIBTA?",0.33
"AITA for calling the police on my ex over something that started as a ""joke"" My ex and I have 50/50 custody of our 10 year old daughter, Phoebe. 

2 weeks ago My ex sat Phoebe down and told her she will not be joining him, her stepmom, and her step siblings on their vacation because they wanted it to be family only. This was all bullshit. She was supposed to go. I had already given permission for him to take her out of the country and he bought her plane ticket. Phoebe didn't believe him at first but he kept doubling down and his wife and step kids confirmed that she wasn't going/they didn't want her to go. She locked herself in her room for the next 2 days and anytime she tried to leave to get food and water, they'd talk to her about the trip again. This led to Phoebe refusing to leave her room at all until I picked her up. She was a wreck when I picked her up and didn't improve much that week no matter how much I tried to convince her that her dad was lying. She clung to me, refused to eat or drink if I wasn't there, wasn't talking, and started sleeping in my bed. I've already reached out to her pediatrician and got her an appointment with a psychologist but they can't fit her in until beginning of September. I also got her a phone so she can call and text me while she's at her dad's house. 

She begged me not to make her go back but I didn't have a choice so she packed her backpack and I dropped her off. This was on Sunday. On Wednesday Phoebe started texting me saying she needs help but she wouldn't answer my calls or FaceTimes. I called my ex and he insisted that she was fine but wouldn't let me talk to her. I told him he had 10 seconds to get my kid on the phone or I was calling the police. He wouldn't get Phoebe on the phone so I called 911 and went over there. Police came and we found out Phoebe had locked herself in her room and pushed her desk up against the door. When we eventually did get inside she was in the same clothes that I dropped her off in and was so dehydrated that we had to take her to the ER. My ex confirmed that he hadn't seen or heard from her since I dropped her off and thinks she's throwing a temper tantrum because of his ""joke"". 

Now he's being investigated by CPS and we have an emergency custody hearing but he's pissed that I called the police on him over her ""tantrum"" because she ""can't take a joke"". AITA",0.4
"AITA for buying a new phone with my own money while expecting my parents to support my needs. Today I (M18) had an argument with my mom (F50) about something really stupid but it eventually devolved into an argument about trust. (For context, just before this argument I had asked if she could provide some money for a haircut.)

She explains how she can't trust me with the money for a haircut if I can't even be ""trusted with my own money"". She brings up how I bought a phone using my first paycheck when I didn't really need to get it and I have needs to fulfill.

 In a sense she is right because I bought this phone because it was one of my wants. I felt extremely guilty and am still upset at myself but a part of me felt like it wasn't fair.

 I allocate a good amount of my funds to things I need such as transportation and education savings. I was not aware I would need to allocate things like haircuts or my other needs, if I did I would pay for it myself and not buy things I want.

"AITA for refusing to share my Netflix password with my roommates? 
So, I (26M) live with two roommates, ""Tom"" (25M) and ""Jake"" (27M). We get along great most of the time, but recently, they’ve been asking me to share my Netflix password with them. I pay for my own account, and I like having my personal watch list, recommendations, and the peace of knowing no one’s messing with my viewing history. 

Tom and Jake have been arguing that since we share rent and utilities, sharing a Netflix account should be no big deal. They even tried to guilt-trip me by saying, “We’re all friends here, why can’t we share?” 

But here’s the thing: I don’t want to. I pay for it myself, and I like having my own space online, just like I have my own room in the house. Plus, I’ve heard horror stories about people’s Netflix accounts getting messed up when too many people use them. 

They’re now calling me stingy and acting like I’m the bad guy for not “contributing” to the household entertainment. But I think they should get their own subscriptions if they want to watch Netflix. It’s not that expensive to split between the two of them, right?

"AITA for judging my mom on her bizarre behavior and telling her she embarrassed me in front of my friends? My(16F) mom(46F) recently has been acting a bit weird ,it probably has to do with her going through a mid-life crisis. 

More recently she got a tattoo, mind you she didn’t have any tattoos before. And it’s kind of an inappropriate tattoo, it’s a woman wearing a bikini holding a gun. My dad and I couldn’t stop laughing when she first showed it to us. My dad explained to me she just probably wanted to complete her unfulfilled teenage years. Anyway I didn’t really mind that but I got even more concerned  when she bought a motorcycle. She had never even driven one before but she told us it made her feel free. I was appalled but it wasn’t that big of a deal to me but my dad was kind of pissed because we already had two really good cars and it was a waste of money to him .

It wasn’t until yesterday when things got out of hand. I invited my friends over to watch a movie and  in the middle of it she came back from “a business meeting” that’s what she had told us, turns out she had pierced BOTH of her nipples. I could tell because she was wearing a see-through shirt. I sat there shocked and I asked her where she was, she told us she went to the piercing shop and then went upstairs. My friends started giggling when she left and asked me why was my mom dressed like an 18 year old punk . I felt embarrassed and told them we could watch the movie another time.

When my friends left I started an argument with my mom and I called her immature and that she kind of embarrassed me in front of my friends coming in with her nipples pierced.

"AITAH? Wife dressing for and receiving validation from other men and it bothers me  My (36M) wife (35F) and I have been married for 8 years and have 2 children.  After having children she ended up staying home with them to raise them, which we both agreed on.  Now that they’re older and both in school starting this year, my wife has suddenly shifted her appearance and behaviour quite a lot.

She recently changed her hair, bought new tight revealing gym clothes (which she wears everywhere; even school pick-up and kids practices/games) that leaves nothing to the imagination.  Shes also started tanning and has even talked about getting some leg tattoos and other changes.  

I’m quite happy for her to be feeling more free now that the kids are in school but these changes came out of nowhere seemingly.  She also just got a new job this summer at a gym as a child care attendant for when people drop their kids off to workout and she enjoys it.  I’ve just noticed when we go out now, that the staring and constant attention is quite obvious.  

Ive mentioned it to her and she just plays it off or says she likes those shorts “because they’re comfy”.  She recently was out at the mall with her friend and came home to tell me about all the guys staring at her and what a confidence boost it was and that “she still has it.”

"AITA for not lending my SO money? My (30 F) significant other (30 M) seems to be in a pickle and asked me to borrow some cash. Career-wise I am a few years ahead so I live and spend comfortably.

I never mind paying for dates and meals, and on several occasions have promised to be there and support him while he works on himself and his future.

I just kept telling my self it was ok bc it was only going to be for a month or two.i gave Amber and Mandy a room upstairs and Crystal a room downstairs. Then I let them use the whole garage, all the walking space upstairs, over half of the fridge, and about half of the cabinet downstairs in the kitchen. all I asked was if their dogs make a mess clean it and if they mess anything up fix it. Once again thought it would be ok as long as it was only 3 months tops.So now I'm sitting here 2 and half months later.

So I told Mandy when she came house from work that they needed to pay some rent. Nothing to big like 200 maybe 300 a month that's it but she kept saying they couldn't do that bc they had other bills (such as a phone car and medical bill) and they couldnt pay thoses and save money.

We then went to Walmart to see if they had any. They did but the only ones they had were $6 per pair.

When he came home from school that night he told us that when the teacher was trying to open the package she cut the cord on the headphones. He told us that when she did this she told him that we would need to replace the headphones. My biggest problem with this is that the teacher never said anything to us about it. She has our phone numbers and even sent us pictures from the first day of school. She could have sent a quick message letting us know what happened but didn't.

"AITA for complaining about the food my ex makes? For some context I (40) and my ex wife (35F) got divorced five years ago. While we were together we had twin girls. We maintain a healthy co-parent relationship and she’s doesn’t prefer to communicate outside of that.

When my wife and I were together she enjoyed making things from scratch. Mostly food but clothes as well. She would always tell me she wanted to live on a farm. I always thought that it was all a waste of money, but let it be.

Now that we’re divorced, she moved onto the farm she always wanted and grows various kinds of fruits and vegetables. She has also continued to make even more food from scratch but now feeds this food to our daughters. Apparently it makes up most of their diet.

The problem comes in when it is mealtime when I have custody of our daughters. The girls refuse to eat anything I make. I usually use store bought pasta, bread, jam, cheese, yogurt etc, all things their mother makes for scratch. They often complain about the taste and say they can’t taste the difference if I try and lie to them.

I talked to my ex about this a few times. Her solution was to send over a few things to give them. But I really don’t see the point in not just giving them regular food. It seems like they are developing a snobbish attitude from this. I communicated this to my ex but she keeps saying it’s healthier and that she isn’t going to keep arguing with me. She also offered to teach me to make a few things but I told her I wasn’t going to waste my time or money making anything from scratch

I asked her to stop feeding the girls that food and she told me to grow up. So now I think I’m an asshole because she doesn’t get mad this easily.",0.67
"AITA for not apologising to a farmer I trespassed? I'm a novice runner, currently on holiday in the countryside. I went for a run a few minutes ago which I could have sworn blind was entirely on public roads, but on the route itself I got disoriented and ended up running down a parallel track which belonged to a local farmer. I know this because the farmer chased me down in his car when I was back on the public roads to give me a telling off! 

I was polite but (incorrectly) confident I was on public land, and offered to show him a photo of the map which proved I was in the right (even though obviously all it would have shown I was an idiot), so I'm pretty sure he understood I was just confused and not trying to steal from him or anything.

After having got home I checked the map, realised I was wrong and don't know what to do next. My friends who I am with think that he wouldn't want to be bothered by me going back on his land and interrupting him to apologise, but also I was in the wrong and would want to be apologised to if the situation was reversed. AITA for going with the majority opinion that I should just leave it (and be more careful about route-plannint in future)?

I wfh, she works retail and is on her feet, and understandably says she doesn’t have the motivation. I’ve lost weight and feel good, but I am feeling less attracted to her.

She comes up to me today to tell me she told her friend let’s call him brady (M38ish) that i was pregnant and as she was telling me this i cut her off and i go “why do u gotta tell people that i’m pregnant without asking me first?” she states that she’s only telling people that she knows won’t tell anyone but i still feel like she should ask me first considering i haven’t even been to the doctor yet to confirm that i am.

"AITA for yelling at my friend and kicking him out instead of staying calm over a situation I panicked in? I know that yelling is such low-level behavior that just makes you seem unreasonable and not worth taking serious, but on the other hand my friend put my dog in risk so I am on the fence on whether I did was assholish or not

My friend came over and we were playing minecraft together. We had spaghetti with meatballs and the meatballs were huge (you will see why the size is relevant in a bit). I don't allow my dog (Mookie) in my room but he can be rebellious at times that he came into my room without me noticing. This dog is a small yorkie and while I don't condone giving dogs table food, my parents do and they learned the hard way that meat makes Mookie really sick (Mookie did not deserve to get involved over my parents' negligence and it still pisses me off to this day)

Without asking me, my friend just tosses an entire meatball to Mookie and I freak tf out because the dog just ate the whole thing in seconds. ""WHAT THE HELL?!"" My friend is shocked and immediatlely gets pissed. ""Why are you yelling at me?!"" I explain to him that meat is bad for my dog, and just because it doesn't affect my other dogs doesn't mean they all react the same way to meat. I continue to yell at him as I am filled with fear, anger and adrenaline, panicking and screaming, ""he has never eaten that much meat! What if it kills him?!"" I immediately start calling and making an appointment to the vet.and when I was done with the call, my friend went back at it again. ""Look I fucked up and I'm sorry but you don't have to yell at me! Yelling doesn't solve anything and it won't make the dog throw it back up!"" I cut him off and get louder because what he said angered me so much. ""ACTUALLY YES HE WILL THROW UP THE MEATBALL BACK UP, HE THROWS UP WHENEVER HE EATS MEAT BUT WHATEVER IS IN THAT MEAT IS ALREADY IN HIS SYSTEM!!!"" I probably didn't make sense there, I actually don't know how that works but I was thinking irrationally. After yelling back and forth, I saw that it was finally time to take Mookie to the vet, so I immediately kicked my friend out and headed straight to the vet

Long story short, Mookie threw up two times and had to get serious medical attention. My friend refused to pay for the vet bill

"AITA for not letting my boyfriend’s family to come over to our shared home? I (23F) have been with my boyfriend (23M) for five years. He was raised in a large family very wealthy and he was not raised with very many rules, he was babied, textbook “mamas boy”. However, he IS technically the least babied out of all his family so he feels like an “outcast”. His sister, who was previously my best friend, often shares her rude opinions about our relationship and causes us to argue because she calls me selfish and think I’m trying to take his family’s money. She will never bring these things up to me, only him. 
Tonight, my boyfriend called me to ask if his younger siblings could come over to our shared home. His argument is that I regularly bring my special needs brother to my house because I assist my mother taking care of him. The difference in the two, is that his siblings do not respect our home and they don’t listen to discipline. They stay up all night playing video games and keep me up when I work M-F as a Nurse. My brother is very respectful of our home and just watches tv and it’s like he doesn’t even live there. 
I attempted to set a boundary asking my bf if he could please not bring them over as I am tired from work and don’t want to be kept up all night; and of course my brother was thrown in my face and his sister told him that it is very fucked up of me to not “allow” his family over to my house.

I feel like hes going to get serious hurt or worst. I told my dad that I want to call and report the time before last he escaped. (He's escaped 5 times total I know of) But my father told me no. He says they are having a hard time because our neighbor is going threw a divorce and it's not our business and the neighbor is a good parent. We fought and basically told him that it will be on his conscience if something happens to that boy. So now comes to today. The past month the older son and neighbor have had problems and cops have been called 6 times.

"AITA For Declining A Freshman To Take Over My Research Project I am a junior high school student that is currently working on a three year long research project, and I'm waiting until my senior year before I have a freshman take over and 'continue my legacy. My academy focuses on these research projects and I have worked my butt off in order to make it pure perfection. I even go to conferences to present my work and compete against college students and professors.
A new freshman student who has gotten the attention of my teacher has been assigned to work on my research project with me, being my 'little lab assistant' so that I don't have to do that much work, my teacher said. 

My project focuses on going out to certain rivers to take water samples every month, and I don't mind doing it at all. I actually enjoy the moments that I go with family to collect and it isn't considered a nuisance to me at all. I am in love with science and love working with chemicals, which is also a part of my project, and the fact that some freshman will take over in order to 'take some of the workload off' isn't sitting right with me.

l also have to mention that I am the type of person that wants to get stuff done by myself because I always think there's the potential that if I trust somebody else with it, they'll mess it up. The last thing I would want to do is depend on a freshman for my research project that I have worked so hard on.

I haven't brought it up to my teacher that I want to work on this alone because I'm afraid I'm being selfish for not giving the freshman a chance but this is my project and I don't want to start collaborating with anybody until senior year. As soon as I’m a senior, I would LOVE to train that same person so that when I go off to college I know my project is in good hands. I also trust a sophomore a lot better than a freshman.

"AITA for texting a stranger to stfu? I (24M) was speaking to my friend Ryan (Fake Name 24M) about potentially having him come help move some heavy items. We initially spoke over instagram. He asked me to text his phone number the details of what was needed. I went to check if i still had his number and I apparently still had it. I texted him the details of what was needed thinking it was him. Boy was I wrong

It turns out he changed his number because a father texted back saying that it wasn’t Ryan and it was his 13 year old daughter’s phone. I was caught off guard and profusely apologized by saying “oh I am very sorry!! This used to be my friends number and I thought it still was. Sorry for any confusion” thinking it was the end of that conversation 

Well it wasn’t. The dude proceeded to ask why I was texting his 13 year old daughter’s phone at 9 pm on a Tuesday. I, politely, explained that I was trying to text my friend some info and the number was his contact info in my phone. I, again, apologized.

Well that wasn’t good enough for him, and he proceeded to tell me that this had been his daughter’s phone number for the last 2 years. Having some annoyance, I replied that this was my friends number at least 4 years ago. I promised him that I would lose the number and leave it at that

This is where I may be the AH. This guy ends up CALLING me and states how I am such a creep for calling his 13 year old daughter and that he has half a mind to call the cops. Having enough of this, I recorded myself on my friends phone explaining the situation one last time and told him to stfu and I won’t call back if he won’t.

"WIBTA if I leave my boyfriend homeless My boyfriend (36M) and I (30F) have been dating for 7 years and living together for 5 years. A couple years ago I was experiencing mental health issues because of work and decided to take a break to think about a different career. I had saved enough money to cover my half of rent and contribute to some of the groceries for a year. But I ended up not finding a job until 5 months after the year passed. So in those 5 months my boyfriend covered my share of rent and food which I paid him back for when I started working again.
When my boyfriend quit his job almost 2 years ago I was supportive. It was a terrible work environment where the boss was treating everyone terribly. He had a little saved up but not as much as I had when I quit my old job, so he was able to cover his half of rent for a while but not groceries. At first I didn't mind, I felt like I was returning the favor for him supporting me before. But his money ran out 10 months ago, and I've been paying everything. And I don't make a lot for living in one of the most expensive cities in our country. I don't even have an emergency fund anymore, it's just paycheck to paycheck. I've helped him with his resume and cover letters so he can start applying to jobs. I asked him if his parents could lend him some money but he's too embarrassed to ask even though I'm sure they would be happy to help him out. I don't want to pressure him so I try not to mention it but every day I'm stressed about money. Of course I love him, we're like  best friends. We share all the same interests, we have very compatible personalities. And both still very much attracted to eachother. Both of us smoke weed, which was a habit I picked up from him and I know it's not good for my mental health but at this point I feel like I need it to distract myself from how stressed I am all the time. I know it's a problem. And it must be effecting my boyfriend's motivation as well. He stays up all night playing video games and then sleeps until I get off work at 4pm. He's applied for 3 jobs and had 2 interviews.
I'm worried about him, like maybe he's depressed. I feel like I've done everything I can to be there for him. And at this point am I just enabling him? I really don't want to end our relationship, the idea of that is insane to me. But I have student loans to think about and credit card debt. I can't afford to take care of a whole other person. But I really couldn't live with myself if he ends up homeless. And even though he promised even if we broke up he'd still pay me back all the months of rent I covered, I don't believe that's possible if he also has to worry about his own rent. So having him leave might mean I wasted all this time on our relationship and all the money I'll never get back. I want to have the kind of relationship where we help eachother no matter what. I don't want to give up on him, and I would feel like an asshole if I let money get in the way.",0.1
"AITA for uninviting my friend for my birthday party?  Hi guys, this is my first post here because I am not usual to the english community, only my mother tongue. But I wanted wider opinions on that, that’s why I’m here. 

So, I have a friend group of 7 friends and we spend most of our days at school, and we have been friends for the past 3 years. And there’s one specific friend that used to hit on my boyfriend in the past and he was a bit clueless about it because it was really subtle, even though she knew we were together. It happened in the first two months of our relationship and since then he blocked her and kept distance as much as he could despiste we both going to the same school and he interacting with my friend groups (with include her). She also tried to hit on his two best friends as well and now keeps a ‘friendship’ with their girlfriends. 

I dealt with this situation with my boyfriend only because I am not very close to her, and he was very understanding and we solved this problem in the first months of relationship (years ago), but I still feel very conflicting about the idea of them interacting in social backgrounds because it remembers me that said situation (which was in the first days of dating, it’s yet very remarkable because he’s my first boyfriend ever). So I talked to him and discussed about the incoming birthday party. 

The other two girls in our friend groups celebrate their birthday in the same week as mine and we decided to throw a themed party together for the first time and invite our friends. But the thought of having my bf and she in the same space (btw the party will be happening in MY house), I feel like I need to cancel it, even though I am really close to my girl friends that will share the birthday with me. 

My boyfriend told me he didn’t want to miss the party because he’s part of my family now and it’s a special moment to share with me, and if I am uncomfortable in my own party and house, I should talk to my friends and explain why I didn’t want her there. 

But I thought it would be embarrassing to her talk about excluding her from the party behind her back, so I talked to her in private. I explained her that I wanted our friendship to deepen but, because of our past, I couldn’t feel like it but I searched for forgive in my heart, although she never apologized. And I told her that I was very uncomfortable to put her in this situation and before considering texting her, I considered canceling the party without explanations to my friends. And that I was really sorry that everything happened in the past led to this moment in our lives. She said she was okay. 

But from three days now, everytime I try to talk to her she’s very rude and she’s been whispering with my other friends when I am afar, and has blocked me. I know she’s very sensitive and I feel like shit for uninviting her from the party because my two other friends has no problem with her. Am I the asshole for this?

"AITA for not trusting my boyfriend to smoke/drink? aita


1, 16F, have a boyfriend, who just turned 18. We will call him K. We have been together for almost 2 years now and I can't be happier. Before we met, K was always high or drinking, and was very very addicted to both. He would smoke weed and nic everyday, and was always finding a way to drink. He was in an emotionally abusive
relationship. I on the other hand, was with someone who was constantly drunk. He ended up graping me. 

I gained massive trauma with that, and now take medication for my disorders. K has disorders too and is taking medication. 

K went full turkey for me and was completely sober until one day. I was in a mental hospital when K relapsed and got high because he was super upset that I was in the hospital. I can't be with someone like that, so he promised to become better. I did lose a lot of trust in him but we remain together. 

Recently we went to a party with drinks. He was almost about to drink then we left. I lost a lot of trust in him. He says he wants to be like his friends and have fun. He called me maipulative and controlling. Mind you I don't ask anything from him and this is the only thing I expect from him. We continued our argument. I said that he can drink if he really wants to, but I let him know it would cause a crash in our relationship. We managed to come to a compromise that he can drink when he's of age, maybe a little younger, and it has to be around me. 

He still sometimes blames me for his yearning for alcohol and drugs. How can I stand up for myself without sounding controlling or manipulative? Am I doing something wrong? I really don't know. ",0.04
"AITA for telling my in laws we’re eloping?  My (27f) boyfriend (23M) are planning on eloping. I am currently 24 weeks pregnant and we have been planning this for a while. We were going to wait longer but decided we wanted to be  married when I give birth to our daughter. While I love my boyfriends family, they are very intrusive. I personally don’t handle this well, my boyfriend on the other hand knowing them his whole life tends to ignore their antics because he knows how they can be. This is NOT to mean that he isn’t supportive of me or doesn’t set boundaries. 

Here’s where the problem lies. I obviously know he’s going to propose to me, since we’re eloping on a specific date soon. His mother offered her original engagement ring to him for me as a family heirloom. He went to go get it and ran into his younger brother (21m) while he picked up the ring. By the time he got home his brother called him to let him know “he knows what he’s doing and what he took.” My boyfriend trying to be the semi secretive person he is, tries to play it off. His brother then informs him he’s just going to call their mother to confirm what he’s doing. Me and my boyfriend have no secrets so he tells me all of this and I’m immediately angry for him because he cannot do anything with out them being intrusive. So I flat out texted his whole family and ruined what was supposed to be a secret intimate thing between me and him (which is the reason we didn’t out right tell everyone). This is where I might be the ahole because I sent a very aggressive text to everyone that simply said “since ___ can’t do anything with any privacy, we are getting married this date and no one is invited.” I feel like I said the wrong thing to my future in laws but I am really sick of their behavior.

I’ve told him many times it’s gross, not acceptable behavior, and not to do it  again and he just argues he’s too lazy to walk to a sink to spit and it’s no big deal and I’m just a stupid parent.  We typically exchange some heated conversation and than drop the subject.  Well today he did it and I got really mad at him because he was like 3 feet from a sink.

"AITA for working hard and costing my co-workers money because of it?  I recently got hired at a warehouse, it’s a medium sized unionized company and I’m on the last shift with seven other people. I’ve ADHD so this job is perfect for me, always moving and it’s really rewarding finishing a job that’s well done. Because of the nature of my mental disorder, I just move fast naturally. I can’t stand moving at a slow pace like the other guys. 

Since it’s a small team of seven, my productivity matters a lot more for the other guys. When all the work is done, we just relax until we’re finish our 8 hour shift. Well turns out, this wasn’t necessarily the norm before I got hired. Since they worked a lot slower, they usually worked an extra 2-4 hours every night. They got paid 1.5x for 2 extra hours and double time for anything over 10 hours. 

One of them came to me during break and asked me to slow down because of reasons above. I told him that I’ll work at my own preferred pace, he’s not management and doesn’t sign my checks. He then said “I’ve got kids to feed and a mortgage, we all need the extra money. You’re costing us money kid”. I told him that he can always find another job or work a second one, I’m not costing him any money.

"AITA for not checking in on my friends while I was focusing on my health?  To start, I am usually the friend that reaches out to everyone to see how they're doing, and rarely the one that gets checked on.

But for additional context, the last calendar year has been extremely hard for mentally, emotionally and physically. I've been dealing with a compressed nerve as a result of a car accident  that took over a year to diagnose and after imaging, physical therapy, nerve conduction studies, more imaging, nerve blocks and epidural spinal infections, I was exhausted. During that entire time, I couldn't take time off work because I didn't have enough balances after taking days off after each injection procedure, and had to work late to make up time for appointments that I had to take during the day. 

I also got put on gabapentin, but after one night of very scary nightmares and a spiral of dark thoughts, I stopped taking it, wasn't worth it. I'm now two months post physical therapy that is actually working. I'm in a much better head space, and I haven't been a complete hermit to a few very close friends, but some I honestly just forgot to reach out to. It isn't intentional, I just feel like my brain was full with what I had to do each day and I could only handle so much a day, and even another text to someone seemed like a chore. 

I reached out to a friend of mine and it isn't unusual to go a month or two without speaking, but when I reached out to ask how she was, I got met with ""oh, now you decide to come out from under your rock and message me. Are you going to ask how I'm doing?"" I got so put off right away because she knew what I was going through, but not once did she initiate a message to see how I was doing. I didn't respond until the next day and I mentioned everything I was going through and the progress I've been making, only, again to be met with"" you're not the only one going through things right now""

I'm hurt, because, I tend to be the one who checks in on people when I can, but during that year I normally wouldn't hear from some people until I reached out to them first. I actually had someone tell me ""you haven't reached out to me in a while to see how I was doing, so I started to get worried about you."" 

Not to trigger warn, but I had very dark thoughts during the last year at certain times, and considered... Thoughts. I won't go into detail, but it was mentally very hard.

"AITA for accidentally touching my friend? I am completely aware how this sounds, but please, here me out, because I need some peace in this.

To start, I don't like people coming up behind me. Whenever someone does, I have a sort of fight or flight reaction. But my fight and flight happens at the same time. It's normally like a small nudge, followed by me backing up. I usually tell that to people after they come up behind me the first time.

I have this friend who I'll just call Donnie. Don was born a female, but now identifies as a male. I knew this, and always accepted Donnie. Prior to the main problem, Donnie has either seen other people come up behind me and has seen me express my discomfort towards it, or has done it himself and I guess completely ignored my discomfort towards it.

One day, he came up behind me. I did the usual nudge and back up, and I accidently touched Donnie's chest area. It was an obvious accident. Donnie has talked about how he knows it was an accident, but still keeps bringing it up. It's gone as far as him saying things like ""You groped me"" in a joking manner. He has also compared me to people who have groped people intentionally, and have gotten arrested for it. I would never do that to somebody, but he still brings it up everyday, as if I did it intentionally. I have apologized more times then I could count, but he still says it. Am I the asshole?",0.05
AITA for being in love with my fwb I FTM17 had a fwb since I was 16 with the same guy M17. I actually had feelings for him and thought he was the one for a long time. He only wanted to be fwb and nothing more he said he was waiting for college to date. I told him I would wait for him so I did. We keep doing things until I told him I loved him. He kept saying it back but didn’t mean it. our relationship was really good until he ghosted me for two months then blamed it on me. We started doing things again and started saying I love you again. I was in love again. recently he told me we can’t talk anymore because he was getting serious with another girl. I was heartbroken and so mad at him. i got a boyfriend a couple weeks after then he messaged me asking to be sexual with him again. I told him i have a boyfriend and he has a girlfriend but wouldn’t drop it and kept pushing me to do things with him. i told my boyfriend and said i’m not going to do anything. M17 wouldn’t stop until i gave in on messages once i felt horrible for with i did and told my best friend what happened. I think i still love my old Fwb and i don’t know what to do. ,0.5
"AITA for not letting my mother bring her boyfriend of 17 years to my wedding? This is a long story so bare with me. I will use all fake names too. I will also need to cut A LOT out. (My family is nuts). 

My parents are swinger's and when I was 14 they fell in love with another couple and decided to move in with them. 

In the house was myself, my brother, my parents, the other couple and their 2 boys. There was a lot of fighting and overall was really toxic. 

They lived together for 15 years until the woman (let's say Eve) from the other couple passed away from bone cancer.

After Eve died everything changed in the family. Originally my mother and father were going to stay together and move out. 
However, my mom decided she didn't want to move out and leave the other man (let's say Frank). 

They decided to get a divorce, however, a month or so later they appeared to reconcile and moved out together. 
After 3 or so weeks my mom decides to go back to Frank and leave my dad. 
I found out she was still talking to Frank even though she was trying to reconcile with my father the whole time. 
Now, it's been almost 2 years since I saw the other family including Frank. 

I understand relationships don't work out for everyone. I don't hold that against her but her going behind his back really upset us. 

My fiance and I struggle financially and we  were trying to figure out the best options for our budget. I told my mom about the wedding and she offered to pay for the wedding venue and dress. And we accepted. 

Now, my mom keeps bringing up Frank and his kids trying to get me to invite them to my wedding, bridal shower and such. I have told her no many times. 

Everytime she somehow manages to make me feel like the bad guy but I feel like I'm setting fair boundaries. We are worried she is only helping with the wedding because she wants us to all get along again. 
She claims we aren't trying to see it from her perspective and that we don't care about her happiness. 

AITA? 

Edit: mom did know Frank and his kids weren't welcome at my wedding before offering. 
We are willing to cancel the wedding, we are fine with going with our original plan of a pavilion and potluck. We only want a small wedding, we have around 30 guests, mom found an adorable cheap little venue in the area (still more than we can afford tho). Idk if the amount matters in this situation, but the venue was $1,200, and my dress was $80. 
My dad absolutely hates Frank.
I appreciate the feedback too. It is hard to step out of the situation and try to look at without bias. ",0.56
"AITA for divulging a coworker's medical issues in order to stop an unwarranted intervention? Thus situation actually happened a couple years ago, but I thought about it recently and was wondering if I made the right decision.

A couple years ago I had been working for a few years as an assistant teacher at an elementary school. The lead teacher I worked with was a wonderful lady and we had a great work relationship. I received comments from some other coworkers about how they could never work directly with her, but I never really understood them. She had high standards, in that she was a hard worker and she expected the same out of others, but that's the most I can figure.

During my time their, she began experiencing some major health issues. Basically, she had uncontrollable type 2 diabetes. She would barely eat anything and her blood sugar would skyrocket. She was losing a ton of weight, coming to school every day with blood sugar levels that would put most people in the hospital, and spending her afternoons at endless doctors appointments.

One day in the middle of class, another teacher came to our room and asked to speak to me in the hall. He said that he and some of our other coworkers had seen how little my lead had been eating, and how much weight she was losing, and were planning to hold an intervention for her anorexia. I think he was hoping I'd join them.

I thought about how to respond. Maybe I should've told him I wasn't interested and gone to HR. Maybe I should've told my lead what he had said and let her handle it. But in the moment I just couldn't stand the thought of her having to deal with even more than she already was. So I told him basically everything that I described above. And told him that an intervention was completely unnecessary. He basically said, ""oh, I see."" And walked off. I never heard anything else about it. And I didn't mention it to my lead. 

I don't know if she would've wanted me to tell him everything. Maybe that was the wrong choice to make, and I'm an AH for divulging her personal medical issues to another coworker without her consent.

She did end up getting everything figured out though. Turns out her type 2 diabetes had turned into type 1, and she just needed to start using insulin.

Anyways, reddit, am I the A hole?",0.84
"AITA for not buying my Mom cigarettes while she recovers from surgery  My entire life my mom has smoked cigarettes. I often smelled like cigarettes while going to school and have some minor breathing problems caused by secondhand smoke. When I turned 20 she always mentioned how my next birthday I could buy her cigarettes and how excited she was about it. She always brought it up and the closer it got to my birthday the more she would do so. I actively vowed that when I turned 21 I would never buy her cigarettes, and I told her that. Fast forward to now, I’m about 2 months into being 21, and my mom recently had a surgery thats left her unable to drive during the recovery period. Ive been helping her with other things like moving stuff for her setting up her bed and chairs, basically whatever she needs I try to help. She finally asked if I would go buy her a pack of cigarettes today, and I said no. Shes acting like it’s the worst thing I’ve ever said to her. Am i the asshole? Do I just not get it?

"AITA for telling my brother I don't want other people to know he is my brother in high school Hi. I am 17F and I have a brother that is 12 and we will be going to the same high school soon.

The other day, I told him I don't want people to know we're siblings.

My brother is an iPad kid who always plays mobile games like Roblox. He also plays on his laptop, watches YouTube, and other activities. However, he does this excessively; he would play games the whole day, and I mean 5-8 hours a day.

This has been happening for at least 3 years now. My parents have tried everything they can to stop my brother from literally being addicted to games. They have scolded him, taken his devices away, and even severely shouted at him, but nothing works. He ignores everything my parents say, and when my parents take the devices away, he either takes them back or annoys them during their work hours (they work at home) until they give the devices back to him. Furthermore, he has a severe case of spoiled brat attitude, and since he is entering puberty, he has a stuck-up, ""nobody cares about me,"" and ""you guys are all against me attitude"" around all of us. Additionally, my brother has horrible grades, and with the current trajectory he is going, he will be failing all his classes or getting C's and D's. Worst of all, he has nothing else in his life; no sports, no hobbies, no passions, no social skills, literally nothing.

Since he is entering the same school I am, I do not want to be associated with him. In my current high school, all the teachers like me, I have good leadership positions, and my GPA is decently high. However, once he enters, I feel like he will be horrible in his classes. Although he won't directly insult the teachers, he probably won't do his homework, fail most of his tests, and if the teachers are strict, he is the type to purposely hand in a black test paper because he doesn't like them. Worst case, if he really doesn't like the teacher, he will talk back at them and give them the look that pisses all teachers off.

I worry that if it's known I’m his sister, I'll be obligated to help him, especially if my teacher makes a comments about it. Furthermore, if he does become rude to the teachers, they will have a subconscious negative perception of me, which in some cases hurts my recommendation letters and my grades. If my brother becomes infamously rude and annoying, I feel like my friends will always mention it like ""oh hey why is your brother Steve so unlike you"" or ""hey did you hear what your brother did today,"" and I will suddenly become responsible cleaning up my brother's every actions and its consequences. I don't want my brother's reputation to stain what I have built for four years. I guess I am selfishly asking him not to be associated with me because he is, in my eyes, an embarrassment both to society and to my family. In my heart, he is still my brother, but I see him as a lost cause that isn't willing to help himself, and I don't want to be pressured to help him.

WIBTA if I choose to not associate with him in high school?

Edit:

I see a lot of comments saying I'm the AH and it's quite a reality check. I appreciate it.

I wrote this in a fit of rage because my parents got into an argument again over my brother and I also got shouted at so I was just really mad at him and I felt the need to blow off some steam.

I think I should clarify some things: I just don't want to be around him in high school, but I won't bully him. I want to help him, and I've tried in the past but it never worked out. My parents work a lot of over time so they sometimes don't have the time or energy to help my brother, and I'm guessing they're basing off how I came out so they expect my brother to be more responsible.

I know a lot of the issues for my brother is more complex and I don't want to expose that in a Reddit post since that's more for therapists. But I suppose more of my main problem is that I don't want him to keep on acting like this, but he isn't willing to change no matter what method we tried. And this isn't just affecting him, but it's also affecting how our family functions because now a lot of times my parents argue a lot and I also get entangled into it. So I'm hoping that ppl on Reddit will help with that because I really don't know what to do.

Edit #2: I wanted to clarify our ages. I am born 2007 and my brother is born 2011. So when he is in grade 8, I will be in grade 12. I think I should also clarify that these are more of my internal thoughts. I've never said these words to him because we don't really talk much.

Edit #3: I've been reading the comments for an hour or two and I've also been replying to some. It's getting quite late and I don't want to stay up too late so yeah. I'll just say some last thoughts:

I'll try talking to my parents about just letting me take the devices. It's summer right now so there isn't homework, but I'll try help my brother with homework but I hope he can gain some new friends that will study with him instead of having me. I actually never said ""I don't want other people to know you are my brother,"" but because AITA doesn't allow non-action things so I made it so I did. I just wanted to see the general opinion of my potential future actions. I realized that yeah, I'm a pretty asshole of a sister, and I'll try to change by following some of the advice on Reddit. But I think that the situation is too complicated for people on Reddit to really understand and there are too many details that can't really be written out on a Reddit post, so I might ask some of my friends because they understand my family situation a bit better.

I think there is a lot of serious underlying issues with my family, and I acknowledge that. I understand some of the things my brother is going through because I also went through that-- after all we live in the same household. I guess that also makes me more of an asshole knowing what he is going through but not helping.

I always thought the methods my parents use will be useful to him since it was useful against me, but I think Reddit gave me a new perception on that. I also never really thought being 12 is that young, but the comments allowed more insight into that. 

I'll try my best to be a better sister from now on. Our relationship isn't negative per-say, it's just stagnant, kind of like roommates with occasional fights. But I'll try to talk to him about life in general. 

Thanks for the comments. Some of them were mean, some were brutally honest, and some were both. But I think that they helped me a bit on at least what my next steps should be.

I'm also the type to delete Reddit accounts in a day or two so this post will likely be gone soon, but thanks for the advice.

"WIBTA for changing my wedding cake request for a 3rd time? WIBTA for changing my wedding cake request for a 3rd time?

I (31F) am getting married on September 28th, and a friend (31F) has agreed to make the cake in payment for a few times I helped her out with babysitting, a few years back...I have told her repeatedly that I don't need any payment but she says that she HAS to give me something, and she enjoys baking.

My wedding is themed after Up and originally, I was just going to have a 2-tier and use my Up topper...but being ever concerned about being a burden, as well as a craft loving individual, I changed my request to a single tier with 3-dozen balloon cupcakes as I felt like it would make things easier for her, and give me the opportunity to build a display to show  off the in theme cake and cupcakes.

BUT...prior to the wedding I am extremely busy and have a bunch of crafts to finish, and am worried that I won't have time to finish all of them and my display in time.

I am aware that the wedding timing was poorly arranged, but due to family health deteriorating and other circumstances...later in the next few months just wasn't feasible either.

I have a few friends who are telling me that I would be a bit asshole-ish to ask her to change plans AGAIN, but others who are saying that since she offered to make the cake she should expect ""bride brain"" and for me to change my mind.

So...would I be the asshole to ask her to revert the cake back to our original plan, when I have already requested a change of plans when this is gift she is doing for free???",0.8
"AITA for telling my friend he is too old for the church he attends and should fine a different one? So I (27M) have been friends with this guy
(33M) since I was a freshman in college.
We attended church together back then, and I was an attendee and even an intern there, 5 years total for me. Moved to a big city in a different state for nearly four years, but moved back recently this year.
The church we attended is a ""college ministry"". I use quotations because it is a church, so everyone is welcome. But it is very purposefully a college ministry, that's why it was founded and that's what the staff is there for. Fostering faith in college students who want it, and serving and caring for the community they're in. I don't want this post to be about anyone's opinions on church or religion as a whole, just on this next part. My friend still attends there. He's welcome, of course, it's a church and they're wonderful folks. But me and some friends had encouraged him to find a new church BEFORE I moved to a different state in 2020. We'd encouraged him for his age, because he was 29 at the time and single. The being single is a big thing, because he is active and vocal about wanting marriage and a relationship, even today four years later. He's 33 and wants a girlfriend, problem is that his ""dating pool"" is 18-22 year olds. I myself decided not to attend this church anymore myself since moving back. Being 26 and a single man at that time, I truly feel there's no reason someone my age should be interacting with college students so much younger than me, unless it's literally their job. I was just looking for a church, so I went to one where I'm on the young end, a big church that spans multiple generations. He's 5 years older than me and still is looking for a girlfriend amongst the students. He's a kind and sweet guy, l'm confident that he'd never hurt a fly. But it would be so easy for him to just been seen as creepy. I feel that the age difference alone between him and a college freshman Makes their interactions creepy. I remember him telling me he'd be fine with dating a girl that much younger than him before I moved, we're talking PRE-COVID, folks. I've had many chats with him about this over the last 5 years, like at least 4 separate
conversations, but he loves it there and is still adamant he'll marry someone from this church. So... AITA for telling my friend he's too old for the church he attends and he should find another?",0.06
"AITA for screaming at my roommate for getting a cat? A little background information: My (20f) roommate's (19f) ""fiance"" (21m) was incredibly abusive to the point where I would never see her, and he told her enough lies to make her awful to me and my friends.

Just recently he cheated on her a second time and she finally broke up with him. This is when I found out that he was freeloading off of her and that we are soon to be evicted on the 5th of September. She apologizes profusely for how she acted to me and my friends for the past few months. We each sat her down and told her all of the awful things she has done to us and that she should take accountability for once and really truly apologize. She ended up apologizing.

A few days pass after the breakup and it seems like everything is going to be ok, we have a plan to catch up on the late payments that her ex-fiance owes and we are even planning to sue him for damages and money he owes to countless people. We both agreed to pay this large payment and be frugal for the next 2-3 weeks. It's like we were finally friends again.

Let it be known that I have a cat (3m) who I cherish dearly and he lives in the apartment with me. While I was at work today, I get a text from her saying that her friend found 2 stray kittens and that she will be immediately taking one in. As soon as she texted me this I was furious because we made a prior agreement that no animal is to be adopted until AFTER we pay off this debt that we owe.

When my boyfriend picked me up from work, I told him what had happened and how furious I was because she basically took back every single apology she gave to us and is STILL the immature girl who let her cheating ex fiance walk all over her. I was worried about how my boyfriend would take the news because this last year his cat passed away due to complications with FeLV. When he heard the news he was furious because she invited this stray cat with no vaccination records or immunizations into the house.

When we got to the apartment tonight I knocked on her door and was immediately greeted with ""I don't see what the big f*cking deal is"" to which I unloaded on her and practically screamed in her face that she is putting my cats life at risk because she doesn't even know what this cat could have. When my boyfriend chimed in and told her the cat needed to get vaccinated tomorrow she screamed in his face that ""[he doesn't] even live here and has no right to comment"" to which he replied ""you should KNOW that my cat passed away because a stray had FeLV"" to which then I replied with how EASY it is to transfer FeLV. I unloaded onto her more about how selfish she was and she claimed that I was being childish and that she'll just ""move out."" 

Apparently she's getting the cat vaccinated NEXT WEEK so my boyfriend is taking our cat to his house to make sure nothing happens disease wise. All things considered, AITA for screaming at her for bringing a stray into my home?",0.21
"AITA for lying about my trust fund to my husband?  # Sorry in advance for my English. 

I (28F) and my husband, Franco (30M), are married. We are a happy couple and we both respectively earn quite fine for our age and our industries. He earns higher than me, although not by much. We are currently living in one of the most expensive cities in the world.

I am from a working class family in a very poor country in Eastern Europe, where the monthly salary is 500 Euro per month. My family were poor when I was growing up but our fortune turned when I was 20. My mother is a stay at home wife so she doesn't generate money. My father turned into a small millionaire ‘overnight’. However, he had worked blood, sweat and tears for that, for 20 years and as long as I can remember, he didn’t have a single vacation. The longest vacation he ever had for years was when he was admitted to the hospital for exhaustion for one week. What I took from my father’s hard work is that I have to work for everything I have, including my education. I studied in in a richer country in Europe to study and I met Franco here.

My father always let me  knows that he planned to split his estate into 4 along my brother, I, my mother, and my uncle. My uncle raised my father when their parents passed away and my father loved him like, well, family. Each of us are entitled to 1 million euro of his estate. I can dip into this trust the moment I turn 30, which is a requirement of my father.  Franco does not know about the amount but he knows that my father is a millionaire. This is a gross simplification of how his finance but I do not know more, I only know about what he let me know specifically.

The topic of my trust fund came up yesterday when we talked about looking to buy an 3 bedroom apartment, which is around 1.2 million euro.  Franco said he will contribute around 300,000 euro to the outright sale and I can dip into my ‘inheritance’ to buy the house outright. I lied and said that my trust fund only has 200k euro. Franco dropped the subject and now I feel a bit guilty about if lying about how much money I have laying around is a a-hole move? I would like some security behind my back and not blow it if we get divorced my father hard-earned money can be given to Franco by the splitting of the house. I also thought about a post-nuptial agreement but I don't want to let him know how much I have in my trust because I don't want him to rely on me. My trust fund is not so big that we can afford to lazy around and ""give up"" in life. I intend that money to give me and family security against hardship in life because I know first hand how cruel poverty is.

"AITA for not telling my mother i’m stressed? I(17f) have been studying for my IGCSEs lately.

I’ve naturally been stressed to all hell. I even needed to go to the doctor because it’s been affecting my physical health (stress induced ibs etc.) 

I have been trying to fix it while keeping up with my daily responsibilities and making sure it doesn’t affect my family or friends but sometimes I get in a low mood and really just need to be alone.

Now, my mother(37f) has recently been sick (slowly getting better). Unlike my father and I, she very much a ‘tell me your feelings’ type of person. And it shows even more when she’s sick. She gets extra irritable, sad, etc. I know this so I try my best to be positive and more cuddly or saying ‘i love you’ more. 

Last night though, I was really struggling. Just with insecurities and what not about my intelligence. I really wanted to confide in my father and was waiting for my mother to go to bed because I knew if I went out while crying she’d start constantly asking what was bothering me. Which I know is normal and shows she cares but it wasn’t what I needed and besides, she was sick and I knew she was struggling with some other things. (She cried while eating dinner about two days ago.)  
Eventually she comes into my room to say goodnight but notices i’m more quiet and asks me whats wrong a few times. I say ’nothing’, ‘I don’t wanna talk about it right now’ and ‘im fine’. To be fair I did get a bit snappy when she came into my room for the third time to ask. Mainly my tone.  
I got comforted by father after that and I thought it was done.

This morning, she still seems mad. I asked if she’s mad at me and she says no, irritated with me.   
She goes on to tell me that my father and I should at least communicate what we’re feeling like just saying we’re stressed, hurt etc. She said it’s just common decency between anyone whether its your friend, co worker etc. I said I thought it was obvious I was just upset. She said nothing but was obviously still peeved so I apologized and went yo my room. (I’d just woken up.)

she wants to go smoke these vanilla cigarettes because she “just wants to try them” and I tried to explain to her it’s a bad idea and this is how addictions start but she won’t listen to me. it’s like she thinks she’s above bad shit happening to her?

"AITA For Asking My Friend To Stop Smoking In Their Own Home While I'm There? This happened a couple weeks ago.

Whenever I hang out with my friend they usually smoke one or two cigarettes while I'm there. I absolutely detest smoking and especially the smell it leaves. Not to mention how bad second hand smoke is for your health. Anyway in the past I haven't said anything about as I'm generally pretty conflict avoidant, but whenever I hang out there and they've smoked I hate it and when I get home I essentially need to wash all my clothes and myself just to get rid of the smell. This is especially annoying if I'd just picked out a new outfit I was planning on wearing later or the next day or just washed my hair, as I feel the smell just lingers forever especially in the type of hair that I have (tightly coiled hair) pretty much forcing me to take a shower and wash my hair again. It's a bit irrational sure, but the smell and the feeling it gives me is also just plain disgusting.

Anyway this leads us to a couple of weeks ago where I finally said something as I was chilling there. I hadn't even been there for an hour closer to 45 minutes, when they grabbed a cigarette and I asked them to please not, because it smells and I've just put on new clothes washed my hair and I can't stand the smell and also it's bad for my lungs. They said: ""well it's my house so no."" So I said: ""alright I'll just leave then"" and they said: ""alright cool see you later"" and also added that I was being ""disrespectful"" for even mentioning this in the first place. Now this is what kinda really pissed me off, because wtf? It's just a simple question, I'm not telling them, I didn't yell or ask in a passive agressive tone. Just said, yo can you not while I'm here or I'ma dip, essentially. And somehow that's disrespectful? If a friend asked me to stop doing something that costs me nothing because it makes them uncomfortable not to mention is ADVERSE TO THEIR HEALTH. I wouldn't hesitate for a moment, hell I might even apologise for making them uncomfortable in the first place. If anything I think it's disrespectful to care so little about a friend's wishes. I didn't say any of this or anything at all, I just dabbed them up and walked out. They didn't even wait for me to leave and had already lit their cigarrete before I was proper out the door.

"AITA for letting my kid trace his finger on the airplane tray while other passengers boarded? I was flying with a baby and a kid under 5. I normally go out of my way to make sure myself and my kids follow the rules, don’t bother anyone, etc. I throw out my normal cares and let them have all the snacks/candy/activities/movies if it will keep them peaceful on a flight. 

We had just boarded (A group) and were sitting for about 5 minutes and were waiting for the rest of the passengers to board. My kid had pulled the tray down and I had reminded him we can’t put it up/down or be rough with it when he did so. He left it down and started gently tracing their finger on it since I hadn’t let them take anything out because the airline had been pretty strict about keeping items under the seat until lift off.

They were sitting silently and their finger wasn’t making any noise or any visible movement so I had no idea the movement could be felt (I never feel the tray go up or down or any items be moved about behind me unless it is abruptly bumped) and so I thought it was a fine way for him to hang out and wait. 

He did this for about 5 minutes while I nursed my baby to sleep. (Still boarding passengers). And I was trying to relax because everything with security, boarding, the kids was going smoothly.

This woman in the row in front of us suddenly stands up and leans over the seat into our row and very aggressively says “is your kids going to do that the whole flight? I’m sorry, I had kids, but you know I would NEVER let them do that.” Then she peered over farther as if to try and confirm my kid was kicking her seat or something but they were sitting on their feet

I was so shocked. After the initial shock I was fighting off tears for several minutes. I would have been happy to tell my kid even that wasn’t okay if she just let us know politely. Instead she gave me the worst anxiety for an entire 5 hour flight within 10 minutes! My kids were perfectly behaved & quiet the entire flight. (For background I normally have people tell me they didn’t know I had a baby/kids in my row or say “wow you were so quiet!” to my kids. My kiddos have their moments for sure but thankfully this is one place they always behave for me *knock on wood*)

1) AITA? I was doing my best to keep my kids “invisible.” I honestly had no idea we were right behind the princess from the princess and the pea. 

2) not sure if against the rules but what would some of your responses of been? I was so caught off guard by it, especially because I wasn’t anticipating anyone even being bothered by my kid since they were so quiet and gentle. ",0.2
"AITA for agreeing with my mate's GF that he's a seven (out of 10, in terms of looks) at best? **Parties involved:**

* Myself \[32M\]
* Damian \[33M\]

**Context to argument:**

Damian has always struggled with women. But he started dating his first GF \[early 20s F\] recently. Not even a couple of months in they're already having problems. The latest of which was when he asked her to rate his looks. Last Sunday, at a dinner with the friendship group, Damian ranted that she only rated him an ""7"". It infuriated him that he wasn't perfect in her eyes. He then went on to surmise that she's only with him for his money.

For context, Damian is a lawyer. Though he works at a top tier law firm in my country, he's a middling lawyer at best. His salary wouldn't exceed $150,000 AUD. And, having studied and worked with him in the past, I doubt he'd ever amount to more. His salary is a decent earning, of course. But it's not 'target of gold diggers' money by a long shot. Fellow Australians will tell you that you'd still struggle to get a house in a half decent suburb on that salary. And, frankly, rating his appearance a ""7"" is generous.

I told Damian as much. Paraphrased, I said something to the effect of, ""A seven is generous, mate. It means well above average. Take the compliment and just be happy"", and ""On your salary you can't even afford to have your GF be a stay-at-home wife, let alone a gold digger. Relax, if your GF wanted to gold dig, she'd try her luck with someone who makes a lot more money."". I was expecting a fight, but instead Damian just went quiet. And didn't say a word for about 15 minutes, before abruptly leaving the dinner early. Good riddance.

**Context to my relationship with Damian:**

That sounds harsh. And I admit that it is. 

But Damian is the type who unironically believes that ""facts don't care about your feelings"". He's that asshole that takes pride in being ""brutally honest"". So I thought he could taste some of his own medicine. I'll be honest: he's less of a mate, and more of an associate I tolerate because he tags along with my friendship group. If it isn't already clear, I have a very low opinion of Damian.

The turning point in our ""friendship"" was when, during my house warming, Damian got into argument with my mother over Australia's application of the 'The Physician's Pledge'—a watered down version of doctors' Hippocratic Oath. It escalated to Damian insulting my mother with, ""You're just a cleaner. What would you know?"". Yes, at that time my mother was a cleaner. But she was also a top medical student at one of Vietnam's most prestigious universities before the fallout from the Vietnam War forced her to immigrate to Australia. And she was also training to become a Vietnamese translator, specialising in the medical field. She's also the smartest person I know. Far smarter than me, and hell of a lot smarter than Damian. I was already not a huge fan of Damian, but after that, I wrote him off completely.

"AITA for parking across the street from someone’s house?  I (31f) live in a relatively rural area with my house being off a busy road. Because of this, there is no where safe to walk my two large dogs. We have a trail in the woods behind our house, but it isn’t flat enough for my 13 year old dog. Earlier in the summer, we started taking the dogs to a nearby neighborhood to walk them. I generally take them early in the morning and walk them around the neighborhood. I always make sure to clean up after them and we haven’t had any issues. People wave to us and they have even met other dogs. This morning, we were finishing our walk and an older woman about 100 feet down the road started yelling at me. She said “you really need to find somewhere else to park every day.” I asked “why is that?” And she said I’m making her dogs go nuts every morning. I was at a loss for words. I am generally a very anxious person and try to avoid confrontation. I can see why she would find this frustrating, as I would likely be annoyed if something like this caused my dogs to bark every morning, but on the other hand I don’t think I’m technically doing anything wrong. We don’t park directly in front of her house, it’s across the street from her. This is a pretty quiet neighborhood but it’s large. When we arrive, I slowly park, get the dogs out, and begin our walk. We haven’t had any issues all summer. Should I stop parking there? AITA? ",0.06
"AITA for questioning my wife's drinking? My wife likes wine.  Like opens a bottle and 2/3rd-3/4 of it is gone.. in just that evening.  She brings 2 bottles home on Friday,  immediately uncorked one and later that evening, drinks 2/3 of it.  We have a cocunut rum in the fridge (that we both decided looked interesting) that she drank some (w/Dr. Pepper) on Saturday.  Drank the remainder of the open bottle of wine on Sunday.  Went out to dinner/drinks with a retired coworker on Monday.  Dinner/drinks again with current coworkers on Tuesday.   Last night (Wednesday), she uncorked the 2nd bottle of wine. 


At this point I question her if she needs to have a drink every night & that I'm concerned.  I tell her that I love her,  want her to be healthy and around a long time.  (I previously brought up this concern a few months earlier when she was bringing home 2 bottles of wine every 5 days or so & that we don't have room in our budget for $100+ wine expenditures/month & she significantly cut back.. for a while-- until about a month ago & now she's back into the same routine).  Last night,  she claimed she didn't know she was drinking that much (which I find hard to believe), and then goes over the top with ""fine, I'll just stop drinking"" and pours the full bottle of wine out.   I tried telling her that I'm not asking her to stop completely- that I just want her to be healthy and not get caught up in a bad habit and she replies ""no, I wanted to do this"".  She was completely frosty/cold/quiet/moody the remainder of the evening and again this morning.

"AITA for being a stay at home mom?  I am a stay at home mom with a 2 year old son, my husband works full time. When our son was 1 years old my husband got laid off his job, we had a few rough months ( so I thought) but he eventually found a new job. There were time he would ask for help financially and I didn’t really know how to help. I don’t have a degree and have always worked in childcare - not making much at all. If I worked full time I would just be paying for my son’s childcare and it wouldn’t make much sense. I eventually found a part time job working at a preschool, I am able to bring my son with me for free and I still get paid. 
My husband has informed me that it is still not enough. He says he resents me for not working full time and that when he was struggling I didn’t help. I have voiced that I understand where he is coming from and I should have helped soon but I just didn’t know how. He says that I should still be looking for a full time job. He has recently started to pursue music, he is an amazing musician and I support him BUT he told me he would choose music over me. I just don’t know how I’m suppose to act like things are normal after hearing that. There are lots of other issues and I feel like he thinks everything is my fault. I do want to say that when our son was born my husband did not wake up one night with him, would get mad at me if the baby cried for too long in our room, and I do 90% of the task for my son. I chose to be a stay at home mom and love it , but it feels like my husband knows I will get everything done and takes it for granted. He has recently told me that maybe he should have chosen a partner that is more career driven and that he’s afraid to have more kids because when he was struggling I didn’t help. I truly don’t know what to do. It seems like he’s checked out but we still have great moments. I feel like I’m very relaxed on letting him have free time. He was at a recording studio for 10 hours the other day and I supported it. He makes plans and tells me about them last minute bc he knows I’ll always have our son. I’m drained and confused.

"AITA for telling my dads mom to leave? 


My dad's mom makes our living space, unbearable to live in due to her consist complaining and controlling problems.  We will call her Sofia, Sofia moved in after my grandfather passed away and I never thought it would become worse to live with her. 

Her controlling problems are the worst, she would treat everyone so badly and then act nice and I don't understand that. When my mom does anything Sofia judges her and insults her, I don't like it because she has no right to treat anyone like that especially when you live in someone else house. Due to this, my parents are experiencing marriage problems because of his mom, I do agree with my mom on this because she's being treated badly in her own home and my dad does nothing.

There's the problem, I have many pets and I have an aquriama. I make sure to feed my fish every morning and If I forget my mom feeds them. I was out with my friends watching Deadpool and my parents were at work, when I got back I noticed my fish tank water very quickly. Listen in these situations I don't know how to explain or react properly, half of my fish were dead, and that was because Sofia refilled the tank with hot water from the sink.

"WIBTA for Asking My Roommate to Move Out So My Partner Can Move In? 
I've been subleasing part of my beloved apartment for over three years. The main tenant is almost never here. I originally moved in with my ex, and together we subleased two of the three rooms. When we first moved in, the apartment was in terrible condition—moldy, dirty, and almost unlivable. Over the past two years, I’ve invested significant time and money to transform it into a beautiful space. After my ex moved out, I couldn’t afford the full rent alone, so I asked a colleague, Ana, to sublease with me. We both sublease from the main tenant, who only shows up about twice a year.

Initially, living with Ana was pleasant. However, a month after she moved in, I started dating my new partner, and we began spending a lot of time in the apartment. At first, everyone got along well, but over time, Ana became increasingly disengaged, neglecting household chores and responsibilities. My partner and I have since decided to move in together and plan for a future with pets and a family—not a chaotic roommate situation. Although I’ve grown attached to this apartment, I didn’t want to force Ana out, especially since I technically can’t as we both sublease. I informed her that my partner and I were looking for a new place.

Since then, Ana has acted as if the apartment is already hers, constantly asking if we’ve found a new place and even planning to move her friends in. Recently, I mentioned removing a closet from the hallway, and she casually responded that I didn’t need to bother since I’d be moving out soon anyway. This attitude has made me reconsider my decision to leave. I’ve lived here much longer and invested so much in making this apartment what it is today. If Ana moves out, she shouldn’t have much trouble finding a new co-living situation, as we live in a student city and the new semester is starting soon. From my experience, it shouldn’t take her more than a month to find something similar.

For my partner and me, it’s much more challenging to find a comparable space in the area. Affordable apartments suitable for couples are scarce, and in the last six months, we haven’t found anything that wouldn’t be a significant downgrade for a higher price.

So, here’s my dilemma: Would I be the asshole for asking Ana to move out?

I would explain that I’ve changed my mind and give her the reasons I mentioned above. I’d point out that, in all fairness, it makes more sense for her to move out, considering I have more history with this space and most of the belongings here are mine. I’d also tell her that I’m no longer looking for a new place but would help her find a new shared living situation quickly. While I dislike going back on my word, I don’t want to leave behind everything I’ve worked for and give up my home to someone who doesn’t even maintain the space or seems eager for me to leave.

"AITA for accepting things from my girlfriend? So, i've been living with my girlfriend for 6 months and our financial situations are pretty different. i live in her house, which is paid for and we share all the costs of living(house expenses and food). The problem is with food delivery and going out. for the first two months i still had some money left and we split those in half, like it should be. then my money started to end and for about the last 3 months everytime she orders food for the both of us(which might be 15% of the time she orders food for herself) she pays for my half. mind you i rarely asked her to buy something(like 2 times in these 3 months), i was always very clear that i did not have money to contribute and was fine not sharing the food. a few times also she bought us food without even consulting with me, if i wanted of if i could pay for it. 

this month i got a job in sales and have been doing well so next month i'll start getting comissions and my financial situation is going to be alright, i'll be able to pay my bills, eat out and still have some money left. 

the problem came a few days back when she said i spent 3 months unemployed, that i was not sharing things equally with her and she felt i was taking advantage of her. 

The total of what she spent with me is about 400 reais(we're from brazil) over these 3 months(mind you she spends around 2000 monthly with eating out) and i'm thinking of just paying her this money back and be done with it. 

so, am i the asshole? and should i pay her back that money even though i was always clear that i could not afford? (she is not asking me to pay her back of anything, i just think that would solve the problem without that situation ever being thrown in my face again)

"WIBTA If I tell my Sister In Law her parents were in an car accident? Throwaway as my fam all use Reddit and love this sub.

My sister in law is travelling around Europe , we are in Canada. It’s her first trip out with friends and she’s having a blast.

My inlaws( her parents) got into car accident. They are physically ok and it was minor besides landing in a ditch. 

They are elderly though with multiple health conditions.

I also ended up having to deal with predatory towing companies (whole nother story, and ended up paying 150 from my pocket) 

My wife and my in laws insist we don’t tell my sister in law what happened until after she gets back next week.

Here’s my dilemma.

Iv always been of the principle treat others as you would want to be treated. If I were in her shoes I DEFINITELY would want to know if my parents got into a car accident and were harassed by predatory tow truck drivers. Even if they are physically ok.


But on the other hand, like technically she’s not my blood sister and her family does not want to worry her with this. I haven’t told her anything, even though I KNOW she would be so upset and hurt that everyone hid such an important event from her. She would want to know.

"AITA for losing my shit over cookies when my DIL tossed them out  I am a good baker, I enjoy making sweet treats for everyone to enjoy. My DIL (Emily) is very heath conscious and even more so now that's they have two kids. She is the type of person who avoids sugars, mostly eats organic, and avoids processed foods.

When the grandkids visit I usally make cookies or something sweet for them to enjoy. Every single times she sees them she usually goes on about how they are unhealthy. We got into an argument about this a few months ago about not giving the kids junk. I pointed out everything is homemade and I am not only serving them cookies. My son stepped in on this and we compromised that the kids can have one cookie when they are here. 

This was good for a while until yesterday. The kids came over last night and I made a batch of cookies. They were cooling on the rack. Emily  and my son decided to chat a bit before heading out. During that time Emily went into the kitchen and throw away the cookies. 

When I asked her why she did it, she claimed I was doing me a favor since they are unhealthy. 

I told yelled at her saying that she had no right to throw away food that I had worked hard to make. She got defensive and said she was just trying to help. My son stepped in and told me to calm down, but I was furious. Emily left the room in tears, and now my son is saying I overreacted and should apologize.

We were constantly fighting and there was so many things said and done that i still have not been able to move on from. I've had to beg him so many times to come over just to see our daughter, help out with her, etc etc. We broke up completely when i found out his was cheating on me for over a month. Fast forward to now, A couple nights ago around 9-10pm he texted me and asked how I would feel if he left to california in the morning with his friends. I said i would be upset because we are trying to raise a 4 month together. He said ""Well im leaving with (friend and friends mom) in the morning"" i got upset because there is no heads up but he keeps saying it was just a last minute decision and he only had a couple minutes to decide. I told him he's being an irresponsible father and needs to prioritize his daughter because there is certain sacrifices you have to make as a parent and this is unfortunately one of them.

"AITAH for calling a wellness check on my partner after not hearing from her for nearly 3 days?  We're both late twenties. We've only been dating for a few months. She's very prompt about answering texts and phone calls.

Her last message was that she was going to go to bed and clear her head. The next morning I texted her Goodmorning. That afternoon I texted her again. Same thing that evening.

The next day was more of the same. Even tried calling her a couple of times. As day 3 hit, I texted her that I was going to be calling in a wellness check. It said delivered but she never messaged.

I went ahead an called in a wellness check to her apartment.

She messaged back much later and was annoyed that I did this? I told her I was going to do this and she must've thought I was joking. Anyways now she's even more mad at the entire situation, lol.

She said that she wanted a little space to decompress. I told her I get that but she's could've at least said something.

"AITA for criticizing my dad for buying tickets for his wife to see Hamilton? (Don't know if any of my family uses reddit, so this is a throwaway account)

For some context I am a 21 (almost 22) year old man. My dad is 51 and his wife, who I will refer to as Debbie (fake name for privacy's sake), is 58. 

I grew up pretty poor until my biological mother passed away from cancer in September, 2018, when I was 15 years old. She and my dad had still been married at the time, and I was very close with my mother, so it hit the family hard. Well— most of us. 

To sum up, dad met Debbie on a dating app in December, 2018. Dad proposed to Debbie in June, 2019, and they were married by December, 2019.

Without my mom's medical bills, my dad is now pretty well-off with a good paying job (over 100k/year), and he and Debbie have a lot saved up from insurance and inheritance from my mom and a relative of Debbie's. Meanwhile i've been working any job i can get to keep up with car repair bills, plus paying for all my own personal items since I refuse to ask my dad for money unless I have no other option. I plan to go no contact as soon as I'm able to move out.

My dad, however, complains a lot about being short on money, and insists I— a university student who has been struggling to find work and lost all my savings to fix my car and pay for my own gender transition— pay him since he's ""put food on the table and a roof over my head all these years."" Then recently, he brought up that he was surprising Debbie with tickets to see the musical Hamilton live for her birthday this year, and plans to take her on a European cruise in December for their 5-year anniversary.

Here's where i may be the AH. I got angry when I heard his plans and said how it feels kinda weird to one minute have him complain to me and my sibling (24 nb) about not having enough money and have us pay him for things, and the next brag about the expensive gifts and trips he gets for his wife. He got angry back and said it's because they work hard and save their money (out of the two of them, he's the only one with a job) and that it's his decision what they spend that money on. He also called me entitled because I still rely on him for a lot right now, and do make use of the nice things he and Debbie buy for the household, like the pool and streaming services.

I'm honestly conflicted about this. Every time they bring up their trips or expensive gifts for each other, I just boil inside. Maybe I am taking advantage of them taking care of me but sometimes it just feels so... weird. There's no other word I can think of to describe it.

They haven't even mentioned Hamilton since I criticized my dad about it, and Debbie has been cold and touchy since then. My sibling also sided with my dad and told me I was just irresponsible. I know I'm useless on my own right now since everything is so expensive. Maybe I should be more grateful. 

Am I the AH?

Edit: To clarify some common things I'm seeing in the comments, yes I do live with my dad for the 3 months I'm not living on my college campus. I have a job, and have been working since I was 15, but recent price increases without wage increases (as well as a couple periods without a job once due to the pandemic in 2020 and later due to mental health issues) has made it very very difficult for me to move out. 

I would love nothing more than to move out and provide for myself, I want so so badly to be independant, but it's not financially possible for me right now. I do try to support myself in other ways. I pay rent when I am home, and contribute to groceries and other amenities around the house, as well as paying my own way on vacations we take as a family. I'm trying my hardest to have nothing to owe my dad by the time I am able to leave.

Also, another clarification, the inheritance is Debbie's from a late family member. The money my family got from my mom was the life insurance payout after her death.

There are other grievances I have with both my dad and Debbie that probably contribute to my reaction to all this, but I don't think they are necessary to air on the internet, as they are very personal.

Edit 2: I'm reading through all the comments and so many are saying I'm the AH so i think I'm going to just take some time to reevaluate some things in my life. I think I'm making excuses to justify being angry and lashing out and holding grudges, and I need to fix that about myself. I'll be moving back to school in a few days so the distance might help me sort out my head.

"AITA for sending my mom back home?  My mother had a heart attack and she moved to my apartment so that I could take care of her for a few months. 

She’s been very demanding and I noticed that I had roaches that I never had before.

I work full time and she’s been recovering and not wanting to go back to her home because it's lonely for her. 

I asked her why the fuck does she have all these cans in her room. I told her we have in building recycling and I have a separate trash for them and it looks like she was saving all bottles and cans from every thing from the trash and hid them in her room. 

She told me she was saving them to help me on bills and I can take them to the recycling center. Like my brother used to do. 

Now my brother that used to do that was a drug addict and my mom enable him until then day he died. I told my mom this. I said my brother wasn't doing it to be kind and to help when he didn't have enough money, he did it to shoot it up. I told my mom it wasn't helping and I’m not driving for 30 minutes to get $20 for bags of trash that should have been tossed out of sanitary reason and now my mom has roaches in her room and I’m going to have tell the apartment complex so they can come spray. 

I told my mom it is time for her to go back to her home since she thought it was ok to trash my apartment and now I have roaches. It was gross they would just fall from the bags as I was taking them down to the garbage shoot and my mom was hiding 7 bags of stinky bottles and cans in her room.

"AITA for telling my brother-in-law his daughter would grow up to hate him? For as long as I can remember my brother-in-law has been creepily obsessed with my sister but because he's attractive and has money everybody likes to pretend it's cute. I don't know how he convinced my sister to finally give him the time of day but that's a story for a different day. Anyway, they've been married for 4 years and have a 3 year-old daughter together. 

I'm convinced that the only reason they even had a kid is because my sister has always wanted kids and she would've left his ass if he didn't agree to having one. The reason I think this is because he's outright said my sister is the most important person to him (even after their daughter had been born) and when their daughter was in the hospital he only came home because my sister told him she was scared and not because he was worried about their daughter (he admitted this himself).

I think my niece and sister both deserve better but I usually bite my tongue to keep the peace and because he has a way of always making the other person look like the bad guy in front of others so I knew I would get a lot of backlash if I said anything to him. BUT recently he missed his daughter's birthday because he went on a work trip that he could've moved or cancelled so since my niece is so young my sister celebrated her birthday twice since she wouldn't really know the difference. During her second birthday party he was completely unbothered and wasn't giving his daughter any attention (he was too busy watching my sister the entire time). I felt so bad for her because she's a complete daddy's girl and just wanted him to play with her on her ""birthday"" and he wasn't encouraging her at all. The only time he bothered to give her attention was when my sister was around.

Eventually it was just me and my brother-in-law and I told him he should give his daughter more attention and he just scoffed and claimed he did (he absolutely doesn't). I asked him if it had been my sister's birthday would he have went on that trip and he wouldn't answer because we both know the answer is no. I can't remember exactly what else was said but he told me to mind my own business and I was feeling pretty angry on my niece's behalf so I told him that he shouldn't be surprised when one day she was all grown up and hated his guts. I also said that my sister would catch on and she would hate him too which I think got to him more than the comment about my niece.

As I mentioned before he has a way of making the other person look bad so he spun a story to my sister and now she's upset with me because I won't apologise to him.

I offered to kick in some money for the apartment until he could be put in another position. At this point he still makes more money than I could ever imagine, he is very well off. 

He declined my offer and said it’s ok, I didn’t have to pay anything. I do some small side stuff like flipping items on eBay, nothing crazy. Just gives me money for food and stuff. I don’t spend a lot of money on myself. It’s perfect for what I need. 

Months have gone by and my brother has not put been put in a new position to replace that one income he had. Keep in mind he still makes a ton of money at his other positions. I have offered to kick in money for the apartment 3 times now and he has declined all of them. 

On my days off, I go out and have fun. Do whatever I want. I take pics and post on social media. This has now set my brother off and he has ranted to me that he is at work, while I’m just “out fucking around”. This has made me feel like I have to live in complete privacy and not post or talk about anything. We made the deal at the beginning of the year, and his position has changed since then. I have offered 3 times now to kick in money, which he declined them all. But now he seems to want me to live in guilt. I am perfectly comfortable where I am for my living style. ",0.4
"AITA for wishing my friends a happy birthday at midnight? Me (21M) and 10 of my friends went to wish our mutual friend's a very happy birthday at midnight in our university. We quietly went to their room at exactly midnight and were seen doing so by the wardens. We made it a point to be as quiet as possible since we knew that noise wouldn't be tolerated at nighttime.

So we went to their room and were greeting them when the warden loudly burst in and angrily asked us what we were doing at such a time. We calmly explained that it was our friends' birthday. An important point here is that we did not have any cake, candles or anything else with us ( as the wardens disapprove of this). 

The warden did not want to hear it and demanded us to hand in our ID Cards and stated that we would have to pay a hefty fine, along with our names being handed over to higher officials.

Naturally, we were confused and afraid because being referred like this could have a serious impact on future career opportunities.

After trying to explain our perspective for about 20 minutes, (during which we were insulted with implications about our  morals and values) the fine was waived in favour of writing an apology letter, which we eventually did just to get out of the situation.

The warden was not satisfied with this and still ended up taking our names. So, Reddit, AITA?

EDIT: There are no specific rules in place for when we have to be in our respective rooms as long as we are in the hostel block by curfew. Going to other people's rooms is extremely common and is usually not a big deal.",0.85
"AITA for going on holiday alone after girlfriend refused boarding Me (40M, unproblematic passport) booked a holiday for my girlfriend (38F - let's call her Masha) and I to Greece to the tune of €3000+ - which doesn't break the bank for me but is not at all insignificant in the slightest. 

She is a Russian citizen but we live in another European country, and in a very complex legal and personal situation, her permanent residence status is pending but the previous visa is expired, thus she managed to be issued with an uncommon document essentially saying ""treat this person as if they have documents, even though they don't."" We decided to stay inside the Schengen zone (no passport checks) to be safe. We were not worried at all.

I'll add as a quick intervening detail. I'd not been on a ""proper vacation"" in two years - for reasons.

When we arrived at the airport we had to check her bag, and it being holiday flights on tiny airlines, this was done in person rather than automated. She pulled out her passport, and immediately after scanning, the ""Checker"" asked for her residency card. Eventually the Checker took her documents and went away to consult on what would happen. Medium story short, they would not allow Masha to board the flight. And I decided to go and have the week in Greece myself nevertheless.
Am I the asshole?

"AITAH for gifting my niece makeup? My(20f) niece “Bella” just turned 12. My brother(36) is a single dad and has his daughter the majority of the time. I’m pretty close with my niece and she spends a lot of time with me. She’s an amazing kid. 

My brother had a small birthday party for her at his home. I got her a bunch of things she’d specifically asked for (a puzzle, books, a squishmallow) and I also got her some stuff from ulta. I got her a sol de janeiro body set, 2 lip glosses in her favorite colors, and a mascara. I thought noting of it and added it to the bag with all her other gifts. Especially since she’s talked about makeup to me in the past and expressed interest in it. 

Skip to the party and she’s opening gifts. She loved everything I got her and hugged me after opening them, she specifically commented on the lipglosses and the colors and how excited she was to use them. It was a nice party. 

After the party, my brother pulled me aside and told me my gift was inappropriate. I asked what he meant and he said giving a 12 year old makeup was ridiculous and he would be taking it away from her. I told him this child has a phone, social media, and is now in middle school and you’re worried about some mascara and lipgloss? He got pissed and told me to stop trying to parent his kid. I left shortly after. 

I don’t think lipgloss and mascara was inappropriate for a 12 year old girl. It’s not like I got her foundation or eyeliner or something crazy. But I could be wrong. So AITAH for giving it as a gift?",0.18
"AITA for confronting my roommate playing on my $3,500 gaming laptop, with all of my personal information and college access, without my permission and when I walk in from being out of the room. He’s not going into anything personal as far as I know, so I don’t think he’s causing any damage. I noticed he had done it a few times without my permission, but I was in the room so I didn’t say too much. However I just walked back from classes and lunch and found him sitting at my desk playing games on my personal, very expensive laptop. He does the same thing with my Xbox, but as far as I know he’s only using them for games, but all my credit information and passwords are saved on that computer behind the password he apparently knows.

"AITA for giving my daughter a reward for 'breaking a rule'?  My (31F) daughter (13F) has a rule where she has to not be on her phone from 11pm. Last night, i caught her on her phone at 1am, messaging someone. This was against the rules we had agreed on, so i took it off her for the week. 

My instant reaction was to think she was messaging a boyfriend , so I check her phone and find out she's messaging a friend, let's call her Hannah. Hannah was talking about some seriously sad stuff and how much she was struggling, and my daughter was reassuring her she was fine and saying how much Hannah would be missed and how kind and pretty Hannah is.

"AITA for lying to my little brother on why I left home? For background, I (18M) am an idol, and have been for quite some time. Recently, my younger twin brother, let's call him R, joined the industry as well. After a competition live, he confronted me and asked why I abandoned our family to become an idol.

Truth is, I didn't really. R is really sick, he grew up confined to his bed and since our parents were always busy running the club they owned, I was the one who took care of him most of the time. When we were 13, this man, let's call him K, shut down our parents' club. That was really hard for us, as we were already struggling financially, and R's medical expenses were through the roof. He said he would pay off R's medical bills if he could take me in and raise me to become an idol. Our parents and I agreed, but nobody ever told R the truth of the matter, so he thinks I abandoned him.

After the competition live, I told him I'd tell him the truth. Though when the time came to talk about it, I panicked. I thought the truth would hurt, that he would think he was a burden if he learned I left to pay off his medical bills, so I lied. I said that K showed me what the entertainment world was like and that I was fascinated by it and so I agreed to go with him, thinking that would hurt less.

Though, that ended up hurting him a lot more than expected, and he lashed out at me, saying I really did abandon him, that it felt like I didn't care about him, and that I probably hated taking care of him growing up, which none of that is true. I tried to resolve the situation, but it ended up only escalating. I ended up saying that I would never acknowledge him as an idol, and stormed out.

"AITA for refusing to clean my severely autistics cousin wee up from all over the floor? Hey reddit users I want some feedback please. I am 14m and every year for my whole life me my brother and mum take a trip to Poland for 2 and a half weeks during summer half term. We go to visit my mums polish side of the family considering I am half polish and half german. We tend to go to to my grandparents for 1 and a half weeks to 2 weeks and for the remainder go to my aunt considering she lives closer to the airport. This year was no different, we have a couple days left before goin back to the UK.  

My aunt(43f) has 6 children but only 1 is relevant( her youngest ). Her youngest child I'll call him anthony anyways anthony is severely autistic and has trouble doing anything and can't control his emotions. He is constantly hitting animals and people taking stuff and throwing it around. I don't mind putting up with it considering it's only 1 week every year. He is 6 and still ca t speak only making caveman like noises. (This is not an attack on him and I understand he was born that way and I am not hating on him but this is just to give you a but of an Idea on the next part ). 

Anyways back to the story me and my brother are sleeping on the sofa bed which I do t mind but is just around the corner from the bathroom. My aunt and mum were outside renovating so it was only me my brother and 2 cousins of close age in the house. Anthony thought this would be a good time to go to the toilet on his own. Spoiler alert he didn't do well he weed all over the bathroom floor and then panicked so he decided to run into the living room with his sausage out weeing eveywear and the first immediate thought in his brain was to grab me and my cousins attention by running over to the sofa (which was in bed mode considering it's 9pm) and he stood over us still weeing and poj ting to the floor. I jumped up and called for my mum and aunt who rushed in. I was covered thighs down in wee . I rushed to the bathroom not caring about the fact we was all over the floor and hopped straight into the shower to wash myself. My plan was to just jump over th wee out the bathroom when I'm done considering the fact it wasn't a large bathroom I could definitely make the jump. 

My mum seconds later banged on the door as if she was feds after learning qbout what happend. She shouted at me calling me selfish and said I should mop the floor first then go in the shower . I told her I wasn't a servant and that ny aunt could clean up his mess its definitely not gonna be me. Since then my mum has given me the silent treatment other than to berade me calling me selfish or telling me my possible punishments at this point idk.

"AITA for Not Attending My Best Friend’s Wedding After She Asked Me to Be a Bridesmaid? I (19F) have been best friends with Julia (22F) since high school. We’ve always been close, and I’ve supported her through many important moments in her life. When Julia got engaged, she asked me to be a bridesmaid. I was thrilled and agreed without hesitation.

However, a few months before the wedding, Julia called me with some news. She said that due to budget constraints, she would need to make some cuts and had decided to reduce the number of bridesmaids. She said she felt terrible, but she had to choose someone else over me. Julia also mentioned that she would still love for me to attend the wedding as a guest.

I was hurt by this sudden change and felt undervalued, especially since I had been so involved in helping with wedding planning up to that point. I decided to be honest with Julia about my feelings. I told her that I was disappointed and that I needed some time to process it. I also mentioned that if I couldn’t be a bridesmaid, I might not feel comfortable attending the wedding.

Julia seemed upset but understood. She said she hoped I would still come and celebrate with her, even if I wasn't a bridesmaid. I took some time to think about it and eventually decided not to attend. I felt like my presence as a guest would just highlight my exclusion from the bridal party, and I didn’t want to feel like an afterthought.

When Julia found out, she was very hurt and angry. She told me I was being selfish and that my absence would cast a shadow over her special day. Our mutual friends also think I’m being unreasonable and should have just attended as a guest.

I feel conflicted. I understand that weddings can be stressful and that plans change, but I also feel like my feelings were dismissed. AITA for choosing not to attend the wedding after being removed from the bridal party?",0.33
"AITAH for telling he should’ve told me first before DM’ing a girl from the gym? So, my boyfriend is a personal trainer, and he creates a lot of content for his business. There’s this girl at the gym who’s pretty social media famous, and they talk now and then. Recently, I saw on his phone that he DM’d her. When I asked him what they were talking about, he said he messaged her to ask if she wanted to do a partner workout and make some videos together.

I’ll be honest—it stung. I’m not going to lie, there’s definitely a bit of jealousy on my part, but what really got to me was that he didn’t tell me about his plans before reaching out to her. I felt like he could’ve at least given me a heads-up.

"AITA for withholding study materials from my brother in an attempt to make him more independent? my brother, 16, is entering his sophomore year of high school and continuously needs his hand held by our father with his school work. i have just entered college, and all of the work that i did, such as study sets, projects, and papers that have been created since 6th grade, he has been utilizing. for context, my little brother, as a 16 year old, has our father read aloud his english books to him, uses my quizlets, has both my parents complete his projects, has my dad practically write his papers, and i feel as though this is setting him up for failure in the long term when he goes to higher level education. 

so, i naturally told him no when he came up to me and asked for me to unprivate my things that were study materials for the classes he took this year. this had angered not only him, but our parents, and it had angered my brother so much that he proceeded to demand it from me (to which my parents had defended). i explained my side, that i feel as though the babying will only bring about negative side effects in the coming future when he does have to go out on his own and have some form of independence, and all of my claims were shut down. my father proceeded to claim that i need as much help as my brother does. however, this “help” refers to me asking him to look over my papers (after they are written) in hopes he could provide feedback. other than that, i’ve done everything by myself since i was 12 years old, and i was extremely hurt by this. i proceeded to say that he will be fine, as so was i, and now both my parents and brother are angry with me.

"AITAH for my reaction after asking my Fiancé for some money to buy supplies. For context i left my job a few months ago under the assumption we were moving out of state. He had legal issues to deal with for a few more months so he stayed behind in our apartment until then. When I went to our desired location I spent weeks trying to find opportunities and failing greatly and just came back. He did not stay in the apartment and decided to go back to his family’s home and disregarded what we had here, letting it fall apart even though he said he was there everyday cleaning. 

When I came back I had left my trailer of belonging with my family over an hour away as the apartment was beyond a mess. I started applying for jobs as I didn’t want to go back to my old one (for other major concerns) and I told him it may take awhile. He stated to me that he’d rather have me be a SAHM so we didn’t have to do daycare or turn over shifts (I’d work graveyard so I never interfered with his job.) and since they were my kids he feels that I should be obligated to be doing it all anyways. I didn’t see it as an issue since he said he’d foot the stuff this time since I had done everything from all bills, even his to food and chores for the entire year prior. 

Well we have an apartment inspection in less than a week and if we fail we could get evicted and I could lose my kids. I have stayed up for three days recovering what should’ve been maybe a couple hours with what I could find. I caved after hours asking him to please let me go get cleaning supplies and he said he refused because he didn’t want me “wasting $200 on stuff we don’t really need and whatever else you’d come home with” implying I’d be wasting his money. I told him it wouldn’t be an issue if he’d gotten a job that doesn’t pay him for his time (it’s his family’s company and he refused to leave it). I told him that it was fine then and stopped cleaning where I was and showered up and layed down. He came to me and said he needs help because one person can’t do it all even though the only thing he’s doing is water vacuuming two carpets while I had the rest of the house. I told him that if his decision was to not provide supplies then he can work with what he’s got. 

I know we have the inspection and I have the most to lose because I don’t have community or resources like he does but part of me is just tired. I just asked for sponges, a mop, some disinfectant  and gloves. I get we still have bills to pay but that’s not for another week and he’d get paid again around that time they’re due.

"AITAH for how i view this parenting situation  AITAH for how i view this parenting situation. 

Hi all, Going to try and add as much information as i can without it being super long and without giving specifics.
I have a son. I coparent with his father. Father and I both have partners who are “ new “ to my son’s life. 
My son has experienced a lot for his age and we believe some therapy may suite him well. My outlook on it is that therapy is a lot and especially as a kid it’s a lot. I believe me and his father should go with our child alone to the first appointment, express our concerns, tell them about our coparent experience ( our time share history , how we go about certain things for him ext) tell them about my household, and allow his father to tell them about his household. After that initial appointment, then maybe bring in the step parents if the therapist sees fit. I mean, me and his father have been here his whole life and both step parents are fairly new. 
Me and my husband and others i’ve asked think what me and my husband suggested works best for the child so they won’t be so intimidated at first. His father and his wife however, are viewing it completely different and even made a remark of how it’s not couples therapy… Which never made sense as all i ever suggested was we go alone  with our child to the appointment at first to explain how we parent / the households  then we can proceed with separate appointments where whoever has him, takes him. So AITAH for thinking that it should just be us at first or should the step parents also be involved from the start? ",0.5
"AITA for charging my sister rent? 
I (24F) and my husband (27M) allowed my sister (20F) to live with us while she is in college for 2 years in our city. My husband and I originally considered if we should charge her rent, but ultimately decided not to because we thought she could watch our dogs when we travel. In the past when we traveled she has watched them for free and occasionally before she lived with us we would give her some cash. Keep in mind so far this has only been a total of about 2 weeks per year. In December we are going out of the country to visit my husbands parents and other family that he has not seen in four years for 2.5 weeks. It has been planned for a month or so and I assumed my sister would watch them like usual. Last weekend while visiting my parents, my mom mentioned that we needed to go ahead and find a pet sitter as they book up. She said my sister also had some trips planned and my mom would not allow the pets at her house while they are out of town and my sister stays with my mom (1 hr away) during the holidays to be close to her finance. Keep in mind, it is really my mom that I am saving $10,000 per year for allowing my sister to live with while she is in school because my parents agreed to pay for our college. In my mind I am doing them a huge favor, and watching our 2 well mannered pets while we are gone is a small ask. It will cost me $1,500 to get a pet sitter or board them which I really don’t want to do. Am I the asshole if I charge her rent to pay for the sitter?

"AITA for telling a friend about my relationship? This morning my partner (37F) and I (35F) had a fight. I told my work friend about it, and now my partner is upset at me for that, too.

I have anxiety when it comes to talking about a certain topic. It’s something I’ve been working on in therapy. This morning while my partner was at work, I realized I needed to tell her something, so I texted her. We talked about it via text for a while and I didn’t feel as much anxiety texting her vs telling her face to face. I thought I had found an excellent solution to my communication anxiety! Unfortunately it WASN’T a good solution for her. She was dealing with a lot of crap at work, and then from her perspective I dumped more crap on top of it and she got overwhelmed. When she told me that, I apologized. We agreed to discuss it more tonight, and then I went to work as well.

I have a work friend I’ll call Nancy. She could tell that I was flustered when I came in and asked me what was wrong. I gave her almost the exact same explanation as above. I thought I was being a good communicator, but it was only good for me and not for my partner, so it wasn’t the amazing breakthrough I thought it was. She said something along the lines of, “Yeah, I could see how she’d be frustrated by that. But you guys will work it out. You always do.” It was a brief conversation but it made me feel better. After that, we talked about other things for a bit and got to work.

About an hour later I received another text from my partner saying, “One thing. Did you tell Nancy about our fight?” I was honest and told her, “Yeah, Nancy saw that I was upset so I told her \[insert near verbatim conversation\].” This is what set her off. She says that I always want to talk to other people before I talk to her, and that it’s wrong to discuss relationship problems with others when we haven’t worked things out together yet.

She has told me before that she doesn’t like it when I discuss our relationship problems with others, but I thought she meant that she didn’t like it when we were in the middle of a huge fight, or when I think she’s wrong and I’m right, and I avoid talking to her and go vent to a friend instead. That would make sense, because she’s available for discussion and we should work things out together instead of talking shit about each other. But this wasn’t like that at all…was it?

In my mind, the original fight was my fault, and I felt bad about it. I didn’t do it on purpose, but I apologized and we agreed to talk in person later. I thought we were handling the situation pretty well considering. When Nancy asked what was wrong, I didn’t think twice about telling her. But according to my partner, I shouldn’t tell anyone any of our issues until they are completely resolved. At least that’s what I think she is saying? Either way I’m sleeping on the couch tonight.

"AITA for not supporting my spouses parenting style? I have a two year old. As anyone with kids knows, they get big feelings about just about everything. I’m not against scolding completely especially if it’s regarding something that could hurt them. But I don’t like doing it to just every upset. I don’t think it teaches anything when done too much. Today’s example, we are playing outside and my son doesn’t want to come inside. I normally handle this by saying, “okay well I am done playing outside so I’m going in.” This usually upsets my son but in my mind it’s teaching him “mom goes in when she’s ready. If I want to keep playing with her I have to go in too.” And after he fusses a bit he usually settles down and comes in on his own. My husbands way of handling it is to say his name in a stern tone and if he doesn’t cooperate (he never does because the stern tone makes him freeze) he then picks him up and takes him in kicking and screaming and lays him down in his room. He doesn’t want anyone to comfort him while he cries. He gets mad if you do. Am I the asshole for stepping in and consoling my son?

"AITA for Asking My Husband to Cancel His ""Bro’s Only"" Trip to Help Me With Our Newborn After He Promised He Would? This situation has caused a lot of tension between my husband and me, and now I’m questioning whether I’m being unreasonable.

I (30F) gave birth to our first child, *Olivia*, two months ago. Being a first-time mom has been both beautiful and overwhelming. My husband, *Jake* (32M), was incredibly supportive during the pregnancy and promised that after Olivia was born, he would be there for me every step of the way, especially during those challenging first few months.

Before Olivia was born, Jake and his friends had been planning a ""bro’s only"" trip for this summer—a week-long vacation to a cabin in the mountains for hiking, fishing, and bonding. When the trip was being discussed, I reminded Jake that Olivia would only be a few months old, and we would be deep in the newborn phase. He reassured me that if things got too tough, he would cancel the trip to help me out, and I trusted him.

Now that Olivia is here, things have been harder than I anticipated. Between the sleepless nights, breastfeeding struggles, and just trying to adjust to motherhood, I’ve been feeling overwhelmed. Jake has been helpful, but I can tell he’s excited about this trip, which is coming up next month.

Last week, I asked Jake if he could consider canceling the trip, reminding him of his promise. I told him that I’m struggling and that having him gone for a whole week would be really tough on me. He seemed surprised and a bit hurt that I was asking him to cancel. He said he’s been looking forward to this trip for months, and that he needs a break, too. He also pointed out that his parents live nearby and could help if I needed support while he was away.

I understand that Jake needs a break and wants to spend time with his friends, but I can’t help feeling like this is a time when I really need him by my side. I tried to explain that while I appreciate his parents' help, it’s not the same as having him here. Jake said that I’m being unfair by asking him to cancel the trip after all the planning that went into it and that I need to trust him to make sure I’m supported even if he’s not physically there.

Now, we’re at a bit of a standoff. Some of my friends think I should let him go, saying that it’s important for him to have some time away, especially after all the stress of becoming a new dad. But others agree that it’s too soon for him to take off for a week, and that he should prioritize being home with me and Olivia.

So AITA for asking my husband to cancel his ""bro’s only"" trip to help me with our newborn after he promised he would?",0.33
"AITA for lying to and leaving my best friend because I thought it would be better for both of us? I (16M) have been singing with my best friend (also 16M, we'll call him Aidan) at local venues for a few years now. He has a dream of putting on a performance even better than one he saw as a kid that's become sort of a legend in our town, and so he asked me if I could be his singing partner. 

My dad is a pianist and raised me to be the same, but I decided to quit when I was in middle school and I still feel really guilty about it. He always made me play piano all day long and wouldn't let me hang out with friends or go on school field trips or do anything fun in my spare time, but I still feel bad about leaving all that behind when he put so much effort into teaching me. I only picked up singing to escape piano; I find it really fun. But Aidan is way more serious about it than I am. 

Anyway, there's this one girl we know who Aidan really respects (16F, we'll call her Anne), and they have the same dream. She recently found a singing partner of her own (15F), but the new girl is super inexperienced, so Aidan thought Anne wasn't taking singing seriously anymore and got kind of offended about it, calling them half-hearted and stuff. 

Anne's friend recently proved herself to actually have the drive to reach their dreams, so Aidan begrudgingly apologized for being mean and said he approved of them. I, on the other hand, realized I'M the half-hearted one, since I'm only singing to escape my dad-- and because I thought it'd tick him off-- and if Aidan hated Anne's partner so much for that, then he probably didn't want me around, either. I'm pretty sure I was only dragging him down and stopping him from reaching his dreams, so I felt really bad and decided to quit being his singing partner. 

I knew Aidan wouldn't let me break up with him if I told him the truth, so I basically lied and told him his dream was super childish and stupid and the music we perform together is totally meaningless, and that he needs to grow up. I meant well, since I knew he could be happier without me, but I knew all the things that would make him the most upset and said them. I'm also maybe the only person he trusts, since his parents act like he doesn't exist and his personality makes it hard for him to find friends. He got really mad and almost cried and ran off, and now we're not speaking to each other, like I'd planned on, but I DO think it's better this way, right? This way I'm not being selfish, and I'm letting him go?

"AITA for telling my mom I hope she dies? For context, earlier today I told my mom about the future job careers I would like to pursue (I'm 18) and she immediately starting interrupting me and saying ""I know you better than you do"" and that ""you're not interested in this boring, menial stuff."" I began to say let me explain because I had a whole document typed out about the reasonings. She wouldn't let me get two words out before telling me how people without college degrees work dead end menial jobs and that I'm so privileged to have a mother who pays the bills and paid for my college (even though I asked her that we could take out loans) and that I'm throwing it all away to work some menial dead end job. I began to say how I'm interested in the profession (pharmacy technician) and that I think it meets all my goals and interests and that they make the same amount of money as someone in my chosen major at college. She then began to throw very hurtful jabs, saying that she's going to be taking care of me until I'm 40 because I won't get a job, even though I have a job interview tomorrow. She told me that she paid for my college, set up the job interview, which the job I want is working at the same place she does and she's the boss, and that I should be grateful because she's been working since she was 15 first at mcdonald's then where she is now. After heated jabs were thrown by both sides, I began to scream at her like she was at me. I told her that she chose to have 2 kids, she chose to marry a chainsmoker who dropped dead at 44 years old even though he smoked 2 packs a day since he was 14, she chose to work at a job she hates so much, she chose to pay for me.

"AITA for almost letting my fiance really mess up his car to prove a point? So my fiance is a ""I take my almost current year Subaru to the dealership/Les Schwab guy"" and I'm a ""I bought my 2001 Taurus on Craigslist and YouTube basic maintenance along the way chick"".

For his birthday he said what he wanted was for someone (me obviously bc we live alone) to change his oil without him having to think about it, pay, or make am effort.

Unfortunately after ten minutes of trying I just COULD NOT get the bolt off so I sweet talked him saying I needed a big strong man to turn this wrench.

He started making fun of me saying I was using the completely wrong size, which I thought was weird, switches it out and does the deed. He says he left the bolt barely on and I can finish the job when I'm ready. The whole thing rubs me the wrong way.

But then I get down there and I'm like babe that's not the oil pan that's the transmission. He said something dismissive and we argued for a second and as he went back inside and as he does I yelled ""if this totals the car you're paying for it.""

I'm gonna be honest 25% or so was doubting myself because he says he's changed the pile on this thing before and it does look different than the American made cards I own, and as I said above, it isn't like either of us are mechanics.

As you can guess though that didn't go well. Turns the car on to run it and it makes an ungodly noise and every light is on. I had to argue with him a second time to turn the damn thing off before it explodes and kills us all in a fiery blaze.

Then his story changes to ""I said I have done an oil change not on this car.""

Ends up costing like $600 at the dealership. I did end up paying for it, but not because either one of us admitted we were wrong but because we share finances and this month I had the money to go toward that and last month he had the money to go toward something else, the money isn't really a factor.

Now he is stuck on ""if you don't know how to do something don't do it"" and I'm stuck on ""don't lie about your ability out of pride and next time I tell you I know something trust me.""

I'm still pretty irritated, even though we forgave each other and mostly worked it out and both apologized, it's on my mind and I think I might be more of the AH than I want to admit because I put our currently only car out of commision for a week out of mostly spite and a little bit of misplaced self doubt, and because until we finance another new one soon it's stupid of me to treat this car like I did my junkers when I could have paid extra to take it to Les Schwab.",0.9
"AITA for not forgiving my little sister for wearing my dress? TL;DR: My sister wore a special dress of mine (that I could no longer wear) and only apologized when she knew how special it was to me, even though I had asked her not to wear it.

My little sister (age 9) and I (19) recently started moving rooms. As I was moving into my new room, my old room (little sister's new room) wasn't quite empty yet as she started to move in, mostly in my closet. While I was emptying the closet, she found my baptism dress. 

Now, I am very religious. I was baptized when I was 8, and the dress no longer fit me. In fact, little sister was also getting baptized a few years ago and the dress fit her then, but I requested she didn't wear it because, well, it's mine. I only wore it the week I got baptized. I would only ever want my daughter to wear it, if I ever have a daughter.

Now, she asked to wear it. I said no. She got upset, and said that the dress didn't even fit me. She also said that she would look so cute in it. I said no again, that the dress was mine and I didn't want her wearing it. She got mad and left the room. I still had things to put away in my room, so I grabbed the rest of my books and went to my new room. A few minutes later, I heard her knock the door. 

I looked over and when she opened the door, she was wearing the dress!!! This wasn't even that long later- she must have instantly put it on once I left the room because of how quick she knocked on the door. She started twirling around and said, ""See? I look cute!""

I must admit, (although I don't want to) I SCREAMED at her to take it off now. She seemed surprised and said ""Why?"" I screamed ""That's my baptism dress, I didn't want you wearing it!!!""

She immediately took it off and gave it back to me. She apologized and said, ""I'm sorry, I didn't know it was your baptism dress."" I told her it didn't matter, I didn't accept her apology, and that she shouldn't have worn it anyway. She got mad again and huffed that I should have told her and if I had told her she wouldn't have worn it. 

Now she got mad and started crying and went to our mom. Mom told me to forgive her because while it happened, it wouldn't happen again, and there was no point to causing contention in the household. I get that, and I believe that we need to turn the other cheek and such, but I also believe that see needs to be held accountable, because she does these things frequently. I will leave things on the table and find them messed with, used, or broken. When I confront her, she says that I shouldn't have left them on the table, which is what our parents say. (though they do tell her not to mess with them, but she receives no punishment)

I tried to tell her the reason I'm not forgiving her isn't because she wore the dress exactly, but because she over stepped a boundary I had previously set and that while she says she's constantly sorry, she always does it again and again.

"AITA for giving my bf (25m) a choice between fantasy with his friends or a concert with me? Alright to give some back story my bf (25m) and I (22f) have been together 3 years.  I work S-T due to costs of child care (may not seem important now but it will come back up) my bf works a M-F regular 9-5.  Back in February I caught the presale of an artist both my bf and I enjoy (him more than I)  pretty close to the stage with a back stage experience included in the ticket. This concert happens to fall on a weekend (I work those days), obviously with the ample amount of time I requested the entire weekend off due to us talking about spending the entire weekend together if child care allowed. Fast forward to August, his fantasy draft was originally scheduled for an earlier date in August, unfortunately something came up with the hosting party and it was cancelled. Fast forward to Today, he comes home from work and tells me the draft date was moved to the day after the concert we’re supposed to attend a.k.a the day we’re supposed to spend together just us no kids. My response to this information was that those plans have been in that calendar for months, I don’t understand why it’s even a thought. He immediately got defensive. He said that the look I gave him told him that “Once again he was choosing fantasy/his friends  over his family” (story for a different day perhaps)  I told him “the look was nothing like that in fact it was a look of ‘your choice’ because you know what’s been on the calendar, it doesn’t matter to me that your event was cancelled earlier in the month. I had nothing to do with that.” The conversation then turned to one about fairness because I attended both events I had planned this month and both of his were cancelled by the host. I turned the conversation back to the actual situation and told him that if he can’t do the entire weekend with me then he’s not going to the concert…. He then proceeded to freak out on me saying that I get to have all the fun. I think it’s the principle of the situation, these plans have been on the calendar longer than the plans he presented.  (The calendar was created due to his forgetfulness of events might I add.) 

I would also like to add when his events were on the calendar I had no problem with him attending these events, he worked out the child care so they could happen (they were both on a weekend) so there was no protest from me. I was sorry for him when he told me they were cancelled.

"WIBTA for last minute refusing to go to my future SILs bachelorette party? Hey all

I want someone else’s opinion because I’m kind of torn on this. It’s hopefully not going to be some long winded post, since I really don’t have too much to write. 

So basically, I (21NB) was invited a month ago to my SILs bachelorette party. This party was originally supposed to be a nail salon, a restaurant and then a small party at home- but turned into a nail salon, a pizza restaurant and bar, but keeping the small part at home. I wasn’t told the cost of things beforehand snd assumed that the lipstick thing wouldn’t cost more than $40. Regardless I was never quoted a price. 

I’m someone who doesn’t like lipstick. I don’t use it. I never have, I made that clear to my sister (who arranged it all) and mom, both over the years and when I was told this. I also do not like cheese, nor do I like most pasta or sauces and this pizza place doesn’t seem like something I’d enjoy because of this- and is extremely expensive on top of that. I researched the restaurant and figured I’d spend the money anyways to make my SIL happy, before knowing the cost of the lipstick lab…

… I was verbally invited a month ago, but only two days ago was I given the proper invitation with a location. The price wasn’t even quoted on there. I was told on the train today by my mother that the lipstick making place was $75; and then when I looked online, it was going to actually come to $95+tax with the fees and all. And on top of that, I’d then have to pay for food (which I already agreed to / assumed so this part is not the problem, if more just means the final cost goes up by a lot). So this would all run me about $150

I literally start college in two weeks and need to spend money on a new laptop that works properly, a new bag, supplies etc. and was not told about the cost of things until the last minute. I want to cancel and say that I’m not going, but I also feel like despite the fact that I didn’t know sooner, I’d still be in the wrong as I didn’t give prior notice. And the invitation was supposed to be sent a while ago too, I never received it due to a mistyped number on my sisters end. 

I feel like I’ll end up being or looking like an asshole, and I also feel like it’s possible I’m just being cheap unintentionally. I’d rather have my SILs day be good than not and I don’t want to be an asshole and ruin that by not showing up- especially knowing it’s only 4 people including me attending. It wouldn’t be fair on her at all but I also just really don’t want to spend essentially $100 on lipstick I’m not ever going to use or like… ",0.05
"AITA for taking off my pants at Chillis? AITA for taking my clothes off at Chillis?

So me [34M] and my gf [24F]  were celebrating our 1 year anniversary and went out to dinner to celebrate. My gf  planned it as she knows how much I love the Chillis. I REALLY love their Skillet Chocolate Chip cookie  (this becomes important later)

Well everything was going fine and we were having a good time until an elderly man at the next table scooted his chair out just as our server was approaching, causing him to stumble and spill hot coffee on me( down my crotch). It was obviously burning and startled me so I instinctively screamed and pulled my pants down. 

I’m pretty small so I don’t typically wear a underwear and obviously I wasn’t thinking about that when something hot was running down my back burning me so I basically flashed all those at the tables around us. Yes I was embarrassed but at the same time it’s just a penis. I pulled my pants back up right after realizing what happened but it was up for about 15 seconds. The server apologized over and over but it wasn’t their fault it was all just an accident. 

Well anyway after this my gf wanted to leave, like immediately leave. SHe said that I was being overdramatic for the way I reacted in the situation and maybe I was but it did startle me really bad and it did burn. She told me I had put on a show for everyone in the restaurant especially since I screamed when it happened and that we need to leave. 

I told him it’s not that big a deal and that I really want to stay to get Skillet chocolate chip cookie because it’s my favorite, I eventually even offered to try to get some to go and she was dead set that we need to leave and didn’t understand why I wasn’t mortified. 

We ended up staying but for the rest of the date she kept saying that the females and men at tables near us were staring at me and probably thinking about me inappropriately but I said it wasn’t my problem if they’re being gross. 

When we got in the car she told me i ruined our anniversary for making him sit through that and we should have just left and that she can’t believe I would choose a piece of skillet chocolate chip cookie over her comfortability.

"AITA for disrupting my sister's parenting?  My oldest niece is 7 and has trouble reading. She will often have trouble recognizing the same word if it is on a different page. I believe she could be dyslexic, but it isn't something that has been looked into for her yet. My sister is dyslexic. 

Tonight, my sister and her daughter were sitting down practicing reading. Except my sister began by firmly saying things like ""come on you know this word"" and ""don't look at me just read the word"". As this continued, it was obvious my niece was just getting more and more nervous and was just trying to ""get the right answer"" instead of actually trying to read. My sister got more and more frustrated and started firmly (not shouting) just saying was the book said to her. I tried lightly prompting, "" what are you doing, you're not teaching her, you're just telling her what it says so she can say it back to you"" my sister just ignored me and then led to her very lightly bopping her daughter with the book (a very thin tiny book) for each word she got wrong. I again was ""hey, that's not really helping her learn"" and had even sent her  a message with a resource page  for teaching Dyslexic kids to read before this. Finally my sister said ""I am going to keep bopping her until she remembers this word,  let me parent"" the book is closed at this point. My niece is laughing but it's clear she doesn't really know what to be doing. 

I had to say something. I Said this isn't working, it wouldn't be how you would learn and it's clearly not helping your daughter, this isn't right. I asked my sister several times if we could step aside and talk about it and her only response was for me to let her parent. Finally she sent her daughter to her room and stormed off to hers.

"AITA for hanging out with a guy friend when he had a gf? I (24F) had a friend (22M) (we’ll call him J) last year. I met him my first semester of school and thought he was cute. I never said anything or tried to show it, because I noticed he was always with this one girl. Turns out she was his gf, so of course I just let it go and didn’t acknowledge that anymore. Last year I became an RA, and he lived in the same apartment complex (on campus) that I did. He always had questions about housing, and we started hanging out. He’d give me rides if I asked, and he helped me out quite a bit. He was a good friend to me. I respected the fact that he had a gf, meaning I never texted him late at night asking him to hang out, I never tried to do anything with him, etc. I thought things were all good.

There were a few things I noticed however. Anytime J and I would hang out or he’d offer to give me a ride somewhere (after I’d ask, I didn’t have my own car at this point), J’s gf would always find a reason to come with. Wether it was going to the grocery store when J offered to take me so I could pick up my order, when he helped me move my stuff into my car from my apartment when I was moving apartments, and when I finally got my car, he offered to help me with driving and learning the roads around our college town. That only happened one time, and his girlfriend came with and sat in the backseat the entire time. It was really weird and awkward and after that and didn’t really talk to him much. I started getting the feeling J’s gf didn’t like me or want me alone with him.

Back in December last year, I texted J just saying hey and asked how things were going. He said good, and told me he was dropping out of school to join the military. I told him I’d miss him but I hoped we could keep in touch and I know he’d do well. He asked for my ig username and I gave it to him. He never followed me, and I never heard from him again. Kinda sucks, but I’m not heartbroken over it. Life happens. Cut to now, and the first day of class (Tuesday) I’m walking and I happen to walk past J’s gf. She glared at me as she walked by. She walked by me yesterday again and did the same thing. I have no idea what happened with J or if they’re even still together, nor do I really care, but the glaring is kinda bs.

this family member and i went away for four days on a trip in another state. we have a different family member (FM2) staying at the house rent free for schooling, in exchange FM2 would watch our dogs the four days we were gone at night about 2-4pm to 7am, and during the day FM3 would watch the dogs during the day, in between the hours of 7am-2 or 4pm. 
puppy got neutered recently and has a cone on her head, so she can’t go into her kennel. since she has free roamed in FM1’s room before at night and not went potty or destroyed anything, we figured she would be fine to free roam while FM2 was taking care them. when we got home, we found pee on FM1’s bathroom rug in multiple places, and in the bedroom rugs too. and the wood furniture at the bottom has been chewed and completely destroyed. 

here’s where i’m at a loss. FM1 is blaming me for this, saying she’s my dog and i didn’t train her. however, like i said puppy has free roamed before in FM1’s room and not had any issues. and FM1 was part of the decision to continue to let her free roam while we were gone and had no qualms when it was discussed. also, we were out of town in another state, FM2 was watching the dogs for us. and like i said, puppy knows if she is inside and gets bored she goes and gets a toy. she has displayed knowing this knowledge for months now and we’ve had no issues with her with that, her destructiveness extends to outside only. puppy is low on training and is about six months old, and i have her in professional training now because it seems even though i’ve worked with her on basic commands, she doesn’t respond to them 24/7. but chewing on furniture has never been an issue before. 

i also did put toys in FM1’s bedroom for puppy, but they were not in there when we returned. it seems she probably took them out. FM1 told me to post this situation to reddit and they would say i was in the wrong, so please tell me if i am. ",0.94

"AITA for making my girlfriend walk home after she called me privileged? My (25 M) girlfriend (26 F) and I have been dating for about 6 months. 

Today we were driving to my house from a small event that I organized with friends and family. I drive a Porsche 911. And I am meticulous about its interior. She put her feet in a way that was getting my door dirty. 

I calmly and kindly asked her if she would stop because she was getting the door dirty. This has happened a few times. No issues.

This time she lost it on me. She told me that she shouldn’t have to feel like she’s walking on glass just because I’m privileged and sensitive. She has never acted like this before. 

A bit of background on me: I grew up lower middle class. My mom didn’t work and my dad was in accounting. I had a great childhood and I am beyond thankful for what I had. I am definitely privileged. 

My parents didn’t give me a dime when I moved out. I had a bit of money saved from doing some lawn care. Used it to start a pretty niche healthcare related business and eventually grew it to the point where it was for the most part passive. 

My girlfriend on the other hand grew up with absolutely nothing. Foster care, homelessness, drugs, the whole nine. She turned her life around and works as an artist now, and does relatively well for herself.  

Compared to her I really am extremely privileged. But the way she said it was the issue. She slung it at me with so much malice it hurt.  

I asked her if something at the event had upset her, or if someone had said something shitty to her, thinking that that must be what happened. My best guess is that she didn’t like that I had all of this family to do activities with. But I want her to feel like my family. Idk 

Anyway, she gets even more angry when I ask her this and said something about how I’m trying to avoid confrontation. I told her I genuinely want to know why she is upset. 

She doesn’t say much that is coherent, just that I was born with a silver spoon, daddy’s money, etc. which she knows isn’t true. This was such shocking behavior to me that I just said, look I’m sorry I upset you, can we just get home and then figure out what’s going on? 

She said she didn’t want to talk about it anymore. Said “I can’t change that you are spoiled. I know you can’t either, but you can at least not flaunt It all of the time.” She then mumbled something about how I wouldn’t make a good father cuz I’d do the same to my kids. I stopped the car, and told her to get out. I said “you aren’t entitled to the rest of this ride” and I drove home (only about a 3 minute walk away, worth nothing I t is daytime and I live in a gated community.)

I am torn because obviously something is going on with her this is very out of character. She thinks that I’m the AH for making her walk home and invalidating her feelings. I think she is the AH for not expressing her feelings in a healthy way.

"WIBTA for confronting my son’s father for breaking his promise, not prioritizing our son, and his careless attitude about morals? My ex-partner (my son’s father) promised to play Minecraft with our son but later canceled, saying he was busy with his new girlfriend, Am, at a bar. This isn’t the first time he’s let our son down—there was another night when our son wanted to call him, and he ignored the call because he was at the bar with Am.

Additionally, during one of the two nights a week my son spends with him, he took a blanket off our sleeping 5-year-old for himself and Am. They had blankets already layered underneath them, so they could have used one of those instead. Our son woke up cold and crying, looking for the blanket. My son’s aunt confirmed this incident, saying she found him upset and had to retrieve the blanket from my ex’s game room.

My ex asked me to watch our son and his two half-sisters so he could go to a concert. I later found out he’s going to another concert only four days earlier, which seems excessive and prioritizes his personal interests over his limited time with his children.

Financially, I’ve spent just under $400 on our son’s school clothes and shoes. My ex has contributed only $19 for a backpack and was supposed to buy a water bottle but told me to buy it instead. It’s confusing why he spends so much on concerts but contributes so little to his son’s needs.

Additionally, I haven’t met Am, and their relationship started because she cheated on her husband with my ex, who was also cheating on the mother of my son’s half-sisters. When I asked how he’d guide our son if he learned about his behavior or made similar decisions, he dismissed my concerns, saying our son will decide for himself about morals. This attitude isn’t acceptable to me.

AITA for wanting to confront him about breaking his promise, not prioritizing our son, taking his blanket, prioritizing concerts, contributing minimally to school needs, and being careless about setting a good example?",0.38
"AITA for not tipping at the bar Lately I've been trying to eat and drink healthier. Part of this is that I've severely cut back on my alcohol consumption. I've still been going out with friends but at most bars I either nurse a soda or just ask for tap water. Last night I went to a bar with friends and asked the bartender for a glass of tap water. He came back with a bottle water and said it'll be $5. (Info the bar was not crowded and he definitely heard me say tap as he repeated it back to me). I said ""oh sorry actually can I just get a glass of tap water"" to which he replied ""$5 for the bottle take it or leave it"". So then I asked him instead how much would a can of coke be, he said it was $6 per can. At this point I figured I might as well be paying for alcohol. I ended up getting a low calorie seltzer (which I ended up nursing for the entire night) for $7. Now for the issue, I didn't tip on the seltzer, in part because of how rude the bartender was and the fact that he only had to pass me a can from a fridge. The bartender then kept giving me deaths stares all night. At first I thought I was just imagining it, until a friend commented on it. I totally get that bartenders get most of their money from tips, but didn't think not tipping on one drink was that big of a deal. Additional info (maybe useless) but a friend afterwards said the bar has a discount on water bottles if you say you are DDing ($3.50 instead of $5 and I wasn't DDing) idk if this is that relevant because I probably still would have upsold myself into getting a seltzer instead of two plastic water bottles.",0.11
"AITA for letting my room get to the point where a mouse is in it? I know the title already sounds like, yeah you are. But Lemme just. explain please.

I'm writing this while in high paranoia and really anxious so anything is gonna be messed up and I'm so sorry. I can hear it and it's making me feel unwell.

For starters, I am 18 and planning on moving out in the beginning of september. I'm currently packign to move out, but the problem is i have (unmedicated) adhd and severe deprestion which makes it hard for me to clean, keep clean, and motivate myself to clean. RIght now my house has a mouse problem and mom told me as long as my room is clean, the mouse will stay downstairs and not bother us. Today (its 3:30am right now), i heard the mosue at around 12:30 harassing some cardboard. Then at 2:30am, i heard strange noises in my room. I struggle to sleep at night so these noises didn't help. Then i heard it. The mouse. I turned off my light and laid down, hoping it was just my paranoia. Then I heard it next to my head. I turned on the light and heard it under the dresser.

My room is bassically a massive mess and now I have to tell mom the mouse got into my room, which means it'll get into her room, which means it's gonna be hell for everyone and I feel like i'm about to leave a mouse in the upstairs as a parting gift. Mom is going to be very mad at me because I let my room get to the point where a mouse wants to hang out. I didn't want it to. I know it's my fault and I caused it. It was never on purpose and I feel like a literal piece of shit for just sitting here and letting my room get so messy that a stupid mouse wants to walk into my room and hang out. I have to do my laudnry all over again and make sure the mouse can't climb up my thigns or damage the other stuff. I feel like an inconveince too becuase mom ahs to go out of her way to help me remove a problem I caused.

"AITA for going out with a girl who my best friend was seeing for a couple of months? * My best friend, P, was involved with a girl, M, for a few months. Initially, M wanted to keep things platonic, but P, feeling lonely and confused, tried to push for more. Despite his growing disinterest and realizing their chemistry wasn't great, he continued to flirt and hoped for a casual fling.
* As M warmed up to the idea of a relationship, they hooked up. By then, P regretted getting involved and told M they should stop talking, saying they lacked connection. M was hurt and responded harshly, which affected P deeply.

**Two Weeks Later:**

* I saw a girl's profile on a dating app that vaguely resembled M. Despite this, I swiped right, thinking it probably wasn’t her. P later confirmed that it was her.
* M swiped right on me. I didn’t unmatch her immediately, partly because I was attracted to her. We started talking and really hit it off.
* I mentioned talking to M to P, downplaying my interest and saying I’d unmatch her. P said he didn’t care as long as he wasn’t involved. I felt guilty anyway.
* On the fourth day, I told P that I liked the girl, but my decision to pursue her depended on his feelings, as I didn’t want to jeopardize our friendship. P got angry, accusing me of pretending to care about his feelings while continuing to talk to her. He refused to tell me how he feels, saying it was disrespectful.

"AITA for shouting at a friend's kid? Cards on the table - I have issues with the kid's behaviour from the past. He's older than my 2 and treats them like shit.

He's very sly and manipulates things to his mum. Typical only child who can do no wrong in his mother's eyes. 

So when the wife suggested a sleepover with our 2 and I was like ""WTAF? Why?"" 

So I set the living room like a little den for them all - with beds and blankets, and the playstation, laptops etc. so they could game and enjoy the night. 

He trashed it. Every time I'd clean his mess he'd make more. I'd ask him to not jump on couches - so he'd jump from tables/units on to the couches. Knocking vases over (on purpose) bottles of water etc. Basically antagonising adults. 

I smiled and let it all pass. Silently furious but not willing to let it get to me too much. He kept getting worse and worse to the point he tried to bully my son - I told him then to pack it in. He laughed and walked away. 

The behaviour continued into the wee hours and then when it was bed time (I stayed on the couch nearby because they're still kids at the end of the day) he came over in the dark and started hitting me and blaming my son. Told him again then he started screaming and smashing the place up so I shouted at him. 

I don't mean I ""shouted"" shouted (IE - I wasn't loud/screaming) but I was very fucking stern and made sure he knew he was bang out of order and that it wasn't going to fly. 

Wife is upset with me because he's not our kid at the end of the day (a fair point TBH) but I'm fucked off because this little brat was destroying the house (a house she's worked hard to put together for our kids might I add) and he was bullying our son and hitting me. 

I think she's worried it'll look bad on us (me!) when he no doubt goes crying to his mum over it.

So, I’m in a bit of an awkward situation at work, and I’m not sure if I’m in the wrong here.

The other day, I was talking to a female coworker and wanted to show her a specific photo from my vacation this summer. I handed her my phone to show her the picture I had in mind, but she started swiping through my gallery on her own.

While scrolling, she stumbled upon another photo I had taken during my vacation. It was a picture of my Fleshlight on top of a mountain I climbed. To me, it was just a funny, random picture, but she was completely horrified by it. She called me “sick” and “gross” and said I was disgusting. Since then, she’s been avoiding me, even though we’re supposed to be working together on a project.

Now I’m feeling pretty bad about the whole situation. On one hand, I didn’t force her to scroll through my pictures, but on the other hand, I’m wondering if I’m the asshole for having that photo on my phone at all.

"AITA for not letting my husband’s sister bring a friend to see our new puppy at our house  My husband’s sister privately messaged him about bringing a friend to see our new puppy at our house tomorrow(Friday). I found it a pattern for her to invite herself into our house with her friend/BF with the primary reason to check out our animals. So I got upset.

Background: 
I am an immigrant and my families are all in another country. We bought a house 30mins away from my husband’s family 2 years ago. Since then we would meet his sister and parent every week, once at our house, once at his family’s. The sister had some visits that crossed my personal boundaries:

1. A year ago she brought her BF to our house during a weekly meetup unannounced (we met him a couple times previously on other occasions).

2. Recently his sister got a new BF. After a couple month, she asked to come to our house with the BF. I feel awkward to let new people in our house so I suggested (my husband sent the msg) to meet at a restaurant more officially. But she said she “wants him to see the cats” (we have two cats, I adopted them when I was single 6 years back). I was overwhelmed by the situation but said yes for my husband.

3. Lately we got a puppy. Sister brought BF to our house on a weekly meetup because she wanted him to meet the puppy (she gave us advance notice).

4. Tonight my husband received a msg asking if it’s ok for the sister to bring a friend to our house to meet the puppy.

I may be overreacting. But here are my triggers:
1. as co-owner of the house, it should take both of us to consent on guest invitations. 
2. I am ok with the sister if she’s alone, but uncomfortable about hosting people I am not familiar with. Even though we might have met them in other places before.
3. 3 of these visits are for checking out the animals. I feel like with new people, it’s a bit disrespectful to ignore the host and primarily see the animals.

For these events, either we are not notified, or she sent the message to my husband directly (we do have a group chat). I am getting increasingly frustrated because my boundaries are not respected. Every time I complain to my husband, he would say she’s a family. He can’t reject seeing a family even though we have a planned meetup including the puppy in 2 days. Tonight my husband basically said he won’t ask for my consent, he just wants whoever he likes to come. He ignored my feelings and said my expectations are totally unreasonable. When we talk about how it’s unfair my families never gets to even meet us every week, my husband just said “they can come at any time” (as if they can just randomly pop up from the other side of the world). He thinks that shouldn’t impact the frequency of his family visiting him (despite the fact that some of these are his sister inviting herself over randomly with almost strangers in our house.)

It would have been nice if my husband stepped in earlier but he keeps avoiding the conflict and try to bully me to say yes to his families during this

"AITA for inviting my sister and her friend over to see our new puppy even though my wife was uncomfortable with it? 
My wife and I live about 20 minutes away from my sister and see her once or twice per week. It’s important for me to stay close to my sister, so whenever she wants to come over I’ll always try to make time. It’s also worth noting that early in our relationship (<1 year), my wife lived with me, my sister, and my dad for over a month, so I always think of us as a close family.

After my sister got a boyfriend last year, my wife has been more vocal about setting boundaries. Despite the precedent set by her living with my family for awhile, she said she’d prefer if my sister’s boyfriend didn’t come over to our house at all until we know they’re very serious. 

My sister’s expectation was completely the opposite, probably too much so, which upset my wife on two occasions in particular. One was the first time we met her boyfriend, my sister asked to meet at our house, so that her boyfriend could also meet our cats. The second was that my sister once showed up for a planned visit without mentioning that her boyfriend was coming too.

These incidents occurred a few months ago, and after the first incident I did talk with my sister about boundaries such as knocking when coming in with someone else. While my wife is still upset about these incidents today, we’ve continued to see my sister - and often her boyfriend - at least once a week. 

The issue resurfaced today since we got a new puppy. My sister asked if she could bring a friend (who my wife and I have both met before) over to meet our new puppy. I wanted to invite them over, but my wife wanted to reject based on this being similar to the incidents mentioned above. 

At a fundamental level, I believe I should be able to invite whoever I want over to our house (within reason, eg keeping it to a few people at a time and not having them stay too long). And I would of course let my wife do the same.

My wife believes that we should not let my sister over today since 1) as co-owners of the house we should both explicitly approve all guest visits, 2) she’s ok with my sister coming alone but doesn’t want her to come with other people unless we know them very well, 3) out of respect, the primary focus of any visit should be on me and her and not on our new puppy. 

So, would I be the asshole if I tell my sister she can come over with her friend even though my wife said she’s not comfortable with it?",0.92
"AITA for not inviting my parents to my fiancé's birthday party? Last weekend my fiance (Emma 26F) had a birthday party at our house, it was a small garden party and BBQ with close friends and family. 

Backstory: My parents are kinda assholes. They complain about food in restaurants, like arguing with strangers, and request refunds on like everything they buy. My girlfriends parents are kinda similar. 
I love Emma, she is the love of my life. We had a son (Theo 1M) a year ago. We met 4 years ago, and started dating soon after. 
Heres the problem, our parents hate eachother. My mother and father argue with her mother and they argue back. Almost every family gathering has ended in chaos. 

So, I decided not to tell my parents about this party. I invited my brother, as he gets alone well with Emma, and he has a daughter the same age as our son. But I didn't invite my parents, as I knew it would end in up in a big drama. Emma supported this. 

Now fast forward to Saturday, everything is going great, and just when we are sitting down to eat, my parents show up. My brother had accidentally mentioned it (hes very gobby and cant shut up 😂) I am literally shocked. They start yelling at me saying ""Didn't you want us to see your fiance on her special day?"" And ""I hardly see Theo anymore, dont you want him to see his grandparents?"" Their argument was that if my brother could come why couldn't they.

"AITA for lying to my boyfriend about baby biscuits? My boyfriend (24/M) and I (25/F) have been together for almost a year. We come from different countries and types of families, and so there have been instances of us misunderstanding one another, but no matter the hardships we've always found strength in working through our faults to make each other happy. Our arguments, although only happened a few times, did not last long as we always mindfully communicated. That was until recently.

Now, I have had insecurities about my physical appearance throughout my  life - crooked teeth, saggy breasts, cellulite, and worst of all - heavy weight. I was bullied at school and made fun of at my own home because of it. This made my relationship with food very unhealthy and I am aware of it. I like to binge on everything sweet if there is any, and that morning I woke up to make myself a bowl of baby food.

In this country, there is a popular brand of baby biscuits called ""gigibebe"" which, once mixed with milk, is given to little kids as a form if nutritious porridge. Adults love this stuff too, including me and my boyfriend.  We always kept a box of baby biscuits in our cabinets, and when there was nothing to eat we would always make ourselves some baby food. When I looked inside the box that day I saw that there was just enough biscuits to make one bowl of sweet deliciousness. So I ate what remained and got to do my chores for the day.

When my boyfriend got up he wanted us to have some breakfast. I said that I was not hungry, but if he wanted I could make him some eggs with tomatoes. He said that since there was no bread to go with it that he would like to eat some baby food instead. When he opened the cabinet and saw no baby biscuit package he asked me if I ate it all. At that moment I felt really bad about the deal, but since I did not want to look like a glutton, I lied and told him that I threw the box away as it seemed empty. And that was my biggest mistake.

He knew how much was left, as he got to eat half of that package at night, and so me telling him that it was empty set him off. He asked me several times if I was being honest, but I kept pushing my point until he stood up and got out of the house. Upon return, he threw the empty package of baby biscuits in front of me, which he got from rummaging in our communal trash bin. He called me names, said that the little faith he had in me is now gone, and that if I was stupid enough to lie about such a minor thing that there is no way to trust me. He then told me to start packing up to move out of the house we just moved into.

I do not know what to do with myself. I feel shame and guilt over lying about something so trivial. I truly believe that if a person cares about someone they can change their ways. I am willing to do so, and I said that to him, but he refused to accept anything from me. So, did I act as an a-hole by lying about not eating baby biscuits, or is he simply exaggerating?",0.75
"AITA for telling my date she's not attractive and letting her cry? I (33m) was dating this lovely woman (36f) but she just didn't really tick all my boxes. Her personality was ace but i was missing physical attraction. And we started pretty rough because everything i said was turned in to a pretty big argument.

Yet she had something that made me feel relaxed. Yet the physical attraction wasn't all there. So i thought, maybe after we got intimate it would've gotten better, and it got a bit better but i noticed that it was fading again after some time.

Also, she was a bit.... Smelly, in different parts of her body, and had hair on her face. And i'm not talking about peach fuzz but it almost felt like stubble. Which was pretty off putting.

We dated for about a month, saw each other about 8 times or so and i already noticed the last 3 dates that i was getting less touchy and feely with her. And that were we first were kissing and doing stuff i now kept at it with a hug and may-be a small peck on the lips.

So yesterday we spoke about it and i told her that i wanted to end it with her because i was hoping that the attraction would grow on me because it initially did, but it was fading and i didn't want to lead her on and that i hoped that she got happy with someone else that could take her for who she was, but that i wasn't the guy for her.

She texted me with that i was probably just tired and had to sleep about it, so i said that i was pretty confident that i wasn't going to develop feelings for her.

She then

* Told me that i wasn't over my ex and was just looking for someone to replace her (We didn't end too well after she went to the guy she told me not to worry about 2 days after we broke up. Yet its been almost 5 months)
* Told me how awful she felt that i didn't find her attractive and was leading her on. (Which i wasn't i told her in the beginning that there wasn't a lot going on, but i was hoping that it could grow on me, which it couldn't)
* Then started crying and told me that she couldn't stop crying for over the last 45 minutes because she really was going to miss me and that she was sad that it didn't work out. (I honestly was like.. Wow, red flag, it's not like i'm dead..)
* Eventually we started talking about not putting a label on it, but that just didn't feel right with me. And she understood.
* She again couldn't stop crying, and even though she said she was going to ""Let it go for now"" she kept on messaging me for about 30 minutes, turning stuff in to an argument.

This morning i deleted her number. Didn't block her, but i just hope that maybe the message is clear.

AITAH for ending it with her like this? I don't like hurting people and i don't like doing this, at all. But it just feels like the right thing to do.

"AITA for not being mad a teacher is gay? Sorry English is not my main language.

My son has a language teacher that has come out to her students as a lesbian, apparently saying something like ""you can't say dyke, I can because I'm one"".

Well, this teacher had a bad episode with some students last week and ended in some boys getting an admonition. According to the kids, the boys acted wrongly, but the teacher called them idiots. 

To me that's inacceptable, no matter what the kids may have done. Parents became outraged and wanted the parents of the sanctioned kids to go to the principal's office with a colective letter from all the parents. I agreed to that. 

The next day, one pf the parents shared a letter. It said that the teacher was no bussiness sharing her sexual preferences in the classroom and didn't focus on the insults. Also, my kid told me the teacher apologized in class and told them she was going through some stuff and shouldn't have taken on them. And that she is wellcoming any parent who want to discuss what happened.

I said I am not signing the letter because I think that her being gay has nothing to do with the issue and heterosexual teachers share stories about their partners at school quite often. It's a part of her identity and there's nothing wrong with sharing it with the kids (that are 13 and 14, not really kids but teenagers).

Anyways, all the parents came at me for being unsupportive (my kid was not even at school that day and has good grades on the subject) saying their male kids feel their self steem affected by the teacher since they think she favours the girls in the classroom and that's why they're getting low grades. To me, not-so-sub-subtle suggestion there's a link between that and the teacher being gay is bullshit and I'm not signing.

"AITA for changing my wedding venue despite my wife not wanting to? Hello everyone, I have been an avid reader of this subreddit for some time and have finally decided to post something because of a situation I have found myself in. 

I (27M) am planning my wedding with my fiance (26F), she is an amazing person and the woman I love most but recently we have hit a rough patch. Almost immediately after proposing we started looking for vendors and doing preparations even though the wedding was a year away.

I was very excited to be involved in everything but my wife began rejecting all my suggestions right off the bat. She decided to deal with the decor and theme so I focused on finding the right cake but after I showed her one I liked she said it didn't match her dream.

I was a bit crushed because I had put in a lot of effort and time but I moved on to finding myself a suit but she hated it and made me return it. Every suggestion I made was scrutinized and turned down because it wasn't what she wanted.

Finally, when it came to booking the wedding venue, I decided to go with the church I grew up going to. It was a no-brainer for me because I had decided from I was a kid that I wanted to get married here. When I told my fiance she immediately said no and told me the wedding had to be in an open-door setting. I was surprised because she never told me that's what she wanted but I asked her if I could have this one thing since she had made all the other arrangements. 

She told me no again and that this was her dream wedding and she wanted to do it the way she had always imagined it. I got a bit upset because I also had a dream of what I wanted but I tried to compromise.  I told her we could have the wedding at the church and the reception at the outdoor venue. She disagreed and got upset then left.

Later that night I got a call from my mother-in-law that my fiance was stressing out from planning the wedding and I was overwhelming her by trying to ruin her dream. I decided not to argue with her but told her my mind hadn't changed, I wanted to get married in that church.

When I told my friends and family they said I should let it go because wedding planning was the bride's thing to do since all the focus would be on her and It was her special day but I was getting married too. My male relatives told me men didn't get involved in these things and I should let her do what she wanted and stop making it a problem, but was it that big of a problem that I wanted a say in my wedding? Am I the AH? ",0.17
"AITA for not telling my spouse I created an emergency fund without telling them? When first married I sold some personal things and put the money in an emergency fund - roof leak, job loss, emergency room visit, whatever may happen. My goal was to be able survive a large unexpected expense or a few months of no income without going under financially because of it.

For context, I had items of value I could sell (obviously) but very little cash available and she had virtually no cash available. We had plans to make enough to support ourselves with a little over the bare necessities (rent, food, utilities, etc) but not by much.

I didn't tell my spouse about doing it.
Partly because I didn't want her to feel bad I had sold things that while not critical, I wanted. Partly because I didn't want her to be considering it when making financial decisions since it was supposed to be an emergency only fund and I could see re-buying the items if we ever became financially stable and could create an emergency fund on our own later.
Partly because it never touched out joint income or expenses, normal accounts, and for all intents and purposes would not impact our shared finances if not used.

This may not need to play into your response much, but she was raised making poor financial decisions. Not necessarily her fault - you only know what you know. But I still worried about how she may feel or react knowing there was substantial money that could be quickly accessed.

Other detail: we have shared finances and try to make joint decisions for large purchases.

It came up recently. When it came up, she felt that I had kept extensive financial secrets, failed to be appropriately honest and transparent, made decisions on her behalf, showed I don't believe in her ability to make good financial choices, disrespected her, and she's generally crushed and says she can't trust me.

However, I did keep it from her and it was partly because her history prior to and since has shown poor financial choices as she claims.

"AITA for not going when my husband goes to get my step kids?  AITA For hating when my husband goes to get my step kids? 

AITA for not going when husband goes to get my step kids? They live 7 hours away and he drives to pick them up from his ex. Recently he asked me to ride with him to get them and I said “Hell No” The reason is because in the past he cheated on me with his ex and whenever he goes around her he acts different towards me. I took the ride with him before and when we got there instead of pulling into the empty parking lot of her apartment complex he parked across the street in the gas station and walked across to her apartment. He said it was because he wanted me to go in the gas station to get something to eat, even though we went to get food for the kids right after. When it was time to drop them back off at home he did the exact same thing but was gone for half an hour and when he came back he smelled “terrible”. We’ve been together almost 8 years and married 7 years, so she knows we’re married. When he asked me to go with him this time and I said No he got mad and accused me of not wanting him to see his kids and actually left me and went to stay with his mother. He came back home but only after I found out (from his 10yr old son, not him) that his ex has a man now. AITA for not going?",0.89

"WIBTA if I rescind permission for In-laws to stay overnight? Hey reddit, posting on a throwaway as my spouse follows my main and I want to know if I'd be TA before bringing it up with them.

I (32M) and my spouse (31M/NB) were recently at a family wedding (their side) where my biggest boundary was stomped and somewhat invalidated more than once. For context I have always had and still do have a firm ""no photographs"" boundary.

Anyway their mother, my MIL was taking pictures at the hotel while we were waiting for the coach to the venue. I purposely moved out of frame each time to avoid having my picture taken, or put my back to the  camera if I couldn't move out of frame. I then clearly stated that I don't want my picture taken, and requested that she not included me in any further photographs. She laughed and said that was ridiculous, and that it's likely I'll end up in a photograph at some point through the day in the background. I reiterated that I don't want to be photographed, and will happily move out of the way to avoid being in a picture if asked.

During the drinks reception MIL is taking images of other guests, as is the professional photographer hired by the brides. The photographer seems to quickly get the gist that I don't want to be in pictures and starts framing shots without me in them or making it obvious they're about to take a picture so I have time to move or turn away. 

I notice MIL holding her phone up at the grouping I'm in with my spouse and go to move away, but she laughs and says ""Too slow, I got you already. haha"" and I'm immediately irritated because I'd told her my boundary barely two hours ago.

I go over (names changed for anonymity)
Me: ""Jan, remember I don't like being photographed, please delete that picture with me in it.""
MIL: ""Don't be daft Greg, it's just a picture. Get over yourself.""
Me: ""Do you need a reminder on the concept of consent? Don't make me drink the tea"" in a joking tone
MIL: ""I'm not posting it anywhere, it's for personal use. It's only going to be on my phone.""
Me: ""And I don't really care, I don't want to be photographed and you've taken it without my permission.""
MIL: ""I'm not posting it anywhere.""
Me: ""I still don't care, you shouldn't have it at all.""
She laughed again and walked away, and I didn't want to make a scene at the wedding so I left it that.

MIL, FIL and my spouse's younger sibling (12) are coming to our city for a concert in December and, prior to the wedding, had arranged to stay overnight at our house.

I don't feel comfortable with allowing MIL in the house I live in, especially overnight when I cannot trust her to respect my boundaries.

So, WIBTA if I rescind permission for MIL (and by extension FIL and sibling) to stay overnight when they go to their concert? It's a two yes, one no household.

"AITA for telling my dad to act his age? My(16F) dad(48M) has been acting a bit strange lately because he’s close to hitting his 50s and is probably experiencing a mid-life crisis.

In only 2 months he changed his entire appearance by getting a bunch of tattoos and piercings. My mom and I thought it was weird but he wasn’t hurting anyone so we let him be. We definitely joke about it often tho. 

Last week, he bought a motorcycle and he showed it off to me. We went on a ride on it and I liked it but still I thought he was too old to be riding motorcycles. I asked him why he bought it and he told me he had one in his 20s and he wanted to re-live it again . Up until then I just thought he was trying to live his life but yesterday he crossed the line. 

I invited some friends over to watch a movie and he told us he was out to get some new piercings. I didn’t think it was gonna be anything crazy but he came back with his nipples pierced. All my friends started secretly giggling when they saw him and side eyeing him and I felt so embarrassed I had to make up an excuse for them to leave.

I then asked him what was he thinking coming back home dressed like a member of KISS with his nipples pierced and making me look like a fool in front of everyone. He told me to not judge him and that he was just finding himself. I had to remind him he’s almost 50 not 20 and that he’s a dad now ,not a bicycle gang member.

"WIBTA for traveling to my brother’s state and not seeing him? I (23f) have a brother (29m) who lives in Houston with his wife (30f). He expressed recently that he’s a little upset that nobody flies down to visit them (from New York) and that they’re always the one who make the trip up. I’m still in school and working so it’s a lot for me to make the trip and I’ve said this.

Here’s the problem: I’m a massive figure skating fan and one of the biggest early season events is in Dallas. The flights and event tickets are dirt cheap and it’s on a weekend. I really would like to go and meet up with some friends there, but I’m worried that I would be the asshole if I fly all the way to their state and not see them at all.

"AITA for going to the sea with my friends while my girlfriend was kidnapped by her parents? So basically my girlfriend (19F) broke up with me (23M) yesterday, we were long distance. The story will start from the fact that she had a big fight with her parents approximately a month ago. In my opinion she didn't do a huge mistake but her parents are really lunatics and overreactive. So the parents during this month did really bad things to her. I will not write much about the parents because that is not the point of the post exactly.

So during this month she was living in another house with other relatives. So after finishing school she knew what she wanted and she would go to a specific university to a specific city. In that city a relative of her lives so she would go visit her, while getting to know the city as well. Her father found out she is going there and for some reason he went there and took her by force to her parents' home. She didn't really explain me what was happening while she was there (parents) but she stayed in the city briefly a couple of hours and stayed at her parents' home after the kidnap for 12hours+ before breaking up with me.

So this is where the question starts. I had planned three days ago (before this nonsense happened) to go to the sea with a couple of friends for the last time, because my one friend will go to the army and i won't see him anytime soon and he really wanted to go to the sea. So since she didn't really seem to be under actual danger, i decided to go because i wanted to see the friend and not to necessarily ""have fun while she is kidnapped"" as she claimed. I wouldn't have fun even if i wanted to, i would constantly want to be updated from her. I understand her case but i think she overreacted ( she does it everytime but this time she looked serious about it). Did I do a mistake?",0.17
"AITA for telling my parents I rather pay rent and leaving the house on purpose to avoid cleaning up after them? Hello everyone. I am a 30yr old female with 2 boys on the spectrum of Autism. I recently moved out my old townhome after being there for 3 years and originally wanted to move to Houston but decided to stay here in Virginia until I am in a better financial situation to leave because that is a pretty big jump. Plus my parents were against it and asked me to live with them. I originally was going to go to a hotel until I move out into a new apartment (I move in September) but decided to take them up on their offer.

Before moving in with them in July, I had a hour long conversation with my mom and told her that I would pay her rent and utilities while I am here because I understand with me and the kids being here their expenses as far as lights, water, etc will go up. (I buy food, clothes and other necessities for my kids.) She refused. I told her as a adult it would make me feel so much better if I paid her rent because I have been dealing with muscle fatigue, burning headaches and dizziness to name a few (still trying to get a diagnosis) and I barely have energy to do most things let alone clean their house which is 4 stories. She refused and said she appreciates that but no thank you. Since I have been here, I clean the bathrooms, if they need anything I offer to go to the store or have it delivered, the kids go to ABA therapy for the whole day so they are not here making messes and I leave the house after the boys get back every day and usually just take them to the park while I sit and watch them play and we usually come back later in the night before bedtime. I am trying to keep the boys out of trouble while we are here because my parents have things that can easily be broken.

Fast forward, it's August and she mentioned me cleaning the kitchen. I don't mind but Her and my dad have a habit of making these some what large meals then expecting the kids to clean up after them. It's always been like that since I was younger. I have other siblings that have dealt with the same thing. We cleaned the base boards, their bathroom, did laundry, polished the furniture, cleaned the floors, everything.

"AITA for ignoring my step father and mother at dinner? I (21F) recently went out with my family to have dinner at a public restaurant. I was raised by my grandparents after my mother gave birth to me at 18 and left me with them. Years later, she met a man whom my grandparents dislike for his bad behaviour but she eventually married him and had my half-sister (14F) whom i adore. 

During dinner, i did not speak to them at all because in the last dinner they decided to insult me by saying i was fat and that i became too arrogant just because my grandparents raised me. My step-father then insulted my grandparents by saying that i should have never been brought up by them because they raised me badly. They praise my little sister for being the best since she does sports, while my grandparents raised me to focus academically. They insult me by telling me the course (architecture) i chose was useless and that i was arrogant, just because of it. I love my course and i love studying it, so it really hurt that they would insult me just because my grandparents supported me for doing what i like and they didnt.

My grandparents also dislike my step-father because of his rude behavior to them. So my step-father insulting the people that raised me also hurt because not only do my grandparents support them financially, they even gave them jobs in their own businesses, basically paying them a generous salary while even paying for their own RENT as they do nothing but sit around on the job.

With this in mind, i decided to stay quiet and ignore them, because if i dont, i might say something that would make them angrier. Now they took me aside just to complain and force me to apologize for ignoring them and ""creating a gap"" and that if i dont apologize, i would be considered prideful and arrogant. They even threatened that i wont be able to see my half-sister anymore because i am a ""bad influence"".

I dont want to be the one to break familial ties with them, i tolerate my mother and step-father because i love my half-sister. I also love my grandparents and they dont deserve getting insulted by them. Was i rude for ignoring them just because i didn't want to make a scene in public? Or should i have done something different?",0.01
"AITA for my reaction to my sister’s crush? AITA for my reaction to my sister’s crush?

My (18F) sister (23F) has always had an interest in older men. Every celebrity crush she has is a guy around 40-50, and besides the occasional joke, I never have a problem with it or discourage her from those feelings. Again, I will make jokes, and us mutually making fun of each others “bad” taste is a running bit.

Yesterday my sister revealed to me that she has a crush on a coworker of hers. No relationship has been perused but she does feel very intensely for him. She’s had this crush for over a year, it fizzled out, and now it’s back in full swing. I was happy and supportive of her at first and wanted to hear all about it, until she revealed the man is 14 years older than her. My sister is 23 and naive, when she was describing her crush she said that she believes he probably likes her back since he’s single, stares at her, and makes excuses to swing by her office. When I asked about his personality, she said he’s kind of a jerk, moody, and that her work BFF described him as a “borderline psychopath”. When I asked about him being single, she said he had asked out two other girls at work who both rejected him. When I asked her if he was kind, she muttered and said something like.“he’s nice to me.”. 

I’ve always been overprotective of the people in my life, this is a flaw I recognize and I’m trying to reign in those emotions. But when I heard about this guy, red flags were raised. I know this is just a crush, I don’t think my sister should be ashamed of her preferences in anyway, I also have no clue if this guy really is interested. But if he is, I find that extremely weird. Why would a 37 year old want anything to do with a 23 year old? I’m under the impression that those are two completely different mindsets/avenues of life. And I’ve heard horror stories about younger women being pursued by older men and getting stuck in toxic relationships.

After she told me, I let everything process and debated telling her my true feelings or feigning happiness. I could tell that after she revealed his age she was disappointed in how uncomfortable I was by it. She even asked me, “did you really expect anything better from me?” Which broke my heart when I heard it. I didn’t know what to say, so we went on with our evening. Later, I decided to send a message expressing my happiness over her telling me her feelings, but also expressing the uncomfortable aspects of this guy reciprocating her feelings. I made it clear she doesn’t have to listen to me, just hear me out. 
I sent it last night, this morning has been radio silence. I know she’s angry with me.

Should I have just kept in my lane and not been open about my mixed feelings on the subject? I’m aware my sister is an adult capable of making her own decisions, but I also know my sister, and while I love her, she is trusting of questionable people. We’re super close and I wouldn’t want this to come between us, but I’m so worried. AITA and blowing this out of proportion?",0.19
"AITA for picking a fight with my husband over him not taking a shower? My husband \[43M\] and I \[38F\] recently welcomed our (unexpected) third child into the world. Our baby has some medical issues that require round the clock care, which, naturally, falls mostly to me as the mother and the work from home parent.

A few years ago, my husband also founded a startup. The concept is really good, bringing cost down for a critical industrial process. He quit a reliable and high earning job with my blessing to found this company in the hopes it would provide us with flexibility, purpose, and an early retirement. However, it is an absolute money and time pit. I asked him to quit a couple years ago, but he did not want to. We have been fighting about it a lot lately.

I know that my husband literally does not have the time and/or money to satisfy all of his obligations, and I see him trying, but I'm still unhappy with the amount of attention myself and our children get from him.

For the past two weeks, our baby's condition has required more time from me than usual. Between all of my obligations, I have been struggling to find time to even eat lunch. I have been making up my work time late into the night, and have been becoming very tired and irritable. My husband's machines have also had some unexpected issues, requiring fixing before he can fulfil his orders. He has been working on his startup late into the night. He has (usually) been home to help me put the kids to bed, but then will sometimes go back to work until the wee hours of the morning.

Last night, he wanted to go back to work after supper, but I told him I needed his support at home because I was exhausted. We had a fight about it it, and he eventually decided to stay home. He helped with a chore that is usually mine that I haven't been able to finish for days. But then, after we got the kids to bed, I told him I wanted to just go to bed myself. He needed to take a shower, and he headed up to the bedroom, and hung out on his computer for a half hour. I thought he was showering. Eventually, he came downstairs to talk to me about some of his work problems, and when I realized he had not showered, I yelled at him, telling him he could have told me he wasn't showering, or hung out on his computer anywhere else so I could have gone to bed. He yelled back at me that he stayed home for me, and is he supporting me like I asked him to. Eventually, he went to bed, and I left the house for a couple hours to calm down enough that I could sleep.

He took the kids to work this morning, but when he came back with them, we had the same argument again.

I've been trying to help him with his company in my limited free time. He's happy when I do. Though he does stuff for me, I so often feel like an afterthought or an inconvenience next to his company. I get that he doesn't have the time and energy to care for us both the way we need. I just don't get why a company that is crippling us and \*even he\* admits will probably fail at this point keeps taking precedence over me.",0.08
"AITA For Leaving The Family Dinner Instead  It’s that time of year that happens every four years. We all have different views from my dad. However, for the most part, we never really discuss it. But this year has just been so intense, and last night was just kind of the final blow. My dad and sister just kept throwing insults at each other and their candidates/the stereotypical supporters on each side. To be honest, I’m just exhausted from all the arguing from my dad and sisters, social media, the news, all of it, and I just burst in tears and had a panic attack. I couldn’t take the insults, so I decided to not take anyone’s side, and I just left. Today my sister texted me saying that I’m a coward for not speaking up, and my dad is also upset with me for not helping them calm down the argument.

"AITA for telling my brother he is to blame for our family issues? God this is such a freaking mess, and I’ll try to keep it as short as possible.

So my brother was with his ex for almost 10 years. High school sweet hearts, yada yada yada. They divorced in their late 20s, no children either since I know that will be a question. While my family wasn’t super fond of the ex, we tolerated her. She wasn’t a horrible person, just didn’t fit our family very well.

After about 2 years, my brother finally got enough confidence to get back out onto the dating scene and met Kayla. Now my family absolutely adored Kayla, mostly our mother. They bonded very quickly and became friends. They would see each other at least once a week to shop, grab dinner or do cross stitching, which her and my mom both love. They dated for about 2 years. 

Out of nowhere around 6-7 months ago, my brother decided to dump Kayla. Where did you go he ask? Him and his ex wife decided to get back together to give it a second shot. Kayla was obviously heartbroken, but with my mom’s support and her friends, she’s been getting through it. 

To say I was upset with my brother would be an understatement. I was already pissed at him for going back to his ex. But within the last month, he’s been telling my mother that he will go low contact with her if she keeps Kayla around as her friend. He says her being around all the time makes him uncomfortable, and she needs to reduce the friendship or he is going low contact. (For the record my mother doesn’t invite her over when he is. It is on her personal time she does this)

My father, who doesn’t want to lose contact has been trying to convince mom to do it because he’s family, but my mom is obviously upset because she doesn’t want to lose a son or her friend! Her and my dad have been arguing about it according to her.

I talked to my brother the other week and told him that all these problems stem from him and that they are his fault. Telling mom who she can be friends with is awful. He told me that he isn’t comfortable with it, and if she’s willing to give up a relationship with her son for someone she’s known only 2 years, that’s her prerogative. He hung up on me after that.

"AITA for drawing attention to my roommate's underwear? My roommate and I (both M 20 something) are getting ready to go the gym and I ask him if I can borrow a pair of socks because it's been a while since I have done laundry. We're pretty close and this sort of thing isn't a big deal to either of us. So I go into his dresser to look for them and instead open his underwear drawer (unintentionally). In there I see a few pairs of briefs, which surprised me because I've only known him to wear boxer briefs before, like most of our other friends. I smile and pull out a pair of colored briefs and said: ""woah, you're a briefs guy now?"" as sort of a light hearted joke/inquiry. I really don't care what kind of underwear he wears and certainly don't judge him in any way for it so I'm not sure why I did that, other than just being surprised by learning something I didn't know about him.

He gets visibly upset and snatched his underwear from me and puts it back. He takes a pair of socks out and throw them at me. I mumble a ""I'm sorry man, it's no big deal"" but he sort of storms away from me with a scowl on his face. When we finally leave for the gym about 20 minutes later, he says: ""Dude, you really crossed a line back there."" I apologized again. During the entire gym session he sort of avoided me and I could tell it was weighing on him. 

When we got home I told him: ""Look, I'm really sorry for what I did and calling out the underwear. I really didn't mean anything by it and hope you don't think it's a big deal after this."" He admitted he was embarrassed about it being found out like that but says he finds briefs comfortable and really likes wearing them, but never wanted to show that he was wearing them around me to avoid any type of judgment. I am really surprised by this, since this is out of character and he isn't usually a modest guy at all. I assured him it wasn't a big deal at all and he was free to wear them around me without judgment and shame. That seemed to calm him down a bit but he still seems a little off and i rally hope that this doesn't sever trust or affect both our living situation and our friendship. I even considered getting some briefs myself and wearing them to show some sort of solidarity but maybe that would cross yet another line and make the situation worse?

"AITA for surprising (failed) my friend for her bday with her bf Am I wrong? (long post)

hello, i wanna ask ur opinions on this. i'm in a trio: me (f), and another F nd 1 M. they started dating each other this month and eversince they told me i had my distance with M since i respect F especially as a girl.

little bg, F always had a crush on M eversince we've become friends nd i have always supported that since me nd M are just really close (like, real close not as the flirty type more on sister nd brother type but i do hold his hand or shirt before crossing or walking along the road BEFORE).

back to my question, one day me nd M started chatting and i told him i wanted to surprise F for her upcoming birthday which is today. i asked him A COUPLE OF TIMES if it's okay for me to join since i don't wanna ruin their time together that day and he said that it was okay

sooo we already had a plan but then it was ruined when F saw our messages on the day of the surprise. exactly M saying to me that i should remind him to turn off his loc so that when he would go to the flower shop he won't get caught so i replied sure i'll remind u (i never told him to turn off his loc, it was his own idea) and then F messaged me on the day of the surprise saying that why should i tell M to turn off his location and that it was weird for me to do it. i ask him what to tell since i don't wanna tell it's for the surprise so he told me to wait and that he'll tell instead. and he actually said that it was for the surprise and he'll just surprise her by himself which i felt sad about but there's nothing i can do since i have whole day classes that day and we were supposed to surprised her after my class. after talking to him, i message F that we only just talked for her surprise but she hasn't reply to me yet

i message M again asking if F was mad at me (for something i didn't tell him to do) and to make it clear to her that we only talked for her surprise and make her read our messages so she won't overthink. and then he messaged me that we should keep our distance which i said yes since i know my boundaries and i have been keeping it that way but he didn't told her about making it clear and now she's not replying but made stories about thanking M for the surprise which was my idea :// and i felt sad that she would think i'm a man stealer which not real

"AITA for telling my fiancé that I refuse to buy him clear cards sleeves for his double sided werewolf deck? Childish AITA, I know, and I apologize in advance but I’m sure that there has to be some magic the Gathering fans in here.

I (28M) have been a fan for several years and I got my fiancé into Magic as well. Recently he’s been wanting to make a werewolf deck that utilizes Daybound and Nightbound Cards, which… for anyone who doesn’t know Magic means the cards are double sided and if specific requirements are met, then you flip the card and the card “transforms” to another card or creature


He wants to use Clear sleeves to protect the cards so he could just flip the card and not have to desleeve the card. 

Now, the part where I have been dubbed the A by my significant other. He is disabled and I explained to him that I refuse to buy clear cards for him as it would make the deck unplayable since the cards are double sided, others will know what he is playing.  

Which he said that I only had this put in my head by our friends that play magic too, but all in all I honestly think this is a horrible idea.

I have since suggested he double sleeve the cards so that way he can just pull the card with the clear sleeves out, flip the card and not have to worry.  He was not enthused and keeps saying he will ruin the cards if he does this because he stims due to his Autism

I have also suggested that he not play the werewolf deck using Daybound and Nightbound if this is going to be a problem. I’ve also been dubbed the A because of that as well.

Lyra is currently having a phase when she constantly asks us whom do we love more, and I always tell her that I love them both equally.

My husband however was asked this question at the dinner table and he said “of course I love Kyra more, she doesn’t ask stupid questions”. Lyra started crying and he added “just kidding, I can’t even tell the difference between you two”. Obviously it made them both cry.

My girls were upset and I saw red, I looked at him and reprimanded him harshly, saying that it’s no way to talk to children. He said that it’s no way to talk to their father either, giving him a stern talk in front of kids, and also said that he’s “preparing them for the outside world”.

I can be an asshole because we had an agreement that we would never have arguments in front of children and this thing escalated into an argument. On the other hand he was trolling our small children, something he knows I hate him doing. I guess I need some external insight.",0.2
"AITA for declining an invite to my partners cousins wedding after not being invited initially  Ive (F34) been with my partner for 8 years, and have been welcomed into his family during this time. We have chosen not to get married or have children at this stage for various reasons, but we may in the future.

Last year my partner received a save the date for his cousins wedding. As I had attended other weddings in the family we assumed I would be invited. With the wedding less than 6 months away we had plans in place to take time off work to travel to attend the wedding which is midweek.

My partner had since received a phone call from his cousin outlining that I'm not invited to the wedding due to size restrictions of the venue, but I may be able to come if someone isn't able to. Some of his other cousins also will not have partners attending, with the distinction being that unmarried partners were not invited. 

My almost sister in law will not be attending as she is travelling at the time, and now I've since been invited to take her place. 

AITA for being upset that I was not invited to this wedding initially and therefor not wanting to go as a step in guest? I understand lines are drawn at weddings, but being axed because you're not married seems like our relationship means less because we haven't chosen to confirm it legally. TIA",0.07
"AITA for babying my singing partner because she was new and nervous? Hi! I (16f) have a singing partner (16f), and we are partnered up with another duo (both 16m). Let’s call my partner Katy, and the duo Allen and Tom. So Katy is really new to singing, and I mean new. She’s incredibly talented though, and loves it a lot. Allen seems a little wary of Katy, but is warming up to her, and Tom has RBF so I can’t tell off his expression alone, but I think he likes her?
Anyways, off topic. We decided to apply for a competitive venue, and we got in. My whole team has been practicing like crazy, so I felt we were prepared for the event. Before all of our events, we all have our individual ways to get ourselves ready. Allen shakes his hands and bounces on his feet, Tom closes his eyes and thinks, and I do the choreography but smaller. But Katy worries me, because she clams up and looks like she’s seen a ghost. 
She then proceeded to yell that she wanted to sing before we went on stage. I think the large crowds are still scary to her. Anyways, we started singing and I got the crowd really hype because I was working them. But I got really far away from Katy, and she missed her cue, but I refused to let her fall, so I ran back to her and tried to back up her part, but without me leading the chorus, it fell apart more, and sounded terrible. My dad was in the crowd and said so as well afterwards. 
The crowd got quieter and it was really awkward when we walked off. 
I told Katy I would back her up when she faltered, and she just looked kind of glum. We all started blaming ourselves except for Allen, who has a HUGE EGO and told us we should just make it better next time. Katy started to blame herself and I told her not to, and she ran away to go get drinks from a vending machine so she could breathe. 
I felt bad and turned to Allen and told him I should have protected Katy better, and Allen was incredibly confused, and the two brain cells in his mind rubbed together to form a thought. 
He accused me of babying my partner and not treating her as part of the team, but treating her like she won’t be able to be good enough for the team unless I helped her. He then called me an asshole. I was stunned and just stood there, slack-jawed, and he accused me of seeing her as a “helpless dependent” in my eyes. Tom was standing there the whole time and had no expression change that I noticed. 
Katy came back then, and commented that I looked dazed, but everyone was called back on stage and we lost, as expected. 
Katy left the venue crying, and I almost started crying, and then walked home and slept the rest of the day away. I thought about what Allen said all day, and it made me think about how I don’t think I see Katy as a real member of the team. 
So, Am I the Asshole for babying my partner because she’s new to this to make her comfortable, but ultimately bringing her down because I don’t see her as an equal to me?",0.42
"AITA for calling my sister's boyfriend stingy because he wants a cheap wedding? I(25F) was invited to dinner with my parents, my sister(26F) and her boyfriend(28M). For some background context my sister's boyfriend is not poor at all and he doesn't struggle with money (he makes over 300K a year for sure.)

My sister's boyfriend told me before dinner that he wanted to propose that night and I wished him good luck. I was really excited to see my sister's reaction and to prepare for her engagement day. During dinner everything was going smoothly, we were having fun and having a calm conversation. I see my sister's boyfriend starting a romantic speech so I'm thinking this is were he's going to do it , he gets on his knees , he pulls out the ring and proposes to her. My sister gets teary and she says I do of course, but then I noticed the ring was made of plastic, it was a toy ring.

I asked him what was up with the ring and he told me he was going to get a real soon, because he wanted a specific one and was saving the money for it. I brushed it off and was like makes sense but then my sister started talking about her dream wedding, that it was going to be big and fancy. Her boyfriend cut her off and joked that big and fancy weddings cost and that it would be better to do a close themed wedding inviting only close family. They also talked about the wedding dress and I told my sister we could go shopping anytime she wanted. Her boyfriend suggested that she should wear our mom's old wedding dress and that it would be really touching. I thought that was boring but it wasn't my wedding, as long as my sister was fine with it I was too.

This is where it was getting ridiculous, my mom and dad were congratulating them and my dad brings up the honeymoon phase and wondered where they were thinking of doing it. My sister's boyfriend said it was better to stay here or just skip it altogether. My sister disagreed and wanted to go somewhere really romantic. I thought this guy must be joking so I called him out for being stingy and told my sister she deserved better. Her boyfriend got embarrassed and left the table and my sister told me I was being rude and insensitive. I apologized to her but I told her that she had to rethink if she really wanted to be with a person like that.

My sister left too and I was left with my parents awkwardly staring at me, my mom thought it wasn't the time to bring this up and that what I said was rude, my dad told me I should've stayed out of it but he kind of agrees.",0.59
"AITA for telling my son he needs to get his haircut? This school year I was sort surprised by my son selecting JROTC as one of his electives. He said he just kind of put it down, and he has friends in it. He was told on the first day he would need to get a haircut for uniform days (he has longish hockey flow now). A few days went by and he decided it wasn't worth it so he said he was going to switch electives. He talked to his advisor and was told he was unable to switch electives.

I received an email today from his jrotc teacher outlining hair requirements and that he needs to have his haircut for the first uniform day. I told my son that he chose to take the class, and that he is getting his haircut this weekend.

"AITA for not telling my parents that I am dating a man before letting him meet them  To sum it up, I (20M) have been dating my boyfriend (20M) for 4 years and I wanted to introduce him to my parents even though I was worried about their reactions. I already met his parents multiple times before though so I thought it's finally time he meets mine.
I talked with them about my partner over the phone a lot before but I always (not purposely) left out the detail of him being a man. I told them that my partner is slavic, blonde with blue eyes, is a great cook, that their (his) hobby is baking and working out and just general stuff like that and they were obviously really happy and excited for me and said that they want me to bring my partner home soon. 
Me and my boyfriend decided to book a flight this month (I come from a central asian country but I study abroad) and we went to my parents house more than a week ago.
When we finally got there and my parents came out to greet us they seemed scared or maybe even terrified when they saw who I brought home.
For the context my boyfriend is around 185cm tall and weighs over 90 kilograms and he's into bodybuilding so he's a very big guy (my fathers is barely over 170cm himself and I am 174cm).
They barely talked with us and we basically just ate dinner in silence and when I was alone with my parents we had a small semi-fight because they told me they had thought I would be bringing home a girl all this time. My parents aren't really conservative or anything but they seemed upset anyway and I feel like I've done something wrong for not telling them beforehand.
We were there for 3 days so unfortunately we had to spend a really awkward time together. My mom calmed down a little and seemed more accepting of my boyfriend after two days of us being there but my dad just stared at him the whole time and didn't really talk with him (he was never that talkative anyway but he was completely quiet this time).
My boyfriend told me he isn't upset, only a little scared of my father but I still feel kinda terrible for doing all this.",0.92
"AITAH for telling my daughter she had to wear a dress to her aunts wedding? My sister is getting married next weekend and my whole family is excited to go. 

I'm her maid of honer and it is very important to her that we all come because she loves my husband 42m and kids 12m and 9f dearly and wants them there and my kids love her and are excited to go to the wedding. 

But the issue is, all the women and girls will have to wear dresses. My daughter 9f does not like wearing dresses wich I am overall fine with! I try not to restrict what she can wear as long as it's appropriate for a little girl her age and appropriate for the weather. 

But the wedding requires women and girls to wear dresses so she will have to wear one to the wedding. 

I told her this and she was not happy, she said she didn't want to wear a dress. I tried telling her we would go shopping for one together and I would take her out to lunch first and make sure she got one that was very cute and comfortable. 


She rejected it and said "" I don't wanna wear a stupid dress ""! I then told her it was required to attend the wedding and if she didn't wear a dress we would have to leave her with a babysitter while the rest of the family went to the wedding. 

This really upset her! She looked like she was about to cry and stormed up to her room. 

I feel horrible I want her to be able to attend the wedding but I don't want to disrespect my sisters wishes.

"AITA for scolding my husband about cursing in front of the kids? Me(45F) and my husband(44M) have three kids,7,5, and 4, my husband likes to curse a lot, his favorite thing to do is watch football and cuss the players entire family tree out. I also curse I think it’s natural but I don’t do it in front of the kids to teach them good manners.

Yesterday my son was telling my husband about a kid at school that bullies him and my husband called the kid a bastard and I said “language.” And my husband ignored me. Then he went on “That son of a bitch shouldn’t be bullying people.” I gave him a firm look and he stopped and continued eating. I understood he was mad about the bully but he could’ve chose a better vocabulary.

Later , I overhead my son on the phone telling his friend he was a son of a bitch, I was furious and told him to not curse like that , so I went to my husband and told him that his son was learning his preppy vocabulary. My husband apologized but he said it was natural to curse and that he couldn’t always control what came out his mouth. I told him that maybe he needed to be grounded too.

"AITA for not letting my best friend join a group that puts her in danger? I (14f) and my closest friend Maria (14f) have been friends since i transfered to her school earlier in the year. Its safe to say we've bonded well and ive grown a deep connection to her as a person, extremely scared of her leaving and grouping herself with the wrong people. You could say I have a fear of abandonment when it comes to Maria.

Recently, Maria has been offered to join a certain club (not involved with school might i add) and I've been extremely against it. The club has beliefs that myself nor anyone who comes across it should ever associate themselves with. The club promises rewards and sounds nice, but Ive never seen the appeal. The people involved in the club are trying to trick Maria and her naïve self into joining, Maria not even noticing their demenor and how what they're doing is wrong.

I'd never control Marias entire life, i just want to look out for her. Shes my dearest friend who I'd genuinely go back in time for just to stop her from joining this god damn club. I've continously tried telling the group members to leave Maria out of their cult-like activities, but they continue to sprout nonsense on how Maria is 'such a perfect fit' and how she has so much potential.

"AITA for telling my stepmother how disappointed I am with her chasing money Ok so backstory is my 40F Dad 72M passed away unexpectedly in November last year, his wife 58F was in Japan at the time, it was obviously a massive shock and everything was super overwhelming, as the oldest I took charge of everything, she said she couldn't deal with any of it so I handled all the funeral arrangements and everything else and she paid it out of their account, I had access to my Dad's card and as my daughter (16f) was in another country I spoke to my siblings about using Dad's card to get her a ticket & passport & everyone agreed that's what dad would want, his wife also said to just do what he would want & it was fine.
Anyway after the funeral she sent me a bill of $1500 for the passport, ticket and a pendant of my Dad's thumbprint I got as part of the funeral package
Fast forward noone can find a will, she got a court order and gets everything, an 800k+ house freehold, over 100k in cash assets, a piece of land my Dad put his heart and soul into that he wanted as his legacy for the family as well as all my dad's personal effects, she has never once offered if my brother and I would like to see if there was anything personal we would like to collect, never mind anything else, there is also a statue he carved that was always meant to go to me and she is questioning whether that was ever the case but literally everyone knew it was to go to me. 
Anyway she sent me a message this morning asking about the $ & I wrote back saying I hadn't made any payments bcs my husband and I are off work injured & lost 40% of our income until we get back to work & barely make ends meet, I also mentioned how Dad always said in the event of his passing we were looked after and his half of everything would go to us kids, now I owe her money for getting his granddaughter to his funeral? I still haven't even collected the statue because it sits in the lounge room and I thought it would be upsetting for her and there was no rush, I ended it with saying I'd set something up for $10 a week, she wrote back about not believing the statue was mine but I could have it and I'm not sure what else cause I haven't opened the other messages, I was shaking for over an hour about my message as I hate confrontation and it was just not something I wanted to be thinking about/arguing about. 
I'm now wondering if I was ta? My husband/siblings/best friend and my daughter all agree I'm in the right and Dad would be disgusted by her cutting us out and chasing money for his granddaughter to attend his funeral and it all needed to be said but idk it just feels kind of gross having issues about Dads money in any sense cause losing him was the most devastating thing to ever happen in my life and I've been through some shit lol he was my absolute favourite person so it's been rough.

"WIBTA if I stopped giving my little sister advice and cancel back to school fun day with my mom and sisters? Hello everyone. I 28F am kinda hurt by my 45F mother. An hour ago, my 17F sister was discussing college. I have 2 degrees, an associate and a bachelor's. I'm working on my master's now. My sister was homeschooled from sophomore year until her senior year due to my mom being afraid of COVID and just becoming pure lazy. She depended on me to take her to school because I was the only one who had a Driver's license. However, I had to work. My sister was 7 minutes away from school by foot, but my mom didn't want her to do that for safety reasons. So she pulled her out. Fast forward to now, my sister wants to go to school physically. She missed ACT's and really important junior activities. So now my sister kind of doubts herself. Tonight we were talking about college and my sister said she probably won't get into a good college. My mom said "" the past is the past, we can't do anything about it"". So all I said was ""well mom I think she saying.."" then I looked at my mom's face and I could tell she didn't want me saying any advice. The energy shifted and I felt so bad. I said ""nvm, I'll keep my comments to myself"". My mom proceeds to say ""what are you talking about, I didn't do that face toward you""... but I know she did. She then asked me what school did you go to? I did the zipped lip motion and became silent. I feel like my mom gets offended by my sister expressing how disappointed she is because my mom didn't do her due diligence. I can disburse money to my mom, and help her with my younger siblings, however when I have some advice, she becomes super defensive. My mom is not educated, so I feel like she can't really speak on education. And I thought it would be best for me to. However, I guess not. I just feel so crappy right now. I had plans to take everyone before school starts to have a fun weekend, however I feel like I shouldn't. I just need some advice on what to do moving forward. I want my sister to have the best, but then again, I don't want to step on my mom's toes.

"AITA for getting on my bfs case about his sleeping schedule? For a bit of context my bf spent half of the day at Gamescom then got back home around 10pm. On my side it's already well into the morning (9am - we're in a LDR). I figured at around 3am (his time) he would be asleep by then as I thought he would be exhausted. But I get a message from him saying he'll call me soon to tell me more about his day. Soon after, I suddenly get a call from him on Discord, so I think ""Alright, we can have a short call for a bit."" Unsurprisingly he's still playing Valorant.



From time to time I ask him about when he's going to sleep/if he's going to sleep soon since it's well into 4am for him. When he finally quits Valorant, I see him move on to opening another game. So I get on his case for this, yet he still insists for a while. Clearly exasperated, I just give up and go silent for a while. It's obvious to him that the mood soured. I remind him that he said he wanted to change, and I tell him nothing's going to happen if he keeps this up. I tell him that I appreciate that he wanted to call me even when it was so late, but I also tell him that he would definitely stay up regardless. Idk if this was harsh but I just felt like I didn't want him to lean on calling me as the reason. Imo I've seen it enough times to recognize there are other things going on.



I don't have a great sleeping schedule either but I mostly stay up to hang out with our online friends or to spend time with him. In my mind staying up that late is worth it and a different matter. The thing with my bf is - he stays up regardless. Whether it's Valorant or something else, he's been staying up very late on his own. There have been times when we'd say our good nights and I'll receive a few IG reels from him 20-40 minutes or so after. I know staying up this late for him hasn't really done him any favors. Even he expresses regret for oversleeping and then waking up in the afternoon only to lose half of the day already. I brought all of this up to him during the call. 



He went quiet and seemed to feel down after just letting me go on about his sleep sched. It wasn't so much of an outburst on my end so much as feeling like I ruined the mood by incessantly talking about it. I tried to end it on a better note and still expressed that it was nice to see him and that I appreciated the call and being updated on his entire day. Then we ended the call and messaged each other good night one more time.



Maybe there was a better way I could've gone about this? He would be just as insistent on telling me off to go sleep/rest if I stayed up too late (and rightly so). Then again I've done what he's done a few times as well so I may just be a hypocrite at this point. I also get where he's coming from. I think some people call it a form of compensating.",0.89
"AITA for not telling my friend our mutual friend spread lies about him mistreating his ex? Hoping to keep this short and sweet.

A number of years ago my friend, Amy, told me a mutual friend of ours, Brad, had mistreated his ex, Kate, possibly to the point of abuse. I always took this confession at face value, even though I did come to learn Amy was a pathological liar, who misrepresented or straight up lied frequently throughout our friendship. 

I stopped being friends with Amy about 6 years ago. Me and Kate have kept in touch and we recently ended up at a bar at the same event. I told her, privately before drinks, that I was sorry that Brad had treated her poorly while they were together. She was shocked and confirmed to me that nothing Amy told me had happened, and that Kate had ended her relationship with Amy over also discovering lies.

I am still in contact with Brad and as far as I'm awaare he doesnt know Amy has said these things behind his back.

I know Amy and Brad are still very close friends, she was recently a bridesmaid in his wedding. 

My concern here is really two fold: 

Potential situation where Amy made up this lie to impress me in some way and it was the only time she said it. I haven't kept close friends with Brad because of what Amy told me, and I'm worried if I reach out out of the blue it will just be seen as me stirring up drama that didn't need to exist.

Potential situation two is what Amy said was true and Kate denied it to me because she didn't feel comfortable or ready to discuss. If I bring it up to Brad in this case it might somehow trigger backlash against Kate she doesn't deserve.

My best friend, Rachel. thinks I'm an asshole for not warning Brad that Amy has spread this lie about him, but I dont think its my place to do anything more. What do yall think?",0.43
"AITA? I (30F) turned off my location for my mom (60F). She's upset I did it without talking to her about first.  I get it. She's worried, I live alone in the city across the country from her. But her anxiety has gotten to be too much even with the work she is doing for herself.

I went out tonight and because of the location got a text asking if I was okay. I responded right away but she always thinks someone else must have my phone because she doesn't understand why im at said location. When I was small we had a family password to share for emergencies.  She's only asked for it once before and the 1st time was last month for a similar situation. She asked again for it tonight and it ripped me from having fun in the space for the 1st hour.

Im an adult, I respond right away since I too have anxiety and understand. However, Ive been working on a lot of different things and boundaries is one of them. So when I got home tonight I took her off the sharing list.

She asked if I was home and said she couldn't see location. I said yeah, I took you off, but Im home.

She fly. ""You're punishing me."" ""You're trying to be all in control"" ""pysco""

I see the words. I called her out on it. ""You're being mean. I'm not punishing you I took away a privilege I allowed bc it was not serving you. You had my location but it didn't matter, you still needed me to triple confirm okayness.""

I need reassurance. AITA? Should I have waited a day and told her I was doing it instead of ripping the band aid off?

  
Edit: Thanks for the responds. Some of them were unhelpful in the fact that all you did repeat what I said. ""Set a boundary."" Yeah, I did. See above. 

I know Im not the asshole for not sharing any longer. I was wondering if I was one for stopping before having a conversation about it. Communication goes a long way in relationships.

"AITA for writing a song about a past relationship and publishing it? I (20F) am a singer/songwriter but I have only published like 3 songs In the course of three years and I do not promote my songs so only my friends and family listen to my songs. 

I was in a relationship with my now ex-boyfriend (23M) for a couple of months. Those couple of months were terrible and toxic. Filled with gaslighting, cheating and manipulating which I let happen because of low self esteem issues at the time. I finally left that relationship about 5 months ago and I’ve been doing much much better. 

Writing songs is how I express my feelings so obviously I wrote quite a lot about that relationship. One of the songs sounded really good to me and I was proud of it so I decided to publish it. I posted it on my insta too which I never do. So inevitably, more people listen to it than usually. Those people include friends that I have in common with my ex.

Two days ago, a friend texted me saying that posting a song about me and my ex’s relationship which disrespectful to him because it painted him in a bad light. That friend told me that I was hindering his progress. He told me that my ex was trying to change and move on and that my song reminded him too much about our relationship. This is not the only friend that had texted me saying that I was breaching his privacy and 
that I was purposefully exposing him for his past mistake.

Today, I received an unknown call and answered. It was my ex at the end of the line which took me by surprise and made me very uncomfortable. He told me that i was spreading lies about him and being
manipulative to our friends. He said that I needed to delete the song or he would sue me.

To be clear, I did talk about the relationship in that song but I was never explicit about it. I never mentioned him by name. In that song he is referred to as “you” which could be anyone. Unless you are in our close circle you would never know who I was talking about.

I don’t think what I did was wrong. But having so many people call me out is making me have doubts. I have now privated the song but it’s not completely deleted.

AITA for asking my friend out for a date and then saying I didn’t like her romantically A few months ago I found out that one of the girls in my friend group had a crush on me (in fact I was the last one to find out) so I decided to ask her out on a date. We never really did anything normal couples do besides hold hands one time but I was starting to realise I didn’t really seem to have any romantic feelings for her and really just wanted to stay in a platonic relationship but she didn’t seem to feel the same as she texted me every night and always sat next to me. I guess she didn’t see that I was getting more and more uncomfortable and I was kinda scared of saying I just wanted to be friends again. After a few weeks I decided to rip the bandaid off and text her that while I like her I’m not able to like her as a partner despite really trying to feel that way. She seemed to understand but then said some stuff like “I just want some time to myself” and “you can stay in the friend group” which I’m pretty sure is not her decision to make. Later two of my other friends in the group said that she told them that I was leading her on and I’m the jerk in these events. She has also started taking more jabs at me and making fun of me a lot more after all this has happened.

Now here's where i may be an ah, i worked mandatory 12s for 13 days in a row and so i planned to call on my day off or maybe even drop off a thank you card to have more time to thank them properly which is today 8 days after receiving the check, which i personally think no matter the circumstances even if i didnt have work waiting up to 2 weekends is alright due to people having lives and jobs no matter the gift size.  

Well i got a message yesterday (on the 7th day) saying how they are dissappinted in me and arent sure if i was just unappreciative, didnt really need the money, if i didnt care to take time outside of myself, or if i wasnt raised correctly. But added how they support and love me to the end of that message and maybe i just needed to hear all of that even if it was hard to hear. (There was more colorful language but keeping it vague for anonymity but this is the bulk of it)

While i agree that maybe i should have called sooner versus waiting till i had time to properly thank them fully, i think that the message was incredibly rude and they could have waited at least one more day, my first day off in almost 2 weeks before sending that. It makes me almost want to still give them a thank you card with a check back for that same amount and wash my hands of this and avoid them in and out of family functions and refuse any future cash.

Some relevant info.

They are aware i worked 13 days in a row and today was my first free day, but even if unaware i still think their reaction is uncalled for. 
Said family member is retired, unsure if thats relevent or not so thought i should add it just in case. 
I never asked for the money, i never hinted at needing money, have a good paying job, im looking at buying a house in a year or two but havent really brought that up to this specific family member it was really out of nowhere but not unusal for them to randomly hand out large amounts of cash once a year


Atiah in this situation? And does anyone have any advice on how to reply to their message because all i feel right now is anger even if i get where they are coming from that was just too much and all they had to do was wait one more day and they would have gotten their proper thank you vs a 10 minute one that i felt would be too rushed for something that big.",0.99
"AITA for leaving in the middle of the night so suddenly? I had been talking to a guy from work for about 4 months. Initially, I saw him as just a coworker, but he made some moves & I became interested. He asked for my number, & we started talking regularly. He told me he had three kids & shared a painful story about his previous 13-year marriage. His ex-wife cheated on him, citing postpartum depression, & he discovered it by planting a microphone in her car. I sympathized with his story because I had a similar experience. I invested emotionally, financially, & put my time into a man who betrayed me. I found out that everything I bought him was worn for other women. I cleaned his house daily, did maintenance, cooked, & even taught him how to take care of his car (oil changes/car maintenance). Even with all that I did for him, he brought other women home & entertained them. Whenever I tried to leave, he would beg & cry. He would start opening up about his feelings, showing the emotion I always wanted to see from him. Then it’d be right back to the same things but every time something happened, he’d manipulate me into believing that he really wanted to change. He’d gas light, love bomb me, made me feel like I couldn’t do better & acted like a different person in front of my friends/family so they loved him. Despite my past, I decided to trust this current guy because of his story & even his brother was telling me how this man did everything for her & treated her great. What confuses me a little is he was the one that brought this all up first saying me he only talks to one person at a time, & that we are in a talking/dating stage is what he called it. I agreed to be patient and not rush things to be official, knowing his reasons were his kids. We acted like a couple—spending time together, helping with his kids, and I did my best trying to make his life easier as he was always working and taking care of his kids on his off days. He asked me to inform him if I was talking to anyone else, I agreed to the same. One day, we were in bed, he was asleep & I was watching videos with his kid on his phone & I was about to fall asleep until I noticed when his kid swiped to the home screen, I saw dating apps & messages from another woman. This contradicted what he had told me about cutting off other contacts and staying committed to building with one person at a time. I felt confused & hurt. When I confronted him, he got upset and said he was still single and justified having dating apps. He criticized me for looking through his phone, which I regret but did out of self-preservation after seeing the dating apps. What made it hurt more was that it was from a woman he was talking to before me & told me he cut off. The messages were him trying to get a hold of her & telling her he still cares about her even tho she isn’t responding much. I left in the middle of the night, feeling betrayed and unable to listen to his justifications. I’m questioning AITA for leaving without giving him a chance to explain further.",0.02
"AITA for not punishing my daughter for copying her step sister? I went through a peaceful divorce with my ex-wife, who is my daughter's mother half a year ago. I got custody of my daughter, who is 15, and we are now living with my soon-to-be wife and her two daughters, who are 16 and 20. 20 and 16 are really close but 20 doesn't live with us all the time, as sometimes she would be living in uni.

20 gets along with my daughter fine and they pretty much like each other, although they aren't that close yet. The problem here is my daughter, who is considered babyish for her age, idolizes 16, who acts more maturely. My daughter has been paying attention to what she likes and doesn't like, and is trying to imitate everything. She even picked up video games, which she previously hated. It's not like she has lost her identity though--- she's still pretty girly, but 16 is not.

15 always tries to talk to 16 but 16 is never interested to talk to her. She gives her the shortest reply possible then walks away or make excuses. 15 would give anything for her attention, and she always gives 16 little treats bought with her pocket money, and 16 accepts them everytime with a ""thanks"" then gets away from her.

16 approached me today and told me I should punish 15 for copying her, but I don't agree with her as I don't see any malice in 15's actions, and I also think 16 can be more friendly towards her. I tried to help 16 see the brighter side of things--- 15 only imitates her because she looks up to her, and she should feel proud instead. AITA?

"AITA for not letting my brother stay with me? My (26M) brother (35M) who lives 700 miles away approx messaged me 2 days ago saying he's visiting my city for a week for work and he's pulling up on the 4th September. I responded saying it would be nice to see him one day or a couple of days but I have quite a busy week that week so to lmk when he's around (I haven't seen him since pre covid and we aren't that close so I thought it would be nice to catch up). 

A few hours later my mum called me and told me I was being incredibly rude and a selfish brother for not immediately offering my brother to stay at my place. I had just assumed he was being given accommodation by his work and she told me that his work thing was only 2 out of the 8 days he was staying and the rest of the time he had wanted to see me, which had not been made clear in his text.

I have a tiny flat. It has 2 rooms, a kitchen with a pull out sofa which is where I sleep and a bathroom which is literally just a toilet and a sink. I don't have a shower or bath and I wash myself in the sink every day. I do not have room for guests ever. My mum suggested that I stay with a friend while my brother stays at my place (all my friends have similar living situations or aren't close enough that I could ask, there is a bit of a housing crisis in our area), or that I pay for my brothers hotel as I am being selfish or that my brother stays with me and sleeps in my bed (there is almost no room). 

I explained why none of these would be possible and she said I was just offering problems rather than solutions and that I was making it difficult on purpose for my brother but I don't see why I have to drop everything for him to have this trip but he is just guilting me saying he will have nowhere to stay so AITA?

"AITA for not engaging with a friend who was late with no heads up. So, a relatively minor event, but need a debate settled.

A few months ago I text a friend asking if he wanted to jump online for a few games at 17:00? He said sure he should be back from the gym by then.

At 17:08 I get a text saying sorry but he's sidetracked with wedding planning and would give me a shout when he's available. I replied that I had gotten our friend on to be our 3rd and so I really needed an idea if he was going to come or not so we could do our own thing, or jump off, or get another friend on to be the 3rd.

He said he would be on by 18:00 latest then.

So the other friend and I hung around until 18:00. Then it became 18:15, then 18:30 and no sign of first friend. So I contact a 4th friend, they jump on the game and we start playing ranked.

At 19:38 the original friend texts me to let him into the voice channel so he can watch what we're up to and hang out. I reply ""nah"". And that's the end of the scenario.

So I was talking with that first late friend yesterday.

He brought up this event from a month ago. He says he was annoyed about my not letting him into the call with us. I can't remember why it was so look back at the chat history and can see the story above unfolding. I tell him that was why.

He says that makes me precious and that people have things come up. I say that that in itself is totally fine but I think him not spending 10 seconds to shoot a text to say he's late or not coming (for the 2nd time that day) makes him rude and I don't feel it's precious to be annoyed by it.

So which is it? Am I the asshole for being annoyed at the situation or is my friend the asshole for not shooting an update that he won't be getting on?

And yes I appreciate this is 2 grown men bickering about squeezing in a couple hours on a hobby. But hopefully everyone realises it's not that deep. We're still friends, just had a debate yesterday about the situation and who was in the ""wrong"".",0.65
"AITA for telling my friend she got into this mess trying to date a man having a baby with someone else  I have this friend. She dated a guy last summer for a month or so. He ended it saying it just didn’t feel right or something like that, end of July. Basically she said good luck and I hope you find what you’re looking for. Fast forward to January and she tries to text him and the texts don’t show delivered so she SnapChats him. He responds and they talk a little and decide to meet up. 

He tells her that he got someone pregnant that fall and she’s currently like 4-5 months pregnant but they’re not together and he’s interested in seeing where things go with her. She says she might need extra reassurance but she’s willing to give it a shot. They go out that one night. The next day or two he texts that he really needs to focus on the baby and being there for the baby mamma and be patient with him. She says wow this is a 180 from Friday so I’ll wait till I hear from you again. He reaches out two weeks later to say the baby mamma is in the hospital and the baby may come early and even though they aren’t together he really needs to be there for her. My friend was like wow I feel so led on etc and basically the guy just says yeah it’s a tough situation but I’ll get through it. 

Fast forward to this July and she gets a text from the baby mamma! This woman tells her how desperate do you have to be to want to pursue a man who is having a baby in 5 months with someone else? And says they were together trying to work things out and he lied. And that she knows her issue is also with him but it’s pathetic and desperate that she would’ve pursued a man who rejected her last summer and was having a baby with someone else. My friend said this woman was not a girls girl and needed to take it up with the man only. 

She’s been stewing about this and I told her the woman had no business reaching out to her especially after all this time but she probably just found out herself. She probably has pregnancy hormones like crazy. And honestly I also found it a little desperate to text then Snapchat a man who said he wasn’t feeling it with you last summer and to decide to pursue a relationship with this same man who got someone else pregnant after breaking it off (very soon I might add) and having all that drama to deal with. And that this woman’s point that it’s also not being a girls girl trying to date a man having a baby with someone else is valid and she kind of set herself up for drama with that. 

Well she’s pissed at me. I was just trying to say she really shouldn’t pursue men like this in the future. I didn’t call her desperate but just said I could see where this woman was coming from and considering my friend is a psychologist, I’m surprised she would put herself in that position.. and at her shock that this guy would “do a 180” and choose his new family, this woman carrying his baby and his baby to be there through the birth etc shouldn’t have been a shock and seems reasonable.

"AITA for arranging to see my young niece with my ex-SIL after my brother messed up the dates? Throwaway since my main is basically my name.

My brother (m44) is going through a long divorce (2.5 years since separation) with my soon to be ex-SIL (f40) and they have my niece together (f6) while she has a newborn son with a new boyfriend. I don't know of any cheating on her side, but I do know of cheating on my brother's side so I'm not super sympathetic with him. He also has a lifelong lying problem that gets on my nerves and I need to ignore it at this point just to get along with him without having him freak out. I've been extremely low contact with ex-SIL since split. 

In the past month, I've been pissed off at my brother for breaking multiple plans between my son (m6) and my niece for unknown reasons. It's heartbreaking having my son stand at his door for half an hour waiting to see my niece while he spouts weird lies and delays over the Ring doorbell. We are neighbors and the plans are always small, like bike rides or just simple hang outs. My father keeps telling me my brother is going through a rough breakup with a recent girlfriend so I need to be sympathetic and let it go. However, I'm pissed at his treatment of my son in this way. 

My son had invited my niece to his taekwondo belt test this week with a week's notice, and my brother confirmed the plans multiple times. The night before, I brought it up again because I was skeptical, and he acted surprised and said ""oops! I got the custody days wrong. She's with my ex."" I asked if there was any possibility and he said no. He has had many obvious lies and exaggerations about how terrible his ex is for changing plans for custody, so I didn't push it. 

When I told my son, he was devastated. I didn't blink twice before texting my ex-SIL a few hours before the event and asking if she could bring my niece to the taekwondo test. She was very friendly and accommodating, and although she couldn't make it with her newborn, she suggested I pickup my niece from daycare and go to the event, then bring her home after a little celebration dinner. 

Here's where I may be the asshole. I didn't bother telling my brother any of this for several reasons. My son was mad at him and didn't want him there anyways, it was my ex-SIL's day for my niece so it wasn't really his business, and I was afraid he'd sabotage it somehow like he has sabotage previous get togethers this past month. 

My brother found out the next day from my niece after picking her up from daycare, and went nuclear on me. Angry for contacting his ex. Angry for doing something with his niece without his permission (even though it was the original plan), angry for not giving him a chance to come to the event (even though he showed zero interest after telling me he didn't have his daughter), etc. It devolved into him saying he'd get a no contact order against me and report me to police. 

My father is absolutely on my case and siding with my brother 100% for betraying him.

"AITA for spending child support money on my own stuff? Hi everyone. Looking for advice . I am not the best at writing things down like this but I hope it makes sense.

I (34f) and My ex husband (37m) had a big argument about the children and I need some clarity. When we were married, I used to work part time about half the of the duration of the marriage then when my husband got a significantly higher raise I became a stay at home mom for my sons aged 5 and 4. 

we had a very messy divorce, we broke up because of infidelity, and i was given child support money as I could not provide for the kids as a stay at home mom, and I work a part time job now to support our family , my ex gets the kids 3 times a week. 

Now my sons are very young, and I’ll be honest i do not need that much money to take care of them , just a lot of attention and the most some daycare and such and I have a lot of extra cash which I started spending on some cute outfits and jewelrey. I brought it up as my ex and I were having casual conversation and he asked me what I was spending the money for our kids.

"AITA for asking to go to something and calling out someone for being rude?  
I 18f was hanging out with a few friends a couple of them are in the year above me as in going to university next month (I’m one the oldest in my year birthday was the other day) 

One of them I’m closer with than the other and they’re both friends. They start talking about having their tickets for freshers, (they’re both going to the same uni) and I asked if he could buy me a ticket and I’ll and him the money because I don’t have the link to buy them 

He gave a really stupid reason that he doesn’t want to go with too big a group of people he already knows because he wants to meet people at it and he’s already going with some people. 

He said it’s not exactly closed off to only uni ones even tho it’s meant for them so he’s happy to send me the link and if I got some other friends together I could still go. 

But most of the people i would go out with wouldn’t go because it’s a few hours away and I mentioned I’d have to go with him because I’d be staying in his accommodation if I go and he immediately burst out laughing at that. I said I could literally sleep on the floor or get an air bed or something, I could come up earlier in the day and leave change of clothes and stuff  and just get the bus back home early next morning and he said there would be a 0 chance that even if I was going I’d be staying in his accommodation. I probably wouldn’t even sleep just need somewhere to stay after the club closes and buses start but even then he said no. (Also he’s gay btw in case you’re thinking it’s weird) 

I thought he was being a dick about it and called him out for that and he’s being ridiculous about the reason why I can’t go and I don’t see why he would laugh and that wasn’t necessary and he said I was being annoying and assuming I could stay in his accommodation is crazy and entitled even tho I again wouldn’t be sleeping just hanging out there until the morning or drunkenly falling asleep for a couple hours on the floor.

"AITA for telling my girlfriend I don’t feel safe driving with her? I (20F) do not drive. I stay in the heart of a city with incredible public transportation, and as a student, have never felt the need to get a car. 

I visited my GF (21F) in her home state of Oklahoma. I’m adding the state if you guys have any idea how those roads compare to roads elsewhere (if that’s relevant). She sped so much. She would regularly be passing other cars, going 15-20 over with occasional acceleration to like 25 over, and I’d have my eyes peeled on the road as well as her dash as a passenger because I was so scared.

She drove 85-90 in a 60 once and I had to tell her to slow the fuck down. Most of the speed limits that I saw on the highways were 70, and she would go 85-90. I’m not sure if that’s normal, but she’d be going faster than 90% of the traffic and I felt unsafe. She’d take both her hands off the wheel at times too, which I reprimanded. We drove in an area with a bumpy road near construction and she’d be speeding 15-20 over and almost lose control of the wheel I felt like.

Here’s what may make me an asshole: I don’t know how to drive. We were talking about the trip because I’m home now and I mentioned that she sped a lot when I kept asking her cruise control at the speed limit. She said she’s been driving since 16 years old and knows what she’s doing while I do not, and I guess that’s valid, but I don’t think I need to know how to drive to know that speeding so much over is dangerous. I know you should be predictable and match the speed of traffic, but I don’t think she needed to go over so much. No one I’ve ever ridden with has. She got upset at me for saying I felt unsafe in the car with her, and I don’t think I’m an asshole for expressing my opinion, but I might be if I’m overblowing this speed thing and it isn’t as big of a deal as I’m making it. I genuinely do not know if this is as normal as she’s painting it to me.",0.04
"AITAH for telling my boyfriend what to do when i’m PMSing 
I (23F) cry excessively during PMS to my partner (24M) & I’m worried that IAH because of it

I 23F have been with my boyfriend 24M for 2.5 years. Before my period, in my luteal phase, I literally could not stop crying. I question my relationship, cry if he hasn’t messaged me for a while, and question myself. I never verbally express those negative intrusive thoughts to him because I’m aware it’s PMS and not valid. Although I know what would really help is words of affirmations (but on steroids), such as regular loving communication, calls every couple of hours etc.

I’ve educated him about luteal phases and periods, but I wonder if it’s even my partner's responsibility to deal with me. I wrote him a list of simple things that would help me during my luteal phase and more complex ones if he has the time (writing long letters, planning a date).

This is usually a time when I am very clingy and need a lot of reassurance and his presence (whether it’s online because of LDR or in person). I am never toxic, although I call him crying often during this time to seek his comfort. He answers and makes me feel better, and then he obviously goes back to work.

I wonder if going to my partner and crying a lot during my luteal phase is healthy. A part of me thinks it’s normal to find comfort in your partner, but another part thinks I should hide those feelings and let them in instead, because it’s “too much”.

"AITA for being uncomfortable with how my bestfriend’s been acting? I, (23M) and my bestfriend (21M) have known eachother for about five years now. I was never one to make a lot of friends (if at all) so for most of my social life, he’s been the only one I’ve been speaking to and it’s been the same on his end, because we mutually believe that other people aren’t worth investing so much energy into. (I’m trying to work on it) 

I do not suffer from any kind of mental or physical illnesses; I am perfectly capable of taking care of myself and staying safe, But he always insists on making food for me, accompanying me to ensure I sleep well, and many other things. Nobody has ever done that for me before so I thought it was really sweet at first. Nobody has ever done that for me before so I thought it was really sweet at first. I’ve always felt super close to him and I, as a friend, struggle to envision my life without him.

Recently, I got into a fight because someone (22M) I’ve been talking to for a few months had been getting on my nerves. While we were talking about him, I lost it when he started joking about my previously mentioned bestfriend being “messed up” because of how stupid he is, and how he needs to “get his shit together someday,” among other things. I know he’s been trying to bargain money from him KNOWING he’s short on money right now and this was the last straw for me because he was just being a hypocrite. I raised my voice at him, he got super defensive, and that’s where it quickly started escalating. He later kicked me out and I ended up calling my bestfriend to pick me up but ever since then, he’s been acting really unusual towards me and everyone else. 

He tells me to stay at his house for the time being so that he can take care of me. When we get there, he doesn’t start talking until we’re both sitting on the bed together and he grabs me and starts asking if I was hurt or had any wounds on me. I told him I was fine but I think he was really out of it. He later offered to set up the bath for me, and while I was getting ready, I put my phone away. When I came back, it was gone. He hid it from me at the time because he (still) insists that it’s too dangerous for me to continue speaking with other people. 

I don’t trust him with people either and you can see why either of us don’t. He’s always been the sweetest person in the world and I know he’s just trying to take care of me after everything but it feels kinda odd to be “trapped” in his house all the time.

My husband is the second one in charge in the department of the company he works, he started working there on the recommendation of a mutual friend of both of us, so everyone in that company knows me. He started as an assistant 3 years ago and worked his way up to assistant manager. He hasn't moved up any further only because his boss refuses to leave.


I didn't know how he treated people or how he treated his boss until he recently started working remotely 2 days a week, I work from home also 3 days a week so for two days we practically worked together, now, I don't mean to butt into his work life but I've heard how he talks to his boss and it seems like he is the boss instead of her.


He never, and I repeat, never acts with permission, if he's going to go somewhere he just say to her ""I'm going out, I return in 2 hours"", gives orders, always in calls it is summarized in him saying ""I will do this, you do this and that and send it to me within an hour"" even in group calls with his work area he refers to his boss like that.


I myself am a boss of the department where I work and no subordinator talks me like that, he even uses ""tu"" instead of ""usted"" that in Spanish is a casual way to refer to people while ""usted"" is used with someone with a superior rank or someone you don't know, I'm actually worry that would explote in his face in any day, I don't know if his boss is okay with that...

One time she was telling me that she got in trouble because Tish caught her talking with another employee.   When I asked her if it was work related, she admitted to me that it wasn’t. Usually when she complains to me about these things I just reply with “wow that really sucks. I’m sorry.”

Yesterday when I went to the office, she complained to me that she now has to get our coffee order replenishments approved by Tish and it set her over the edge. I didn’t understand why she was so upset as it seems reasonable to me that because Tish is in charge of our budget that all things that cost money should be approved by her.  She then went on to say that our office was turning into a dump and that Tish was running into the ground. When I asked her how she said that she’s coming in and making so many changes that we are not allowed to do anything anymore. That she’s no longer having fun working at our job. I said back to her that it’s Tish’s job to make sure that our office is profitable and she’s only trying to do the best she can. Claudia kept complaining and finally I lost my patience and told her that I’m tired of hearing these complaints, the lady is only trying to do her job, and if she just came to work and did her job, Tish wouldn’t be such a thorn in her side. I asked her to please not complain to me anymore about this woman because I’m not interested in hearing it. She got very upset and told everyone in our office I screamed at her which I didn’t. I just was very firm with her.  AITA?

"AITA for wanting my friends to pay for movers? I am (25M), my gf is (24F) Clara, her brother is (20M) Bob, and his gf is (20F) Liz.

 We all moved 10 hours away from home for work together at the same company doing commission work other than me who was promoted to a salary. Our 2nd year, we rented a house and signed a 1 year lease. Bob wasn’t making as much money as he initially hoped, he didn’t enjoy the work, and Liz was missing her family and was going to miss time with her brother who is joining the military and will be no contact for 4-6 years. They wanted to move back home 3 months before lease end. Liz’s grandparents let them live with them and they got jobs back home. They felt bad that they were leaving early and committed to the lease so they’d help us move and continue to pay their portion of the rent. We helped them move out. 

After returning home Liz asked if we can move our move out date earlier so it would be easy for her to come, she’s already taking work off for our group trip and concert. This wasn’t going to work for us as we’d be paying double rent and the new house wouldn’t be ready in time so we’d have to rent our U-Haul for more days and stay in hotels till the house was ready. I said we can only move out at lease end. Bob and Liz accidentally left some things with us. Clara and I had all of the large furniture like couches, tables, and washer/dryer that was used by the group. 

A couple weeks later I thought as a possible solution if they hired movers it’d be overall cheaper and easier on them. They wouldn’t have to drive 20 hours round trip, pay for that gas, and wouldn’t have to take work off so they wouldn’t lose money from not working. They responded a few days later that Liz now has mandatory work and if she doesn’t go she’ll have to make it up on her own time and that the movers idea wouldn’t work because they wouldn’t get their stuff. I asked them if they’d be okay with waiting to get their stuff till Christmas and we just bring it to them when we come visit for Christmas. They said yes and I asked if the movers idea would work then and they said no. They said moving our stuff isn’t their responsibility. I asked if just Bob could come out to help with the move since Liz couldn’t and he said he didn’t want to leave her. They are upset that we want them to pay for the movers.

Clara and I are upset about all of this because Liz asked for the trip and concert days off when she started her job but not the move out dates to help and Bob could still help and says he doesn’t want to leave her though she’s going to be at her mandatory work during the day and they live with her grandparents so she won’t be alone. If the roles were reversed, we’d take off work, make up the hours, pay for movers, split up for a night if we needed to, etc. for them. Reddit, AITA for wanting them to pay for movers?",0.53
"AITA for falling out with my bf To keep it long story short, going through some rough times in our relationship right now, recently fell out and we haven’t seen each other in 10 days in person. 

I am upset with him, and he hasn’t bothered to see me to try and sort things out. We have occasionally texted but haven’t got very far before we argue again. He has however, managed to make time to see his friends though over the past week and has went out tonight when he explicitly told me he has no intentions of going out drinking alcohol if things are not ok between us and I am still upset. 

I texted him tonight to meet up and talk things through, not expecting him to already be out, especially since he communicated I am more important and so is us before any night out. 

He said he went out because he had ‘no idea what was going on between us’. Why couldn’t he have just asked me then?

Ps. We originally fell out over communication issues, and me feeling like I wasn’t being considered. 

Is my annoyance valid? I practically broke up with him and blocked him.

"AITA: should we even ask about gender? I think that the USA government should make it illegal to ask anyone their gender on forms, documents, etc. You should only be allowed to request a person's gender if you are #1 going to reproduce with them/have a baby OR #2 if you are going to provide health services to them.

What do you think? Wouldn't this help resolve a lot of these issues around gender? Then people could be who they want to be and there will be no comment or obstacle, it won't be discussed. The question of gender is irrelevant to anything except for when wanting to have a child OR when needing to receive certain medical care.

"AITA for wanting my boyfriend to spend time with his kids? Small backstory, my boyfriend (31y/o) and I (22y/o) have been together for a little over a year. He has two boys from his previous marriage ages 6 and 9 ( this is important to the story). When him and I first started dating he wasn’t allowed to see his kids very much due to the lack of food and cleanliness of the house. He had two dogs that he would let pee and poop all over the floor and he wouldn’t clean it up, he had piles of dishes with old food rotting on them and food moulding in the fridge. I told him at the time that I would not be staying at his house unless he cleaned up and he did. I helped him deep clean his house and throw out any garbage lingering around washed the walls, the floors, everything. I went through all of the boys clothes to make sure they all fit, bought 600$ of groceries so he could prove there was food in the house for them to eat. But now after living with him for almost 9 months i make sure that him and the boys have a clean home and clean clothes. On top of being a full time house wife I also have two full time jobs and a part time job (he’s self employed with little to no work most days). Last night before the incident I had worked from 9am-2am the next day. Now that we’re caught up, this morning, around 10am, I had woke up to the boys talking. I spent some time doing the dishes, laundry, feed the animals and by that time the boys were hungry for lunch. I made them lunch and after they ate it was about 12 o’clock. so I go into the bedroom to wake him up and he brushed me off and went back to sleep. Again at 12:30 I go to wake him up and say “one of the boys would like to go on his dirtbike with you” again he brushed me off and goes back to sleep. 1pm rolls around and I’m headed out the door to go to work I said to him again “I’m going to work you should get up with the boys while you have them for the weekend” his response was that I was being an asshole and I have no right to tell him how to be a parent to his children because I don’t have any. As far as I’m concerned I have been more of a parent to his children than he has. This is only one example of one day that he had slept in till 1pm or later when he has his children who he only gets to see two weekends out of the month.

My mom had a few boyfriends over the years, but nothing serious that lasted long
She didn’t date for years until my sister and I became young adults, and she wasn’t busy raising little kids.
She started dating this guy, and we got along fine in the beginning. But things started to change in ways I can’t explain. Maybe I’m just not used to living with a man? My whole life all I remember is just me, my mom, and sister. So when a man started living there, it was different
My mom and I kept fighting, she kicked me out last summer and I’ve been living with my bf and his family ever since
I also got into a huge screaming match with her bf because I was mad I heard them having sex one morning 
Anyway, my whole family loves him and accepted him immediately and expected me too as well. They even tried getting me to get him a Father’s Day card, but I refused

"AITA for Trying to Improve my Roommate's Wellbeing? I (25M) am currently sharing a house with a friend (21M), let's call him Oscar, and quite a few more people to help keep the lights on. Most of my roommates are slightly younger than me and, to my knowledge, are enrolled in a college or university, so I try to keep the house in order (chores, rent, etc.) when they're busy with their studies since I have plenty of time off work. We're all pretty close after having lived together for a while, so I often check in with everyone to see how they're doing. 

So, this is where Oscar comes in. He's always been a bit shy; I consider myself to be the closest to him out of the rest of our roommates. I even helped him open up to everyone when we all first started living here a little over an year ago. From what I've seen, Oscar seems to struggle a lot with his depression, which is fine, no judgement here, but I worry for him and try to help him out the best I can because he's a friend who I care about deeply. I personally do morning workouts and Oscar usually joins me if he doesn't have classes that day. I used to be the one encouraging him to do so at first, but now he joins voluntarily. I also generally just give him words of advice and encouragement, and it'd always seem to put him in a better mood whenever he was feeling down. For the past month, It even felt like he had improved mentally. 

  
At least, that's what I thought. I recently accidentally caught him talking with another one of our roommates (19F), let's call her Fatima, about how I approach his depressive behavior. I'm not the biggest fan of their friendship; Fatima is a nice person, but it often feels like she encourages Oscar's poor thoughts, pries into his feelings, or enables his behavior (but that might just be my POV as a close friend of his). So, basically what I overheard was that Oscar tried to be in a good mood around me, but felt like he couldn't meet my expectations and it made him feel even worse about himself. Fatima agreed with Oscar and told him he could vent about his depression to her. It was as if Oscar hadn't gotten better at all. The two laughed a lot together in their conversation; Oscar had never smiled like that with me. I know it's not my job to make him happy, but seeing them together did hurt a bit. I'm upset that my words couldn't reach Oscar in a way that genuinely made him happier. I never expected anything from him, all I wanted was for him to feel better. Though, with what I know now, I think my efforts might have ended up being in vain.

"AITA for asking my friend not to touch my long hair without permission? Posting this from another account.
I (19F) live with my friend (20F).
I have quite lush long hair, I don't really like how it looks with hairdo with tail or plaid (I do it only when I am eating), also I have very big ears, and I don't like how I look when the hair doesn't cover the ears.
Today we were watching a video with my friend. I was standing with loose hair (like on one of these photos: luxyhair.com/cdn/shop/articles/LuxyHair_16X9_Blog_70dc7d00-694e-4c68-8163-7a6e696b1ba7.jpg?v=1540475756), my friend was standing next to me, and I turned my head down because I am much taller than her.
So I touched her face with my hair by accident, I didn't notice that. And she put behind my ear the part of my hair which was touching her, and she had wet fingers, because of that it was even more unpleasant for me.
After that she told me that she hadn't been able to watch the video because of my hair, I apologised (I hadn't noticed that) and said I would try not to interfere her with my hair, but then I said that in these cases it would be MUCH better to tell me about that, I would just apologise and put it behind my ear by myself, and it is quite unpleasant when other people put my hair behind my ear without asking me about that.
She said she thinks she did nothing wrong, and I am the AH for not putting my hear behind my ear before coming to her and being uncomfortable with her doing that instead of telling me.
But I think she shouldn't have put my hair behind my ear (especially with wet fingers) instead of asking me.

"AITA and responsible for the ending of a 25+ year best friendship? My best friend and I have been friends since 2nd grade and we're both in our 30's now. We've remained friends through college, through moves and through it all, really. As we've grown, I've gone a more corporate route, she's remained a free spirit who loves writing and works at a coffee shop in town. 

Backup to a couple of years ago, I made a business move that started making me a good bit of money. As a gesture of love, I took her out to dinner and offered her 10k. I wanted her to pursue what made her happy. To my shock and gut aching sadness, she became visibly upset and downright refused my offer. I went home deflated and upset and never mentioned it to her again. 

Fast forward to now, we made plans to see a concert and have a girls night. When I asked her if she could get the tickets and I could pay her at the show (cause it was will-call only) she said ""I'll buy my own ticket..."" then I offered to get everyone's tickets if it would be easier. She just repeated, ""I'll buy my own ticket..."" I just said ok dude, bought my own but made a mental note that was weird behavior. A day before the show, she texted me that she was meeting up with a girlfriend beforehand for dinner and she'd see me there. Maybe I'm just sensitive, but I was hurt she didn't invite me. Like, the whole point of the night was us hanging out, why not invite me? I Between the two interactions, I just didn't show up at the concert and didn't say anything. I know, shitty move. I didn't know what to say, I was hurt, half waiting for her to say something... we saw each other the next week and had a quick, semi awkward interaction. Then not even an hour later, I receive this EMAIL:

""Hey-
Sorry to make you so nervous at the farmer’s market!
I guess you understand by now, that I know why you didn’t show up to the concert. In me not agreeing to pay for you and your boyfriends ticket (a RIDICULOUS thing to ask anyone to do btw..just a social etiquette tip if you’d like to have some female friendships) it made it readily apparent that I was wise to your “I forgot my wallet business.” Over the years I dismissed the numerous times that you had me pick up anything from cat litter, to $50 jackfruits, to coffees for you and your boyfriends, to hotel rooms and gas, and just never offering up any cash as a lack of socialization.
But over the years I’ve made really close friends with wonderful people who ask me questions about my life, who care about me, and want the best for me, so getting walked on just isn’t worth it anymore. I do love you, and hold a lot of fond childhood memories of you in my heart and really want the best for you. I want you to find true happiness and real love, the kind of love that makes you put the other person first.
Wish you the best.""

We went back and forth. She had no desire to reconcile. I'm so genuinely sad and confused. She had never mentioned this to me in 25yrs.

"AITA for leaving my mom for good? 


Hello everyone I wanted to make this since I wanna leave but my mother refuses to let me. So im 18f and my mom (we will call Luna) is 37F. Me and Luna dont really have a good relationship and we dont talk at home she barely says any words to me,she usally leaves me at home alone for a few days and goes out with my step dad. During my chillhood Luna was not the mom at all to me, she barely took care of me, my grandma had to take care of me whenever Luna left me with her, i love my grandma alot, she is like a mother to me because she was the one always bringing me to school, dressing me up ect, so we are really close. SO I work at gas station and ive been saving money for the past year I work at go to school so im pretty exhausted when I come home.

So yesterday I told my Luna, I am moving to ireland forever and I do not want a relationship with her anymore, she was not happy about it at all she got really mad at me saying,I need her in my life, I cant leave, she owns my life and my money,I need to take care of her and her bills and everything.  Saying how will I even get a job there (I researched everything and I did find a job and a place to stay there,since my godfather lives there, he said I could stay with him until I find my own place to stay). When I told her that i can stay there and survive. Luna started threatening me saying she will take all of my money,make me quit my job and take my phone awat if I decide to leave,since im not allowed?? (I know I can since I am an adult rn ig?) AND saying more means things to me how can I leave my own mother,since she took care of me all of my life and this is how i repay her(sure). I have to admit I just snapped and started yelling at her that she is not my mother she barely took care of me and I will do what I want with my life.  She cannot control me at all and what I do anymore, I sajd I will cut all my relationship with her after I leave and I did kinda push her because she was yelling at me straight into my face.

Now she is complaining to all of my family members that I am a horrible daughter for leaving her and her family. Half of the family is on my moms side saying I should take care of her since I have too because she gave birth to me. Tho my godfather and my grandma are saying that I can do what I want with my life and they will support my desicion.

Now idk what to do, I feel bad that i might be making a wrong desicion, I do love her yes but I also dont want to talk to her or see her for making my life difficult. I just wanna leave this toxic place

"WIBTA Would I be the ah if I changed my daughter’s name? I’m not sure if my ex uses Reddit or if this would get back to him but frankly his opinion means nothing to me now and I want other outside, unbiased opinions. 

My ex and I tried for five months to get pregnant. Almost as soon as we were successful (it took several months) I noticed a SIGNIFICANT change in him. Almost overnight it was like he stopped being happy, treated every request I made like a massive burden, started being an absolute jerk toward me, stopped communicating, stopped showing any affection etc. When I brought up concerns I was met with being called selfish, having my past thrown in my face, yelling, and slamming doors. At 19 weeks pregnant he ended things with me stating that his police officer training was causing him a lot of stress and that he’d like to just focus on FTO (field officer training) and then focus on our daughter once she arrives. He’s done next to nothing to support me while pregnant because “she isn’t even here yet.” This included him not caring when I told him I was sick, or in the ER. He’s since lied to family about what has been happening and even changed or added additional excuses as to why he left. Frankly I think he’s been cheating and a lot of people have drawn the same conclusion. He says he didn’t but after leaving the way he did I don’t feel like I can trust anything he says. 

ANYWAY. I had a long list of names I’d always wanted for a little girl but he didn’t like any of them. We finally settled on a name that wasn’t on my list but both were okay with. I always wanted a unique name for my daughter. The name we chose is pretty but not unique at all. 

Since he’s no longer in the picture (but says he will be when she gets here) my best friend asked me if I was going to change her name to one of the ones I wanted. I’m only 22 weeks pregnant now so there is plenty of time, but I know he’s going to be upset if I change her name. My mom sees nothing wrong with it but obviously my family isn’t his biggest fan so they’re a little biased. I do want to note that I do not want to change her name out of spite. He wasn’t even super set on it, it wasn’t like it held any special meaning or anything to him, he just hated all my other name suggestions. 

So Reddit, would I be the AH? 

EDIT: The names I like aren’t crazy or spelled weird. Since he’ll know this is me for sure if it gets back to him I’ll just say that I’ve always loved the name Charlie for a girl (ever since watching Friends) or older names like Nora. 

Also for those asking, she will have my last name. And yes I know a lot of people want to say we should have been married, but I had been married before and can tell you that to some people it is just a piece of paper. If people want to bail, they can bail. However, I’m 30 years old and a veteran so my body is quite literally falling apart. We’d agreed to get married but I wasn’t in a rush to plan another wedding or spend all that money (I wanted to do a destination wedding).",0.09
"AITA for refusing to give back the laptop my mother gave me to punish younger sister I (23f) am starting grad school this year. My laptop recently broke and I couldn't afford a good one, my mother said my little sister (16f) has been ""acting up"" recently and not listening and she'd like to give me her laptop since ""she's been horrible lately.""

Now my mother tends to spoil her so it is her fault my sister turned out this way (ofcourse she'll hear none of it), she has a bad habit of not following through on punishments and ""canceling"" them when my sister pitches enough of a fit.

Because if I'm gifted this I'm not giving it back unless you buy me one of equal or greater value."" She said ""yes I'm sure I've had enough of her antics"" so I went over and picked up the laptop when sister wasn't home and that was that or so I thought. 

It only took about a day before my mother called me begging for the laptop back because my sister has become unbearable and I said ""are you going to buy me one of equal or greater value?""

She then screams at me and hung up and now won't speak to me. 

Dad always gives into whatever mom wants ""happy wife happy life"" and is telling me to ""be the bigger person"" and give it back, and I said I'm sticking to my guns and he's sent me several nasty texts and emails because now mom is on his case and he can't stand it and he's saying it's all my fault and this had just hugely blown up.

I waited to see if she wanted to pull through to take the open pump, generally deferring to her, because she had been there first. She decided to pull directly behind the car in the lane with the open pump, and waited there.

Seeing that she had decided to wait behind the car that was still fueling, I proceeded to drive between the car she was parked behind and the car in the next lane over, backed in, and took the open pump in front of the car she was waiting behind.

I began fueling. Eventually the car now behind me, and in front of her finished, and departed. Waiting woman pulled in to the now open pump behind me, got out of her car, and muttered something along the lines of ""Real dick move, lady"". I was surprised, and a bit confused at her reaction, since:

* The pump was open
* She had decided not to pull through to use it
* My using the open pump did not delay her in any way, since she had pulled in behind the other car, and would not be able to fuel at either pump until they finished

There was so mistakes along the way but overall from my understanding things were going well. 
So well that in May they gave me a promotion and a raise. 
The summer has been hard for me because my kids are out of school and are still at an age where they are dependent on me as well as having some behavioural issues. 
I had made some scheduling/ payroll errors due to the extra stress. I was aware of this and i was also very open about the struggles i was having this summer. I had made sure i was checking in regularly and kept communication open. 
They did not once over the summer give me any constructive criticism or feedback. I  did however start to receive passive aggressive comments in our shared spreadsheet the last couple weeks.
I can totally see where i was dropping the ball in areas of my job this summer and take accountability for that.

Tuesday morning i recieved an email with no subject line from 1/2 of the business owners who also happened to be my closest friend. 
The email basically said that they were letting me go without actually saying it and wanted to meet in person to talk about it further. 
I immediately picked up what they were getting at and said no need to meet up i understand and will start the steps i need to end my position. 
They still really wanted to talk further and wanted me to be able “to ask questions and they will be forthcoming” 
I am completely uninterested in this because they had already made the decision to let me go. When i did ask in email why they didnt demote me or get me to another position within the company they said “they thought i wouldnt be interested because i make more money cleaning for myself.” That statement is correct i do make more with my own clients but i was taken back because i had been vocal about wanting to clean for them and honestly invisiioned myself working with them a long time because i believed in the company. 
The more i ruminate the angrier i feel. 
From the business side i am frustrated about the lack of communication. Had we met and gone over where my shortcomings were and collaborated on a solution i would have happily stepped down on my own because I do understand. 
As a friend i am also upset about the same thing. They knew i was having a hard time and didn’t consider the whole picture. 

Am i the asshole for not wanting to hear them out?

"AITA for not inviting my ex husband/his family to one out of two bday parties I had for my kids?  
First time poster, and it’s a long one so I apologize in advance. 

I have 2 children with my ex husband. My kids birthdays are literally one day apart. For birthdays I always have done one party, with two cakes/two different themes to make it more individualized for each child.

Rewind to last year, it’s birthday time. I invite friends from school, my family, my exs family, work friends of mine, etc. Important context- I invite my Ex SIL Jane (fake name), and her son Parker (also fake name). I have never met them in person as she lived multiple states away until she recently moved closer. 

It was an at home birthday with rented inflatables. Everyone shows, and it started off great. Until it wasn’t. Parker started misbehaving. I’m not talking misbehaving as a normal 5yo might. He was screaming, having tantrums, not playing nicely with any of the other kids, not sharing toys/games I had put out, and hit several other kids in attendance. He even shoved a toddler down because he wanted to go first on the inflatable slide. It was so bad just about everyone except family started leaving before we could even cut the cake. At this point I was at my limit, and kicked both Jane & Parker out. He had an immense fit, ended up grabbing a knife I had on the table for the cakes, and stabbed one of the inflatables putting a massive gash in it.

Jane did not offer to pay for the damages, nor did she try to apologize. It was just “oh kids act that way” “you’re being ridiculous”. My ex nor his family said anything to her, and just said they didn’t want to be involved. I ended up paying 3k in damages to the inflatable company. 

This year I decided to throw two parties. One as I usually did, and the other for my ex & his family. 

The first party was a week before the one we originally have. I did the usual inflatables, games, photo booths, etc. Neither my ex, nor any of his family was invited so it was fair and I wasn’t excluding just Jane and Parker. Everything was great, and everyone had a wonderful time. 

The next week we do the second party. My family, and my exs family are there. I had everything else as the other party at this one, excluding inflatables as I was not risking paying another few thousand if Parker’s behavior had not changed within the last year. Everything goes okay, we did have some outbursts from Parker, but no one was injured this go around so it went a lot more smooth. 

It is now a couple weeks later, and I started getting blew up with text messages from my ex/his fam saying how awful I am for throwing two parties, and acting as if they were “too stupid to find out”. I ignored it at first, but the messages continued so I eventually started a group chat and just explained to each of them that I did what I did due to everything that happened last year. I’m still getting messages saying I’m being an AH, so am I really TA?",0.25
"AITA for not helping gf and her friend prepare hotpot and just watching sports on tv all day? Went shopping with gf and her friend, in preparation for dinner. it was a bunch of asian grocery stores, i have no idea what half the things they're buying are, everyone there spoke a different language, most of the labels were in a different language.  I paid for EVERYTHING btw, which I’m ok with.  Got home, they were preparing hotpot together, they were having a lot of fun, I have no experience in it. At no point did they ask for help.

"AITA for telling my husband he should’ve come see me in the hospital? My husband had just left for work and I was outside and ended up falling and breaking my ankle. It was very obviously broken and the first thing I thought to do was call my husband to come back. He came back within minutes and called an ambulance. When the ambulance took me, he said bye and to let him know any updates and he went to work. Him going to work at this point i understood as he has his own business and it’s only him and another guy, plus it’s a broken ankle nothing worse. He texted me an hour later saying “call me when you get out i’ll pick you up” as if picking me up from work lol. 

I planned to keep him in the loop via text as much as I could, and I’ll admit i was scared at one point because I didn’t have pulses in my foot so a bunch of people came into my room explaining they needed to reduce the fracture immediately. So they put me out while they did that, thankfully a kind nurse held my hand until I was asleep lol. 

Once I was awake and back to baseline, I was in a hallway bed waiting for ortho who eventually came to me and said I’ll need surgery that night. I asked him to bring me some things but they wouldn’t let him in he tried but ended up leaving.

Once I was in a room it was late-ish but i told him visiting hours are 24/7 come whenever or tomorrow (bc we haven’t heard about when they were to do the surgery yet). He said ok he’ll stop by tomorrow but he has to go to the bank at 930 so he’ll see when he can come pick me up. I never said anything about picking me up lol. Anyway I said ok, i’ll keep you updated. 

An hour later I text him i’m going into surgery. No answer. I text him when i’m awake after surgery. no answer (tbf it’s 1am lol). HOWEVER. I later learn he did not have his phone on ringer and the surgeon tried calling him, and he didn’t pick up.

Fast forward the next day he eventually picks me up in the early afternoon, and I learn he ended up not going to the bank or anything. He never came to the hospital to see me all morning or afternoon, only came to pick me up. 

Anyway a week later i told him i was upset about him not being there or having his phone on (what if something in the surgery happened and she needed to reach him?). He was sorry but didn’t know it was a big deal bc no one came to see him when he was in the hospital (which was before we even met, like 15 years ago). I said that I’m his wife, he should’ve been there at some point for me, i was scared, i had to have surgery!!!

Anyway he seemed upset that i was so upset with him which made me feel bad lol.

"WIBTA if I told my Mom to start respecting me Hi, long time lurker, first time poster. I never really thought I'd post here, but here we are. Throw away account because my mom would recognize my main.

I will try to keep things brief. Basically, things have been a little weird with my mom and I want to call her out and tell her to respect me as an adult, but I don't know if I'm overreacting. There's too many examples to go through here, but I will go through the biggest ones for me.

I, (22 F) have been working on a huge remodeling project that has taken a lot of blood, sweat, and tears over the past months.

Recently, it got to the point where it wasn't fun or good for me anymore, and it started taxing my mental health really badly. There was a week straight I couldn't sleep because of nightmares, and would break down crying.

So after I made the connection that the project was causing all that stress on me, I decided to pull the plug and sell the project to any other DIY people who can handle it. Yeah, I won't be making any money on it that way, but I thought it was worth it for my mental health.

My mom told me I should suck it up and finish the remodel. I don't want to quote her exactly because then she might recognize the post, but that is the gist of what she said. That I should get over it and get it done anyway.

She said she'd help with the remodel herself to make it easier for me, but she's been saying that for months now, and never has helped, so I frankly don't believe her.

She also doesn't listen to me in a lot of extremely important things (to me.) It bothers me that she texts and drives, I ask her to stop, she ignores me (multiple times.) She wants a hug, I don't want to be touched, she pushes until I relent and let her hug (one time thing.) Stuff like that. I don't have the characters to list more examples.

I also am uncomfortable with how she talks about me to her spouse, which is a guy I've only known for a year. She assumed something a little bad about me, and instead of talking to me, she told her spouse and he got mad. She talked to me after he got mad, starting the conversation with “Spouse is mad that you're deciding that.”

Final example, someone was subtly insulting my art hobby with AI comments (he didn't mean anything by it, he was just clueless,) and she started defending him, knowing exactly what she was saying.

This isn't everything, but it's the most important stuff. I have talked with her a little about some of the issues, and although she apologized, it never changed anything. Which is why I'm asking if I'd be in the wrong to basically tell her to get her shit together and treat me with more respect.

Thanks in advance, I'm willing to answer any questions, maybe give more examples if asked, but at that point, maybe I should just get therapy lol.

Tl;dr My mom might be subtly disrespecting me and I need advice on if I'm reading too much into it or if I need to call her out on it.

"AITA Removing shoes in a public place  So, recently, my very long term doctor's office was absorbed into a trendy physio thingy. They gutted the place, and redesigned it to look all cool and modern. My doctor's clinic got some paint and flooring. The waiting room and front desk for the doctor are adjacent to the physio place, and they share the same flooring material.
The physio place now demands that all people entering the place remove their shoes, or put on the huge felt like slippers over their shoes. They're rediculous looking things that I could easily get both feet in to one, and it would be impossible and dangerous for me to navigate and not fall. I also have back issues, and need help with my shoes, which is the reason I'm seeing my doctor.
My last visit, I politely declined to remove my shoes or to wear the booties. Them asking me to do that in front of strangers embarrassed me, and to be honest, my feeling is to install a flooring material in a public place that requires the removal of shoes is silly. The architect must have realized that was the wrong material, but perhaps it was the new owner of the building.
In any event, does the hive mind think I'm being difficult? I can't decide if I'm out of bounds here. I wonder what your thoughts are on this.",0.36
"AITA for telling a friend to leave an outing after being rude to the group.  Being a little vague since I don't know if the person I am talking about has an account. 

I (27f) had a friend, who we will call ""Adam"" (32m), who is also an ex. We broke up after 1.5 years due to differing expectations of the relationship. It was a hard breakup, but we stayed friends. Everything was fine until I began dating again. 

I started dating ""Abel"" (28m). Abel was aware that I had dated and was still friends with Adam. Once I told Adam about Abel, Adam began acting strange. It began with inappropriate comments on mine and Adam's previous sex life. Then it was comments about how Adam couldn't get hugs anymore because I was dating Abel, and would immediately stop texting if Adam knew I was hanging out with Abel (I never asked Adam to do this). Then Adam demanded that Abel not be in my home while he was there, saying he wasn’t comfortable around Abel. At this point, Adam and Abel had met once, and exchanged pleasantries but no deep conversation. I told Adam that he wasn't able to dictate who was allowed in my home. I asked if Adam would be more comfortable with another person that he knew while around Abel and I. Adam said yes.

Later, I, a mutual friend, and Adam were wanting to go to a local festival. I asked if Abel would be welcome. Both Adam and the mutual friend said yes. At the festival, the mutual friend, Abel, and I arrived together a little late. We waited for Adam at the meeting place after letting him know we had arrived. After ~20 minutes, Adam sulked up to us, greeting the mutual friend and I, but barely acknowledging Abel. We apologized for being late, but Adam rolled his eyes and glowered. We began walking, but Adam wouldn't walk with the group. We made efforts to include Abel in conversation, but he would just shrug. When looking at an art stall, Adam stood far away from the group. I walked over to ask if he was going to look around with us. Adam shrugged. I prompted some more for Adam to join the rest of the group, but all that I received clipped responses. I finally said, without making a scene, that if he wasn't having a good time that maybe he should go home. I then went back to the rest of the group. After telling Adam to go home, he proceeded the follow the group around, glaring and looming over us. He didn't say anything to the group or interact, just followed. 

After the festival, Adam an I had a phone that mostly comprised of him yelling at me. Adam said that he was uncomfortable with Abel being there, even though the mutual friend was there. I asked why he didn't say anything, and Adam said that he doesn't tell people about his emotions, and that I shouldn't have even invited Abel in the first place since Adam was invited first. Adam continued to yell at me until I was sobbing. I asked why he even stayed at the festival, and Adam admitted it was because he wanted Abel and myself to feel uncomfortable.

I don't think that I was in the wrong, but after talking with friends that know us both, I'm not that sure.",0.02
"AITA I didn't put my roomate's spatula in the dishwasher despite cleaning the sink Last Thursday my roomate left the apartment for the weekend and left a dirty rubber spatula in the sink. I don't want to clean other people's dirty dishes so I left it there. It's not a ""I'm grossed out by it"" thing just that I don't want to take care of someone else's dirty dish when the could have spent the same 4 seconds to put it in the dishwasher it would have taken me.

During the weekend I wanted to do a deep clean of the sink so I put the spatula to the side and when I was done I put it back in the sink. When my roomate came back this morning they asked why did I leave it there. We had a 5 minute ""argument"" where I explained my side and they said that they think it's weird I didn't do it and that I'm splitting hairs. Also mentioned that whenever they clean anything in the apartment they're not differentiating who's mess is who's (Neither do I except for the dishes. And as a side note I clean much more than they do).

Spatula is still there.

"AITA for Vitamin Boosting my Mother I'll start with some background. I (18M) live with my mother (36F) in Albany. We have a pretty good relationship, or so I thought until recently. We have one key difference: I'm big on fitness, and my mother is pretty casual about health in general. I am constantly doing cardio, taking supplements, and taking cold showers/plunges. I love to be intense about health past the point of diminishing return. It's my passion, and I go to school for public health at an out of state college that my mother thankfully pays for. I plan to research nutrition science in the future because I love the field so much. I can't help being the way I am. I'm a total health geek!

But I have one especially weird quirk: I like to take my vitamins/supplements in random intervals. Not for any scientific purposes-it's more of a game to me. I'll bake muffins and randomly insert (powdered if necessary) potassium, modafinil, ashwagandha, vitamin D + K2 capsules, THC, etc. in the muffins. Now this sounds weird, but I'm an adult, and I have my interests. I could get into it, but for the sake of brevity, just know that I get an intense amount of pleasure from randomly getting a ""vitamin boost"". I live a very structured life, and this adds variety when I'm spending most of my day studying, exercising, and researching.

Now, here come's the kicker. This summer, I've been living at home in my mom's apartment while assisting virtually with a professor's nutrition science research. I bake a lot, so my mom didn't suspect a thing when some of my batches ended up missing. Our apartment thankfully has a community area with a couple fridges that nobody really uses except for drinks/snacks since each apartment also has a fridge. Hence, I placed my muffins in discreetly and labelled them with my name.

A couple days ago, I was running a quarter marathon to limit test my running ability when my mother came across my ""special muffins"". And...you guessed it: she had four. Afterwards, she had an intense headache and had to miss a couple important meetings for her work as a lead product designer at a startup. Naturally, she was very angry after she gathered her senses together and said that she disapproves of my use of supplements. I had to keep my habits hidden from her since she's a totally teetotaler and also doesn't approve of anything that isn't ""organic"". I respect her dedication, but I love the benefits I get from supplements so much that I literally don't think I can stop. She's given me an ultimatum: she's still willing to fund my college tuition thankfully, but I'll need to fund my (very expensive) rent this upcoming school year if she finds out that I've used supplements again.

"AITA for not allowing my friend to live with me? I (22f) just moved into my parents home over the summer. They moved to our beach house and are “renting” (we pay utilities) the house out to me my sister and her friend. Weve had these plans for a year now and just got settled in. The house has 4 bedrooms and i was told i would get the bottom two to myself. Around last winter my friend (22f) who graduated last semester and lives about 6 hours away mentioned wanting to stay here so i said she could potentially live with us in the spare room. I didnt hear much more about this until she moved back home and shared that she was looking for jobs here. She wasnt hearing back from many, and wasnt really keeping me updated. It had become so long that i assumed it wasnt happening. My parents moved out about 2 months ago, and kept many of their belongings in the spare room and are preferring to keep them there as it is their house and they are essentially still paying for it and plan on returning. Out of the blue my friend says shes coming to stay with me for a job interview here. While here she mentioned moving in multiple times, and i didnt have the heart to tell her that option no longer really existed based on my parent’s stuff, as well as no room for parking and my sister not being her biggest fan which i was not aware of when i offered the room. She was also very rude to me during this stay making snarky remarks about the food i ate or the speed i ate at, which kind of raised a red flag about her living with us.

"AITA: Am I the asshole for opposing to my fiancé on sending menu to our wedding guests? 
I (39F) my fiancé (55M) are getting married in a month. We’ve been in a relationship for 5 years now but mostly on LDR. Into the story.. I’m doing most of the preparation as he is in another country for work and will be there a couple of weeks before the big day. I need to discuss with the caterer about the menu so before meeting with them, we talked about what we want. Now, this is the part where I may be the asshole. He wants to send everyone the menu and let them choose what they want on the day of the event. I told him, there’s no need as in our process, we pick the food from the starters to the desert, the guests will just eat what has been prepared choosing from what already has been prepped. Guests are all my fiends and family members as none from his side will be able to make it, so I know what’s gonna work for them. He kept pushing and discussing and I kept explaining why I don’t want to. It’s an added stress for me to get their orders or request when it’s all gonna be a buffet. I don’t want to add that task on my lap. He funded the wedding, with a little from me here and there so I mostly agree to his requests. That’s what he wants so I would give it to him, I thought. But if I feel like something is too much for me, I would tell him. We discuss stuff but this discussion tonight is taking a toll on me. He said, he’s gonna do it but most guests are offline, he’s in another country, how is he gonna do that? 
To clarify, I’m Asian and Fiancé is British. There’s a cultural differences and I understand he wants to do something western but like I said, if it’s doable, we do it. If it’s not we dont. If it’s doable but it’s not necessary, we don’t if it’s just an added task. ",0.36

"AITA for not checking in on my sister during her first day of high school? My sister (15f) and I (16f) don't have a good relationship and we fight like crazy. I never want to hang out with her and she never wants to hang out with me. This started when we were really young and our parents used to force us on each other. Whenever we were home and doing our own thing they would intervene and force us to play together and they would legitimately stand over us and make sure we were doing something together. Putting us in a room was never enough. My mom told us that her favorite thing about having sisters was having three best friends at home and someone to hang out with always. She only had the two of us and really tried to recreate what she had with her sisters through us.

But we were never into the same things and we resented each other being forced together so much. Dad was the same way but he'd also take us to the park and call us back if we played with other kids and not each other. He'd direct us on what we could and couldn't do if we didn't go along with automatically playing together. It led to us fighting, and screaming at each other. When we were younger and we were sharing a bedroom we used to wake each other up and fight. It only made our parents force us together more. Which made us hate each other more.

Our grandparents would babysit us sometimes and they'd get yelled at for separating us and letting us do our own thing. Or for doing 1:1 stuff with each of us. So grandpa would take me and grandma would take my sister and then they'd swap which granddaughter they had. Eventually, for that very reason, my parents stopped letting them babysit us or have grandparent sleepovers. My parents did eventually stop forcing us together so much after mom's sisters all said they would not have been close like they were if it had to be forced and how my parents probably ruined the chance we did have at naturally growing closer. I was 11 when they finally stopped and that was also when we got our own bedrooms.

My sister has struggled at school for a long time and she also has anxiety. She had to repeat a grade and it made her hate school. She started high school last week and she was anxious. My parents were worried about her. So they dropped her off for the first day and picked her up. When she got home from her first day my parents asked her how it was and whether I checked on her during the day, and she asked why the fuck would I do that and why would she want me to do that and how gross it would be for me to talk to her. My parents confronted me and yelled at me for not being a better sister to her. So last week was shitty with them and they're still pissed about it. My mom told me we're family and we act like we don't care about each other. Of course I can't speak for my sister but I don't care about her and I believe that feeling is mutual. I didn't say that to my mom obviously. But the message was still clear that she and dad are disappointed in me for not checking on her that first day.

"AITA Friendships after children  I am friends with a group of girls from university, there are 4 of us all 30-32.
We lived together and uni and our friendship was very much based on fun and going out and we had so many funny memories and experiences. In our third year, the other three girls got into relationships that became serious quick.

We left uni 10 years ago and have made a real effort to stay in touch despite living an hour apart (I am about 30 mins further and in London so traffic is often an issue). We continued to have a really great friendship with lots of fun experiences and holidays etc.

In the last five years, the other three girls have had five children between them. Since they started having children, all of our meet ups are at our houses and we do the same thing each time - they all bring their children and we bring lunch items to have a buffet sort of thing. I love their children and catching up but it feels like we haven’t created any memories during the last five years. When we try and catch up it’s hard with five children running around. I don’t have any children (am currently actually pregnant which they don’t know yet). They never offer to do anything different and also assume every meet up is for the children too. I just find it so frustrating as I want to do fun adult things. Am I being unreasonable to think that sometimes we should go out for lunch/drinks/catch up without the kids. Additionally to this, we no longer actually celebrate our own friendships - we don’t do gifts, didn’t celebrate our 30ths but the others do gifts for all of the children’s birthdays now instead.

"AITA for telling my girlfriend not to get a specific tattoo because it makes me extremely uncomfortable?  Lets start off by saying I don’t normally care about this kind of stuff. She already has a bunch of tattoos that I quite like, and I knows she wants more, which is awesome. I genuinely love tattoos and how they make people look. My issue is this one certain tattoo. We are two women in a relationship. Already a lot to handle, as I am the first very openly-gay woman in the family. Which is okay, because most of my family is super chill about it. What my lovely partner wants to get, is a “For Her” tattoo on two of her fingers. I’m sure you guys are smart enough to get what that means. Genuinely though, the thought of that makes me super uncomfortable. I love sex just as much as anyone else, but Im not the kind to like it advertised. Im sure my family would also be uncomfortable about it. I understand the want and need to express yourself, but not when it alludes to something sexual that we do together. She’s quite upset about me telling her no, and she says she’s going to do it anyways. I really don’t like that. For the straight women, would you want your boyfriend around your family with a tattoo like that? Have your mom ask what that might mean? Or to have him just advertise that information to anyone? Idk, maybe I am overreacting. I cant really talk to anyone about this because of the subject matter of the tattoo. Plus, its on her fingers which make it infinitely harder to hide.

"AITA for telling my mom I won’t tell her if anything happens to me? 34M. Parents tend to be annoyingly persistent when they think they know what's best for me. I know it comes from a good place but it’s difficult to have conversations with them because if I express a desire to buy/do anything they don't simply listen or give an opinion; they actively push what they want onto me.

For example: I tell dad I'm looking into getting a new car and considered Car A. He'll ask why don't I look into Car B. I explicitly tell him why (e.g. expensive and doesn't suit my lifestyle) but for the next few months he'll ask at least once a week if I've decided on a new car and to look into B again. My mom (who I know isn't into cars) will randomly ask me to look into B. Suddenly “my mom’s friend from her karaoke group whom I've never met"" is suggesting I look into B. Etc.

Last year I hit a breaking point. I was going on a trip and my parents asked if I wanted a new travel bag. I said my current one’s fine. They got a new bag anyways and kept asking me if I wanted a new bag. Apparently ""this new bag will be much better"", even though they've seen my old bag maybe once. After the 4th or 5th time I told them on WhatsApp to stop asking me if I need a new bag, I've repeatedly said I had a perfectly good bag that's less than a year old, it’s only been used a few times, and if I don't think I need a new bag I don't like being asked about it repeatedly.

The night before the trip they asked again. I looked at it and it was smaller than my current bag so I can't even fit everything I want in it. I went on a long rant about how I dislike how much they try to push what they want onto me. That sometimes what they think is right for me isn't what I think is right for myself. When I tell them explicitly why I pick Car A over Car B and they continue to push B it feels like they aren't listening to me or respecting my decisions. When they tell me that the bag they got ""will be better"" than my current bag that they've barely seen it's like they think I don't know how to buy things for myself. They acknowledged this and then said they would try to do better.

Flash forward to a couple days ago. I told the family chat that I found a huge spider in my car that disappeared when I tried to get rid of it so it might still be in the car. It was meant to be a funny story. My mom sends an article on all-natural spider repellents and asked if I wanted her to make one. I said no. The next day I stopped by my parents’ house and before I left my mom insisted I hang this bag of herbs in my car to repel spiders. I told her I didn't want it. After she asked 3 more times, I took it and said something like ""Next time something happens, I'm just not going to tell you"" in Chinese. She said fine and took the bag back and was visibly annoyed.

Was this a harsh reaction? My partner said NTA but my sister said it might have been a bit of an extreme response.",0.2
"AITA for hiding how much I'm (18M) eating from my boyfriend (19M) to make it look like I'm more dedicated to my diet than I am? Howdy! Nice to meet you. I’ve been dating my boyfriend (James) for about a year now, and aside from one thing, it’s been going great. I’d take a bullet for him. But the things is, I’m mildly overweight. It’s just enough that you can’t tell unless you already know or I’m not wearing a shirt, but if you know you can definitely see it. James was super comforting and merciful about it at first, insisting I was handsome as I was, etc. However, I made the mistake of cuddling shirtless with James about two months ago and ever since he’s been weird about my weight.



Just to clarify, I’m not that soft as a person. I work at a barn, I barrel race competitively for money, and I sleep rough. But it feels like that’s what my boyfriend is saying. It doesn’t help that some people can pull of extra weight and look good (Lumberjacks, Sam Gamgee builds) and I’m out here looking like Dorian Gray had one too many feasts.



He’s started making subtle comments and prodding at my stomach while we were cuddling, and I eventually brought it up to rip the bandaid off. He agreed that he wanted me to lose weight and that he’s be more attracted to me if I wasn’t flabby.



So we sat down and talked about what I was eating, plans, etcetera. We settled on a calorie count, and a cardio/running schedule. All well and good, since I was trying to lose weight anyway.



But… I’ve started eating incredibly lightly or not at all in front of him - maybe a small salad a day - and letting him think that’s all I eat while I actually get other food in private. I never let it exceed the 800 calories we agreed to, but there’s still a hell of a lot of difference between what I fess up to eating and what I’m actually eating. He's expressed pride that I'm taking it 'so seriously', but there's like 500 cal between what he thinks I ate and what I ate.



I didn't actually start this on purpose, I was just super uncomfortable that he'd see me eating anything substantial and think I was being gluttonous/lazy. It took me about a week to realize how it looked and run with it.



Also, I don’t like him asking me this much about the cardio. I know, I should do it, but like I said - I’m cosmetically overweight. I am at no risk of health anything. I don’t like being prodded about running constantly, especially when I get home from an otherwise really good workout and I wanted to tell him about it. 



I know I list towards self-pity, especially when things are unpleasant or humiliating. And he’s already kinda sacrificing to be with me because, even lean, I’m not his type. But it still feels rude to “check in” with comment so regularly when he knows I’m already actively dieting. (Then again, I’ve been ‘dieting’ in theory for like ten years without losing much weight, so I see why a few weeks of real progress don’t look like much.)",0.12
"AITA for playing video games after work instead of spending time with my GF Backstory:
To get started my GF (21) and I (20) moved in together late January after long distance for a year due to going to different colleges. We are high school sweethearts and have been together for 4.5 years.

The issue: 
This started about a month ago. I work 10 hour days and don’t get home till about 7PM. My GF has no job for the past 2 months and just got a part time job but hasn’t started yet. 

When I get home I always greet and hug and kiss her when I get home and we talk about our days. After that I’ll go play my game for about 2-3 hours. Then we’ll eat dinner and I’ll watch a movie or a show or something with her. So we end up going to bed around 12am-1am after we watch a couple episodes and a movie or something. 

Last night the issue came to an eruption. She had a friend over from about 6pm-9pm so I played my game while she was over and towards the end around 9pm I got on with a friend to play 1 round of a game that last about 30-45 minutes. She got upset with me because after I got done we ate and watched something like we always do but I had to call it in a little earlier because I had a long day at work. This was like at 11:30

She starts to lose it saying that I never spend time with her anymore or show her attention. I was completely baffled by this because i do spend time with her after work and on my days off we always do whatever she wants to do.

I guess my question is am I the asshole for spending 2/5 of the hours I have to myself after work playing games with myself and friends rather than spending it with her?",0.02
"AITA for not hugging and subsequently getting into a verbal fight with my dad? I (28M) had dinner with father (60M) recently. For some context, my parents are divorced and I live with my mum, he visits once a week. I had dropped out of uni and have been applying to various jobs and courses.   
  
The plan was to have dinner out with his sister, and for all of us to catch up. On the car ride there and back, he asked me what I was doing. I mentioned that I had recently done two things, managed to get an interview for a social marketing part-time job, but it didn't go through, and that my application for a course had been approved. He spent both car rides to the resturant and back berating, questioning and disapproving of everything (""The job you applied for is a scam, they just want cheap labour"" ""Why are you applying for a part-time job, you should be applying for full-time jobs"", etc). It got worse when he realised that I had only gotten the application approved, and not actually gotten into the course itself. During the dinner, he didn't make any of those remarks, cause the last time he did it infront of his siblings, he got called out on it.

So after dinner when he dropped me off, I had spent about 20 mins each way listening to all this negativity. He got out of the car to hug me goodbye, but I wasn't feeling too affectionate towards him so I just turned and walked away. This resulted in him blowing up, yelling at me for disrepcting him, and demanding that we sit down and have a discussion about why I've been acting out towards him, resulting in another hour of trying to explain my point of view while he kept on goin on about how I've disrespected him.

I know I fucked up by yelling back at him but it was the straw that broke the back after a 1000 cuts. I tried explaining to him that I appreciate his advice and all that he's done for me, I just didn't like the way he's been saying it my entire life, but he took it as me not respecting him at all. At this point I'm tired of having to deal with him cause every dinner alone is the same song and dance of him being disapproving of my life even though I'm trying to get my shit together. He left saying that he's dissapointed in me and the answers I gave him during the fight, and I've also been feling guilty for some of the stuff that I said,",0.11
"AITA for potentially moving after my elderly parents bought a home near us two years ago? My family is originally from the East Coast. After having kids me and partner decided to move to AZ. We ended up buying our first home and a year later my parents (70 & 73) ended up buying a home nearby where they are now snowbirds. 

After living here for almost 5 years and having another child we have realized we just don’t want to raise our children here as the summers are brutal. 

Now we are in a situation where if we do sell and move it’s now going to impact my elderly parents whom moved here to be near us. It’s also a unique situation as my other siblings live far and in various states that this will leave my parents alone which also makes me feel like AITA.

"AITA for asking my friend for gas money? Ok so for some context I’m 25F and my friend “Dave” is 38M & totally platonic situation so don’t be weird in the comments please.

A couple months ago Dave and I got into an argument about a couple things one of them being I feel taken advantage of because I’m being expected to give rides all the time but he says I smoke all his weed. I definitely disagree with him saying that because whenever I do give him rides he’ll smoke me a bowl or offer me a dab & outside of that I only really smoke their reclaim so I’m not taking all their stuff. Well after that Argument I didn’t talk to Dave for a couple months until my bf decided our friendship was too important and brought Dave to the house & said we had to talk it out and be friends again.

I won’t lie I’m definitely still very frustrated because even when we did talk it out he kept doubling down on everything he said before I had to just cut him off and say I’m not here to fight more and told him to stop trying to pick a fight with me. 

So now here’s where the gas became a problem last night. We had an event that I had been planning on going to alone when it was scheduled in the time me and Dave were not talking and as soon as we started talking again he starts saying things like “so we’re going to that event right?” And I know that means he’s expecting me to pick him up. I live 5 mins from our downtown area and he lives, not fully across town, but far enough that I have to go a ways out of my way to pick him up. I did have a family event to go to with my bf before the other event that Dave wanted to go to so I told Dave he needed to Uber there and then we could talk about the ride situation. When I got to the event I talked to Dave and said everything about how he needs to give me gas money & weed doesn’t count anymore because he just throws it in my face when he’s mad so I told him he either needed to give me gas money or call another Uber home and he said he’d give me gas money. 

It’s the next morning he never gave me gas money, he gave me one dab when I dropped him off, and when I texted him asking for gas money and even spelled out how much extra gas I use to include him in things he hasn’t replied so I’m thinking I’m not getting any. 

Side note: I did look up the miles to see how much extra I use and from my place to the event is 3 miles but I added an extra 20 miles just one way. ",0.5
"AITA for not getting dressed while someone was washing my clothes? Okay so this is a little ridiculous. Sounds like something out of a sitcom but before I tell it to other people I want to make sure I'm not going to come across as some asshole lmao.

So I (24m) have a good friend named ""Jared"" (24m). It is his birthday and me and his roommate ""Lexi"" (25f) decided to team up and throw him a surprise party. His other friends kept him occupied while I went over a few hours early to help Lexi set up. 

While we were setting up I managed to spill an entire thing of salsa over myself because I'm an idiot. Lexi said we had plenty of time before the party and she could just wash my clothes for me and get it out before it settled. She turned around and told me to toss her her clothes.

I gave them to her, she didn't turn around, and I was just left in the kitchen in a tank top undershirt and my underwear while she washed them. Felt kinda embarrassed but don't know what to do. Ngl it was like 5-10 minutes before she came up (laundry is downstairs). She's confused why I don't have clothes on and I say because she washed them. She said I should have gone into Jared's room and borrowed some shorts. That did occur to me, but I had figured going through someone's clothes without their permission was weirder than not getting dressed. I had planned on just staying like that until either a.) she told me what to do or b.) my clothes were ready. She called me a creep and said she has a boyfriend and I told her that I wasn't trying to hit on her but she made me leave, didn't even give me clothes. I had to wait outside in my underwear while my friend picked me up.

I missed the party. I explained to Jared what happened and he thought Lexi was out of line. However, my gf and Jared's gf both believe I was an asshole.",0.13
"AITA for walking out on dinners? I'm just sat upstairs in tears, which is probably a complete overreaction! I always try to prepare nice meals for my partner and our two daughters. Meat, fish, two vegetables and potatoes etc. There are times when I put a ready made pizza in the oven or make ready made tortellini, but they are proper meals.

Last night I asked my partner if he could cook, as I usually cook seven days a week, I fancied a break. He cooked spaghetti and tinned tomatoes, that was it. No salt and pepper, no herbs! I ate the meal and went upstairs, as I was pretty annoyed. 

Tonight I asked if he could cook again, I thought surely he'd cook something more substantial. Nope, he did pasta again, but with mayonnaise, tuna and sweetcorn. But he did add herbs, pushing the boat out there! Although he asked where they were, we had our kitchen installed a year ago! He gave our daughters ravioli from a tin, that's it. They are three and one, so they need vegetables, which they haven't had two days in a row. 

I said, I'm not eating this and walked off. He said the meal is actually a proper meal. I'm thinking, probably for a student on a budget! 

I'm not a highly fussy eater and I would have eaten tonight's dinner, but it's more the principal of the situation. It's just lazy and it feels like he really doesn't care about us. ",0.79
"AITA for Making a Big Deal of my Boyfriend Lying by Omission?  So the backstory, a woman made a comment about our relationship that I didn't like, I was upset about it and boyfriend said I was unreasonable and she didn't mean it that way. Defended the woman and didn't seem to try to understand my point of view.
That hurt my feelings and set the stage that he took her side but that's not the main issue.
Then she hears that this upset me because my boyfriend told one of our friends and it got back to her. She texted me and asked if I would call her so she could defend herself and apologize, I didn't want to call her as that gave me huge anxiety. I texted my boyfriend that she wants me to call and he said ""yes she asked me to call her as well"". I also called him after the text and wondered how she knew and told him I didn't want to, we talked a bit and he never mentioned anything about having already talked to her. Anyway after I work up the nerve I call her and downplay the situation as I don't want to talk to her, not all that close with her and was not comfortable. Then I find out after that my boyfriend had called her already at the point of him saying ""yes she asked me to call her as well"" but he never told me that he actually did call her and talk to her about me and my relationship.
I feel betrayed that he didn't tell me he talked to her, likely told her I was upset and whatever, then I talked to her and told her I wasn't and it's fine. So then I look stupid. I wish he would've told me he talked to her and what they talked about, as it's about me and my relationship with him. I already felt like he wasn't supporting me or being loyal to me in the situation before but then to omit this seems to deepen the betrayal I felt.
Am I wrong? Is this not a big deal? It's not that he was saying anything wrong on the phone, he was trying to diffuse situation but I still feel lied to. ",0.96
"WIBTA for asking my boyfriend not to come home drunk from work? I (21F) live with my boyfriend (24M). On the weekends, he is a bouncer at a nightclub so he gets home around 4-7am depending on the night. If he doesn’t drink, he gets home around 4-5am. But if he decides to stay and have a few beers with his coworkers/friends, he gets home around 6-7am. 

This was fine when my work shift was 3-11PM because I was usually up pretty late anyways, and slept in till 1-2PM. However, I now work 8-6PM which means when he comes home from the bar, I am just waking up and getting my day started. 

Yesterday, he came home drunk and was being obnoxious and loud. He was also trying to have sex and I repeatedly told him I had to get ready for work. This whole situation irritated me because I was exhausted and trying to get ready/not be late and had to deal with him. 

All day I was thinking about asking him to not come home drunk anymore, or at least not behave that way because it was just a lot to handle right before work at 7am. But then I thought it would come across as controlling. I want him to have fun with his friends and I don’t want to patrol his drinking, but if this becomes a regular occurrence it will just build resentment on my end. 

So, WIBTA if I asked him not to come home so drunk anymore because of my new schedule?",0.25
"AITA for telling my sister I don't care that her house is bigger and cheaper than mine? Edit 2: Just wanted to clear some things up. I got such a good deal because a friend of my aunt had to go into assisted living. She wanted to sell it ASAP, I was able to pay in cash, and she gave me a good deal because she knew I was looking and that I'd take great care of it. I'm also in a ""shady"" (according to tech bros who never leave the north side) area. Also, somebody mentioned that I shouldn't look down on my hometown. I will and I'm not sorry for it. I faced a lot of discrimination, and I had to leave because a group of people made it their mission to harass me because they didn't like the way I was born.

Edit: Thank you everybody for your replies. Maybe half an hour after posting this, I tripped on some uneven sidewalk and broke my phone. I had to get it replaced (thank goodness for iCloud) and the cashier just gave me really bad anxiety. Just know that I appreciate all the comments even if I can’t respond right now.

My sister (24F) and I (26M) grew up in a small town that I pretty much got chased out of. I ended up a couple hours away in Chicago. I absolutely love it here. There's things open after 7 PM, I can walk and take transit everywhere, and there's actual jobs for disabled people like me.

A few months ago, I bought a house in the middle of my lease. It's an 800 sqft bungalow in a lovely neighborhood that didn't need any work at all. It cost $220,000. For comparison, my sister bought a 20-year-old 2,400 sqft house for $170,000 last year. In our hometown, my house would go for maybe $80,000. She's not in a bad area or anything - it just has nothing to offer young people who haven't lived there for several generations.

My sister came over yesterday to see the house for the first time, which was an event in itself because she's scared of Chicago. She liked the photos and called it a ""good starter home"" (I plan to live here forever), but was pretty disappointed when she actually got to look around. She claimed it was barely bigger than a studio apartment. She asked how much I paid, I told her, and she said, ""Um, I literally paid $50,000 less for something much newer, prettier, and 3 times the size."" I went, ""Okay? Congrats, but I don't care. I'd rather buy somewhere I actually want to live even if it costs more."" She accused me of being condescending, and said that I shouldn't act like I'm too good for our hometown. I told her I wanted to move past this, and offered to walk with her to the KFC a couple blocks away. She said she'd rather go home, and that I should reimburse her for gas since she drove ""all the way out"" (2 hours) to see me, only for her to ""have to leave"" after half an hour because of my ""attitude"". I told her I wouldn't be doing that and that she chose to leave, and she went, ""You've turned into a complete jerk ever since you moved here."" I told her to leave, and she left.

I'm not sure who's TA here because we aren't the type to involve family in our arguments. But she's telling her friends who are apparently saying I'm a jerk who just wanted to humiliate a woman.",0.13

Me and my fiance had discussed later about how much I should charge him and everything. Well it comes around time for him to get the tattoo. And he decided that he would rather have the tattoo than the bb. So he let my fiance know he wasn't going to get it. That he would be getting the tattoo. Well since then my fiance has been making comments about how its messed up that he backed out. And it made him mad. That's ok. I get that. But now he's mad at me because no one has tried to make it right with him. Because he didn't get that money. He is expecting  me to make it right. And I'm assuming give him part of the money I made from doing the tattoo. Because he feels he got back doored out of the money from the bb. Even tho. He was with us when we discussed it. And I don't see how it's my problem that our buddy backed out. I don't feel like I should be financially responsible for paying him out of what I worked for. Am I the asshole?,0.13
"AITA for keeping my half brother from visiting our father's grave/vault My (40F) father (76) passed away over two years ago. I suspected he had a second family so was emotionally prepared when a woman (\~50yo) arrived at the wake with her children “Art” (then 23M) and “Kate” (11F). She was a former secretary at my dad’s work and her two children were my half siblings. When  security  tried to make them leave, the woman demanded that they had the right to be there, especially Art, who she called the “*unico hijo*” and “the most important person” there. 



My mother (70) and her sister (F72) were shocked, and those words hit my mom really hard



Unlike his mother, Art was thoughtful.  He understood when I said I needed to prioritize my mom's physical and mental health, and he got his family to leave, which I appreciated. The next day, I took my mom away for a few hours so they could go to the wake.  Mom knew what was going on, of course, and was plenty mad at me. I was stressing about another confrontation at the funeral, so was relieved when Art texted that “out of respect for (my) mother” they would keep away. He asked to visit the columbarium later and I said of course, whenever he wanted



Fast forward 2 years. Art and I both work abroad. We communicated during the distribution of my dad’s estate (money/shares, no property since our house/land are all mom’s family). We were efficient and civil, and  we haven’t talked in over a year. No acrimony, just no longer any need



So I was surprised to get an angry message from Art a few days ago. He was back home, went to the columbary vault, and learned that my mom moved my father’s urn. I called mom and learned that she and her sister had a chapel built on their private land way outside the city. There is a vault with my dad’s urn, and mom said it would eventually house her urn too. I asked if there was any way Art could visit the chapel and she exploded. She is still angry about the *unico hijo* comment and  accusations Art’s mom made during the distribution of dad’s assets.  My mom said Art’s family got too entitled because of me. And that if I kept insisting, I was going to give her a heart attack. My aunt added it was time for me to think of my mom first 



I told Art that I would no longer press my mother about this and for the first time, he blew up at me too. We screamed awful things at each other during the phone call. Now that I’ve calmed down, I can see his side. But if I weigh this against causing my mom any more pain, I’ll choose my mom every time. Art said that after everything he did to be considerate, how could I not even let him visit his father’s resting place. He said  that I’m finally showing my true self, and I’m just like my mom. 



I feel like any action I decide, I would be end up being TA to someone, so I choose to prioritize my mom.  AITA?",0.5

"AITA for not pushing to have a relationship with my nephew? Some backstory on my sister and I’s relationship. We have never been super close just because we are very different people. Normally that wouldn’t bother me but she is also a negative and close minded person. I like to think that I’m an open person. I’m not against opposing ideas, just the unwillingness to let others have their own opinions. So, even prior to my sister having a baby, we didn’t spend much time together but we would talk every now and then. 

Well, my  sister had her baby almost a year ago now, the first baby in our family. We both live in the same State, about 40 minutes from each other. I can count on one hand how many times my sister has invited me to spend time with my nephew or even to hold him, 2 times. This is only when my brother is in town on leave. When we were growing up, we had really close relationships with our extended family because my parents made it possible for us to be around them and visit with them often.

I started thinking recently about the situation and how I have a closer relationship to my friends new baby than to my own nephew. I feel guilt for not being being around or really putting in any effort to see him.

"AITA for telling my mom that I am irritated with her cause she always blamed my 9 year old ASD son for all the things that got broken in our own home? I (40F) got mad with my (67F) mom because she always tells me and my (41M) husband that my ASD son broke this and broke that. I told her that she always blamed my son for all, even the simple things that happened in our own house. My husband and I are OFW and since we cannot afford to let him study in our current residence because all schools and therapy centers are expensive and it is not easy to be accepted with his special condition, So we let him stay with my Mom and 2 brothers in our home country. All of them are staying in our house. We are the one who pays all their bills and provides food since my 2 brothers doesn't have work. Whatever their needs, we are giving them since they are the ones who are taking care of our son. I told my mom that I am annoyed and pissed off with her because she always blamed my son.

"AITA for conforting my wife about not telling her coworkers we are married and live together? Hello everyone,

I’m a 26M, and my wife is 25F. We recently moved to Germany together, though she arrived a bit earlier than I did. Lately, I've started to suspect that she's hiding the fact that we're married from her coworkers. She's a nurse, and there's this older female coworker of hers that she talks to often about life in general. She tells my wife everything she does talks about her damily her single son etc. My wife basically knows a lot about her. My wife told me that she only mentioned to this coworker that she has a boyfriend, not a husband. 

There was one particular incident that stood out to me: we were walking together one day when she asked me to cross the street because she didn’t want this coworker to see us together. She said it was because the coworker didn’t know that I had moved to Germany with her. I found that strange, and disrespectful to me but I know my wife tends to keep certain things to herself so I let it go.

However, today things escalated. That same coworker informed my wife about an available apartment for rent. When my wife told me about it, she said she planned to go check it out alone because she still hadn’t told the coworker that I was living with her. At that point, I got angry but tried to stay calm and hide it. I suggested that she could just tell her coworker that I had just moved to Germany and that we would check out the apartment together as this was the perfect moment to tell her that. This made my wife defensive, she got angry and we ended up having a huge fight where we even talked about breaking up.

I doubt if anyone at her workplace knows we're married. They probably think she is single, I’m not sure what to think of this situation, and it’s causing me a lot of confusion and frustration. I can’t make sense of this. She tends to keep things to herself, but this feels like more than just being private. I asked her to tell me the reason why she doesn’t want to tell her that we are married and she didn’t answer.
AITA for being upset that my wife hides the fact that we are married from her coworkers? Why would she still be keeping this a secret? I’m struggling to make sense of it all.

I would appreciate your advices.

"AITA because I am intentionally not letting my neighbour in, causing her and her dog to sit outside in the dark? I live in an apartment block - to access the property after 8pm you must carry your front door key with you, we were all told this prior to moving in. A tenant has moved in downstairs and she leaves the back door unlocked to allow herself to come and go without taking her key. She isn't supposed to do this, and she has been told multiple times to take her front door key in case the door locks which she has ignored.

She has started treating me like a literal doorman - knocking loudly on my windows and repeatedly buzzing my apartment to try to get me to open the door for her. It is daily and it riles up my dog every time - and it always occurs after 9pm. I have let her in twice in good faith, then told her the third time to take her key and that I will no longer be answering.

She decided to go out with her dog this evening and again didn't bother to take her key, when she started buzzing and knocking on my windows loudly. I shut off my buzzer, gave my dog a treat and closed the doors, deciding to ignore her and continue watching my movie instead. 

This is where I could be TA, it's dark out at the moment, late and she's outside by herself with her dog, shes been out there for about 45 minutes, we also live in a shady area - not *dangerous* but definitely not pleasant at night. She has been sat outside on the doorstep on her phone angrily ranting about me to her friends - like I'm her DAD. I don't know this woman aside from her treating me like a concierge. AITA?

Edit for update: I opened the door. I said I wouldn't, but quite frankly, I literally couldn't go to sleep knowing she and her dog were out there. I went downstairs and opened the door and told her that this was the last time and I will be reporting to management and calling the police if she knocks on my windows anymore. I'm gonna just hope that a few hours outside has got the message across - sorry for everyone who told me not to give in, but it's nearing midnight here and as much as she pisses me off I'm not about to leave her out there.

"WIBTA for leaving my roommate mid-lease? I (21M) signed a lease with my roommate (19M) who is a friend of mine last March, shortly after my boyfriend (21M) joined on the lease. Our lease is for a year long. While there are few small things with my roommate overall it has been good living with all of us together. 

Our main concern is safety at this point. Someone had broken our window a month in (which I was not involved in, our window is the only way to access the apartment because our door is deadlocked). The mother of the guy who broke our window knocks on our door often. Which would be fine if her behavior wasn’t weird. Recently someone was screaming and tugging on our door. There are small things that my boyfriend and I would like to change but they are all things we could live with until March. 

We were recently offered an apartment by my boyfriend’s family, as they hold a share in the apartment. It is a good price for being downtown and offers solutions to most things we wanted to change. It would improve our quality of life by a great amount. The main thing being that it is a quiet apartment with secured access. Another big factor to this is that I would like to be close to my boyfriend’s grandma since she is going through chemotherapy soon. We have built a bond and I want to be there for her easily. 

My roommate mentioned recently that if we don’t want to stay past our lease he has people in mind who could move in with him. He also does not seem to mind the apartment regardless of what has happened. If we accept the offer he would get about 4-5 months to find another roommate. The main thing I feel bad about is his rent would increase to what it initially was because it would be two people, not three. My boyfriend’s mom periodically supports us as well. As in buying toilet paper, paper towels, soap, a ring camera, pots & pans, supplying most of our streaming services, you get the idea. So if we leave he’d lose those benefits as well. WIBTA?",0.75
"AITA for not disclosing what my best friend said in a voice message while my girlfriend was listening in This reads like a teenage couple problem but oh well lol. 

So I was in a call with my girlfriend while using my PC at the same time. I had Instagram open and got a voice message from my bestfriend (they know about each other but aren't friends) about our plan to go to the beach tomorrow. I made the mistake of playing the voice memo on speaker while on the call, thinking it was just about where to meet/what time. Lo and behold, he was telling me why he couldn't come and the reason was embarrassing (something to do with underwear). She heard half of the vm before I cut it off and laughed out of second hand embarrassment. She immediately started asking me ""what's that about underwear"" and I said ""hold up, this is embarrassing for him, I'll mute you for a second and hear the rest"".

After that, she repeatedly asked me what he said and, at first I refused thinking she'd drop it by understanding it's embarrassing for her to know something he said to me that he prefaced was embarrassing. But she didn't, and got increasingly pissed that I was refusing to divulge something ""so stupid"". 

She then started saying the fact I was so adamant on not letting her know was a red flag and that she shouldn't tell me anything as a result... basically things got ridiculous over this small thing, and I was wondering if I'm in the wrong here. My thinking is if I was in a call with him and she sent me a private message that I mistakenly played in front of him, I wouldn't want to let him know what she said. But she thinks it's apples & oranges and that she is my girlfriend so it's not the same.

"AITA for throwing out perfectly good milk out of spite? I (30 F) really like good milk. Given the inflation and prices, they usually sell around $6-9/half gallon. I'm talking, usually along the lines of organic, grassfed. Particular brand I like is horizon (simply for the taste). It's rich and creamy so it's great on its own or in mixed drinks (ie. matcha lattes).

My husband (33M) does majority of the cooking so he does majority of the shopping. He knows exactly which kind I like but he frequently buys ""good"" milk that's ""on sale"". However, usually the flavor is off or it's on sale for a reason (ie. Only have 3-4 days before sell by/expiration). Everytime he buys a different brand because it was ""on sale"", I simply did not like it. I've told him multiple times now.

So it happened for maybe the 10th plus time now and I see it's not my horizon organic grassfed whole milk. And I got so annoyed, I took out the entire gallon, in front of him, and poured it down the drain and told him the 2$ he thought he saved was actually 5$ wasted because now I've dumped it all. Then I got in my car and drove to the store and bought my milk.

(I'm the only one who drinks milk).

He said I overreacted and was being an AH when he was just trying to save us a few bucks.

"AITA for throwing away unhealthy food?  My parents have the mindset that you can't even eat junk food and need to restrict heavily. Look at a cookie and gain 10 pounds. This lead to me binging, hiding bad food, and more. It's helped me become obese. Now I'm trying to fix my relationship with food. That you can practice moderation and no food is bad. 

Onto the situation....
My mom saw this new brand of ranch I wanted to try and told me it had too much fat. She also saw a microwaveable ramen that has been sitting in the pantry and said was processed and unhealthy (we might use this for camping or something, and it lasts a while). Last week she got mad that I brought home some Cheetos from a party (a one off thing). I threw the Cheetos out after we had a fight about it. Today I tossed the ranch because of what she said, because I want her off my back, because I want to make her happy, because I probably won't hear the end of it unless it's gone, and out of negative emotions like spite. I thought she'd be happy about her win, but she is not. She mad at me because she didn't specifically tell me to throw it out. Now she says she won't help me lose weight. My dad is upset I threw out good food. I tried to talk to her and explain my feelings, but she's mad. 

I see two choices, either we eat it or we toss it. And don't buy it again for fear of consequences. It's not going to disappear like a magic trick. 

Was I wrong to throw away the food? Maybe I overreacted? Maybe I could have brushed her off and just let her lecture. Maybe this is her way of communicating to check labels and she's just not good at it.

"AITA for lying about serious illness? I’ll try to be quick here.

Preface: I (26m) broke my back as a teen which caused some mild lifelong consequences, it’s nothing visible if u don’t know where to look, but in a nutshell I can’t do a lot of stuff like heavy lifting and so on. By no means it’s a mystery of the century or smth but I don’t like talking about it bc it usually means hearing some unsolicited medical advice.

Anyways I was at work and my coworker (lady in her 50s) had to move a heavy box, she asked me for help and I said no sorry I can’t I’ve got some issues with my back. She asked what kind of and I said just issues hoping she’ll get the hint and fuck off. She didn’t and continued on asking even after I said I don’t wanna talk about that. I was already pissed and I said I have SMA. Dk why exactly I said it just picked a random disease that has to do with the spine off the top of my head. For the record my back issues are nowhere the same level of severity as ppl with sma have so she could’ve caught my bs easily and finally get the hint that I’m not sharing my private medical history with her.

Turns out she spread the gossip that I have sma around the workplace and it reached my boss, my boss called me in and asked why I haven’t told him abt my disease, I said it’s not a disease and explained my predicament as long with the situation with the nosy lady. He had us be called to hr department where they talked to her about why you shouldn’t spread gossips at the workplace and told me that I shouldn’t spread lies about my health also.

Now she’s pissed at me saying that I embarrassed her on purpose and that I shouldn’t have lied. I think I’m not the ahole because she caused it upon herself. The boss thinks we’re both at fault so idk I just want to hear some unblased opinions.",0.63
"AITA for leaving the house during my husband’s bday weekend because our A/C is out? Friday night my husband noticed the A/C was dripping and it ruined the filter. Internet says it’s not safe to run the AC without a filter for more than like 6-8 hours. We were traveling this weekend so we turned it off for the weekend and just got back at around 4:30pm.

He mentions not turning on the AC until tomorrow and I look at him stunned. It is 79 degrees in the house. Not to mention, I’m sick as a dog and just wanted to go home and lay down but there’s no way I could in our house. The air is dry and stuffy and hot asf. 

He went to Home Depot and Lowe’s Friday night to look for the filter size we need but neither had it. He ordered it but won’t be here until “Monday by 10pm”. Of course this week is supposed to be so fucking hot too.

Anyway, I put my crap from the trip away, quickly ate leftovers for dinner, then told him I’m heading to a book store to hang out for a while because I don’t want to hang out here. He said “fair enough”, in regards to the heat.

He asked when I’d be back, and I asked “when’s the AC being turned back on”. He gave me an annoyed look and said he planned to put it on for the evening and then turn it off before we go to sleep to give the house time to cool down but then the night time won’t be so hot. So basically by like 9pm it’ll be cooler but then it’ll have to be off again. I told him multiple times he’s welcome to come with me/meet me at the book store. 


AITA? He wanted to hang out and play video games together. Today isn’t his actual birthday, that’s early this week but we celebrated with family this weekend. But the house is miserable and I’m sick as hell and couldn’t handle a super hot house on top of that.

AC is out until at least Monday. Celebrated husband’s birthday this weekend but the AC is out so after getting home, I told him I’m hanging out elsewhere until it can cool down. ",0.96
"AITA for yelling at my partner for borrowing my clothes without asking? 
For perspective while my partner generally identifies with their birth sex they sometimes feel more feminine or like a girl and will prefer feminine clothes and pronouns etc.

My (19F) partner ""Zane"" (19) and I are both from the same small town. They're not out to their conservative family and so spent a lot of time around mine. Since they're pretty small/scrawny for a boy we're about the same size when it comes to women's clothing and I'd share my clothes with them sometimes when they were in the mood.

We moved away to the same college in NY and the clothes sharing continued because even though were in a way more liberal place now they're still afraid to buy more girly stuff because they're parents still watch their accounts. The problem is there pretty messy and anytime we go out and their in a more feminine mood they get stuff on my clothes and so I only let them borrow certain stuff. Lately they've been kinda just taking stuff without asking. I let it go for a bit because I know they're afraid to buy stuff buttttt yesterday they wasted hot sauce all over one of my favorite blouses.

I admittedly lost it and yelled at them about how they always do this and I hate them borrowing my clothes. They kept apologizing and telling them theyedd get it cleaned. I was still angry and I told to not touch anything of mine without asking again and theyve been kinda closed off since. AITA?",0.7
"AITA for tryingto adopt my neighbor’s cat 
All summer the cutest little tortie cat has been making the rounds in my neighborhood-like literal rounds…she has a certain route that she walks every day. I work from home and see her out the window. For the past two weeks I have been going outside to try to make friends with her. She is extremely skinny, has very matted fur and appears to have a respiratory infection-so much so that when she meows snot bubbles come out of her nose. She is the cutest sweetest cat and I was worried about her and the state that she was in. I started feeding her in the hopes that she would start hanging around my house and maybe stay on my porch and I could take care of her. I posted on my local neighborhood group on Facebook to see if she belonged to anyone and she did. It turns out the cat belongs to a neighbor just a block away. The neighbor said the cat was home safe and that if I ever saw the cat again to let her know. I was relieved thinking the cat had just run away and was safe now but also thought it was odd that the person wanted me to keep watching for her cat. Anyway 2 days later I see the cat again…looking as rough and sick as ever. Am I the asshole for wanting to adopt this cat even though she has an owner? I feel like this poor cat deserves better.

"AITA for grounding both of my kids? I'm a single dad to both of my kids(16F, 11M). Their mom passed away 7 years ago. They used to get along fine, but now it's like every day is some huge argument.

Yesterday, I went out to run some errands, I came home to a screaming match. My daughter explained that she was walking down the hallway, glanced in my son's room, and told him to pick up the dirty clothes all over his room. With him, the room gets picked up, but it's always a battle to get him to do it, but eventually he gets to it.

He told her he didn't want to, she told him he had to and gave him, "" I'm older, dad's not here you'll do as I say"" reasoning.

My son was angry that his sister was the one that got to explain the story. I asked him to give his side, he was about to when she told him not to be a "" lying mfer(except she used the full word). He told her to stop being a controlling b-word( he also used the full word).

I grounded them both, told them I was not going to put up with that language. My daughter got angry and felt like she was punished for asking him to be tidy. My son was mad because he felt like his sister was being bossy.

Just a little background. His sister is married to his daughter’s grandfather. So when there’s a family dinner or cookout his daughter’s mother is there. That’s one thing. Then His mother doesn’t like me and her only reason atp is because she doesn’t know me and she's never tried.

"AITA for telling my intern to please leave me alone throwaway bc my situationship follows my main and I don't really want him reading this

I (22M) used to work at this really shitty corporate company. When I was there, I had an intern under me who idolized me as a mentor figure. Mind you I did not want him to do that. Anyways, I ended up leaving the company for personal reasons and later joined a small agency. Surprise, I ended up with a part-time intern (18M) AGAIN (idk why or how this keeps happening). Intern #2 is a ray of sunshine and I actually care about his well being (as compared to intern #1, who I low-key hate). I was out for coffee with my new team and ran into intern #1.

Here's where I may have been the asshole. I was in a really bad place mentally at my old job and intern #1 acted like a child 90% of the time, so I wasn't super nice to him. Tbf it was literally NOT MY PROBLEM that he couldn't do his job. As his supervisor, I was responsible for correcting his mistakes but it got really annoying really fast w how incompetent he was. I may have yelled at him a few times because of it, but I didn't say anything that wasn't true. (Let me emphasize again that intern #2 is not only capable of understanding if he's made a mistake but actually capable of improving, something intern #1 clearly lacks.)

Anyways intern #1 and intern #2 stared at each other and it became clear intern #1 was pissy that I'd taken on a new intern (again, I literally left the old company, I don't know why he's mad). When he asked me, I said intern #2 was superior to him in every way imaginable (I really just wanted him to leave me alone). Intern #1 was NOT happy to hear that and I think the two have been arguing on social media for the last few days. (I've looked over intern #2's shoulder at his desk a few times and he tried to hide his screen BUT I did manage to catch a glance at their discussion and it seems pretty extreme for something that started for no reason. Incredibly confident that intern #1 started it just to be a jerk. I don't know why he can't move on when I was very clear about wanting nothing to do with him, and we had no real relationship of any kind.)

"AITA for being frustrated with my mom?  A little backstory… 
My mom was a teacher in the 90s. When she got pregnant with me in 2001, she quit & didn’t return to work until 2013. I spent roughly 10 years of my life with a stay-at-home mom & I’m very grateful for that. 
In 2013, my mom got a job at a private school. My younger sister & I were enrolled there & life was hell. I was constantly bullied & my mom became non-existent. She refused to cook dinner, go to our sports games, help us with studying, refused to buy us clothes, refused to do A LOT of stuff for us. She became quite literally non-existent in my sister & I’s life. I even take partial responsibility for raising my sister, quite honestly. 
I even remember being violently sick one day during school & she made me stay in the back of her car for 4 hours because she refused to take me home or call anyone to pick me up. She put EVERYTHING into her job. She would spend 12+ hours at school working & would continue working at home too. It was ridiculous and quite honestly, unnecessary. 
I understand things could have been A LOT worse, but having a mom’s full attention to having nothing is emotionally and mentally hard, especially when you’re being bullied. 
Let me also add that my dad was very successful in his job and my mom did NOT need her crap teacher salary to keep the household afloat, but if she considered quitting he would claim they would be financially suffering if she did, so I definitely know she had issues of her own. 

Anyway… fast forward to Covid, she quit teaching. My dad is much older than her & was forced to retire years ago. They are both now not working. I am now 22, have a boyfriend & I’m self-employed full-time. I also used to be in school full-time but graduated in May. My plate is full, but I’m most content when I am staying busy & don’t like to be cooped up in the house because it makes me depressed.

Here’s where I may be the asshole… 
My mom will beg me to not go to work or to my boyfriend’s house so I can “spend time with her” (sit around & stare at our phones). If I’m downstairs having a conversation with my mom (I live at home still- can’t afford to move out) & tell her I’m going upstairs, she frowns and begs me to stay and talk with her. If I’m leaving for work early in the morning, she’ll ask why I have to leave her. If I leave the house in the afternoon to work or spend time with my boyfriend, she tells me she’ll miss me so much and can’t wait until I come home.

I don’t mind spending time with my parents. I do love them, but I’m a people pleaser and the remarks they make are so frustrating to me. I want to look my mother in the eyes and tell her she wasted away my childhood & should’ve spent time when I needed her most, but of course I would never dare to say that. 
So AITA for being upset over these comments of feeling like I need to be their source of all happiness??

"AITA for breaking my boyfriend’s trust? I (17F) and my boyfriend (18M) have been dating for almost a year. Recently we have gotten into our most serious argument yet, after he found out I lied to him about who I was calling.

For context, my boyfriend and I work at the same establishment because of connections with management. I work as a host with two other coworkers who happen to be guys around my age (17M). My boyfriend works in the back, working independently most of the time. Around a month ago, we got into an argument because he thought I was being too friendly with my coworkers. I genuinely think I am a very friendly person, I’m not flirtatious nor touchy, but I do like treating people the way I’d like to be treated. I love complimenting others and smiling, which is the main reason I was put at the front. Anyway, my boyfriend saw my coworker throwing a napkin at me playfully and the other taking pictures on my phone. My boyfriend thinks I gave them the confidence to play around playfully with me, therefore, I’m being too friendly. He says joking around/talking about unrelated work topics are too friendly. At the end of the argument, he apologized and said he should trust me more while I agreed to tone down the jokes and conversations I have with the coworkers. 

Fast forward to Sunday, I was super tired from working three days in a row and was kinda portraying it through my attitude. I told my boyfriend I was tired and went to the front to work. In the morning, I decided to play a prank on my assistant manager (16M, who I think my boyfriend is okay with me being friendly because he’s gay) and call the establishment pretending I was a customer. However, one of the other hosts I work with answered instead. Knowing he picked up, I went ahead with the prank. When my boyfriend saw me on the phone laughing and asked who I was calling, I lied and said I pranked our assistant manager whom has pranked me twice before. We then took a break outside with the assistant manager. My boyfriend asked him if he liked the prank, but he didn’t respond. I then quickly decided to change the subject. I know it’s unjustifiable, but I felt immense guilt after I lied to him. My conscience repeated that it’s better to tell him now than never, yet I decided not to, afraid he’d get upset at me.

On Wednesday, my boyfriend talked to the assistant manager, who revealed I didn’t prank him, but pranked the other host instead. Ever since then, my boyfriend has been understandably upset with me and tells me I’ve made him feel “stupid” for overthinking and that it’s hard for him to trust me again. He says “if you lie for something small, what stops you from lying for something bigger?” I’ve apologized so many times and promised him I’ll change and put his feelings above all. I promised to not be friendly to other guys, even if it hurts their feelings. His happiness matters a lot to me, and I realize maybe my treatment if others has been wrong all along.",0.5

He has enough space in his own walk-in closet! I told him if he can’t fit all his clothes in there then he has too many clothes. He says it’s a convenience thing. But, for me it’s now clothes everywhere in two rooms. 


He says he pays mortgage so he’ll do what he wants with the rooms, and thinks I’m an asshole for being bothered by it. I’m a bit of a neat freak and just like things in their place and the guest closet isn’t where his clothes should be, they should be in HIS closet. 
He will say he’ll clean the room, but he’s not going to. So I can’t compromise there.

"AITA for placing a compost bag on a baking tray?  While cleaning the kitchen so I could start preparing dinner, I tied off the full compost bag and, not wanting to make a trip outside yet, I set the bag on top of a dirty baking tray. 

My husband came in while I was finishing up, spotted the compost bag, and asked ""Is that garbage?"" I said, it's compost, as if he couldn't tell from the type of bag we exclusively use for compost. He then said it was ""on a food preparation surface."" 

I pointed out that it was in a bag, on a dirty tray that I was planning to wash anyway, and said he could have offered to take it out instead of complaining about it. 

He said he wasn't complaining, but it's not the first time that he has made comments implying my safe food handling practices are inadequate, so I finally suggested he could make his own dinner instead of worrying I would food-poison him. 

He insisted I was being unfair.

"AITA for not helping my wife AITA for not wanting to the help my wife?

AITA for not wanting to help my wife clean our homeschool classroom for the 4th year in a row?

My wife stays at home with our kids and teaches. She was a professional teacher before she became a mother. She is an awesome wife and mother. She teaches, maintains the household, cleans etc…

I must admit at times I have somewhat taken her incredible care of us for granted. I’m a man and by nature not always receptive to her feelings. I get in that regard we just suck sometimes. 

Here’s my defense. I work 6 days a week. Hours varies between 60-80 hours. I have my regular 6 days a week job and I also do side work to keep money flowing. We have done pretty good at maintaining a comfortable lifestyle for our kids and us.
I work this much proudly to provide for my family. I believe my wife sacrifices a good amount for our children and they deserve the very best I can provide.

This is where it gets tricky. My wife has been dragging for the last few years an unnecessary amount of school supplies. They were in our old house after she left her job. Then stored in her brothers attic while we moved for my job. Then moved to our new homes garage and eventually up to the classroom. She has put off the purge of these supplies. This summer we moved our daughter upstairs to a room across from the bonus classroom area. The room she moved into was a guest room that had furniture and other storage stuff. We have since gotten rid of all of that stuff. In the time we were making the transition some stuff that was supplies had to be moved back into the classroom. Last weekend I spent a couple hours with her getting the classroom somewhat more manageable. The kids have not been in school for summertime. Most of the summer was filled with activities and projects and other life events. Projects like moving daughter’s room, moving my 5 year old into her old room. Painting, cleaning etc… She did everything but get her classroom back in order. 

School starts this week and I had an especially long work week and I’m tired!! I worked over 80 hours this week and my 1 day off is Sunday. Well I usually let her give me a honey to do list on Sundays to help things get caught up and set her up for her week to come. She’s got a lot on her plate with kids, making sure house isn’t destroyed, carting them around to activities, appointments, grocery shopping etc…. This weekend however I hit a wall. After 12 years of marriage and her dragging all this stuff around from house to house, closet to closet, attic to garage I had enough. I’ve bought her wine for her to settle and overcome this classroom. I just wasn’t going to deal with it anymore. So she now has threatened our marriage and that this was the final straw. 

I have made mistakes in our marriage and they have never been betrayal type level mistakes or anything like that. I regard myself as decent hardworking person. I’m not perfect but I’m always present and trying.

"AITA for bringing up that I make more money than my boyfriend? My(25F) boyfriend(25M) and I live together. Yesterday, we were planning on going to the pool in our building. I was putting on my swimsuit, when he comes into our bedroom, smirks, and makes a lame joke that I need to get a bigger size and swap out chips for salads.

I was already feeling bad because I had to really cram myself into these bottoms, I knew that they were tight, I knew what I saw in the mirror especially in the stomach and butt area and for him to say that just told me he lacked tact. I am overweight, I don't need tasteless jokes about it.

I told him that maybe he should focus less on lame jokes and focus more on trying to see if he can start making more money. He got all annoyed and asked what I was getting at. I told him I made more money than him.

He rolled his eyes and told me that I weighed more than him too and suggested we step on the scale.

I told him to get away from me. Pool day was off, he sulked in the living room, I stayed in our bedroom most of the day.
