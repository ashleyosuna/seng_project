"AITA for telling my brother to tell his 2.5year old to stop having a tantrum at dinner? I (29F) recently had dinner with my brother (30M), SIL (29F), mum and dad at my parents house.  I am staying at my parents house for 12 months as they will be doing lots of travel and I am here dog sitting half the time anyway, so this is my house too now.  My brother and SIL come over for dinner with their two young daughters (Lucy, 2.5 year old and Rebecca, 10 month old).  My brother’s parenting style is very much about “letting the girls have their big feelings” and “there’s nothing wrong with crying and being sad”.  However, their eldest daughter Lucy has entered her tantrum stage.  Lucy’s mum turned the TV off because it was dinner time and time to eat at the table.  Lucy instantly had a melt down and started screaming and crying “I want to watch tv”.  This continued at the dinner table and she was having a very big and loud meltdown for at least 5 minutes.  My brother and SIL just let her cry.  They didn’t tell her that she needed to stop having a tantrum and just asked my niece if she “wanted space” and let her continue to scream and cry at the table.  We all just wanted to have a peaceful meal but Lucy would not stop and kept getting worse, and her parents just keep saying it’s “big feelings and she isn’t doing anything wrong”.  AITAH for telling my brother that he should address or at least acknowledge his daughter and tell her she can’t behave this way? And that it’s rude for her to not acknowledge her or even try to discipline her as she is ruining our dinner?",0.15
"AITA for purposefully outing my stepsister’s nasty comments Not in the US  I (24f) currently room with my stepsister Wendy (25f). My dad married her mom. My dad inherited this apartment years ago and let us live there rent free when I got into the same university Wendy did. Wendy and I get along well though we work in different fields and have our own groups of friends.  I have an aunt on my mom’s side, Anna (31f). Anna’s mom, my mom’s former stepmother, used to date Wendy’s dad until he moved to another city. Anna has an extremely wealthy older husband (46m). She met him in high school when she babysat his niece. They dated when Anna graduated from college. They’re now married with a son (3m) and Anna a SAHM since his birth.  Anna lives a luxurious life and shares a lot on social media. I and Wendy are friends with her on several platforms but Wendy is jealous, there’s no other word. She often talks about Anna and her husband age gap. She said it was creepy and there was no way she would date someone so much older.  I always tried to get Wendy to stop but she would just bring the topic back again and again.   This Christmas our parents went abroad so I went to spend Christmas at my mom's side. My mom passed several years ago but it was nice to see the family. Wendy was set to spend Christmas with her friends but the host was busy last minute, so I invited Wendy to spend Christmas with me.  The day before Wendy and I headed back home, Anna and her family joined us. Anna’s husband broke his ankle so he pretty much sat in a chair and just chatted with anyone who came to talk with him. Anna spent a good deal of time making sure he had food and drinks (meal was buffet style) and checked on him like every 10 minutes.  Wendy of course noticed this and kept whispering to me about how this was just a taste of Anna’s future, having to wait hand and foot on her much older husband in his old age. Wendy said she wouldn’t wish Anna’s fate on her worst enemy. She said her husband has a devoted wife since he groomed her so well.  I have had enough. Wendy was acting like the biggest Grinch with all her joy sucking gossips. So I purposefully raised my voice “Wendy, what do you mean grooming?! Just because they’re 15 years apart doesn’t mean there’s grooming involved!”  Everyone around us went quiet. Anna and her husband stared at us, knowing full well it involved them, but they didn’t say anything.  Wendy was so embarrassed she excused herself and left the party. In the morning when we left, Wendy only said good bye to my grandma before heading out.  Wendy was angry and said I embarrassed her and drove her to her room without even getting dinner. She said I could have told her in private like I have always done and not shame her in public. She said it was normal for people to talk like this about every woman marrying a much older, richer man and Anna should know people say things like this behind her backs no matter what. I was just tired of her jealousy and hoped this would shut her up. AITA?",0.69
"AITA for bashing my girlfriend over a misunderstanding!? Hello, I'm 27M.  I've been in a relationship with my girlfriend (27F) for 5 years. It has been going good until recently. I'm a very open minded person and so is she, and lately we came to a concensual to explore our sexual lives and after a bit of convincing I made her agree to a threesome with another guy. I'd wanted to experience this for quite some time now. She decided to pick the guy and got a mutual acquaintance (her friend) for the threesome. Since she got the choice, I laid down the ground rules, one of them being ~ no kissing the guy! But during our session, she broke that rule twice or thrice for a continued duration. I ignored at the moment but took up the issue with her later. According to her, it happened it the heat of the moment and was ""only natural"" because it was only a kiss. However I got angry at her and bashed her for breaking one of the only few ground rules. Now we have a legit fight between us. And I'm sitting here wondering whether I am the one at fault or is it justified behaviour on my part!",0.4
"AITA for letting our kids freely play at home. To clarify, my wife and I live on the second floor of a three story apartment complex. We have lived here for almost a year with our two children whom are 1 and 4 years old. Our downstairs neighbors that we got along with recently moved out and an older couple moved in shortly after, we have had no contact with them since they moved in aside from a smile here and wave there.  Tonight the lady of the couple came to the door and unfortunately my pregnant wife was the one who opened the door. Right away the lady who was shaking with anger holding both hands up with balled fists told my wife “ I am sick and tired of your kids running around and making noise from morning to night.” My wife responded with “ I don’t know what you want me to do with a 4 year old.” . The old woman’s response was “I don’t care, it’s common courtesy, if you don’t stop I will call the cops.” My wife responded back with “Alright, I’ll try to stop my toddlers from playing” while going to close the door. The old woman chose to end with  “they make noise till one in the morning and it’s ridiculous” by which point the door was closed and locked.   My children are down for bed by 9 every night, a complete hour before the 10pm curfew of the complex, but on rare occasion my daughter has woken up and refused to sleep early in the morning but she has never been allowed to run around and make noise when that happens.   Where I think we could be the assholes is that we don’t restrict our children from playing how they would like aside from limiting them bashing the walls and floor with toys.",0.26
"AITA for thinking MY Christmas gift would be MINE? This is kind of a silly one, but I'm still curious.        My husband (27M) got me (24F) a Nintendo Switch for Christmas! I was so excited since I've wanted one for a few years now. He got me accessories, a protective case, controllers, the works! It was wonderful and now I can play Stardew Valley with my friends!        When we had a break during the day (on Christmas) I was looking through my Switch and saw that there were a few games on the Switch already- Mario Cart (which of course I wanted since it's a fun game to play at parties) but there was also Assasins Creed (which I have never played and am not super interested in but my husband IS). When I asked him about it he said, ""Oh yeah, I got a game for myself too!"". I asked him why he would buy a game just for him, and he said, ""Because it's OUR Switch. It was really expensive, so it's for both of us and we will share it equally"". I kind of bristled at this, and told him that while I was very happy to share- he could, of course, play games with me and by himself when I wasn't home or interested in playing- the Switch is MINE since it was MY Christmas gift. I had been asking for it for so long, so it definitely wasn't OUR Switch, it was MINE and he could use it when it was available. Plus he has an Xbox (although a very old one) that he can play Assasins Creed on whenever he wants.        He asked if I was serious and after I said yes, he got mad and called me selfish and rude.        We did makeup later and he agreed that I could have priority use when I wanted to play (although it seemed begrudgingly). Everything has been fine and we have been sharing and playing together and truly having a wonderful time. I have been playing Stardew Valley with him and he loves it! However, I still think about that conversation and wonder if I was the a-hole. So reddit, am I?        Why I may be the asshole: I told my husband the gift he intended for both of us was MINE and he could use it when I wasn't playing. I may be selfish because of this.",0.09
"AITA for dancing with my ex? I am currently on vacation down in Mexico and I went with my parents and my sibling, and everything at the party was fine running smoothly when my ex asked me to dance.  Now for some background. I have a bf and I told him before I left that my ex would most likely ask me to dance and I can’t reject it as where I’m from it’s seen as incredibly rude to reject an offer to dance no matter who it is. And as I said I had informed my bf about me dancing with other guys and possibly my ex and he has no issue with it.  Well surprise surprise the other day my ex asked me to dance so I did and of course I let him know that I have a bf so he doesn’t make any advances at me and my brother saw and got extremely pissed, when I say extremely I mean extremely.   No he didn’t know of what I said to my bf and how he didn’t have an issue with it as my brother had a really bad relationship experience with a girl who cheated on him with her ex so he thought I was doing the exact same thing when he didn’t know and yes I tried to explain but he is also extremely stubborn and has really bad anger issues so there was no reasoning with him.   So now I am giving him the silent treatment and he is as well because I believe he had no reason to act the way he did when he didn’t know the full story. But I do want to try and reason with him but with his stubbornness I don’t know if I can.",0.6

"AITA for wearing a white blouse to my cousin's wedding? [This is pretty much my outfit I wore for wedding but higher neckline](https://postimg.cc/HJJ5g9Mh)  25F I'm not comfortable with wearing a dress. So for my cousin's wedding, I chose to wear a suit to her wedding. My brother and I were essentially dressed same. Dark blue suits with a white shirt underneath.  My family were having fun and I thought all was fine. That is until the MOH came over while I was walking on my way to the washroom. I was confronted about wearing white and she poured wine on me.  Was I really the AH for wearing a white blouse with my navy suit? I didn't think the don't wear white rule was so literal. There was absolutely no way I could have been mistake for the bride. I also saw plenty of men dressed same as me. Some kind of dark suit with a white shirt. Yet none of the were confronted about it.",0.13
"AITA for deleting my Twitter account without telling any of my mutuals why? So, I started a Twitter account for posting art and thoughts of an anime I started watching, because I wanted to put myself out there a little more and also not bother my friends since none of them watch the anime. I have really bad (diagnosed) anxiety issues and my therapist was the one who recommended starting an account in the first place to try to build confidence.  I started getting relatively popular, and was getting lots of comments and people following and dming me, which was getting extremely overwhelming. I was getting incredibly distracted from my work trying to make sure I follow everyone back and answer all comments and dms, because I didn't want anyone to feel like I didn't like them, I have major RSD and the thought of making someone feel bad because they think I don't like them/want to talk to them stresses me out so much I end up throwing up. This was getting incredibly stressful and having so many mutuals of people I barely even know was flaring up my anxiety, so I just decided to delete the account. I didn't want anyone to try to find me or ask if I had somewhere they could message me because that would defeat the whole purpose of deleting. I just want to disappear from the online scene and go back to only lurking around and looking at other's posts without directly interacting/posting things myself.  But now I'm starting to feel like an asshole for deleting and not saying anything about it, AITA?     EDIT: I did put up a hiatus status before deleting, but still got messages and didn't want to give the false impression that I would be back someday.",0.25
"AITA for only staying with my partner for finicial reasons... So before anyone calls me a gold digger, or selfish, you need context. Me[18] and my partner[20] met online. They lived down south and I live in the north east of America. They were going to be homeless so I let them move up here and live with me and my family(parents and older brother[20]). My partner and I are both nonbinary, although we are both of the opposite biological sex. I have ptsd, anxeity, deppression, gerd/reflux, insomnia and a variety of phobias. My partner knows im sensitive to touch and sexual stuff. Yet they've taken advantage of me multiple times. I've confronted them about it and they say they're trying to be more careful and or blame their adhd for what they did. I developed hapephobia due to it. And I have the chance of getting pregnant due to the most recent incident. Due to what they've done, the gaslighting, guilt tripping, and manipulation they do I've gained a severe lack of trust for them. My feelings/love for them are fading quickly. And im only staying with them atm cause finically they could help me move out of this house. Away from my abusive and narssacist parents, who groomed me. And my creep of a brother. Along with the fact my partner would help finically if I do end up pregnant with the finances.   Also I'm aware of the fact my partner forced me into sexual stuff without my consent many times, yet I need them to be able to be finically stable and get out of my terrible environment. Ik it's dumb to stay with my partner cause they'll probably take advantage of me again, but at this point my life has been so shitty that I've grown used to it. Still bothers me a bit tho.",0.11
